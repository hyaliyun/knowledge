The program was hosted by Ben Maller with co-host Karen Kay. Clear Channel Communications laid off seven percent of its workforce and thus the show was cancelled as the entire staff was laid off. Hosts *Ben Maller: Host *Karen Kay: Update anchor *Greg Bergman: Producer, call screener *\\"The Amazing\\" Vladimir Former hosts * Jorge Sedano: Weekdays from 2004‚Äì2007 * Josh Gears \\"Lord of the Board\\": until 2008 * Chris Plank: Hosted from Tulsa, Oklahoma on weekends.  Segments =Coach, Player, or Entertainer Coach, Player, or Entertainer was a segment that intermittently over the course of the show. The game consists of Maller giving the name of a person; the caller then has to guess based on their knowledge coach, professional sports player, or actor/musician. The player received 10 points for guessing the correct category, and 5 bonus points for saying what team or television show/movie/band the person was in. The caller with the most points at the end of the timed segment won. This segment was later revived during Maller's current show that started on November 4, 2014. Benny vs. The Penny On Saturdays during the NFL season, Ben competed against a coin toss on picking the winners of each NFL game that would be played during the upcoming weekend. In 2006 Ben was outscored by the coin by almost 40 games. The segment was later moved online and was briefly available as a podcast before seeing revival during Maller's current show that started on November 4, 2014. The Challenge Line In the style of Jim Rome's \\"Smackoff,\\" this was a game played between each was given two opportunities to square-off against the other person on a hot topic issue. In the first round, each caller got 30 seconds, one after the other. The crew briefly discussed it, and then the second round begun. The second round was the same format but instead the callers were given only 15 seconds. At the end of the second round the crew voted the winner, and took text or email votes from other callers and in the end declared a winner on-air  Password  Password was a smaller version of the hugely popular television game show, Password. Branded as \\"the word game of the stars\\" it was held every Friday on the show. Live callers were teamed-up with the celebrity hosts and asked to guess the password based upon one-word clues administered by the hosts of the show. The game play was also alternated between the two teams and at the end of the show a winner was declared based on the scoring and points system. Sports Jeopardy On Tuesday mornings, two callers competed in a sports themed contest similar to the game show Jeopardy!. The questions were usually written by one of the hosts and occasionally by a member of the audience. Karen Kay, Julio and a random caller on hold all acted as a life line for the contestants and were frequently utilized during the game. At the end of the game \\"Final Jeopardy' occurred where players could wager their imaginary dollars on whether or not they knew the answer to the question that was given to them. After this the game concluded and a winner was usually declared based on the caller's imaginary dollars, although in a few occasions, special circumstances would happen that changed the winner of the game.

History  As early as 1993, Rabbi Kenneth Brander, then rabbi of the Boca Raton Synagogue, held discussions with the communal leadership of South Palm Beach County about the creation of the first yeshiva high school between North Miami Beach and Atlanta. In 1996, he organized The Committee to Form a Yeshiva High School, and in 1997 it hired Rabbi Perry Tirschwell as its Head of School to create the school. Mrs. Ora Lee Kanner, who joined Rabbi Tirschwell before it opened, rose from Director of Judaic Studies to Assistant Principal to Principal (in 2008). Mrs. Pam Turk, who was involved in the school from the beginning, was the school's founding president. The school opened its doors to forty-one 9th and 10th graders in September 1998, and has grown quickly in its short history. The school graduated its first class in June 2001. The school was named in loving memory of Jack and Bessie Weinbaum in 2003. The school is located in Jacobs and Rubin Youth and Senior Center of the Boca Raton Synagogue in suburban, central Boca Raton. The center is named for Dr. Merv and Elaine Jacobs and Mr. Lenny and Sima Rubin who both were part of the founders of the Boca Raton Synagogue and instrumental in the early years of its existence. In the summer of 2004, the school more than doubled its space, and Dr. Sam Lasko assumed the presidency of the school. In 2010, Mr. Jeff Harris assumed the presidency. In June 2012, Rabbi Tirschwell stepped down after 15 years at the helm of the school. Executive Director Shimmie Kaminetsky and Principal Mrs. Ora Lee Kanner are running the school during the 2012‚Äì2013 transition year, as the school is in the midst of a search process for a new Head of School, who will begin in Summer 2013. On February 20, 2013, the Board of Trustees announced that it had selected S.A.R. Associate Principal Rabbi Jonathan Kroll as Head of School. The announcement came after a rigorous vetting process undertaken by the newly formed search committee. In 2015, the school was renamed Yeshiva High School, and construction began on its new campus at the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County. It was later renamed Katz Yeshiva High School. The school officially opened at its new campus and building in August 2017.

It stars Cornel Wilde, Michael Wilding, George Sanders, and Anne Francis. The film is based upon the events in the American Revolution in which Benedict Arnold offered to surrender the fort at West Point to the British in exchange for money. The film purports to tell the story of the creation of the \\"American Secret Service\\". It weaves a spy/counterspy tale in which British and American counterparts, played by Michael Wilding as the historical personage Major John Andr√© and Cornel Wilde as the fictional Major John Bolton, each unaware that the other is attempting to outsmart him for the sake of their countries, deal with issues of honor, loyalty, and friendship. There is also some rivalry between the men for the love of a beautiful woman, the fictional Sally Cameron (Anne Francis). While historically Andr√© and Major Benjamin Tallmadge, Bolton's historical counterpart, did meet shortly before Andr√© was to be hanged as a spy (Talmadge's regiment of light dragoons was charged with guarding Andr√©), their acquaintance was not the longer-term and deeper friendship suggested in the film. Bolton betrays this friendship out of duty in the film, but Karl Tunberg's script ameliorates that difficulty by having Bolton make attempts to save Andre's life. Another important departure from history is that during the course of events Andr√© saves Bolton when the latter is arrested for being a spy, something that never occurred. Andr√© is treated sympathetically in the film while Wilde's fictional Major Bolton is portrayed as more ruthless, particularly in the brutality he employs to accomplish his objectives. The script is noted for its even-handedness in depicting both sides of the conflict. Plot In 1780 General Benedict Arnold commands the Continental Army defenses at West Point, New York. Major John Bolton (Cornel Wilde), a dragoon officer assigned to counterintelligence, intercepts and kills a British spy leaving the Storm King Tavern, and captures a letter found on his body. He reports to Gen. Robert Howe (John McIntire), that the coded message was from the British spy calling himself \\"Gustavus\\" to \\"James Osborn\\", in care of Dr. Jonathan Odell of New York, stating that Arnold has taken command at West Point. The secret knowledge indicates that the spy is a \\"highly placed person\\". Bolton returns to the tavern, where one of his contacts, stable boy Ben Potter (Bobby Driscoll), tells him that the Tory wife of a redcoat, Mrs. Sally Cameron (Anne Francis), is traveling under a flag of truce possibly carrying information to the enemy. She catches them searching her room, where Bolton takes her safe conduct pass after verbally sparring with her. Mrs. Cameron tries to seduce Bolton to obtain its return, but he rebuffs her. A messenger arrives with a package for \\"Mr. Moody\\", but when no one by that name can be found, another traveler, Col. Winfield, offers to deliver the package. Bolton recognizes that Winfield is an imposter, and in a struggle over the package, kills him. Other American officers arrest Bolton for murder and deliver him to Howe. A pass through the lines found hidden in Winfield's boot reveals that the impostor was actually Moody, a spy, who had another coded letter from \\"Gustavus\\" to \\"Osborn\\" in his possession. The package, a ream of blank paper, concealed a message from \\"Osborn\\" written in invisible ink requesting an urgent meeting to finalize an unknown arrangement. Howe proposes that Bolton feign desertion to the British. Bolton agrees, aware that he could be hanged if the British discover his mission. With Moody's pass, Bolton passes through the British lines, but the British lieutenant on duty recognizes that he is not the same man who previously used the pass and follows him. In New York, Bolton calls upon Dr. Odell (George Sanders), trying to deliver the letter. The lieutenant bursts in to arrest Bolton, but when he addresses him as \\"Mr. Moody\\", Odell takes Bolton and the letter to British Army Major John Andr√© (Michael Wilding) for deciphering, using a pair of spectacles to isolate key words. Bolton claims that he was Moody's source of information. He offers to continue working for the British. Odell bluntly tells Bolton that he thinks his story is too neat and believes him to be a Rebel spy. But Andr√© takes an immediate liking to Bolton. He invites him to a dinner party that evening, where Bolton suffers an anxious moment when Sally Cameron (unmarried and Andr√©'s mistress) is present. Bolton's explanation corroborates information about the murder that Andr√© had checked, and Sally provides the perfect eyewitness. Bolton is sent with two Tory agents to sabotage the chain barrier across the Hudson River before a British attack on the American position at Verplanck, so that British warships can pass. Andr√© gives one a letter to deliver afterwards at the Storm King Tavern. Bolton drowns one agent, but when he tries to arrest the other, is confronted by an armed Ben Potter, who still thinks that Bolton is a murderer and deserter. The agent disarms Ben and nearly kills Bolton. Ben finds his gun and shoots the agent. At a secret meeting with Howe, Bolton uses spectacles to decipher the letter, which points to Gustavus as someone at West Point with authority. Bolton volunteers to return to New York to identify the mysterious \\"James Osborn\\". Odell more than ever believes Bolton is a spy, but Bolton convinces Andr√© that the British agents completed their mission. To trap him, Odell writes a false dispatch from \\"Mr. Osborn\\" for Bolton to steal. At another dinner, Bolton notices that Sally Cameron only pretends to toast the King. She has also fallen in love with him and warns Bolton about Odell's trap. The British attack on Verplanck is crushed and results in Bolton's arrest as a Rebel spy. He is saved from hanging by Andr√©, who intervenes for him after Sally confesses her feelings for Bolton and begs him to vouch on Bolton's behalf. He does so, despite her refusal of his marriage proposal. Putting duty before personal considerations, Andr√© asks Bolton to accompany him to a meeting between \\"Gustavus\\" and \\"Osborn\\" aboard the sloop Vulture. Andr√© assures Bolton that \\"Gustavus\\" and \\"Osborn\\" have conjured a quick end to the war. The wily \\"Gustavus\\" changes the meeting at the last moment to the house of a Tory sympathizer and orders Andr√© to come alone. Bolton persuades Andr√© to go in uniform, and not in civilian clothing, lest he be captured as a spy. Soon after, Odell detects Bolton warning American shore batteries of the British presence, but Bolton escapes by swimming ashore to the American garrison. The American commander, Col. Jameson (James Westerfield), is skeptical of Bolton's loyalties and stubbornly holds him until Howe can vouch for him. \\"Gustavus\\" escapes. \\"Osborn\\" is captured and Bolton realizes that Benedict Arnold is \\"Gustavus\\". To his horror, Bolton learns that \\"Osborn\\" is Andr√©, and worse, that he changed into civilian clothes trying to escape. At Andr√©'s court-martial, Bolton testifies that Andr√© entered the lines in uniform and changed into civilian clothing only at Arnold's treacherous orders. The court reluctantly sentences Andr√© to be executed as a spy. Andr√© pledges his continuing friendship with Bolton and asks him to protect Sally from any retribution. Bolton brokers a last-minute deal to exchange Andr√© for Arnold, but Andr√© considers the suggestion a taint on his honor and declines.

Andre's Butler (uncredited) Production As reported in April 1952 in Daily Variety, the genesis of the film was the original story \\"Betrayal on the Hudson\\" by Hollister Noble and Sidney Harmon, purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as the basis for the screenplay of The Scarlet Coat. In January 1953 The Hollywood Reporter listed Stewart Granger in the role of John Bolton and Robert Pirosh as the film's director. Later that year Robert Taylor was named Granger's replacement, to co-star with Michael Wilding. In June 1954 production was delayed because of a shortage of sound stage space and stagehands. Exteriors filmed on location in Tarrytown, New York and on the Hudson River were shot in the autumn of 1954 to capture fall foliage for depicting the historical September 1780 time frame. The film is available for streaming and on Region 1 NTSC DVD at Amazon. For several years it has been shown on Turner Classic Movies on Independence Day. Reception According to MGM records, the film earned $449,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $719,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $1,158,000.

Relations between the Czech Republic and the United States were officially established in 1993 following the collapse of the USSR and the subsequent breakup of Communist-aligned Czechoslovakia. Since transitioning into a democracy in 1989, joining NATO in 1999, and the European Union in 2004, the Czech Republic has gradually become a close economic partner and formal military ally of the United States, drastically improving bilateral ties in the years since through increasingly extensive cooperation in areas ranging from counterterrorism to cultural exchanges. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 39% of Czechs approve of the job performance of the U.S. leadership, with 26% disapproving and 35% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup History=Post‚ÄìWorld War I U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and the United States played a major role in the establishment of Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1918. President Wilson's 14 Points, including the right of ethnic groups to form their own states, were the basis for the union of the Czechs and Slovaks. Tomas Masaryk, the father of the state and its first President, visited the United States during World War I and worked with U.S. officials in developing the basis of the new country. Masaryk used the U.S. Constitution as a model for the first Czechoslovak constitution. Post‚ÄìWorld War II and communist Czechoslovakia After World War II, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile returned. Normal relations continued until 1948, when the communists seized power and relations froze rapidly. The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 further complicated U.S.-Czechoslovak relations. The United States referred the matter to the United Nations Security Council as a violation of the United Nations Charter, but no action was taken against the Soviets. Velvet Revolution Since the Velvet Revolution of 1989, bilateral relations have improved immensely. Dissidents once sustained by U.S. encouragement and human rights policies reached high levels in the government. President V√°clav Havel, in his first official visit as head of Czechoslovakia, addressed the U.S. Congress and was interrupted 21 times by standing ovations. In 1990, on the first anniversary of the revolution, President George H. W. Bush, in front of an enthusiastic crowd on Prague's Wenceslas Square, pledged U.S. support in building a democratic Czechoslovakia. Toward this end, the U.S. Government has actively encouraged political and economic transformation. The U.S. Government was originally opposed to the idea of Czechoslovakia forming two separate states, due to concerns that a split might aggravate existing regional political tensions. However, the U.S. recognized both the Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993. Since then, U.S.‚ÄìCzech relations have remained strong economically, politically, and culturally. Mirek Topol√°nek, Barack Obama and V√°clav Klaus at a meeting Current issues=Iraq War and Global War on Terror In 2003, the Czech Government sent a small contingent of elite anti-chemical weapons warfare experts to Kuwait to support the then-impending U.S. led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Despite governmental support for the war, an overwhelming majority of Czechs opposed the U.S. led invasion of Iraq throughout the lead up to the war and immediately following the invasion. A public opinion poll conducted in March 2003 found that over 70 percent of the population opposed the war even with a UN mandate while 83 percent of Czechs were against the war in Iraq without a mandate. Furthermore, the same poll found that 82 percent of Czechs believe that the U.S. bases its foreign policy \\"according to its own power and economic interests.\\" Czech opposition to the war did not amount to the level of massive visible street demonstrations such as those seen in other cities around the world. On February 15, 2003, 1,500 people attended a rally against the war in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Missile defense system A missile defense system was planned to be installed at Brdy part of the Czech Republic. It would have been an X band radar system that would work with a missile site in Redzikowo, Poland. In August 2008, the Czech Security Information Service (BIS) published the report for the year 2007, in which it says that Russian secret agents (spies) have been from the beginning highly influencing the public opinion against the building of U.S. radar in Czech republic.http://zpravy.idnes.cz/rusti-agenti-chteji-v-cesku-vyvolat-odpor-k- radaru-varovala-bis-psn-/domaci.asp?c=A080925_093519_domaci_ipl In September 2008 Czech Military Counter-intelligence confirmed the report of BIS.http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vojenska-rozvedka-potvrdi-zpravu-bis-o-aktivitach- ruskych-sluzeb-10e-/domaci.asp?c=A080928_133002_domaci_ban \\"BIS claims, that the Russian espionage is currently at high intensity and level.\\" Russians secret agents mainly influence the people, that can have a great influence on public opinion. After Barack Obama was elected the President of the United States, there were speculations that he might stop the project. The final decision to scratch the plans was announced on 17 September 2009 by a phone call from Obama to Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer. In June 2011, Alexandr Vondra, a Czech defense minister, told the U.S. that his country was withdrawing from the European missile defense system, stating: \\"We will seek other opportunities for the Czech Republic to participate in the Alliance system in the future; but this does not change anything about our support for NATO missile defense.\\"Czech Republic Withdraws From U.S. Missile Shield Plan After Diminished Role Frustrations Huffington Post In January 2014, the Czech government approved of the sale of 28 sub-sonic L-159 military planes in a deal worth up to $25.8 million to the United States.Czech government approves deal to deliver Czech-made military airplanes to US company StarTribune Czech Role as Protecting Power in Syria As of February 2012, due to the escalating Syrian civil war, the U.S. Embassy in Syria closed down.

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Woods served in the military prior to becoming an actor. He appeared in nearly 250 films between 1923 and 1958. During his 35-year film career he acquired a reputation as a screen villain par excellence; his imposing size, powerful build, piercing eyes and snarling voice typed him as a bad guy to be reckoned with. He seldom played ordinary henchmen, usually cast as both the brains (the banker or saloon owner who secretly runs the bandit gang terrorizing the area) and the brawn behind the local villainy. He was well respected by his peers, another prime screen villain, Roy Barcroft, once said of him, \\"Everything I know about being a bad guy I learned from Harry Woods.\\" He enjoyed a long career in films before retiring in 1958, and he died in Los Angeles ten years later from uremia.

First a fear-hierarchy is created: the patient is asked a series of questions to determine the level of discomfort the fear causes in various conditions. Can the patient talk about the object of their fear, can the patient tolerate a picture of it or watch a movie which has the object of their fear, can they be in the same room with the object of their fear, and/or can they be in physical contact with it? Once these questions have been ordered beginning with least discomfort to most discomfort, the patient is taught a relaxation exercise. Such an exercise might be tensing all the muscles in the patient's body then relaxing them and saying \\"relax\\", and then repeating this process until the patient is calm. Next, the patient is exposed to the object of their fear in a condition with which they are most comfortable - such as merely talking about the object of their fear. Then, while in such an environment, the patient performs the relaxation exercise until she or he is comfortable at that level. After that, the patient moves up the hierarchy to the next condition, such as a picture or movie of the object of fear, and then to the next level in the hierarchy and so on until the patient is able to cope with the fear directly. Although it may take several sessions to achieve a resolution, the technique is regarded as successful. Many research studies are being conducted in regard to achieving immersion therapy goals in a virtual computer based program, although results are not conclusive.

A native of Philadelphia, Harley played baseball and American football at Georgetown University. He then played professional baseball from 1895 to 1909, including seven years in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Browns (1897‚Äì1898), Cleveland Spiders (1899), Cincinnati Reds (1900‚Äì1901), Detroit Tigers (1902), and Chicago Cubs (1903). During his major league career, he appeared in 741 games and compiled a .262 batting average with 96 extra-base hits, 236 RBIs, and 78 times hit by pitch. As an outfielder, he had a strong arm, led the National League in assists in 1898, and totaled at least 20 assists in four of his seven major league seasons. He also led all National League outfielders in errors with 27 in 1899 and 30 in 1901. Harley later served as the player-manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Eastern League (1904‚Äì1905) and as a college baseball coach for Georgetown (1913), Penn State (1915‚Äì1917), and Pittsburgh (1920‚Äì1924). Early years Harley was born in 1872 in Philadelphia. He grew up on his family‚Äôs land named Boxwood Farm located in Whitpain Township located in the Blue Bell/Gwynedd Valley area northwest of the city. Dick Harley home farm. He attended Georgetown University, where he played both American football and baseball. He played at the fullback position on the football team in 1893. Although contemporary newspaper sources have not been found referring to him as a coach, modern Georgetown football media guides list Harley as the head coach of the 1893 Georgetown football team. He played at the shortstop and left field on the baseball team in the spring of 1894. Professional baseball=Minor leagues (1895-96) Harley began playing professional baseball in 1895 for the Millville team in the South New Jersey League. He advanced to the Springfield Ponies of the Eastern League in 1896. St. Louis and Cleveland (1897-99) On May 29, 1897, he was traded by the Philadelphia Phillies with Bill Hallman to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for Tommy Dowd. (Mike Grady was part of the original deal announced on May 29, but ended up remaining with Philadelphia) At the time, The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that, while Harley was drawing \\"a big salary for a young player\\", he was \\"worth every cent he draws. That boy is a comer, if there ever was one.\\" Harley made his major league debut on June 2, 1897, with the Browns. On June 24, 1897, he collected six hits in a 12-inning game played at Pittsburgh.Six Hits in an Extra Inning Game. Baseball Almanac. Retrieved on June 17, 2019. During the 1897 season, he hit .288 in 90 games for the Browns. The following year, he appeared in 142 games for the Browns, but his batting average dropped by more than 40 points to .246. He was hit by a pitch for a career high 22 times in 1898. He also led all National League outfielders in 1898 with 26 assists and ranked second with 27 errors. Prior to the start of the 1899 season, the St. Louis Browns baseball club was acquired by the owners of the Cleveland Spiders. On March 29, 1899, Harley was assigned by the St. Louis club to the Spiders. He appeared in 142 games for the 1899 Spiders and compiled a .250 batting average with a career-high 50 RBIs. He was the starting left fielder for the 1899 Cleveland Spiders, who some consider to be the worst team in baseball history. The Spiders went 20-134, scoring 529 runs and allowing 1,252 runs. Harley led all National League outfielders in 1899 with 27 errors. Detroit and Cincinnati (1900-02) On April 3, 1900, the Detroit Tigers purchased four former Spiders: Harley, Sport McAllister, Harry Lochhead, and Suter Sullivan. (The Tigers were part of the American League in 1900, but the league was not recognized as a major league until 1901.) Harley appeared in 123 games for the 1900 Tigers and led the team with a .325 batting average, 77 runs scored, and 47 stolen bases. In September 1900, after the Tigers had completed their season, Harley joined the Cincinnati Reds. He appeared in five games and hit .428. However, he remained the property of the Tigers. In October 1900, Detroit club owner James D. Burns announced that he had rejected an offer of $2,000 to sell Harley, but he would sell for $3,000. One week after Burns' statement, the Reds purchased Harley from Detroit, reportedly for the $3,000 demanded by Burns. Harley appeared in 133 games in the outfield for the 1901 Reds. He hit .273 during the 1901 season and led all National League outfielders with 30 errors. He also had 37 stolen bases in 1901, ranking fourth in the National League.

He also led the American League in 1902 having been hit by a pitch 12 times. Chicago Cubs (1903) In early October 1902, Harley signed with the Chicago Cubs for the 1903 season, jumping back to the National League. Chicago manager Frank Selee moved Harley from left field to right field and said: > \\"Harley always appealed to me as a player of more than ordinary intelligence > . . . Harley is a natural hitter, is fast on the bases, can throw well, and > uses good judgment in everything he does. I feel certain that he will make a > success of right field, and that the team will be stronger for having him > there.\\" In 104 games for the 1903 Cubs, Harley hit .231. The 1903 season was Harley's last in the major leagues.

Most professional teams are named for, and marketed to, particular metropolitan areas;Daniel J. Bruton, Sports Marketing, p. 112 amateur teams may be drawn from a particular region, or from institutions such as schools or universities. When they play in that venue, they are said to be the \\"home team\\"; when the team plays elsewhere, they are the away, visiting, or road team. Home teams wear home colors. Venue Each team has a location where it practices during the season and where it hosts games. This is referred to as the home court, home field, home stadium, home arena, or home ice. When a team is serving as host of a contest, it is designated as the \\"home team\\". The event is described as a \\"home game\\" for that team and the venue that the game is being played is described as the \\"home field.\\" In most sports, there is a home field advantage whereby the home team wins more frequently because it has a greater familiarity with the nuances of the venue and because it has more fans cheering for it, which supposedly gives the players adrenaline and an advantage. The opposing team is said to be the visiting team, the away team, or the road team. In baseball, sometimes, when teams are playing a makeup game from an earlier game postponed by rain, the game may have to be made up in the other team's stadium. An example of this occurred on September 26, 2007, with a game between the Cleveland Indians, who were the \\"home\\" team, but the game was played vs. the Seattle Mariners in Safeco Field, with their fans, etc. Other instances of the home team playing in the visitor's stadium include the New Orleans Saints hosting the New York Giants at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005; and the Toronto Blue Jays playing a 2010 home series with the Philadelphia Phillies in the Phillies' Citizens Bank Park while the G-20 Summit was being held near the Rogers Centre in Toronto. Because it was an interleague series, the designated hitter rule was instituted in a National League ballpark for the first time in the regular season. A spectator can often tell which team is home by looking at the field of play. Often a home team logo, insignia or name is in the middle of the field at center ice, midfield, or center court. Also, the logo, insignia or name may be found atop a dugout in baseball or in the end zone in American football. Uniforms or kits Rules and conventions often apply to the choice of home and away colors. In Australian football, the home team traditionally wears black shorts. In American football and ice hockey, most home teams often wear uniforms that feature their official team colors, whereas the visiting team to be wearing white or colors opposite of the home team's choice. On the other hand, in baseball and basketball, the home team will typically choose to wear the lighter colored version of its uniform. Many teams have a home uniform which is mostly white and referred to as the \\"home whites\\". The road team will generally wear a version of its uniform with one of the darker of its official colors as the main color, or in baseball with a grey main color referred to as the \\"road greys\\". The term \\"home whites\\" originated in the early days of Major League Baseball. Typically the visiting team had no access to laundry facilities and thus the players were unable to clean their uniforms on the road. By wearing grey or another dark color the visiting team was better able to conceal the dirt and grass stains that had accumulated on their uniforms over the course of the series. The home team, having access to laundry facilities, was able to wear clean white uniforms each day, hence the term \\"home whites\\". Miscellaneous In any context where a game score or the pair of teams meeting in a game are mentioned, the team mentioned first (left or top) is the home team, except in the United States and Canada, and to a lesser extent, Japan, where home teams are mentioned second. The North American and Japanese practice of listing the home team second likely derives from baseball, in which the home team bats after the visiting team in each inning.See: . Exceptions are found in most North American soccer competitions, where the international standard of listing the home team first is mostly adhered to. Typically, the home team has responsibilities such as supplying the venue and equipment, hosting its opponent, media and the officials (referees, umpires, etc.), and may have the opportunity to sell tickets, food and media rights.

History The band initially started by accident an initial one-off gig, when Tr√© was asked to lead worship at a youth Cell-Church conference in 1997, which resulted in their first tour, of California after they were invited by the conference speakers. Following this, the band released 2 independent records, which sold in excess of 16,000 copies. Onehundredhours were then signed up by the Christian record label Survivor. Since then, another 2 albums have been released, assisting in the growth of the band's popularity, in the UK and also within Europe, where many tours have taken place. They are also regular guests to Spring Harvest and Soul Survivor festivals, as well as New Wine. In 2005, Onehundredhours supported Daniel Bedingfield on his UK & European tour. Daniel, a long-time friend of Onehundredhours, gave a personal invitation for the band to guest on the tour. In 2006, the band toured throughout the UK, touring with Tree63 on their UK dates in December. Furthermore, on 11 May 2008 Onehundredhours played at the Astoria Theatre as part of the 'Live at the Court' celebration, which made up a number of events in the London-wide Pentecost festival. They shared the stage on this occasion with The Gentlemen, Electric Church and headliners Salvador. In 2009, the band played their last gig at Soul Survivor Week C. Name The Band's name comes from the average amount of free time a Christian has each week, inspired by the book ‚ÄòThe Other Hundred Hours‚Äô by Wyn Fountain. The process on which it works is as follows: There are 7 x 24 = 168 hours in a week If you spend 8 hours sleeping per day, this makes 7 x 8 = 56 hours per week So extracting the time spent sleeping, that leaves 112 hours a week. 12 hours is about the maximum time one can spend in church, at bible studies, or youth groups etc. That leaves 100 hours, and the band wanted to say that this doesn‚Äôt need to be 100 hours without God, but instead that worship should be a lifestyle, which spans all our time.

It is part of Sumner County Schools. In 2018, over 1,600 students attended the school. Arthur Crook is the current Principal. History Station Camp High School was created to ease overpopulation in three Sumner County public schools: Gallatin High School, Hendersonville High School, and Beech High School. However, in their endeavor, Station Camp became overpopulated. In 2017, over 1,800 attended the school, and rezoning sent students back to Beech High School and Gallatin High School. It is a four-year high school but, during the first years of operation, juniors and seniors could stay at their schools of origin. Freshmen and sophomores could attend the school an older brother or sister was currently attending. The same situation occurred before the 2016‚Äì17 school year. David Hallman, the first principal, hired staff at a temporary building on the school property while overseeing construction of the plant and facilities. Guidance and administration registered students at the same building. Eventually, the office was moved to the Board of Education building where rooms were prepared for the opening of the 2002‚Äì03 school year. The facility located on Lower Station Camp Creek Road was not completed, so students and staff had to meet at 695 East Main Street in Gallatin. The temporary facility was the former Gallatin Junior High that was being renovated to house the administrative offices of the Sumner County Board of Education. For two months, classes met in former classrooms, portables, and temporary classrooms in the Teacher Center. During those two months, the population exceeded predictions causing some classes to be moved and additional teachers to be hired. 2006 Tornado SCHS was in the middle of the hardest hit areas during the April 7 tornadoes. The inside of the building itself was relatively unscathed. Outside, only two light poles were blown down on the left side of the building, but damage was sustained to the roof of the gymnasium. Several of the athletic fields were damaged. The baseball and softball fields were destroyed, along with the field house. Additionally, several of the football field lights were toppled, and the school had to provide extra lighting for the 2006 football season. An entire row of trees along Lower Station Camp Creek Road was torn apart, changing the view south of the school. 2010 Flood During the Nashville flood in May 2010, the school's grounds were damaged when Station Camp Creek overflowed its banks. The majority of damage was done to the football practice field and the baseball fields. Athletics Station Camp competes in the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association.

He was sustained one of the First Council of the Seventy on October 5, 1897. McMurrin was ordained a member of the Council of the 70 in 1898 in England. Though born in Tooele, McMurrin was largely raised in Salt Lake City. He learned the trade of stone cutting and worked for a time as a stone cutter on the Salt Lake Temple when a teen. In 1876 he was sent on a colonizing mission to St. Joseph, Arizona where he remained for two years. He then returned to Salt Lake City. He then hauled freight from Salt Lake City to various mining camps. In 1881 he took up a contract with some associates to build a portion of the Oregon Short Line Railroad through Wyoming. While doing this he was called to serve an LDS mission in Great Britain. He served for 25 months in Scotland which was where his parents had originated from. Among many others he baptized two of his aunts. After returning to Utah McMurrin was called as a home missionary, somewhat like modern ward missionaries. He also acted as a bodyguard to LDS Church leaders during the anti-polygamy crusade. In 1885 he was shot by a US Marshall through his vitals, but survived after being given a priesthood blessing by John Henry Smith. In 1886 McMurrin went on another mission to England this time accompanied by his wife and 2 children. He was head of the London Conference for most of this mission. In 1896 McMurrin was sent on a 3rd mission. This time he served as 1st counselor in the European Mission Presidency to Rulon S. Wells. Although based in Britain he traveled extensively to oversee missionary work in continental Europe as well. He was also one of the key people involved in pushing to have single women called as missionaries.LDS Church historical department article on the beginnings of sister missionaries He died in Los Angeles, California on October 24, 1932.

He is best known for creating the fictional character: Achak, King of the Jungle. He was somewhat notorious for reworking other peoples' stories (at his editors' request) in order to meet his deadlines. Krueber was born in Missouri, but his parents soon moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. He grew up in Colorado and later worked as a ranch hand at one of the many ranches of the surrounding area. During the 1910s, Krueber started to sell stories to the pulp magazines that were becoming popular in the era. Krueber attempted to enlist in the armed forces when the United States joined World War I in 1917, but was denied entry because of an undefined heart condition. He wrote in many genres, first in the pulps and later in the upscale \\"slick\\" magazines, but never achieved a high degree of success or fame. During this time he also found work as an illustrator of pulp covers. Krueber never became financially secure as a result of his work in the pulps and held many different jobs (including briefly starting a small newspaper) while pursuing his writing career. Many of his science fiction stories were shorter than 1,000 words, or even 500 words. These stories were popular among magazine editors because their short length made the stories useful for filling out a magazine's page layout. He died on November 10, 1987 and is buried in Colorado Springs, Colorado. References *The Bloody Pulps, by Charles Beaumont, Playboy Magazine, September 1962.

Established along similar institutions by the Cuban Government in 1964, it was intended to serve at the same time to provide intelligence information for Cuban leaders, and to provide propaganda by proposing to international audiences Cuban views on certain topics. The centre became renowned in the 1990s, when some of its most prominent members, including economist Julio Carranza and Pedro Monreal, and sociologists Haroldo Dilla and Aurelio Alonso, started to promote views that were not in concert with those of the government. This led in 1996 to a purge of the institution, resulting in all its core academics being transferred to other functions.

A road game or away game is a sports game where the specified team is not the host and must travel to another venue. Most professional teams represent cities or towns and amateur sports teams often represent academic institutions. Each team has a location where it practices during the season and where it hosts games. When a team is not the host, it must travel to games (usually by bus or car, hence \\"road\\", though increasingly also by plane for longer journeys). Thus, when a team is not hosting a game, the team is described as the road team, the visiting team, or the away team, and the game is described as a road game or an away game for that team. The venue in which the game is played is described as the visiting stadium or the road. The host team is said to be the home team. The home team is often thought to have a home advantage over the visiting team, because of their familiarity with the environment, their shorter travel times, and the influence that a parochial crowd may have over an official's decisions. Another home team advantage that is unique to baseball is familiarity with the home ballpark's outfield dimensions and height of the outfield wall, as well as the size of foul territory and location of in-play obstacles (e.g., a bullpen on the playing field). Major sporting events, if not held at a neutral venue, are often over several legs at each team's home ground, so that neither team has an advantage over the other. Occasionally, the road team may not have to travel very far at all to a road game. These matches often become local derbies. (Also, see the article on Subway Series for baseball series played between the New York Yankees, and New York's National League teams, and similar series between other teams that play in the same city or state.) A few times a year, a road team may even be lucky enough to have the road game played at their own home stadium or arena. This is prevalent in college athletics where many schools will often play in regional leagues or groundshare. The related term true road game has seen increasing use in U.S. college sports in the 21st century, especially in basketball. While regular-season tournaments and other special events have been part of college sports from their creation, the 21st century has seen a proliferation of such events. These are typically held at neutral sites, with some of them taking place outside the contiguous U.S. (as in the case of the Great Alaska Shootout and Maui Invitational) or even outside the country entirely (such as the Battle 4 Atlantis in The Bahamas). In turn, this has led to the use of \\"true road game\\" to refer to contests played at one team's home venue. Association football Away fans at Walsall F.C.'s Bescot Stadium. In some association football leagues, particularly in Europe, the away team's fans sit in their own section. Depending on the team's stadium, they will either sit in a designated section or be separated from the home fans by a cordon of police officers and stadium officials. The reason of this arrangement is to prevent conflicts between fans in rival teams, which is a real concern in European association football leagues due to football hooliganism. However, in the semi-professional leagues in England, supporters may be free to mix. When games are played at a neutral site, for instance the FA Cup final in England which is always played at Wembley Stadium, both teams' fans will be allotted an even number of tickets. This results in each team occupying one half of the stadium. This is different from other sports, particularly in North America, where relatively few fans travel to games played away from their home stadium. Home and away fans are also not separated at these games.

He also served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy. He was promoted to brigadier general during the American Civil War. Early life Ren√© Edward De Russy was born into a family of ethnic French planters in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) on February 22, 1789. Two years later, soon after the birth of his younger brother Lewis, the De Russy family fled the violence of the slave revolution and settled in Old Point Comfort, Virginia. At the age of 18, De Russy enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York on March 20, 1807; he graduated on June 10, 1812, at the bottom of his class. Career After West Point, De Russy worked as the assistant engineer for New York State's defenses and helped to build Fort Montgomery, Rouses Point on the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In the late 1810s, he became the Superintending Engineer of the defenses of New York Harbor. He was next assigned to the South, where he oversaw construction of forts along the Gulf of Mexico, serving from 1821 to 1825. In 1825, De Russy returned to New York City, where he continued to build the Harbor's defenses, specifically Fort Hamilton. The Brooklyn Eagle reported that De Russy was the \\"engineer under whose direction Fort Hamilton was built, the corner stone of which was laid on June 11, 1825, and which was first garrisoned by troops on November 1, 1831.\\" During his assignment in New York City, De Russy supervised the construction of the New Utrecht Reformed Church. He built his own residence on a hill in Brooklyn, which the Brooklyn Eagle referred to as \\"The Lookout\\" because of its position above New York harbor, on a ridge that became known as Dyker Heights at the end of the 19th century. On July 1, 1833, De Russy was assigned as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy, which he led for five years. He was next assigned to supervising fort construction in Virginia and Delaware. Because of this experience, De Russy served as a member of the Atlantic Coast Defense Board from 1849 until 1854, when he was sent to San Francisco. He continued to build military forts and was named to the Pacific Coast Defense Board. In 1857, he was reassigned to the Atlantic Coast, returning to San Francisco in 1861. He died in San Francisco in 1865. De Russy was credited with inventing the barbette depressing gun carriage. In recognition of his service, on July 17, 1866, De Russy was posthumously nominated by President Andrew Johnson for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general in the Regular US Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate approved the appointment on July 26, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 733. Personal life De Russy was married to Harriet Elizabeth Taylor (1805‚Äì1834). Together, they were the parents of the following: * Gustavus Adolphus De Russy (1818‚Äì1891), who became a brigadier general, serving as quartermaster at Fort Monroe from 1848 until 1857. He married Frances Clitz (1836‚Äì1901), sister of John Mellen Brady Clitz (1821‚Äì1897), commander of the Asiatic Squadron. * John Allen De Russy (1826‚Äì1850), also served in the military; died at Fort Monroe in Virginia in 1850. * Clara Louise De Russy (1829‚Äì1900), married William Augustus Nichols (1818‚Äì1869) * Emily Caroline De Russy (1831‚Äì1857), who married Henry Jackson Hunt (1819‚Äì1889), who became a brigadier general. After Frances' early death, De Russy married Helen Augusta Maxwell (1832‚Äì1908). Together, they were the parents of the following: * Isaac Denniston De Russy (1840‚Äì1923), who became a brigadier general. He married Laura Requa (1859‚Äì1929). * Laura De Russy (1853‚Äì1923); she married Washington Berry (1851‚Äì1921) in 1876. * Helen Maxwell De Russy (1856‚Äì1901), who married Charles Hobart Clark (1851‚Äì1915) in a double wedding with her younger sister Sara. * Fanny De Russy (1857‚Äì1925), who married Eli DuBose Hoyle (1851‚Äì1921), who became a brigadier general. Their son Rene Edward De Russy Hoyle (1883‚Äì1981) also became a brigadier general. * Sara Wetmore De Russy (1860‚Äì1926), who married Arthur Murray (1851‚Äì1925); a career officer, he became a major general. They had a double wedding with her older sister Helen. Their son Maxwell Murray (1885‚Äì1948) also had a military career, becoming a major general. He commanded the 25th Infantry Division in Honolulu during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. The senior De Russy \\"died while on active duty at San Francisco on November 23, 1865, aged 75 years, the oldest graduate of the Military Academy on active duty.\\" He is buried at the United States Military Academy Post Cemetery. Legacy There are five Forts DeRussy in the United States: Fort DeRussy Military Reservation in Honolulu, two in Louisiana, one in Kentucky, and one in Washington, D.C. The latter four were all built during the American Civil War. All of the forts were named for two brothers, Ren√© Edward and his younger brother Louis Gustave De Russy. Louis (also known as Lewis) graduated in 1814 from the United States Military Academy, two years after Ren√© but on an accelerated schedule. An engineer and career officer, he was assigned to Red River outposts in Louisiana in 1826 and made much of his career in that state. At advanced ages, they served on opposite sides of the Civil War: Ren√© on the Union side and Lewis as a colonel in the Confederate Army; he was the oldest West Point graduate to serve on the Confederate side. *DeRussy Drive on Dyker Heights was named for Rene E.

She saw service in World War II. After her decommissioning, the U.S. Navy loaned her to the United States Coast Guard, in which she served as the cutter USCGC Casco (WAVP-370), later WHEC-370, from 1949 to 1969. Construction and commissioning Casco was laid down on 30 May 1941 at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington. She was launched on 15 November 1941, sponsored by Mrs. W. J. Giles, and commissioned on 27 December 1941 with Commander Thomas S. Combs in command. United States Navy service=World War IINorth Pacific operations= After a period patrolling and caring for seaplanes off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, Casco arrived at Sitka, Alaska, on 5 May 1942 for duty surveying Aleutian waters, laying moorings for seaplanes, and providing seaplane tender services. Based at Cold Bay, she operated at Dutch Harbor, Chernofski Harbor, Kodiak, and Nazan Bay. While lying at anchor in Nazan Bay on 30 August 1942, Casco was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine RO-61. The resulting explosion killed five of her men and wounded 20, but prompt and clearheaded action brought flooding to a halt and got the ship underway so that she could be beached and later salvaged. Casco was refloated on 12 September 1942, and, after emergency repairs at Dutch Harbor and Kodiak, she received a thorough overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard. Casco returned to duty in the Aleutian Islands in March 1943, operating at Constantine Harbor, Amchitka, as tender to Fleet Air Wing Four (FAW-4). In May 1943 she moved to Attu, to care for the seaplanes conducting antisubmarine patrol and search missions in support of the United States Army's invasion of Attu, guarding against further Japanese reinforcement or penetration of the Aleutians. Cascos service in these waters where weather was often as formidable an enemy as the Japanese ended in November 1943, when she left for overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard. During one of her stays in the Aleutians, an OS2U Kingfisher from the Casco was borrowed by Colonel William O. Eareckson for use as a forward air control aircraft, which personally flew on numerous missions. =Central Pacific operations= Casco arrived in the Marshall Islands in February 1944 to tend seaplanes of patrol squadrons at Majuro and Kwajalein during the American occupation of those atolls, and later at Eniwetok until September 1944. Temporarily assigned to carry cargo for the buildup for the invasion of the Philippine Islands, she shuttled between Saipan, Ulithi Atoll, and the Palau Islands until November 1944, then returned to seaplane tender duty, in the Palaus until January 1945, and at Ulithi until April 1945. After overhaul at Saipan, she arrived in Kerama Retto on 25 April 1945 to care not only for seaplanes, but also for a motor torpedo boat squadron, all engaged in the American invasion and occupation of Okinawa. Casco returning to the United States West Coast in July 1945 for upkeep, and was there when hostilities with Japan ceased and World War II came to an end on 15 August 1945. =Honors and awards= Casco received three battle stars for World War II service. Post-World War II Her upkeep completed in September 1945, Casco returned to the Philippines in October 1945. Departing for the United States in April 1946, she then briefly assumed training duties at Galveston, Texas.Per Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center: Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy Ships: USS Casco (AVP-12), 1941-1949, which updates and corrects her original Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c4/casco-iii.htm), which states that she returned to the \\"Far East\\" in the spring of 1946. Decommissioning Casco was decommissioned on 10 April 1947 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange, Texas. United States Coast Guard service USCGC Casco (WHEC-370) in 1969.The Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the United States Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting, law enforcement, and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the U.S. Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. Casco herself was transferred to the United States Coast Guard on 19 April 1949, and was commissioned as USCGC Casco (WAVP-370), the first Coast Guard ship of the name, the same day. Service history Casco was assigned to operate from Boston, Massachusetts, which was her home port throughout her period of service in the Coast Guard. She served as a weather reporting ship, and also supported Coast Guard law-enforcement and search-and-rescue operations in the Atlantic Ocean, operating on ocean stations. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress. She was the first ship commanded by future Commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral J. William Kime. Casco responded to the a distress call from the sinking fishing vessel Magellan on 22 August 1949, rescuing Magellans crew and then saving Magellan from sinking. When the fishing vessel Wamsutta became disabled, Casco took her under tow and towed her from a point north of Nantucket, Massachusetts, to Boston on 23 January 1950. On 26 August 1950, Casco rendezvoused with the Greek merchant ship Igor northeast of Bermuda and evacuated an Igor crewman in need of medical assistance. On 24 November 1954, she went to the assistance of the disabled fishing vessel Sea Ranger and towed Sea Ranger to safety. On 17 February 1956, Casco took 21 men off of a United States Navy seaplane that had ditched south of Bermuda, then towed the seaplane to St. George‚Äôs Harbor at Bermuda. On 20 October 1958, Casco took a crewman in medical distress off of the merchant ship Maye Lykes. In cooperation with universities in the eastern United States and international agencies, Casco conducted oceanographic experiments between South America and Africa from 1 August 1963 to 19 August 1963. Casco was classified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-370 on 1 May 1966. Casco helped fight a major fire on Long Wharf at Boston on 27 March 1968. Final disposition The Coast Guard returned Casco to the U.S. Navy in March 1969, and she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sunk as a target in the North Atlantic Ocean at on 15 May 1969. Torpedoed twice, she sank at 16:33 hours, less than five minutes after the second torpedo struck her on her starboard side.

He founded both Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch. In addition to his numerous lawsuits against the Clinton Administration, which led him to be called a \\"Clinton nemesis,\\" Klayman has filed a number of lawsuits against political figures and governmental agencies. Klayman's goal in initiating the lawsuits is often to obtain information through the discovery process, rather than to win the lawsuit. Most cases brought by either Judicial Watch or Klayman himself have failed. Critics have described him as \\"gadfly\\" and \\"a racist, a frivolous litigator and a conspiracy theorist.\\" Klayman, a birther, submitted a petition to deport President Barack Obama. His litigation tactics have led to criticism and to sanctions from legal authorities including a ban from appearing in two courtrooms and a temporary suspension of his law license. Education and career Larry Klayman was born in Philadelphia. He graduated from Harriton High School in 1969 and with honors from Duke University with a B.A. in Political Science and French Literature in 1974. He received his J.D. from Emory University Law School in 1977. Klayman founded Judicial Watch in 1994. During his tenure, Judicial Watch filed several lawsuits against Bill Clinton and the Clinton administration. Klayman left Judicial Watch to pursue political office. In 2004, Klayman ran for the US Senate from Florida but lost the Republican Party primary, finishing seventh out of eight candidates. After his run for the Senate, Klayman formed Freedom Watch. He says the name originated from an episode of The West Wing in which he was caricatured as Larry Claypool. Klayman is the author of two books and writes periodic columns for conservative websites such as World Net Daily. He was born to Jewish parents and identifies himself as a messianic Jew. Legal tactics Klayman has a reputation for his aggressive legal tactics; for example, the Southern Poverty Law Center has described him as \\"pathologically litigious.\\" Although he has a poor record of winning cases, his lawsuits have often resulted in the release of previously-undisclosed documents that generate new scandals. He has been blamed for changing the tone of partisan investigations in Washington, DC. In the 1990s, Klayman deposed several White House officials and probed James Carville about his television habits, Paul Begala about his priest, and George Stephanopoulos about his traffic tickets. Carville publicly described Klayman as a \\"little twerp,\\" and Klayman responded by questioning him about the statement during a deposition. Sanctions and discipline imposed Following Klayman's behavior in a 1992 trial in California federal court, Judge William Duffy Keller barred him from his courtroom for life. Five years later, in a separate case in New York, Klayman's behavior led District Judge Denny Chin to issue a lifetime ban on the attorney practicing law before him. In 2007, Klayman received a $25,000 retainer from a Daytona Beach woman facing criminal charges who accused him of not providing legal services in return. The Florida Bar Association mediated the matter, and Klayman agreed to pay off a small portion within 90 days, but after the deadline lapsed, he was reprimanded by the association. In 2014, Klayman agreed to be publicly censured by the District of Columbia Bar. Klayman represented three individuals who had sued Judicial Watch, his former employer and client, but failed to obtain Judicial Watch's consent to waive his conflict of interest. Klayman maintained that the bar had \\"recognized there was no evidence of dishonesty or personal gain.\\" In 2020, however, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals suspended Klayman's license for 90 days and ordered him to complete a class on legal ethics. An October 2016 opinion by a Ninth Circuit Court on Klayman's attempt to represent Cliven Bundy noted 12 cases \\"in which Klayman's ability to practice law in an ethical and orderly manner was called into question.\\" In 2018, Klayman unsuccessfully sued the District of Columbia Bar and some of its employees by alleging they were conspiring to disbar him. Klayman's lawsuit acknowledged three disciplinary actions then pending against him: the Judicial Watch matter already mentioned, Klayman's attempts to represent Bundy, and a complaint on his representation of a sexual-harassment plaintiff. In 2019, with respect to the last complaint, the discipline committee recommended for Klayman to be suspended from practicing law for 33 months. Lawsuits=Clintons Through Judicial Watch, Klayman filed around 18 lawsuits against the Clinton administration, alleging ethical misconduct and criminal activity. In one case, a federal judge ruled that Clinton violated the Privacy Act when he released personal letters between him and a female White House volunteer. The woman had appeared on national television accusing him of making improper sexual advances, and Clinton claimed that he released the letters to discredit her. The judge determined that was an act of criminal intent, but the ruling was called \\"inappropriate\\" by the appellate court. [\\"Indeed, it was inappropriate for the District Court gratuitously to invoke sweeping pronouncements on alleged criminal activity that extended well beyond what was necessary to decide the matters at hand.\\"] In the Clinton-era fundraising scandal known as Chinagate, Judicial Watch was awarded nearly a million dollars in attorney fees against the US Department of Commerce. Klayman represented Gennifer Flowers, who claimed to be one of Bill Clinton's mistresses, in a defamation suit against Hillary Clinton. Klayman also represented Dolly Kyle, another woman who claimed to be a mistress of Bill Clinton, in her unsuccessful lawsuit against him. Klayman represented Jared Paul Stern in his unsuccessful defamation lawsuit against the Clintons, Ronald Burkle, and the Daily News. In 2012, Klayman represented Freedom Watch in its FOIA request to obtain various federal agencies' documents. During the course of litigation, Klayman sought access to Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, but the courts denied his request. In 2015, Klayman filed an unsuccessful RICO lawsuit against Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and the Clinton Foundation by alleging Hillary Clinton sold access to US government officials in return for donations to the Clinton Foundation. In the wake of the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Klayman filed unsuccessful lawsuits against Hillary Clinton, Obama, George Soros, former US Attorney General Eric Holder, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton, and some of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement by alleging they had incited a \\"race war\\" that led to the shooting. In 2016, Klayman, on behalf of family members of two people killed in the 2012 Benghazi attack, unsuccessfully sued Hillary Clinton for wrongful death and defamation. In 2017, Klayman circulated a petition to be appointed as a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's involvement in the sale of Uranium One. Barack Obama In 2012, Klayman filed on behalf of a Florida resident an unsuccessful challenge to Barack Obama's placement on the primary ballot and claimed the president is not a natural-born citizen, as required by the US Constitution. He also represented the presidential candidate for the Constitution Party and a member of the Alabama Republican Party, who alleged the Alabama Secretary of State had a duty to investigate Obama's eligibility. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Chief Justice Roy Moore and another justice dissented by arguing the Secretary of State had the authority to conduct such an investigation. Two other justices wrote concurring opinions that supported the dismissal and addressed the dissenting opinions. In 2013, a citizen grand jury formed by Klayman \\"indicted\\" Obama and others of various crimes (including involuntary manslaughter), \\"convicted\\" Obama of fraud, and alleged that he had forged his birth certificate to pass presidential eligibility requirements. On October 13, 2013, during the US government shutdown, Klayman declared at a conservative rally in Washington, DC, \\"This president is not a president of We the People; he's a president of his people.\\" He urged the crowd to begin a \\"second American non-violent Revolution\\" and demanded for Obama to \\"put the Quran down... [and] figuratively come out with his hands up.\\" Weeks later, Klayman sponsored a \\"Reclaim America\\" rally in Lafayette Square, across from the White House, and called for Obama's impeachment. Klayman stated that if Obama did not resign, conservative activists would meet to establish a \\"shadow government.\\" Klayman had encouraged \\"millions to occupy Washington D.C.\\" but the reported attendance was between 130 and 200. In 2014, Klayman requested the Department of Homeland Security to initiate deportation proceedings against Obama. Klayman also sued the National Security Agency in Klayman v. Obama. In 2013, Klayman sued the Obama administration over the collection of phone records by the National Security Agency (NSA). A federal judge agreed with Klayman that the surveillance program was likely unconstitutional but stayed an injunction pending an appeal by the US government. The ACLU and US Senator Rand Paul had filed similar cases, but Klayman's was the only one to gain a favorable court ruling. In 2015, however, the D.C. Circuit vacated the injunction and ruled that Klayman had failed to show that his own records had been collected. Later in 2015, the district court enjoined the NSA from collecting data about Klayman's client, a California lawyer who had recently been added to the lawsuit, but the D.C. Circuit court stayed enforcement of that injunction. In 2017, the district court dismissed the lawsuit and noted, \\"Klayman accused this Court of being coopted by the so called 'Deep State' into ruling against him. Unfortunately for plaintiffs, such baseless accusations are no substitute for a well-pleaded complaint.\\" Klayman had several other dismissed suits against Obama, including a lawsuit alleging that the Obama administration had secretly allowed the Ebola virus to enter the US to harm people of the \\"Caucasian race and Jewish-Christian religion,\\" a suit to block actions taken by the Obama administration regarding gun control, a lawsuit to block the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, and a suit against Obama and others for inciting airport protests at the Los Angeles International Airport. Serving as an attorney for Jerome Corsi, Klayman falsely asserted during a March 2019 CNN interview that Obama's birth certificate \\"uses the word 'African-American' in 1961.‚Äù Klayman vowed to convene a citizen grand jury to \\"indict\\" Obama's vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden for their involvement with Burisma Holdings. In 2019, Klayman sued the Bidens and alleged that they pressured YouTube to ban his channel, which was suspended for two days. Other legal actions filed by Klayman Klayman has brought a number of lawsuits on behalf of conservative causes or against individuals associated with the Democratic Party. Many of the cases have been dismissed, including lawsuits against Facebook seeking $1 billion for not responding quickly enough to calls to take down an anti-Israel \\"Third Intifada\\" pageKlayman v. Zuckerberg, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182598 (D.D.C. Dec. 28, 2012), http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2011cv00874/148053/42/. and against the Republican National Committee alleging that it conspired to deprive Donald Trump from being awarded the delegates that he had won in the 2016 Republican Party primary for Florida. In November 2018, Klayman sued Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections for Broward County, Florida, over the 2018 election results. In September 2020, Klayman sued Michael Bloomberg and others over Bloomberg's efforts to restore the voting rights of Florida felons who had lost the right to vote. Klayman filed an unsuccessful suit to remove special counsel Robert Mueller from the Justice Department's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and convened a citizen grand jury that \\"indicted\\" Mueller. Klayman has also filed a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission complaint that stating that CNN had incited the \\"assassination of the elected President and Vice President, and the Speaker of the House.\\" Klayman has also brought a number of legal actions on his personal life. In 1998, Klayman sued his mother for $50,000 for the reimbursement for medical care provided to his maternal grandmother. In 2013, Klayman defended his actions in an interview with ABC News and said that it was \\"essentially a case against my stepfather\\" and that he named his mother \\"because legally she was next of kin.\\" Klayman also unsuccessfully sued the City Pages and Phoenix New Times newspapers for defamation after they reported on a custody dispute between Klayman and his ex-wife. Klayman has also sued the group that he founded, Judicial Watch, in 2012. Klayman argued that a Judicial Watch employee falsely told Orly Taitz that Klayman had been convicted of not paying child support. In reality, Klayman had been indicted of failing to pay child support, but the charges were later dismissed. Taitz published the Judicial Watch employee's comment on her website. Klayman sued Judicial Watch for defamation, and in 2014, a federal jury awarded Klayman $156,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages. In 2019, however, Judicial Watch obtained a $2.8 million verdict against Klayman in a trademark dispute. Lawsuits representing others Klayman represented Jos√© Basulto of the Cuban exile organization Brothers to the Rescue and won a $1.7 million judgment against Fidel Castro in 2005. The Cuban government had shot down and killed four of Basulto's colleagues and nearly himself as they flew over international waters. In 2010, Klayman represented Vincent Forras in a lawsuit against Feisal Abdul Rauf to prevent the building of the so-called Ground Zero mosque. In the motion to dismiss, Rauf's attorney called Klayman an \\"infamous publicity hound\\" and wrote that Forras \\"trades in his well deserved laurels for fifteen minutes of fame as a nationally recognized bigot.\\" Klayman and Forras sought sanctions, but the court denied that request and dismissed the suit. In 2014, Klayman filed an unsuccessful lawsuit on behalf of Joe Arpaio that alleged that the Obama administration's actions on federal immigration policy had not been authorized by Congress. In 2015, Klayman represented five former government employees in an unsuccessful lawsuit against the NSA, the Department of Justice, and employees of those agencies for alleged retaliation for their complaints about the Trailblazer Project. In 2015, Klayman represented Dennis L. Montgomery in his unsuccessful request to intervene in the contempt proceedings against Arpaio in a lawsuit that initially alleged Maricopa County to have engaged in impermissible racial profiling but later revealed that Arpaio had allegedly hired Montgomery to investigate the DOJ. In 2017, Montgomery and Klayman unsuccessfully jointly sued James Comey and other federal government officials by alleging a coverup of evidence that Montgomery claimed to show the existence of widespread illegal surveillance by the federal government. In 2016, Klayman unsuccessfully applied in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada for permission to represent Cliven Bundy in the criminal case stemming from the 2014 Bundy standoff. Klayman did not formally represent Bundy at his criminal trial but conferred with Bundy and his family members. The judge dismissed the case, the government appealed the dismissal, and Klayman represented Bundy on his successful appeal. Following the dismissal of the federal criminal charges against Bundy, Klayman on the behalf of Bundy unsuccessfully sued in state court for a declaration that the federal government cannot own land in Nevada. Klayman also filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of two of Bundy's codefendants who were found not guilty. Klayman filed a similar but unsuccessful lawsuit on behalf of Bundy's son, Ryan. Another Bundy co- defendant, Peter Santilli, however, in January 2019 filed a complaint with the D.C. Bar that alleged that Klayman's efforts during the Bundy case had been lacking. In turn, Klayman unsuccessfully sued Santilli for defamation. In 2018, Klayman filed an unsuccessful suit on behalf of Kiara Robles, who alleged her First Amendment rights were violated when she was attacked during the 2017 Berkeley protests. The court revoked Klayman's pro hac vice status for professional misconduct, which ended Klayman's ability to represent her in that court, and the courts ultimately dismissed most of her suit. In 2018, Klayman, on the behalf of Freedom Watch and later also Laura Loomer, filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple and alleged the companies to have conspired to censor conservative content. In 2019, Klayman assisted Loomer with an unsuccessful lawsuit against U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib that alleged that Tlaib had \\"violently grabbed\\" Loomer's cellphone. In 2018, Klayman filed on the behalf of Jerome Corsi a request for an investigation into the Special Counsel's tactics and an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging Mueller and other government actors violated his constitutional rights and leaked grand jury secrets. Klayman also represented Corsi's stepson, who testified before a federal grand jury on whether Corsi had directed him to \\"scrub\\" a computer. In 2018, Schaeffer Cox retained Klayman to help with a FOIA request for law enforcement records in his criminal case. In 2020, Klayman filed on the behalf of Joel Gilbert's production company a lawsuit that alleged breach of contract after a movie theater canceled Gilbert's private screening of his film, The Trayvon Hoax. In 2020, Klayman filed on the behalf of himself, Freedom Watch, and a Dallas-area photography studio a lawsuit that alleged that the Chinese government created the coronavirus disease as a biological weapon. Klayman also represented Ben Stein in a lawsuit that alleged that California's shelter-in-place order in response to the pandemic to be illegal. Klayman also filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN over its coverage of his lawsuits. In 2020, Klayman filed, on behalf of seven former Philadelphia police officers, a lawsuit that alleged they were wrongfully fired following the discovery of their racist comments. In addition to defamation lawsuits filed on his own behalf or against the Clintons, Klayman also has filed defamation lawsuits of the behalf of Forras, Joseph Farah, Bradlee Dean, The judge heavily criticized Klayman, and Dean was ordered to pay defendants' legal fees, which totaled nearly $25,000. Arpaio, Montgomery, Loomer, Corsi, Roy Moore, Laurie Luhn, Jackie Beard Robinson, George Zimmerman, and Demetrick Pennie. None of them has yet been successful.

The war waged throughout the middle of the 17th and 18th centuries pitting partisans of the House of Kinlaza against the House of Kimpanzu. Numerous other factions entered the fray claiming descent from one or both of the main parties such as the √Ågua Rosada of Kibangu and the da Silva of Soyo. By the end of the war, Kongo's vaunted capital had been destroyed and many Bakongo were sold into the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Origins The Kingdom of Kongo reached its apex during the reign of its most powerful king Garcia II. King Garcia II had come to power after the death of his brother, √Ålvaro VI, whom he had assisted in seizing the throne of Kongo from the House of Kimpanzu. Together, the brothers forged a new dynasty named for the Nlaza kanda, thus the House of Kinlaza. The ascension of this dynasty, which traced its legitimacy to the throne maternally as opposed to the paternal pedigree of the House of Kimpanzu and House of Nsundi was greeted with hostility from the get go. Rival claimants for the throne of Kongo, by then the most powerful state in Central Africa, united behind the Kimpanzu. When King Garcia II came to power, the Kimpanzu were entrenched in the county of Soyo giving support to the remaining Nsundi and Kimpanzu partisans inside Kongo while claiming the title of Princes and later Grand Princes. By the end of Garcia's reign, Soyo was completely independent of Kongo and there was open hostility between the House of Kinlaza and the House of Kimpanzu including plots on the king's life and military engagements. Descent into War In 1661 King Garcia II, died leaving the throne to his second eldest son Ant√≥nio. King Ant√≥nio I was determined to remove the Portuguese from Angola, as they had been a thorn in Kongo's side since 1622. King Garcia II's gambit of assisting the Dutch in their short war with Portugal over the port of Luanda had turned out badly. Now Portugal was stronger than ever with control of Luanda, source of Kongo's nzimbu shell money. More and more, Kongo had to rely on Dutch support, which was not as forthcoming with Soyo as a competitor. These events set Garcia II's successor, Ant√≥nio I, on a completely anti- Portuguese agenda. Battle of Mbwila Despite the rising tension between the states, the spark that would set them to war again would be a dispute over the tiny border town of Mbwila. The chiefdom had sworn fealty to both Kongo and Angola in the past. In 1665 a dispute between the claimant to the chiefdomship and his aunt drew Kongo and Angola into confrontation, Kongo supporting the claimant with Angola supporting the aunt. The two powers met at the Battle of Mbwila on October 29, 1665. In the ensuing battle, Kongo was badly defeated. King Ant√≥nio I and many of the Kinlaza nobility were killed in the battle; the royal crown and sceptre were sent to Portugal as trophies. The boy heir to the Kongo throne was captured and taken to Luanda along with the head of Ant√≥nio. The royal possessions of the king, which he feared to leave in Kongo because of rival partisans, were also lost on the battlefield. Robbed of their king, heir and symbols of leadership, the kingdom quickly descended into civil war as Kinlaza and Kimpanzu partisans vied for the throne. Soyo intervention in Kongo The Battle of Mbwila did not have a drastic change on the borders of Central Africa. Kongo and Angola had no more control over this remote settlement than it had before the battle. The party that did prosper as a result of Kongo's defeat was the county of Soyo, home to many Kimpanzu partisans. Soyo, ruled by the Silva kanda, had been refuge to the Kimpanzu hiding out in the Luvota region in its south. With no strong opposition in Kongo to them, the da Silvas were able to impose their will on both Kinlaza and Kimpanzu claimants to the throne. Beginning of Soyo intervention King Afonso II of Kongo and Nkondo, not to be confused with Afonso II of Kongo from the 16th century, took the throne after the death of Ant√≥nio I. The ascension of Afonso, a Kimpanzu partisan, played into Soyo's plans. The Kinlaza were quick to act against him and forced him out in place of √Ålvaro VII. The deposed king fled to Nkondo, where he continued to claim kingship over Kongo. Invasions of Kongo (1666 and 1669) King √Ålvaro VII turned out to be a tyrant, hated by both political rivals and the common people. In an unprecedented move, Soyo marched on the capital and assisted the people in √Ålvaro VII's overthrow and murder. In June, another Kinlaza king was elected. This time, the election would take place under the auspices of Soyo. √Ålvaro VIII was elected to the throne and ruled for three years. He allowed the Portuguese to search for gold in his kingdom, but no gold or silver was to be found in the realm. The House of Kinlaza kept tacit control of the throne, but Soyo proved to be the true master of the kingdom. King Pedro III, another Kinlaza partisan with less sympathy toward Soyo, came to power in January 1669. Soyo sent a force yet again into Kongo and removed the king from power. This time, the da Silvas would place a Kimpanzu ruler on the throne. King Pedro III fled to Lemba (also known as Mbula or Bula), but that would not be the end of his dealings in Kongo. End of Soyo intervention King √Ålvaro IX was put in power by Soyo in hopes that a Kimpanzu might be easier to control. However, even among the Kimpanzu, nobles were beginning to resent Soyo's meddling in Kongo. In 1670 √Ålvaro IX was overthrown by Rafael I, the Marquis of Mpemba. Unlike the previous king, Rafael I was a Kinlaza and unwilling to be controlled by the Silvas. =Battle of Kitombo= Once on the throne the ambitious king sought Portuguese help in removing his overseers in Mbanza-Soyo. With the promise of mineral rights and opportunity to punish Soyo for dealings with the \\"heathen\\" (non-Catholic) Dutch, Angola sent an army under the command of Jo√£o Soares de Almeida. After an initial victory against Soyo in which its ruler Count Est√™v√£o da Silva was killed, the Angolan army was crushed at the Battle of Kitombo by a Soyo force led by Prince Pedro da Silva, brother of the dead count.Battell, Andrew and Samuel Purchas: The Strange Adventures of Andrew Battell of Leigh, in Angola and the Adjoining Regions\\", page 132. The Hakluyt Society, 1901 The victory stopped Portuguese ambitions in Kongo until the 19th century but left Soyo in a much more precarious position. King Rafael remained on the throne as Soyo turned its focus toward protecting its own border and getting papal recognition. The victory at Kitombo is celebrated in certain parts of Angola on Saint Luke's Day (October 18). Sack of S√£o Salvador The Kimpanzu continued to rule the kingdom despite its tenuous situation. The more powerful provinces like Nsundi and Mbata were splitting off, and the power of the king waned as trade was rerouted to more stable areas outside of Kongo such as Soyo and Loango. King Rafael I was succeeded by the Marquis of Nkondo, Afonso III of Kongo. He only reigned shortly before the rise of King Daniel I. King Daniel I ruled four years before the Kinlaza made a final disastrous play for the throne. The deposed King Pedro III marched on S√£o Salvador with Jaga mercenaries, resulting in a battle that killed King Daniel I and burnt most of the city to the ground in 1678.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 23. Cambridge University, 1998 The destruction of the capital forced claimants from both sides of the conflict to rule from mountain fortresses. The Kinlaza retreated to Mbula while the Kimpanzu were headquartered at Mbamba Luvota in the south of Soyo.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998 S√£o Salvador became the grazing place of wild animals, where rival claimants would crown themselves then retreat before drawing the ire of opposition partisans. Even after its resettlement, the city would never regain its prominence. Divided kingdom Without a center for trade and politics, the once powerful kingdom ceased to exist for two decades. This did not keep the partisans from trying to kill each other, however. King Pedro III was assassinated in 1680 under a banner of truce by Manuel de N√≥brega in revenge for the death of his brother, King Daniel I.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 79. Cambridge University, 1998 King Pedro III was succeeded by his younger brother, Jo√£o II. King Jo√£o II fought tirelessly to dominate another Kinlaza stronghold, Kibangu, but to no avail.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 20. Cambridge University, 1998 Kibangu eventually fell to forces from within opposed to the succession of Manuel I of Kibangu. Two brothers from the √Ågua Rosada kanda, the product of a Kimpanzu father and Kinlaza mother, overthrew Manuel in 1688.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 20. Cambridge University, 1998 The oldest brother, King √Ålvaro X, ruled the mountain fortress until his death in December 1695. It would be his brother, Pedro IV, that would oversee the restoration of Kongo. Meanwhile, Manuel de N√≥brega, brother of King Daniel I, ruled Mbamba Lovata in the name of the Kimpanzu and with the sanction of the powerful queen Suzana de N√≥brega.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998 Manuel de N√≥brega used the power of Soyo to make war on all Kinlaza partisans within reach including the Queen Ana Afonso de Le√£o, the matriarch of the Kinlaza.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 25.

Cambridge University, 1998 She claimed that Saint Anthony came to her in visions and declared her mission was to reunite the kingdom of Kongo. She later traveled to each of the mountain fortresses of the Kinlaza (KibanguThornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 110.

Cambridge University, 1998 After being rebuffed by all of them, she gathered her followers and marched into the ruins of the ancient capital in October or November 1704.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 139.

Cambridge University, 1998 King Pedro IV, at the urging of Capuchin missionaries, had Dona Beatriz arrested for heresy and burned at the stake.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 179. Cambridge University, 1998 King Pedro then left to take S√£o Salvador and reunify the kingdom for good. Battle of S√£o Salvador King Pedro had been working toward reunification of Kongo since before the rise of the Antonians.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 199. Cambridge University, 1998 He had gained the fealty of nearly all claimants through political rather than military means. Even the Kimpanzu acknowledged him. On February 15, 1709 King Pedro marched on S√£o Salvador at the head of his army carrying only a cross.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 199. Cambridge University, 1998 In the ensuing battle between Pedro IV and Pedro Constantino da Silva, the Antonians were routed. Constantino da Silva was taken and beheaded as he tried to surrender.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 199. Cambridge University, 1998 Battle of Mbula The defeated Antonians fled to Bula and sought the help of Jo√£o II, who had still refused to recognize any king of Kongo other than himself. King Jo√£o II marched his forces south to see what if anything could be gained at the expense of Pedro IV. On Saint Francis Day, October 4, the armies of Jo√£o II and Pedro IV clashed within the Mbula territory.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 200. Cambridge University, 1998 King Pedro IV was again victorious, and Jo√£o II fled back to Lemba. King Pedro IV was so elated that he proclaimed St. Francis his savior and renamed his base S√£o Francisco de Kibangu.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 200. Cambridge University, 1998 End of the war After these battles, Pedro dedicated himself to reunifying Kongo and making peace between the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu. A general pardon was given to all Kimpanzu.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 201. Cambridge University, 1998 Manuel Makasa, youngest brother of Kibenga, became Pedro's son-in-law and heir.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 201. Cambridge University, 1998 King Pedro died in 1718 leaving an at least partially reunified kingdom with its capital back at S√£o Salvador.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 202. Cambridge University, 1998 Prince Mauel Masaka became king under the name Manuel II of Kongo. After him, Garcia IV Nkanga a Mvemba succeeded peacefully to the throne according to Pedro's compromise agreement. King Garcia the IV was a member of the Mbula faction of Kinlaza. After him, the Kinlaza of Bula stopped making independent claims for the throne of Kongo. King Pedro IV's descendants remained in Kibangu claiming the title of prince but never pressing to become king of Kongo.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 201. Cambridge University, 1998 Peace reigned more or less for the next 50 years with very few intervals. The throne rotated mainly between the Kinlaza of the east and the Kimpanzu of the west. Despite the settlement and restoration of the monarchy, Kongo was long past its glory days. It never regained its prominence economically or politically, disintegrating into fiefdoms recognizing the King of Kongo but not truly under his control.

He was the fourth child in a family of seven born to Mary Frances Moore Lehr (1834‚Äì1922), and Robert Oliver Lehr (1832‚Äì1890), a tobacco and snuff importer who became the German consul in Baltimore and a governor of the Maryland Club. His sister was Alice Lehr Morton (d. 1927) and his brother was Dr. Louis Lehr, who was a physician. Society life He attempted to establish himself as successor to Ward McAllister, arbiter elegantiarum of New York's Four Hundred, the collection of Knickerbocker and industrial families he created as a bulwark against the new wealth of the Gilded Age.Washington Post; September 26, 1903. Some Thoughts on Harry Lehr. Those very industrious and entertaining gossips who spend so much time exploiting the antics of Mr. Harry Lehr do not appear to have considered the possibility that he may be anything rather than the fool they would have him. This very alert and resourceful young gentleman, it will be well to remember, has prospered most amazingly as the result of his more or less dignified activities in connection with the Newport smart set. He was known for staging elaborate parties alongside Marion \\"Mamie\\" Fish, such as the so- called \\"dog's dinner\\", in which 100 pets of wealthy friends dined at foot-high tables while dressed in formal attireVanderbilt II, Arthur T. Fortune's Children. Wm. Morrow and Co., 1989: 243. . At a later party, he impersonated the Czar of Russia, and was henceforth dubbed \\"King Lehr\\".Vanderbilts, 244 Personal life In 1900, Lehr was introduced to recently widowed 32 year old heiress Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Wharton Drexel Dahlgren (1868‚Äì1944). the widow of John Vinton Dahlgren and daughter of the late Philadelphia banker Joseph William Drexel, by Edith Gould, the wife of George Jay Gould. Edith told Bessie that he had \\"hardly any money, but he goes everywhere,\\" and that it was \\"impossible to have a party without him.\\" Gould also told her that the men didn't like him, and called him \\"one of 'the little brothers of the rich,' but that's just because they are jealous of his popularity.\\" They saw each other often and in March, Lehr took her to Sherry's where he introduced her to Caroline Schermerhorn Astor (married to William Backhouse Astor Jr.), Marion Graves Anthon Fish (married to Stuyvesant Fish), Theresa Fair Oelrichs (married to Hermann Oelrichs), and Alva Belmont (who was divorced from William Kissam Vanderbilt and married to Oliver Belmont). After meeting the society doyennes approval, Lehr proposed to Bessie on the way home. Lehr and Bessie were married at St Patrick's Cathedral in New York in 1901. After the wedding, they traveled to the Stafford Hotel in Baltimore, where Lehr refused to sleep with her on their wedding night,Vanderbilt II, Arthur T. Fortune's Children. Wm. Morrow and Co., 1989: 235‚Äì7. stating: > In public I will be to you everything that a most devoted husband should be > to his wife. You shall never complain of my conduct in this respect.

I can never love > you. I can school myself to be polite to you but that is all. The less we > see of one another except in the presence of others, the better. They stayed in a loveless, unconsummated marriage for 28 years, as Lehr benefited from her wealth, she from his social connections and her strong wish to not upset her conservative, staunchly Catholic mother, Lucy (n√©e Wharton) Drexel.

He died on January 3, 1929 of a brain malady at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. At the time of his death, Bessie was in France staying at the home of Alva's daughter Consuelo Vanderbilt and her husband Jacques Balsan (after her divorce from Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough). His funeral was held at St. Ignatius Church in Baltimore and he was buried in the family lot in Green Mount Cemetery. Under the terms of his will, he left all of his property in the United States to his sisters and his possessions in Paris to his widow. Sexuality Lehr was, in fact, gay and rumored to have had a longstanding relationship with friend and fellow Newport cottager Charles Greenough.

He briefly played Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in September 1902. He died in 1910 at the age of 29 from typhoid fever. Early years According to his State of Michigan death certificate, Louis Joseph \\"Lou\\" Schiappacasse was born March 29, 1881, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of Anton \\"Anthony\\" J Schiappacasse and Caterina \\"Catherine\\" Schiappacasse both originally of Neirone, Genoa, Liguria, Italy. Lou's father, Anton, was a fruit dealer and confectioner operating from locations on Main Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan until his death on August 28, 1899 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Lou's mother, Caterina, died on September 17, 1895, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Both are buried in the Anton Schiappacasse family plot along with their children in the Saint Thomas Catholic Cemetery in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Baseball career=Detroit Tigers Schiappacasse played two games in Major League Baseball. Both games were for the Detroit Tigers on September 7th and 8th of 1902. In his two Major League Baseball games, he was hitless with a base on balls in six plate appearances for a .167 on-base percentage. He played right field for the Detroit Tigers; making an error on his only chance. Schiappacasse is one of the rare players with career batting averages and fielding percentages of .000. He also holds the distinction of having the longest last name (13 letters) of any player for the Detroit Tigers in their 100+ year history. (Boots Poffenberger, Steve Partenheimer, and Vito Valentinetti) are tied for 2nd with 12 letters.) Minor leagues During the 1903 season, Schiappacasse played third base for the Holland, Michigan independent team. In January 1904, he was signed by the Detroit Tigers for a spring training try- out. However, he did not play for the Detroit Tigers in 1904 and instead played for the Monroe Hill Citys in the Cotton States League. He continued thereafter to play minor league baseball for the Augusta Tourists of the South Atlantic League (1905, 1906), Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association (1905), Charleston Sea Gulls of the South Atlantic League (1907), Tecumseh in the Southern Michigan League (1908), Saginaw Wa-wahs in the Southern Michigan League (1909), and Muskegon Speed Boys of the West Michigan League (1910).

She was involved with the production of several volumes of the officially sponsored History of the Second World War, but was better known for her books, commissioned by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, covering the early history of Britain's nuclear weapons programmes: Britain and Atomic Energy 1939‚Äì1945, published in 1964, and the two-volume Independence and Deterrence: Britain and Atomic Energy 1945‚Äì52, published in 1974. Through her work in the Cabinet Office from 1945 to 1959, she knew personally many of the people involved. As historian archivist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority from 1959 to 1966 she had access to the official papers and files of the British nuclear weapons programmes. She was the first occupant of a chair in the history of science at the University of Oxford, which she held from 1972 until her retirement in 1986. As co-founder with physicist Nicholas Kurti of the Contemporary Scientific Archives Centre in Oxford, she helped ensure the preservation of contemporary scientific manuscripts. Early life Margaret Elliott was born on 26 April 1921 in Kensington, London, the youngest of three children of Ronald Elliott, a motor engineer, and his wife, Mabel Donaldson, a school teacher. She had an older sister, Audrey, and an older brother, Donald. The family was poor; her father suffered, and ultimately died, from tuberculosis and was frequently unemployed, while her mother was barred from working as a school teacher after she was married. The family therefore often had to live on a weekly sickness benefit. For entertainment, they took advantage of free entry to art galleries, museums and libraries. Elliot's direct experience of poverty led to her becoming an ardent socialist later in life. She attended Portobello Elementary School in North Kensington, and won a London County Council scholarship to Christ's Hospital in 1932. She excelled academically, was a prefect, and played hockey for her house. Elliott completed her School Certificate in 1936, earning distinctions in Latin, English and French and a pass in German. She won a Leverhulme Entry Scholarship to the London School of Economics (LSE), which she entered in 1938. Her first-year studies advisor was the economist Vera Anstey, who considered that Elliott had \\"a decided bent for economic history\\", Elliot later attributed her interest in the subject to lectures by her second-year studies advisor, Eileen Power, who urged her to pursue an academic career. She won both the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Lillian Knowles Scholarship for economic history in 1939. Later that year, with the outbreak of the Second World War, the LSE was evacuated to Oxford, where Elliott graduated in 1941 with a BSc degree in economics with first- class honours.  Civil Service  Academic jobs in history were not easy to find in 1941, so Elliott joined the Civil Service, working in the Prices and Statistics Section of the Iron and Steel Control directorate in the Ministry of Supply. She subsequently moved to the Board of Trade, and the Directorate of Housing Fitments, where she rose to the rank of Assistant Principal, before moving to the Cabinet Office in 1945. There she became involved with the Official History of the Second World War, as assistant to Keith Hancock who was overall editor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of books within the Official History. As an official historian of the History of the Second World War: United Kingdom Civil Series, Gowing had access to unpublished official papers and files. She came to know personally many of the politicians and senior civil servants involved. On 7 June 1944, Elliot married Donald James Graham Gowing at the Wimbledon Registry Office. He was a vocalist who had also attended Christ's Hospital before winning a choral scholarship to Kings College, Cambridge, in 1939. He had joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1941, and was serving at Combined Operations Headquarters. They married shortly before he was shipped overseas. He was taught Japanese in the United States and went on serve in the Pacific as a translator. The marriage bar was suspended for the duration and Gowing was allowed to remain in the Civil Service. They had two children, both sons: Nicholas Keith (Nik), a journalist who was born in 1951 and named after Hancock, and James, born in 1954. Her husband, frustrated by his lack of professional success compared to hers, became an alcoholic, and died from a massive stroke in 1969. In 1950, Sir Norman Brook attempted to have Gowing retained in the Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told that she had no chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried retirement benefits with it. She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began looking for another position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist, but he could not offer her a pension. The Public Records Act 1958 required all government departments to set up archives and records management systems. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) was nominally exempt from the act, being a government corporation rather than a department, but voluntarily asked to be included under the Act. This created a position at the UKAEA for an historian and archivist. Gowing applied for and secured the job in 1959. This involved organising systems and criteria for the selection for preservation of scientific, engineering and administrative records, and writing the history of the British atomic project since it had begun in 1939, the UKAEA having inherited the files of predecessor organisations including the Tube Alloys Directorate. By this time, the UKAEA employed some 40,000 people in offices, laboratories and factories scattered around Britain. Gowing knew little about atomic energy; she once remarked that when she was appointed, she \\"didn't know an atom from a molecule\\". This was rectified, and she won the respect of Sir Christopher Hinton and Sir James Chadwick, and became friends with Nicholas Kurti, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Niels Bohr. At one point she asked Chadwick what he intended to do with all the documents in wooden filing cabinets in his attic, and he just said \\"burn them\\". Such heart-stopping moments led her to help establish the Centre for Scientific Archives in 1972. Gowing's first volume, Britain and Atomic Energy 1939‚Äì1945, was published in 1964, and achieved widespread acclaim. Stephen Toulmin declared that \\"No better example of contemporary narrative history of science has yet appeared\\". It prompted Mark Oliphant to seek the appointment of a historian to the Australian Academy of Science in Canberra, and the Cabinet Office to commission a new series of peacetime official histories in 1966. Academia In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History at the new University of Kent, Canterbury, covering scientific, technical, economic and social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her ¬£1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939‚Äì1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, so they had to do their writing on site, under the watchful eye of Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell. Gowing attempted to negotiate better conditions at the University of Kent that would allow more time to work on the books, but this was denied. She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science, the first of its kind in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in history or science. Gowing was based at Linacre College. Her appointment, Roy MacLeod wrote, \\"struck a conspicuous blow for modern, as against medieval and early modern, science, and for a reading of history that favoured social, economic and political perspectives, as against the examination of scientific practice.\\" She delivered her inaugural lecture, What's Science to History or History to Science?, on 27 May 1975. In this lecture, she examined the reasons why the history of science had grown apart from other forms of history, and endeavoured to reconcile them and bring them together again. In her subsequent Wilkins Lecture in 1976 she examined the history of British prejudice against science dating back to Victorian times. The two-volume opus, Independence and Deterrence: Britain and Atomic Energy 1945‚Äì52, finally appeared in 1974. The publication of her books brought accolades. Gowing was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1975, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1981. She received honorary doctorates in literature from the University of Leeds in 1976, the University of Leicester in 1982, and Manchester in 1985, and in science from the University of Bath in 1987. When she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1988 under the provisions of Statute 12 of its Charter, which allowed for the election of non-scientists who had made distinguished contributions to science, she became only the third person to become a Fellow of both the British Academy and the Royal Society, after Sir Karl Popper and Joseph Needham. Gowing never got around to writing a planned sequel to Independence and Deterrence that would take the story up 1958, when the nuclear Special Relationship between Britain and the United States resumed. Arnold would later write three books to fill in this gap. In the 1980s, Gowing served as a trustee of the Science Museum, London, and the Imperial War Museum but, remembering her own childhood, she resigned from the latter in protest at the introduction of entry fees. She was also a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1978 to 1992. She began suffering from what was most likely Alzheimer's disease, and retired from Oxford in 1986, two years before the official retirement age. Although she had worked in the Civil Service and Academia for 45 years, only 27 of them counted, so she was not eligible for a full pension; her son Nik supported her. She died at Kingston Hospital in Kingston upon Thames on 7 November 1998. An archive of her papers is held by the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, presented by her in 1991, with additions on her death.

A feasibility study for the project was completed in 2002 with a projected cost of $450 million.Bridge and Approaches Over Calcasieu River - Retrieved 2013-04-16 Rating As an indication of the bridge rating, a zero means that a bridge is closed. The rating of 1 is not used. The rating for the Calcasieu River Bridge has dropped significantly from 1992 to 2010. The 1992 report listed the deck condition as poor (4 out of 9), the superstructure condition as fair, with a 5 out of 9, an evaluation of structurally deficient, and a sufficiency rating of 40.9. In 2010, the deck condition was 4 out of 9 (the same), the superstructure condition was rated as serious (3 out of 9), the substructure condition was rated as serious (3 out of 9), and a sufficiency rating of 9.9 was assigned. These ratings evidence is a drastic drop in all but one area. The majority of heavy traffic SD bridges have a sufficiency rating of 50 or better.Uglybridges.com;National Bridge Inventory data - Retrieved 2013-04-16 The I-35W Mississippi River bridge had a sufficiency rating of 50 in 2005, was listed again as \\"structurally deficient\\" and in possible need of replacement, and had ongoing repairs to include overlay, lighting, and guardrails, before falling in August 2007. A contributing factor has been attributed to the extra weight caused by the construction. Because of the severe substandard rating, the speed limit has been dropped to 50 mph and heavy trucks have been limited to the right lane on the bridge. This actually causes truck traffic to have to contend with merging ramp traffic from both ways, but particularly the east-bound ramp that merges at the foot of the bridge, creating a bottleneck. With the extreme height of the bridge, trucks speeds drop considerably to as low as 20 mph, creating a steady bumper to bumper congested traffic flow across the entire bridge at times, adding a substantial amount of weight on the bridge. Traffic congestion There are several causes of traffic congestion on the bridge including; a bottle neck caused from three lanes of traffic dropping to two in the busy corridor, an estimated traffic of 55,000 vehicles a day, sharp curves on the east side of the bridge in Lake Charles with reduced speed limits, a narrow bridge. The bridge is listed as currently being 6,617 feet (1 1/4 mile) length with a finished grade of 152.10\\" elevation. The east grade is 3.8% (listed in 1982 as 3.78% both ways) and the west grade is 3.8% and 5% 600' from the crest. There are no shoulders, no turn-around in case of accidents, and an exposed elevated walk-way on either side that also contributes to the bridge being obsolete.2002 Report p.31- Retrieved 10-1-2015 Repairs In June 2011, the Louisiana DOTD began a $5.7 million repair project (State Proj.

These contributing factors rank the bridge as \\"a dangerous bridge\\" and 7th in the nation in need of replacing.Dangerous bridges- Retrieved 10-1-2015 Bridge concepts Four different concepts are being considered for a new bridge. *Concept A: Would be a new eight lane bridge including an auxiliary lane in both directions. The center of the bridge would be 170 feet north of the center of the current bridge and would require the existing bridge to be removed. The frontage roads would merge onto the bridge and be one-way. *Concept B: Would be a new six lane bridge with two lane service roads on each side built on the outside or the same structure. This concept includes removing the existing bridge and would be for two-way traffic on the frontage roads. *Concept C: Would be a new six lane bridge similar to concept B but with the frontage roads on separate structures. This would also require the removal of the existing bridge. This concept would be more invasive to the environment requiring three bridges to be built and would be for two-way frontage roads. *Concept D: This would be a new six lane bridge with the existing bridge to be rehabilitated and used for the frontage roads. This is the only concept that would require the existing bridge to remain and has some preference because the old bridge has historical significance and is a candidate for historical classification. This design would be for one-way frontage roads. A disadvantage to this concept would be invasion on the beach property and is considered one decision on a particular bridge (considered in 2002) has still not been determined and this has been pushed off until 2016. The preliminary report, subject to change and updating, shows that all the concepts and alternates have common features, calling for steel box girders for the main spans, four spans at 200', 270', 270', and 200', u-turn on the east end, improving the I-10 profile at abandoned railroad, modifying the existing ramps on the east end of the bridge for westbound traffic and eastbound exit at I-10 and US 90 (east), center-line alignment 3 (or similar), bridge profile 2, and the Ryan street ramp construction. Four alternates, that use two of the four bridge concepts, differ depending on if one-way or two-way service roads are chosen. Alternate 1 shows a preference for bridge concept A. Alternate 2 shows a preference for bridge concept C with continuous service roads across the bridge. All the bridge profiles use models with a 95' finished grade elevation, 57.10' lower than the current bridge, and a vertical clearance of 73' that is 62' lower than the current bridge. All bridge models show a 3% grade on the west side. The east side would be 3% for bridge profile 1, with 2.25% for profile 2, and 1.65% for profile 3.I-10 Calcasieu River Bridge and Approaches report p. 30- Retrieved 10-2-2015 References Category:Buildings and structures in Lake Charles, Louisiana Category:Interstate 10 Category:Road bridges in Louisiana Category:Bridges on the Interstate Highway System Category:Bridges completed in 1952 Category:Metal bridges in the United States ","title":"Calcasieu River Bridge"},{"id":"12726003","text":"The Sandside Chase (The Chase of Sandside, The Chase of Sansett; in Gaelic, Ruoig-Hansett, Ruaig Handside or Ruaig-Shansaid) was a Scottish clan battle which took place in 1437 in Caithness, about west of Thurso. The Clan Mackay launched a raid from Strathnaver towards Thurso until they encountered resistance from the locals at Dounreay. The Mackays then pulled back to Sandside, where they were joined by reinforcements and slaughtered the defenders on the coast north of Reay. Background Neil Wasse MacKay, son of Angus Dow MacKay, chief of Clan MacKay had been imprisoned on the Bass Rock by King James I of Scotland in 1427 for his part in the Battle of Harpsdale, which took place in 1426. Neil Wasse MacKay was released from the Bass Rock in 1436 and the following year raided Caithness in a repeat of the Battle of Harpsdale eleven years before. Battle The MacKays met the Caithness men at Dounreay () and pushed them to the Forss Water before Caithness reinforcements made them retreat to Sandside ().

The better to provide against an assault, they placed a reserve about the border beyond Drimholisten, (Prospect-hill) to be ready to assist, if necessary. Neil and John were overtaken by a great company of Caithness-men at Downreay, when a fierce conflict ensued; but at length the latter fled, and were pursued with slaughter about four miles to the water of Forss, where Niel and John saw a fresh company marching with speed down the hill of Forss, to assist their flying countrymen. The MacKays then retired back as far as Sanside, before their opponents got up with them, and by that time they were joined by their reserve. A most desperate engagement followed, which terminated in the defeat and flight of the Caithness-men, who were pursued with considerable slaughter as far as Downreay, about three miles.

The practice of taking photographs and the opening of the first photo studios in Spanish Philippines, from the 1840s to the 1890s, were driven by the following reasons: photographs were used as a medium of news and information about the colony, as a tool for tourism, as an instrument for anthropology, as a means for asserting social status, as an implement for historical documentation, as a device for communication, as materials for propaganda, and as a source of ideas for illustrations and engravings. The practice of photography in the Philippines was not without the influence and influx of Western-art concepts into the colonized archipelago.Guardiola, Juan.

Commercial photography The beginnings of photography in the Philippines date back to the 1840s with two preserved daguerreotypes, one of Intramuros, Manila showing a flag and a portrait of the photographer himself named W. W. Wood. Although known as the oldest preserved photographs of the Philippines, their exact date remains unclear.Juan Guardiola, The Colonial Imaginary, pg 212 The first written record of the employ of photography in the Philippines, however, was mentioned in an 1843 book written by a Spaniard traveler, diplomat and poet, Sinibaldo de Mas. It is believed that de Mas used a daguerreotype camera in 1841. The use of photography became more common in Manila and the rest of the Philippines from the year 1860 onwards. Although it is believed that the first photography studios were opened in the Philippines in the 1850s, the first known actively operational photo studio was that of the British photographer Albert Honnis. Recognized as a resident photographer in the Philippines since 1865 through the 1870s, Honnis was a popular producer of commercial ‚Äúvisiting cards‚Äù and ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù picture portraits. Honnis‚Äô assignment as a commissioned photographer of the Russell & Sturgis Company, a prominent sugar-cane corporation of the time, enabled him to compile panoramic photographs of Spanish Manila and the Pasig River (Vistas de Manila, or Views of Manila). Other pioneers of the photography business in the Philippines ‚Äì apart from Sinibaldo de Mas and W. W. Wood ‚Äì were a Dutch photographer named Francisco van Camp, Manuel Maidin, Pedro Pic√≥n, a German photographer named Enrique Sch√ºren, C. Bonif√°s, E. M. Barretto, Francisco Pertierra, Manuel Arias Rodriquez, L. Gonz√°lez, and an American photographer named Dean Conant Worcester. Landscape photography The first evidence of the use of photography in the Philippine panorama as the basis for illustrations in printed publications, such as magazines and travel guides, was in the 1875 book by Fedor Jagor. Translated into Spanish, Jagor's Reisen in den Philippinen, it was considered as one of the best travel books. It recounted his travels to the Philippines in 1859 and in 1860. News, history and nature through cameras The execution by firing squad of Jos√© Rizal, December 30, 1896. This photograph (Fusilamiento de Jos√© Rizal) was taken by Manuel Arias Rodriguez, a Spanish creole. =Provincial and missionary life= Everyday life of early Filipinos and foreign missionaries were epitomized in the Provincia de Cagayan (Cagayan Province), an album lodged at Madrid's Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a (National Museum of Anthropology). The album, believed to have been published between 1874 and 1880, documented 19th century tobacco farming methods in Luzon. There were also photographs depicting local customs, pastimes and traditions. Despite the difficulty in imposing Spanish dominion over Islamic Mindanao, Spaniards were able to produce the albums Recuerdos de Mindanao (Memories of Mindanao) and the 1892 Vistas de las poblaciones de Cottabato, Rio Grande de Mindanao, Jol√≥, Liangan, Monungam,‚Ä¶ y de tipos indigenas, asi como de tropas espa√±olas en Filipinas (Views of the towns of Cotabato, River Grande in Mindanao, Jolo, Liangan, Monungam, and of indigenous types, as well as of Spanish troops in the Philippines). These pictures were able to illustrate Mindanao landscapes, sultanate settlements, and the living situations of Filipino Muslims and Spanish soldiers and missionaries. =Natural disasters= Photography in 19th century Philippines also preserved visual records of the callous living conditions in the tropics. The existence of cameras and photographers, both professionals and amateurs, confirmed the reality of natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, floods, typhoons and tornadoes in the Philippines. The aftermath of an 1863 earthquake was witnessed and recorded by Martinez H√©bert, a photographer of the Spanish Royal Household, while the devastation caused by the seismic activities that occurred on July 14, 18, 20 and 22, 1880 were captured by the lenses of the Dutch photographer Francisco Van Camp. =Industrialization= Status of public works in the Philippines were catalogued in the 1887 album, Obras del Puerto de Manila (Works of Manila Harbor) and in an 1896 book published by the Board of Manila Harbor. Operational and under-construction lighthouses spanning the years 1889-1893 in the Philippines were also catalogued in the Obras p√∫blicas: Faros (Public Works: Lighthouses) by Madrid's Archive of the Royal Palace. =Relationship to anthropology= The invention of photographs lessened the need for anthropologists to travel to places such as the Philippines for the sake of their work. Photographs became one of the important secondary sources of anthropologists for their case studies. However, despite of the advantage, this photography business also created the tendency of photographers and the anthropologist themselves to manipulate their pictures and subjects such as employing staged scenes for scientific ends. Another accompanying problem of this ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù would be the installation of stereotype human beings into the psyche of Western scientific groups. And also the tendency to produce ‚Äúvoyeuristic‚Äù specimens as evidenced by the great number of native women with exposed upper bodies. First Filipino photographer One of the first photographers of Filipino nationality was F√©lix Laureano. His pictorial compositions, such as En el ba√±o (In the Bathroom) and Cuadrilleros (Laborers), focused on human forms, cockfights and bullfights in the Philippines. He also became the first photographer to publish a book of photographs about the Philippines (Recuerdos de Filipinas, or Memories of the Philippines) in Barcelona in 1895. Laureano was also regarded as ‚Äúthe first Filipino artist to consciously use photography as a medium for art‚Äù. American era An 1899 photograph of Filipino military officers. The Thomasites After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Philippines was ceded to the United States. Photographing the Philippines was continued by Americans, such as soldiers and the Thomasites. One Thomasite who took pictures of early twentieth century Philippines was Philinda Rand. During her tenure as an English-language teacher in the Philippines, Rand took photographs that show many aspects of Filipino life in Silay and Lingayen where she resided. Her pictures included people, students, missionaries, buildings, animals, and sceneries from 1901 to 1907.Anglemyer, Philinda Parsons Rand, 1876-1972.

From 1900 to 1914, the American expeditioners became fascinated with Filipino hill tribes known as the Igorots, a native group that composed an eight of the Filipino population at the time. The trend of photography in the Philippines during the American era was to present colonial or imperial superiority and to differentiate racial status, skin hue, body size, cultural context, dress codes and dressing habits compared to American ways and physical features. An example was the head hunting practice of the Igorots, a tribal practice engaged in by these tribes to settle social conflicts through individual revenge rather than mass warfare, which was sensationalized in American- produced images of skulls.\\"Lesser Breeds\\": America Encounters Filipino Hill Tribes, digicoll.library.wisc.edu In relation to the mode of dressing, American colonialists used the amount of garments worn by tribal Filipinos as an indicator of levels of Philippine social development.In Their Own Image: Filipinos as They Saw Themselves, digicoll.library.wisc.edu to show skull shapes.An American \\"Raj\\": The Philippines as Stage for Colonial Grandeur, digicoll.library.wisc.edu The Filipino tribespeople were also presented as domestic servants and as human exhibits.Filipinos at the St. Louis World's Fair, 1904, digicoll.library.wisc.edu The 1900s also became the source of some of the first pornographic and erotic pictures of Filipino women, such as the nude photographs of Philippine tribal women produced by Dean Conant Worcester, an American photographer and former Secretary of the Interior of the colonial government of the United States. =Filipino-centered photography= Filipinos during the American era who were given the opportunity to ‚Äúcontrol their appearance‚Äù in front of cameras of formal picture-taking studios presented a ‚Äúmedia persona‚Äù that was distinguishably different from what were presented in images taken by Americans who have scientific and anthropological aims. During these personal and formal photographic moments, Filipino women were able to demonstrate female ‚Äúvirtue and refinement‚Äù by being garbed in fashionable and ‚Äúreligious‚Äù garments of the time; while the Igorot people were given that chance to show off their status and prestige by standing straight, firm, and wearing their tribal coats and hand-held canes. Filipino life, culture, and identity through images Smoking the Family Cigar, an early photograph of a Filipino family living in Northern Luzon. Photograph taken by James David Givens and published by Hicks-Judd Company in 1912. This picture could have been taken earlier than 1912. As a tool for presenting Philippine culture and identity, photography revealed that Filipinos during the Spanish period and American colonialism had a distinct society of their own. During the late 1800s, both elite Spanish and Filipino members of Philippine society employed photographs as recorders of social lifestyle. Before American colonialism took hold of the Philippine Islands, an American photographer shot photos of the people and life in the City of Manila in 1886. Without the influence of American colonialistic attitude, the photographer was able to record the actual and uncontrolled street life of Filipino people living in the city, including cleanly dressed vendors with ‚Äúreligious necklaces‚Äù and a young Filipino lad collecting water from a public pump. The photographer's images presented Filipinos exuding natural grace and self-confidence in front of his camera, without any sign of being intimidated by the photograph taker's technological instrument.\\"White Man's Burden\\": Uplifting Filipinos Through Education and Without Empire: American Views of Filipinos Before Colonial Rule, digicoll.library.wisc.edu In the 1930s, photography was incorporated it by Filipinos to become an ‚Äúindigenized‚Äù part of Philippine culture and society. Examples of this cultural incorporation include photographing of weddings, wakes, portraits of Filipino beauty pageant queens, politicians, cult leaders, and popular Philippine sceneries and panorama. From 1935 to 1941 ‚Äì the Philippine Commonwealth period ‚Äì Filipino politicians utilized photography as a means for propaganda and election agenda. Later on, the boom in Philippine photography, resulted to photographic albums bound and collected by Filipino families that preserved recorded baptisms, school life, family reunions, social gatherings and outings, marriages, wedding anniversaries, wakes, and funerals. For them, photography has become a tool for preserving familial genealogy and societal history, recorded imageries that are handed down continuously from one generation to another. The Filipinos developed their own unique character of posing in front of the camera. Because they are sensitive and self-conscious to how they should present and portray themselves through photographs, Filipino individuals or groups are not passive posers. Photographically, they are able to project a ‚Äúcertain style (‚Ä¶) or aspect‚Äù of themselves. In viewing images, Filipinos find ‚Äúlayers of meaning about the (‚Ä¶) character and persona‚Äù of the subject, or subjects, caught in the photograph.

Wolf Hilbertz July 2005 Youth and schooling Wolf Hilbertz was born in G√ºtersloh, (Germany) in 1938, the first child of Rudolf Hilbertz (1909‚Äì1995) and Erna Hilbertz, n√©e Uslat (1906‚Äì2008). His parents had quite different personalities; whereas his father was artistic and inventive, thinking up one of the first electric razors, his mother had a more down to earth, practical approach. While his father would have liked to become an artist, circumstances forced him to start working in a bank, whereas his mother enjoyed her occupation, channeling her forceful personality into her job as a school teacher. After Wolf Hilbertz was born, the family moved to √öst√≠ nad Labem / Aussig in the Czech Republic. When World War II began, his father volunteered for the Wehrmacht and became a member of the Brandenburger special forces. Wolf's sister Uta was born in 1940. His father was badly wounded in Greece in 1944 and fled from the Red Army with his family towards the west in 1945. As war refugees, he and his family settled in Detmold, Germany in 1946. He attended the Gymnasium (secondary school) there, which he didn't complete. This would normally have precluded his attending a German university. However, after completing his compulsory military service, he went to Berlin in 1959 and signed up for a high school equivalency entrance exam. He was one of the very few to earn a \\"pass\\". Thus he was able to attend the Hochschule der K√ºnste Berlin, the Berlin University of the Arts, where he studied architecture. He married in 1961 in Berlin and, upon earning his architecture diploma in 1965, immigrated to New York City with his family in July of that year. 1966 he moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he earned his Masters of Architecture at the University of Michigan in 1967. Professional career Hilbertz worked in architects' offices in Berlin, New York, and Detroit. His first teaching position was in 1967 as an Assistant Professor at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Together with Phil Harding, he was able to achieve that an independent Architecture Department was set up. After several years there, he conceived and published the concept of Cybertecture.Hilbertz, W. H, \\"Toward Cybertecture\\",Progressive Architecture, May 1970 In 1970 he was taken onto the faculty of the School of Architecture at the University of Texas along with several other highly innovative new faculty by then-Dean Alan Y. Taniguchi (1969‚Äì1972). At the University of Texas, he founded the Responsive Environments Laboratory, where he and his students developed and extended his thinking about the automated creation of the built environment. Within a very few years, he was tenured as a full professor for his work. After several years, the focus of the lab shifted to the construction of underwater structures by a method not unlike that used by living corals.Hilbertz, W. H, et al., \\"Electrodeposition of Minerals in Sea Water: Experiments and Applications\\", IEEE, Journal of Oceanic Engineering, Vol. 4, No. 3, pp. 94‚Äì113, July 1979 The material produced has since become commonly known as seacrete or Biorock. Hilbertz' work was influenced by and influenced the work of such notables as Nicholas Negroponte. His academic affiliations as an environmental educator and researcher included Southern University, McGill University, the University of the Arts Bremen, and The University of Texas, where he also held an appointment as Sr. Research Scientist in Marine Sciences. He founded the Symbiotic Processes Laboratory (UT). Hilbertz formed and directed The Marine Resources Co., was a co-founder and Director of Biorock Inc., Vice President of Research of the Global Coral Reef Alliance, and founder and President of Sun & Sea e.V., a non-profit NGO. He published extensively on his R & D and lectured widely in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, conducting hands-on workshops. His work has been exhibited on several continents. He authored several US and international patents, the most environmentally important one together with Dr. Thomas Goreau. In 1998 he and Thomas Goreau were awarded the Theodore M. Sperry Award for Pioneers and Innovators, the top award of the Society for Ecological Restoration. Hilbertz laid down the foundation for the discipline of Cybertecture, emergent all- encompassing evolutionary environmental systems, and invented/developed the mineral accretion process in seawater. The development of Biorock Technology evolved from Goreau / Hilbertz cooperation in Jamaica. The duo publicly introduced the notion and basic framework of a new profession: Seascape Architecture, a younger sister of the venerable design discipline aptly named Landscape Architecture. Installing, maintaining, and monitoring projects in many countries together with his partner of twenty years, Tom Goreau, and with the help of a host of dedicated associates, students, and volunteers, Hilbertz designed and implemented seascaping projects focusing on coral conservation / fish habitat, mariculture, and erosion control. Whenever possible, this was done with direct local government or community involvement and participation. Production of building materials and components, metals, minerals and gases from seawater, direct or indirect solar energy conversion, sustainable brine use and model seacology artificial/natural islands like the Autopia Saya Project in the Indian Ocean initiated in 1997, are ongoing projects and concerns, continuing after his death. His work is being continued by his longtime partner Dr. Thomas Goreau.  Death and family  After suffering what were initially diagnosed as stomach problems in the spring and summer of 2007, he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer at the end of July. He died August 11, 2007 in Munich. He was survived by his mother (‚Ä† 2008), sister, his wife and two ex-wives, and five children; two sons and three daughters. The urn with his ashes was buried at the cemetery \\"St√§dtischer Friedhof Wilmersdorf\\" in Berlin.

It is located between The Wrekin and Wellington, in the Telford & Wrekin borough. It is regarded as an internationally important geological site, which is part of The Wrekin and The Ercall Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The hill is managed by Shropshire Wildlife Trust. The site includes 540 million year old ripple beds and ancient pre-Cambrian lava flows in exposed quarries. Quartzite from the neighbouring Wrekin is also visible. The Ercall bears the marks of extensive quarrying, although the quarries are now disused, safe and open to the public. When the M54 motorway was constructed in 1974, the road was built through the northern end of the hill. Flora and fauna The woods of the forest are important for various butterfly species. In the summer, the Ercall Woods which line the hill are a favourite habitat for the speckled wood and during spring when the forest is laden with bluebells, the dingy skipper can arrive in great numbers. The exposed quarries are popular with other butterfly species, including the green hairstreak and wall, which like to bask in sheltered spots. On the upper slopes of the hill tall oak trees predominate. Acidic soils support such plants as bilberry, climbing corydalis and heath bedstraw. The green woodpecker is also present in the woods. Access The hill is accessed in much the same way as The Wrekin nearby; exit the M54 motorway at J7 (last exit) or the last junction of the A5 from Shrewsbury before it becomes the M54. From there The Wrekin is signposted; follow this road until you reach The Wrekin, then follow the sign for the Buckatree Hotel. There is a small car park across the road from this pub/hotel, and the entrance is clearly visible. Geology The Ercall Quarries are a SSSI and therefore care needs to be exercised when investigating this area. Upon entering the quarry from the main entrance near The Wrekin one encounters an old quarry with many distinctive geological features evident. This is the first quarry that is apparent in the Ercall, it comprises Uriconian Volcanic deposits of Precambrian age. Such volcanic deposits are noted to have been bimodal and potentially intraplate possibly induced by (and therefore close to a) subduction zone and possibly in an island arc setting.P. J. Brenchley, P. F. Rawson The Geology of England and Wales, 2006, 2nd Ed The flow banding and fine to medium grained appearance of the deposit suggests a fairly rapid cooling event and appears to have been deposited in a submerged environment. In all likelihood, during such events the depositional environment would fluctuate between submarine and subaerial as sea-floor levels will have fluctuated as well as eustatic sea-levels.W. Compston, A. E. Wright, P. Toghill, Dating the Late Precambrian volcanicity of England and Wales, Journal of the Geological Society 2002; v.159; pp 323‚Äì339 On the right had side of the picture (running vertical) a dark grey doleritic dyke is evident. The dyke trends at approximately 65 degrees. Dolerite is intrusive and is relative to basalt (extrusive). There is a significant alteration about the contact between the two rocks. The dolerite dyke was emplaced into the Uriconian Rhyolite. The rhyolitic rocks themselves are representative of explosive volcanic centres to the west of this site and beyond the Church Stretton lineament. There is a clear distinction between the tuffaceous rocks of the Uriconican Volcanics (dark brown/black/grey) and the intrusive granophyre which is pink. The relationship between the Ercall Granophyre and the Uriconian is also clearly evident as the Granophyre intrudes the Volcanic rocks and is therefore younger. The Ercall Granophyre is overlain by shallow dipping Cambrian rocks (in relation to the steeply dipping Uriconian volcanics) which contain Atdabanian fossils. The Granophyre is dated at 560+/-1Ma and is thought to be related to the volcanic events in the area.Tucker, R.D. & Pharaoh, T.C., U-Pb Zircon ages for Late Precambrian ‚Äì early Palaeozoic plate tectonics evolution of England and Wales, Journal of the Geological Society of London 1991; v.148; pp435-443 The thermal expansion of the area is likely to have assisted the formation of a sedimentary basin in which such volcaniclastic sediments accrued and were later folded. This has given rise to the steeply dipping sequences exposed at places such as the Forest Glen car park. The folding event is thought to be contemporaneous with uplift and a date of 526+/-28Ma has been put forward for this.

Yakutat tended seaplanes in combat areas in the Pacific during the latter stages of World War II. After the war, she was in commission in the United States Coast Guard from 1948 to 1971 as the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Yakutat (WAVP-380), later WHEC-380, seeing service in the Vietnam War during her Coast Guard career. Transferred to South Vietnam in 1971, she was commissioned into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t (HQ-03). When South Vietnam collapsed in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, she fled to the Philippines, where the Philippine Navy took custody of her and cannibalized her for spare parts until discarding her in 1982.  Construction and commissioning  Yakutat (AVP-32) was laid down on 1 April 1942 at Seattle, Washington by Associated Shipbuilders, Inc. She was launched on 2 July 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Peter Barber, a mother who had lost three sons when the battleship was sunk on 7 December 1941 in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and was commissioned on 31 March 1944 with Commander George K. Fraser in command.  United States Navy service = World War II  After her shakedown in the San Diego, area, Yakutat got underway on 25 May 1942 and arrived at San Pedro, California, late on 26 May 1944. Following post-shakedown availability in the West Coast Shipbuilders' yard at San Pedro, she departed for Pearl Harbor on 17 June 1944. Yakutat reached Ford Island at Pearl Harbor on 24 June 1944. Underway again at 07:00 hours on 28 June 1944, she headed for the Marshall Islands as an escort for escort aircraft carrier . Arriving at Kwajalein on 6 July 1944, she shifted to Eniwetok within a week, where she embarked officers and enlisted men of a patrol service unit and took on board a cargo of 5-inch (127 mm) illuminating ammunition. She departed for Saipan on 14 July 1944. = Saipan and Pelelieu = Reaching recently secured Tanapag Harbor on 17 July 1944, Yakutat began setting up a seaplane base there and immediately commenced servicing seaplanes, providing subsistence and quarters for the aviators and aircrews attached to those aircraft. She provided the aircraft with gasoline and lubricating oil via bowser fueling boats and commenced servicing planes by the over-the-stern method as well. Yakutat remained at Tanapag Harbor for the rest of July, all of August, and into September 1944. After shifting to the Garapan anchorage on Saipan on 8 September 1944, she transferred all plane personnel to the seaplane tender and sailed for the Palau Islands on 12 September 1944. In company with the seaplane tenders , , , and , Yakutat reached Kossol Passage on 16 September 1944, the day after the initial American landings on Pelelieu. Proceeding to the seaplane operation area via a \\"comparatively well-marked channel\\" and \\"while sweeping operations went on continuously\\" nearby, Yakutat soon commenced laying out a seaplane anchorage. The following day, Yakutat serviced the first plane of Patrol Bomber Squadron 216 (VPB-216), furnishing aviation fuel and boat service. With nine Martin PBM Mariner flying boats operational, VPB-216 was based on Yakutat, conducting long-range patrols and Anti-submarine warfare sweeps daily. During that time, Yakutat also served as secondary fighter director unit and experienced air alerts on six occasions. Japanese planes remained in the vicinity for varying lengths of time and occasionally dropped bombs in the lagoon area. Yakutat serviced the VPB-216 planes into early November 1944. On 9 November 1944, she got underway for Ulithi Atoll and arrived there on 10 November 1944. Yakutat tended planes there from 13 November 1944 to 26 November 1944 before she underwent a drydocking for a routine bottom cleaning and hull repairs. She then sailed for Guam on 29 November 1944. = Saipan operations = Reaching Apra Harbor, Guam, on 30 November 1944, Yakutat loaded spare parts for Martin PBM Mariner flying boats before she got underway on 2 December 1944 to return to Saipan. She arrived later the same day, completed the discharge of her cargo on 4 December 1944 and, on 5 December 1944, took on board 13 officers and 30 enlisted men of VPB-216 for temporary subsistence. Yakutat tended planes of Patrol Bomber Squadron 16 (VPB-16) and Patrol Bomber Squadron 17 (VPB-17) at Saipan through mid-January 1945. She departed Tanapag Harbor on the morning of 17 January 1945, steamed independently for Guam, and reached her destination later that day. However, she remained there only a short time, for she departed on 19 January 1945 for the Palau Islands and reached Kossol Roads on 21 January 1945. Yakutat discharged cargo there and fueled seaplanes until 6 February 1945, when she sailed in company with the seaplane tender , escorted by the patrol craft USS PC-1130, bound for the Caroline Islands. Anchoring at Ulithi Atoll on 7 February 1945, Yakutat tended seaplanes there for most of February 1945. Highlighting her brief stay there was her going to the vicinity of a crashed Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplane on 10 February 1945. After salvaging equipment from the plane, Yakutat sank the plane with gunfire and returned to her anchorage in the seaplane operating area. On 25 February 1944, Yakutat sailed for the Mariana Islands in company with St. George and reached Garapan harbor on 27 February 1945. She tended seaplanes there for a little less than a month before departing for Okinawa on 23 March 1945 to take part in Operation Iceberg, the conquest of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Islands. = Supporting Operation Iceberg = Yakutat tended the PBM Mariners of Patrol Bomber Squadron 27 (VPB-27) for the rest of World War II. She established seadrome operations at Kerama Retto on 28 March 1945 and spent the rest of the important Okinawa campaign in seaplane tending duties. The presence of Japanese aircraft in the vicinity on numerous occasions meant many hours spent at general quarters stations, lookouts' eyes and radar alert for any sign of approaching enemy planes. Yakutat provided quarters and subsistence for the crews of the Mariners and furnished the planes with gasoline, lubricating oil, and jet-assisted take-off (JATO) units. The Mariners conducted antisubmarine and air-sea rescue (\\"Dumbo\\") duties locally, as well as offensive patrols that ranged as far as the coast of Korea. Although Yakutat received a dispatch on 21 June 1945 to the effect that all \\"organized resistance on Okinawa has ceased,\\" her routine remained busy. On 28 June 1945, for example, a Consolidated PB2Y Coronado flying boat crashed on take-off and sank approximately 500 yards (457 m) off the starboard beam of the ship. Yakutat dispatched two boats to the scene and rescued eight men, while boats from another ship rescued the remaining three survivors from the Coronado. All eleven men were brought on board Yakutat, where they were examined and returned to their squadron, Patrol Bomber Squadron 13 (VPB-13). On 15 July 1945, Yakutat sailed for Chimu Bay, Okinawa in company with the seaplane tenders , Chandeleur, Onslow, , and but returned to port due to a typhoon in the vicinity. However, she got underway again on 16 July 1945 and reached Chimu Bay the same day. She remained there, tending seaplanes, largely anchored but occasionally moving to open water to be free to maneuver when typhoons swirled by. On one occasion, while returning to Chimu Bay after a typhoon evacuation, Yakutat made sonar contact on a suspected submarine on 3 August 1945. She made one attack, dropping depth charges from her stern- mounted depth-charge tracks, but lost the contact soon thereafter. Yakutat was at Chimu Bay when Japan capitulated and hostilities ended on 15 August 1945, bringing World War II to a close. With the officers and enlisted men of the crew assembled aft, Yakutats commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander W. I. Darnell, led his crew in offering thanks to God \\"for being kept afloat to see the final day of this war.\\" = Honors and awards = Yakutat earned four battle stars for her World War II service.  Post-World War II  Although V-J Day meant that offensive operations against the Japanese ceased, it only meant the beginning of the long occupation of Japan and its possessions. Yakutat remained at Chimu Bay for the rest of August and for most of September 1945, before she departed for Japanese home waters on 20 September 1945, escorting St. George. En route, the two seaplane tenders caught up with Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Unit 56.4.3, formed around the battleships and , and became units of Task Force 56, and later, when redesignated, as Task Force 51. Yakutat reached Wakanoura Wan, Honsh≈´, on 22 September 1945, finding seaplane tender already there and operating as a tender for seaplanes. Yakutat underwent a brief availability alongside destroyer tender before she commenced her seaplane tending operations at Wakanoura Wan. She operated as a tender for seaplanes using that port until 12 October 1945, when she shifted to Hiro Wan, where she performed seaplane tender operations and seadrome control duties for a little over a month. Underway on 14 November 1945, Yakutat arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 15 November 1945, stayed there until 19 November 1945. On 19 November 1945, Yakutat departed Sasebo for the United States with 58 officers and 141 enlisted men embarked as passengers. After stopping at Midway Atoll for fuel on 27 November 1945, she continued on, bound for the Pacific Northwest.  Decommissioning  Reaching Port Townsend, Washington, on 6 December 1945, Yakutat transferred all her passengers to landing craft infantry USS LCI-957 for further transportation, then shifted to Sinclair Inlet, Washington, where she offloaded all bombs and ammunition before reporting on 7 December 1945 to the Bremerton Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Bremerton, Washington. Yakutat subsequently shifted south to the naval air station at Alameda, California, where she was decommissioned on 29 July 1946.  United States Coast Guard service  USCGC Yakutat (WHEC-380), ex-WAVP-380, in 1969.Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability. The Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The Navy loaned Yakutat to the Coast Guard on 31 August 1948. In September 1948, she was towed to the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California, where she underwent conversion for service as a weather-reporting ship. The Coast Guard commissioned her as USCGC Yakutat (WAVP-380) at San Francisco on 23 November 1948.  North Atlantic operations 1949‚Äì1967  Proceeding from San Francisco via the Panama Canal and Kingston, Jamaica, Yakutat eventually commenced ocean station patrol duties in the North Atlantic Ocean, based at Portland, Maine, in late January 1949. Her primary duty was to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and she engaged in law enforcement operations. Yakutat shifted her home port to New Bedford, Massachusetts, later in 1949, and operated out of New Bedford until 1971, continuing her ocean station patrols. Periodically, she conducted naval refresher training in company with U.S. Navy ships out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In February 1952, Yakutat proceeded to the scene of an unusual maritime disaster that occurred off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Two commercial tankers ‚Äì SS Fort Mercer and SS Pendleton ‚Äì each broke in two and sank almost simultaneously. Yakutat, as the ship in tactical command of the rescue efforts, consequently picked up men from both ships and directed the rescue efforts of other participating vessels in the vicinity. Members of her crew were awarded one gold and five silver Lifesaving Medals for their achievements in this rescue operation.

On 14 September 1953, Yakutat performed emergency repairs by constructing a concrete bulkhead aboard and pumping the bilges of the Spanish merchant ship Marte, which had a large hole at the waterline, about southeast of Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, Canada. In the autumn of 1955, Yakutat assisted the Portuguese fishing vessel Jose Alberto. Yakutat assisted the damaged Liberian merchant ship Bordabere south of Cape Race, Newfoundland, between 27 April 1965 and 3 May 1965. Yakutats crew shored up Bordabere, pumped out seawater that had flooded her, and escorted her to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In late November 1965, Yakutat assisted the American merchant ships American Pilot and Maumee Sun after they collided west of the Cape Cod Canal. Yakutat was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-380 on 1 May 1966. On 26 September 1966, her Navy loan to the Coast Guard came to an end and she was transferred permanently from the Navy to the Coast Guard.  Vietnam War service 1967‚Äì1968  USCGC Yakutat (WHEC-380) during her Vietnam War service.In 1967, Yakutat was assigned to Coast Guard Squadron Three, which was designated Task Unit 70.8.6. The squadron was activated at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 24 April 1967 when its commander, Captain John E. Day, hoisted his pennant aboard his flagship, the Coast Guard cutter . Coast Guard Squadron Three was tasked to operate, in conjunction with U.S. Navy forces, in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of North Vietnamese arms and munitions traffic along the coastline of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The squadron's other Vietnam War duties included fire support for ground forces, resupplying Coast Guard and Navy patrol boats, and search-and-rescue operations. Serving in the squadron with Gresham and Yakutat were the cutters , and ; like Yakutat and Gresham, they all were former Navy Barnegat-class ships. They departed Pearl Harbor on 26 April 1967 and reported to Commander, United States Seventh Fleet, for Market Time duty on 4 May 1967. They were joined by Navy radar picket destroyer escorts (DERs) of Escort Squadrons 5 and 7. The ten Market Time ships arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 10 May 1967. The five Coast Guard cutters and five Navy destroyer escorts continuously manned four Market Time stations off Vietnam, while only Navy warships served on two Taiwan patrol stations. One ship rotated duty as the station ship in Hong Kong. Yakutat remained in the Western Pacific until 1 January 1968, then returned to the United States. = Honors and awards = Yakutat earned two campaign stars during this Vietnam War tour, for: *Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase II 31 May 1967 *Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase III 1 July 1967 ‚Äì 18 December 1967  North Atlantic service 1968‚Äì1970  Yakutat returned to her routine North Atlantic duties out of New Bedford in 1968. On 28 February 1969 she suffered minor damage when the fishing vessel Seafreeze Atlantic collided with her while docking at New Bedford.  Vietnam War service 1970  In 1970, Yakutat was reassigned to Coast Guard Squadron Three for a second tour of duty in Vietnam, and resumed her Operation Market Time duties on 17 May 1970. She completed her tour on 31 December 1970. = Honors and awards = Yakutat earned two more campaign stars during this Vietnam War tour, for: *Sanctuary Counteroffensive 10 June 1970 ‚Äì 30 June 1970 *Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase VII 1 July 1970 ‚Äì 6 July 1970, 16 July 1970 to 19 July 1970, 30 July 1970 ‚Äì 7 August 1970, 17 August 1970 ‚Äì 22 August 1970, 24 August 1970 ‚Äì 28 August 1970, 27 October 1970 ‚Äì 6 November 1970, and 22 November 1970 ‚Äì 1 January 1971  Other awards  Yakutat also received a Navy Unit Commendation and a Meritorious Unit Commendation during her Coast Guard career.  Decommissioning  The Coast Guard decommissioned Yakutat on 1 January 1971 in South Vietnam and transferred her to the U.S. Navy.  Republic of Vietnam Navy service  After her antisubmarine warfare equipment had been removed, the U.S. Navy transferred Yakutat to South Vietnam on 10 January 1971, and she was commissioned into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t (HQ-03). By mid-1972, six other former Casco- class cutters had joined her in South Vietnamese service, and they were known as the s. They were the largest warships in the South Vietnamese inventory, and their 5-inch (127-millimeter) guns were South Vietnam's largest naval guns. Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t and her sisters fought alongside U.S. Navy ships during the final years of the Vietnam War, patrolling the South Vietnamese coast and providing gunfire support to South Vietnamese forces ashore. When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in late April 1975, Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t became a ship without a country. She fled to Subic Bay in the Philippines, packed with South Vietnamese refugees. On 22 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t and five of her sister ships, which also had fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: \\"These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition. Below decks generally would compare with a garbage scow.\\"  Acquisition for spare parts by the Philippines  The United States formally transferred Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t to the Philippines on 5 April 1976. She did not enter Philippine Navy service; instead she and her sister ship were cannibalized for spare parts to allow the Philippines to keep four other sister ships in commission in the Philippine Navy, in which they were known as the s. The former Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t was discarded in 1982 and probably scrapped.

Abgar the Great was most remembered for his alleged conversion to Christianity in about 200 CE and the declaration of Christianity as the official religion of the city at that time. It has been suggested that a cross shown on the tiara of Abgar VIII in coins he minted have Christian meaning. Osrhoene was a client state of the Roman Empire in this era, Prior to Abgar VIII, in , the Roman military had reinstated Abgar VII, and they continued to have a significant presence in the region. However, Abgar VIII's behavior indicates that he was not wholly loyal to Rome nor was closely monitored by Rome. While Abgar VIII's coins bear the image of the Roman Emperor Commodus, Abgar's goals were to maintain a degree of independence and to extend his influence geographically as much as possible without disturbing the greater powers of Rome and Parthia. Abgar VIII supported Pescennius Niger as Roman Emperor in , who was swiftly challenged and deposed by the Emperor Septimius Severus. Abgar VIII's submission to Septimus Severus is portrayed on the Arch of Severus in Rome. He was not deposed, but Osrhoene was made a Roman province and Abgar's kingdom was reduced to a rump state containing just the city of Edessa. Abgar was fully reconciled with Septimus Severus and was later received with honor as a guest of Septimus Severus in Rome. In an additional display of loyalty, Abgar VIII took Severus' name as his own. Christianity spread in Edessa significantly during Abgar VIII's reign. The Chronicle of Edessa () reports that a Christian church building in Edessa was damaged in a flood in November . The Christian philosopher Bardaisan lived in Abgar VIII's court. Upon his death in 212 CE, Abgar the Great was succeeded by his son Abgar IX surnamed Severus in contemporary Roman fashion. Though Abgar Severus was summoned with his son to Rome in 213 CE and murdered at the orders of Caracalla. A year later Caracalla ended the independence of Osroene and incorporated it as a province into Roman Empire.

It is the successor to their earlier System 11 hardware (High Speed, Pin*Bot, Black Knight 2000). It was succeeded by Williams/Midway's Pinball 2000 platform, before Williams left the pinball business in October 1999. FunHouse (designed by Pat Lawlor) was the first production game to use WPC, although there are prototype Dr. Dude machines that use WPC.

The original version is sometimes referred to as WPC-89. The WPC MPU remained the same through all generation up to the addition of the security chip in WPC-S, and then the subsequent WPC-95 board. The variations are as follows: WPC (Alphanumeric) *FunHouse - September 1990 *Harley-Davidson - February 1991 *The Machine: Bride of Pin¬∑Bot - February 1991 Some Dr. Dude machines were also made using this WPC generation, although most were made using the later System 11 board.

The history of Arabs in Afghanistan spans over one millennium, from the 11th century Islamic conquest when Arabs arrived with their Islamic mission until recently when others from the Arab world arrived to defend fellow Muslims from the Soviet Union followed by NATO forces. Most of the early Arabs gradually lost their Arabic hegemony and ultimately mixed with the local population, though they are still considered a cognizably distinct ethnic group according to the Constitution of Afghanistan and the Afghan National Anthem. Afghans who carry Sayed or Quraishi in their names usually claim Arab ancestry. First wave Names of territories during the Caliphate The Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque in Kabul At the end of the 7th century, the Umayyad Arabs entered into the area now known as Afghanistan after decisively defeating the Sassanid Empire in Nihawand. Following this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid Emperor, Yazdegerd III, who became a hunted fugitive, fled eastward deep into Central Asia. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the route the Arabs selected to enter the area was from north-eastern Iran and thereafter into Herat where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward eastern Afghanistan. Some Arabs settled in these new areas and married locals while adopting new customs. Other groups and contingents who elected not to settle gradually pushed eastwards but encountered resistance in areas surrounding Bamiyan.Culture and Customs of Afghanistan By Hafizullah Emadi, pg.27 When ultimately arriving at Kabul, the Arabs confronted the Kabul Shahan who had built a long defensive wall around the city. The bloodiest war in Kabul was in Chahardihi area where still tombs of Arabs killed in that war exist in DarulAman area. The most famous Arab character killed in that war was Shah-do Shamshira, whose tomb is located near Kabul river in Asmayee st. One of the most famous Commanders who fought against Arab invaders is known as Mazangi. Mazangi was in command at the battle of Asmayee (Kohi-Sherdarwaza) where Shah- Do Shamshira was killed. There is a number sights where Arab invaders fought in Kabul, but the bloodiest battle after Asmayee was the battle of Alwoden in the area known as Darul Aman today. The historical details of this battle remains largely unknown, though the Arabs were nonetheless subdued in the long term. Despite the lack of much written accounts, another famous archaeological legacy of this battle remains standing in Kabul, notably the tomb of the Shah-e Do Shamshira (translated into, The leader with the Two Swords in Persian) next to the Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque. The site, located near Kabul's market district, was built near the area where an Arab commander died. Following the Arab confrontation, the region was made part of Khorasan with its seat of power in Herat in the west. The Arabs later partially relinquished some of their territorial control though reasserted its authority approximately 50 years later in 750 when the Abbasid caliphs replaced the Ummayads.Afghanistan In A Nutshell By Amanda Roraback, pg. 9 By then, many Arabs increasingly blended with locals as the Arabic identity in the region began to undergo a significant change. Arab contingents settled throughout various parts of present-day Afghanistan including the Wardak, Logar, Kabul, Balkh and in the Sulaiman Mountains. Over time they adopted local customs and languages, some became Persianized while others became Afghanized who followed Pashtunwali. It was during the reign of the Ya'qub Saffari that Arabic began losing its influence in the region. Nevertheless, the Arabs attempted to re- exert their influence in the area by supporting the Samanid rulers of Balkh who in return, assisted the Abbasid Arabs against the defiant Saffarid dynasty. Despite maintaining some clothing customs and attire,Arabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 182 most the early Afghan-Arabs (or Arab-Afghans) gradually lost their original tongue of Arabic. This is confirmed in the 15th century work, Baburnama, which notes that the Arabs of Afghanistan have virtually lost the Arabic language and instead speak Persian and Pashto language. Although the exact number of Arab-Afghans remains unknown, mostly due to ambiguous claims of descent, an 18th-century academic estimated that they number at approximately 60,000 families. Second wave After the Bolshevik Revolution, many Sunni Arabs residing in Bukhara and other areas of Central Asia ruled by Russians migrated to Afghanistan where they were better able to practice their religion without fear of religious persecution or discrimination. One estimate indicated that approximately 30,000 Arabs lived in Bukhara during the mid-nineteenth century.An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires By James Stuart Olson, pg. 38 The Arabs who entered into Afghanistan during this time still retained some ArabicArabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 183 in contrast to the Afghan Arabs who came during the first wave. Some Arabs from the second wave intermarried with the local population as they adopted the languages of northern Afghanistan, namely Uzbek, Turkmen, and Persian language.Arabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 184 Many settled in Kunduz, Takhar and Sar-e Pol provinces. Currently, while they still view themselves as Arab, all the Arabs from the second wave have, like those from the original wave, lost their language of Arabic, adopting Persian instead. Although some tribal names, including Qureshi and Shaiboni are still remembered,Islamic peoples of the Soviet Union, by Shirin Akiner, pg. 367 most of the Arabs view genealogies as unimportant. Many of these Afghan Arabs work in the agricultural industry, often growing cotton and wheat while others raise karakul sheep. According to an academic, the Central Asian Arabs have not had any contact with Middle Eastern Arabs since the time of Tamerlane (circa 1400). The main body of the Afghan Arabs are found in Shibarghan provinces. Afghan Arabs, however, are presently all Dari-speaking and have been in their collective memories. However, they claim an Arab identity. There are other such Persian-speaking \\"Arabs\\" to the east, between Shebergan, Mazar-i Sharif, Kholm and Kunduz living in pockets. Their self-identification as Arabs is largely based on their tribal identity and may in fact point to the 7th and 8th centuries migration to this and other Central Asian locales of many Arab tribes from Arabia in the wake of the Islamic conquests of the region.Barfield (1982), p. ? Third wave During the 1980s Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, many Arab Muslims arrived and volunteered to help Afghans fight Soviet Union. Some of these remained after the Soviets withdrew from the country and were granted citizenship. Others intermarried with local Afghans while some arrived with their families to Afghanistan. Kandahar is home to a small Arab cemetery where over 70 graves belong to Arab al-Qaeda functionaries who were killed as a result of the U.S. War on Terror. These Arabs are revered by the Taliban and the Salafist sympathizers as shahid (martyrs). Regional groups=Balkh Around 900 families live in Khoshal Abad and Yakhdan villages of Dawlat Abad district of the province, the villagers can trace their lineage back to the third caliphate of Uthman, in the 7th century. These families are mainly engaged in agriculture and carpet weaving. Most Arabs in Balkh Province, speak in Arabic as their mother tongue, and Dari as a second language. While some of the older generation had never learned to speak either of Afghanistan's two official languages, Dari and Pashto, many of the younger generation were being taught Dari in school and forgetting their Arabic; about 40 percent can no longer speak Arabic. Many of their customs have been forgotten, or are no longer relevant to a younger generation that identifies more with Afghanistan. Arabs who settled in northern Balkh province are worried that their culture is being wiped out as more people adopt the language and traditions of Afghanistan. Arabs form the smaller minorities in the town and district of Kholm; many identify themselves as ethnic Arabs although no one actually speaks Arabic. Jowzjan There are about 1,000 families living in Hassanabad of Shebarghan, capital of Jowzjan province, and in Sultan Arigh village of Aqcha district that identify themselves as Arabs.Bakhtar News None, however, has spoken Arabic in their collective memory, with Dari forming their native language.

Pushkin wrote the story in autumn 1833 in Boldino,Binyon, Pushkin: A Biography, p. 424. and it was first published in the literary magazine in March 1834.Binyon, Pushkin: A Biography, p. 444. The story was the basis of the operas The Queen of Spades (1890) by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, (1850) by Fromental Hal√©vy and (1864) by Franz von Supp√©The Operatic Pushkin. (the overture to the Supp√© work is all that remains in today's repertoire). It has been filmed numerous times. Plot summary Obukhov Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Hermann is committed at the story's conclusion Hermann, an ethnic German, is an officer of the engineers in the Imperial Russian Army. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in France, she lost a fortune at faro, and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious Count of St. Germain. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret. The countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed. Hermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace‚Äîbut when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the Queen of Spades, rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \\"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\\"  Inspiration  The character of the old countess was inspired by Princess Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna, who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \\"The Queen of Spades\\". According to legend, Galitzine had been a successful gambler. When her grandson lost a considerable amount of money playing cards and came to her to beg her for money, Galitzine instead revealed to him the secret three cards that Count Saint-Germain showed to her in Paris. However, while the Countess died in the story, Galitzine outlived Pushkin and reached the age of 97. Critics have argued that the Count Saint-Germain holds historical importance in the story. Saint-Germain serves as the namesake for the story's protagonist, Hermann. Beyond this, the historical Saint-Germain may represent a father figure for Hermann, the antithesis to Hermann's character, or a former love interest of the countess who seeks revenge for her death by causing Hermann to pick the wrong cards. The card game of faro also plays an important role in Pushkin's story. The game is played by having a player bet on a winning card. The dealer then begins turning over cards, burning the first (known as \\"soda\\") to his left. The second card is placed face up to his right; this is the first winning card. The third card is placed face up in the left pile, as a losing card. The dealer continues turning over cards, alternating piles until the bet has been won or lost.  Themes = Reality vs. the supernatural  Graffiti in Kharkiv, 2008 According to Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Pushkin‚Äôs tale represents ‚Äúthe pinnacle of the art of the fantastic‚Äù. While readers may think that the vision of the Countess that appears to Hermann was merely an apparition, at the end of the story, Pushkin has still given no definitive answer. Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text. These critics focus on three elements: the origin of the three, seven and ace; whether Hermann could have identified the cards without the ghost‚Äôs intervention, and possible explanations for Hermann‚Äôs mistake with the last card. Different critics have presented contradicting supernatural or rational views of Hermann‚Äôs final mistake. The critic Gary Rosenshield claims that, by making the wrong choice of cards, Hermann actually did the right thing: as a man obsessed with gambling, having won the money would have meant that he could never gamble again, and therefore would have never again lived. Other critics with rational explanations, such as Nathan Rosen and Viktor Vonogradov, claim that Hermann may have simply seen a likeness between the Countess who gave him the secret and the Queen card, leading him to make a mistake. This explanation focuses on Pushkin‚Äôs quote in the story that ‚ÄúTwo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two bodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world.‚Äù Here, Hermann cannot separate the actual cards from the Countess who reveals them to him, leading him to accidentally choose the queen instead of an ace. In contrast to these rational explanations, other critics claim that Hermann entered the world of the supernatural and that the card actually changed after Hermann had picked it. These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta‚Äîa concession he had made to acquire the secret‚Äîher ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann‚Äôs downfall.  Storytelling  Pushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \\"telling stories\\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances. It is as if he is set within a story told by others, and feels inspired to write his own. A reading of The Queen of Spades holds that the story reveals the Russian stereotype of the German, one who is cold and calculating person bent on accumulating wealth.  Avarice  Rosenshield describes Pushkin‚Äôs Queen of Spades as an ‚Äúeternal tale of gambling and avarice‚Äù.Gregg, Richard. ‚ÄúGermann the Confessor and the Stony, Seated Countess: The Moral Subtext of Pushkin's 'the Queen of Spades'‚Äù. The Slavonic and East European Review 78.4 (2000): 612‚Äì624. In the story, Hermann becomes obsessed by gambling, even before the Countess grants him her secret to the cards. According to critic Nathan Rosen, Hermann‚Äôs fatal mistake at the end of the story constitutes an act of self-punishment: Hermann punishes himself for the avarice of his corrupted soul.Rosen, Nathan. \\"The Magic Cards in the Queen of Spades\\". The Slavic and East European Journal 19.3 (1975): 255‚Äì275. Beyond this greed in the form of his gambling obsession, Hermann‚Äôs avarice manifests itself in his dealings with Lizavyeta and the Countess. From the moment when he first sets eye on her, Hermann manipulates Lizaveta and her ‚Äúinjured innocence‚Äù to gain access to the Countess and the gambling secrets she holds; however, Hermann‚Äôs ‚Äúdepravity becomes fully manifest in the climactic bedroom scene‚Äù when he trespasses into the Countess‚Äô room and causes her death.Rosenshield, Gary. Pushkin and the Genres of Madness: The Masterpieces of 1833. Madison, WI: U of Wisconsin, 2003. Print.  Style  Pushkin uses metapoetic moments throughout the story to question the reliability of the narrator and to discern the genre of the work. These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann‚Äôs encounter with the countess‚Äô ghostly form. After her departure, Hermann immediately writes down his vision, recording it on paper and writing a small story within the larger story of The Queen of Spades. A second example is when Tomsky and his grandmother talk about traditional plot lines within a Russian novel, of which his grandmother denies the existence.  Adaptations  One of the most notable adaptations of The Queen of Spades was a film produced by Anatole de Grunwald completed in 1949. This film is recognized for its fidelity to the original story with few differences such as the depiction of the backstory about how the Countess acquired the secret of the three winning cards. This film was directed by Thorold Dickinson. It received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the BAFTA award for Best British Film. Pushkin's story has been adapted numerous times into multiple mediums. These include: * An 1864 German operetta by Franz von Suppe * An 1890 opera by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky * A 1910 Russian silent short film directed by Pyotr Chardynin * A 1916 Russian silent film directed by Yakov Protazanov * A 1927 German silent film * The 1949 film The Queen of Spades produced by Anatole de Grunwald * A 1960 Soviet film directed by Roman Tikhomirov * A 1982 Soviet film by Igor Maslennikov The story has also been adapted for radio, including: * The 9 November 1947 episode of Mystery in the Air, starring Peter Lorre as Hermann. * A 1997 BBC Radio 4 adaptation for the Afternoon Drama series, with Greg Wise and Amanda Root.

Afghan militants mounted an assault on a forward operating base in Helmand province near the town of Lashkar Gah, which had been opened only six weeks earlier and was staffed by 100 ANA soldiers and their American trainers, using small arms fire, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars. While eight Afghan soldiers were killed in the initial assault, an American soldier was killed and another wounded, a Canadian soldier was killed and three more wounded, and another Afghan soldier was wounded following a friendly fire incident in which an American soldier manning a Humvee-mounted 7.62mm gun fired on their positions. Convoy attacked The fighting began when the militants attacked an Afghan National Army re-supply convoy on Highway 611 near FOB Robinson, killing two soldiers. Although the locally contracted convoy was unknown to Coalition troops prior to its reporting of contact with insurgents, two British Harrier aircraft were dispatched from Kandahar Airfield, along with a pair of American Boeing AH-64 Apache gunships. After the militants were scattered two hours after the fighting began, the convoy was hit a short distance later by an improvised explosive device along the roadside, killing six soldiers, and was stranded 9‚Äì13 miles from the base. At approximately 10:00 p.m., a Quick Reaction Force, made up of 38 men comprising 7 Platoon of C Company of 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, was deployed from the airfield in American helicopters, to escort the convoy back to its base. Base attacked Four hours later, with the convoy and Canadian escort now resting in the base, the American forces conducted a defensive patrol and determined that \\"there's no way they'll hit us tonight\\", referring to their belief that the 80-vehicle convoy and new troop presence would deter the insurgents. The militants resurfaced in the hills to the west of the base, the ruins of a mud house to the north, and the poppy fields to the south, and began firing their AK-47s and RPGs. American Sergeant John T. Stone was shot in the torso, possibly by friendly fire. The first Canadian to die in combat in the war, Private Robert Costall was laying down cover fire with his C-9 from beneath a small berm together with Chris Fernandez-Ledon. He was shot once through the back of the head, and once in the chest. Master Warrant Officer Ray Brodeur was shot in the leg and the midriff, and two other Canadians were also wounded, as was an American ‚Äì all from a single American Humvee which fired 3‚Äì5 bursts at friendly positions before being ordered to cease fire when it was realised he was firing on friendly forces. American Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers then dropped bombs on the militant positions, bringing their estimated dead to 30, and effectively ending the battle. Aftermath Three separate investigations were launched within a day of the battle, by the American Combined Joint Task Force 76 who ordered a 15-6 investigation, the American Criminal Investigation Detachment and the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service. Canada also launched a board of inquiry, which determined all four Canadians had indeed been shot as a result of friendly fire from an American HMMWV. The two gun barrels from the vehicle were seized by American military investigators as part of a criminal investigation. Following an external examination by Lieutenant Commander Clifford at Kandahar Airfield, Costall's remains were sent back to Canada, where the Chief Coroner of Ontario performed an autopsy on April 2, 2006. The bullets extracted from his body were turned over to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police forensics laboratory in Halifax, and found to be consistent with 7.62 mm rounds. Following the battle, the 1st PPCLI launched \\"a response\\" by moving in to take control of Taliban-controlled poppy fields through Operation Ketara.

Nine firefighters were killed during the final stages of extinguishing a fire on June 17, 1972. The Hotel Vendome was on the southwest corner of the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue and Dartmouth Street, in the Back Bay area of Boston. Background The Vendome was a luxury hotel built in 1871 in Back Bay, just north of Copley Square. A massive expansion was undertaken in 1881 according to plans by architect J. F. Ober and completed in 1882. During the 1960s, the Vendome suffered four small fires. In 1971, the year of the original building's centennial, the Vendome was sold. The new owners opened a restaurant called Cafe Vendome on the first floor, and began renovating the remaining hotel into condominiums and a shopping mall. Fire and collapse  The building was largely empty the afternoon of Saturday June 17, 1972, except for a few people performing renovations. One of the workers discovered that a fire had begun in an enclosed space between the third and fourth floors, and at 2:35 PM rang Box 1571\\\\. A working fire was called in at 2:44 PM, and subsequent alarms were rung at 2:46 PM, 3:02 PM, and 3:06 PM. A total of 16 engine companies, five ladder companies, two aerial towers, and a heavy rescue company responded. The fire was largely under control by 4:30 PM. Several crews, including Boston Fire Department Ladder 13 and Engines 22 and 32, remained on scene performing overhaul and cleanup. At 5:28 PM, abruptly and without warning, all five floors of a section at the southeast corner of the building collapsed, burying Ladder 15 and 17 firefighters beneath a two-story pile of debris. Nine of the firefighters died, making this the worst firefighting disaster in Boston history in terms of loss of life. The men who were killed were: *Firefighter Thomas W. Beckwith * Firefighter Joseph F. Boucher * Lieutenant Thomas J. Carroll * Firefighter Charles E. Dolan * Lieutenant John E. Hanbury Jr. * Firefighter John E. Jameson * Firefighter Richard B. Magee * Firefighter Paul J. Murphy * Firefighter Joseph P. Saniuk Aftermath District Fire Chief John P. Vahey wrote a comprehensive report on the Vendome fire. Although the cause of the original fire was not known, the subsequent collapse was attributed to the failure of an overloaded seven-inch steel column whose support had been weakened when a new duct had been cut beneath it, triggered by the weight of the firefighters and their equipment on the upper floors. On June 17, 1997‚Äîthe 25th anniversary of the Vendome fire‚Äîa monument was dedicated on the Commonwealth Avenue Mall, a few yards from the site of the fire. The monument features a fireman's helmet and coat cast in bronze draped over a low arc of dark granite. An inscription bears the timeline of the fire and the names of the men who died. One faces the site of the fire when reading the names. After the fire, the Vendome was successfully renovated, hosting 110 residential condominium units and 27 commercial units, including a restaurant.

Reid Jr. (October 25, 1878 ‚Äì September 28, 1976) was an American football player and coach of Harvard's football team for the 1901, 1905, and 1906 seasons. Though his goal was to produce winning teams, mounting injuries and intensifying criticism of the game fueled demands for its abolition and pressured Reid into a leadership role in the momentous 1906 rule changes which defused this threat. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970. Early life and playing career Reid was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay area where his father was head of a prep school. When he decided to attend Harvard University, he exhibited such athletic promise that he was actively recruited by both the football and baseball teams. He immediately proved himself to be an outstanding baseball catcher, starting his freshman year and then serving as captain of the university's championship teams his junior and senior years. In football, he started at fullback his sophomore year and scored two touchdowns in Harvard's momentous 1898 victory over Yale, its first since the initial meeting of the teams in 1875. Though injuries constrained his involvement with football over the following two seasons, the Boston Transcript later characterized him, in its account of his wedding, as \\"one of the best athletes that ever came out [of Harvard].\\" Harvard football coach Following his graduation, Reid was appointed student coach of the football team, a long-standing practice whereby early teams selected a graduate player from the previous season to be its coach. Reid's 1901 team went undefeated and crushed Yale 22-0 in its final game. Afterwards, Reid accepted a teaching position at his father's school in order to provide financial support for his wife and family. Ensuing losses, especially ones to Yale, convinced the team and Harvard's Athletic Committee to dispense with student-amateur coaches in 1905 and to raise enough money to hire Reid, making him one of the game's first professional coaches. The conscientiousness with which Reid shouldered these responsibilities is reflected in his lengthy catalogues of notes. He devised both a weight training program and a special meal table. He improved equipment to reduce injuries and devised better treatment for them. He appointed a large staff of assistants so that every position got special instruction. Finally he made a concerted effort to turn his players into good students. Gradual conversion to the cause of reform Reid also crafted his team's schedule so that its initial games were against weak opponents that gained the team easy victories and opportunities for improvement. However, off-field developments soon revealed that the fall of 1905 would not be a normal season. Several articles in major magazines complained about the rising number of injuries, the huge amounts of money pouring into the game, and widespread recruiting abuses. By October, President Theodore Roosevelt was sufficiently concerned about these criticisms that he summoned the coaches of the big three‚ÄîHarvard, Yale, and Princeton‚Äîto a White House discussion of the situation and insisted that they sign an accord \\"to carry out in letter and in spirit the rules of the game.\\" Several weeks later, Reid learned that Charles Elliot, the President of Harvard, was urging his Board of Overseers to abolish football. Deciding that he needed to act, Reid gathered several supporters and drafted a public release to newspapers advocating that current rules of football be radically changed. Reid was hoping that the season's end would quell these complaints and bring him a much needed rest, but it did not. Harvard lost its final game to Yale 6-0, the lone score coming late in the fourth quarter. This devastating loss infused a second quarter incident with a significance a Harvard victory would have trivialized. When a Harvard player fielded a punt, he was immediately hit high and low by two Yale tacklers, and fans attending the Cambridge event thought a penalty should have been called for unnecessary roughness. The Boston Globe exacerbated this belief with a front page photograph of the controversial catch and an accompanying account which editorialized that the hit \\"was certainly an instance of unnecessary roughness,\\" despite its accompanying interview of Paul Dashiell, the head referee, who explained that a fair catch had never been signaled. Also on its front page that same day, the Globe reported that a Union College player had been killed in another game. Path to new rules The overlap of these developments produced a full blown storm. The president of Columbia and his faculty voted to end its football program. The Chancellor of New York University proposed a meeting of representatives from colleges excluded from the big three's Intercollegiate Football Association to discuss the future of football. Meanwhile, Roosevelt summoned Reid to Washington to update him on matters since their previous meeting. The coach informed the President that Walter Camp, the architect of Yale's indomitable teams, opposed change and maintained control over IFA's rule committee via an alliance with Dashiell, who was a prominent member of the rule committee and was then on the faculty of the U.S.Naval Academy. The pair roughed out a strategy whereby Reid would meet with Harvard colleagues to complete a set of new rules and Roosevelt would pressure Dashiell into supporting them. This strategy was successfully implemented at a momentous, unanticipated amalgamation of the IFA and the fledgling alternative, a consolidation which originated today's NCAA. Reid pressured this consolidation by threatening to defect from the IFA to the new organization in order to accomplish substantial rule change. Harvard's Board of Overseers, strongly influenced by President Eliot, supported Reid's agenda with a vote to abolish its football team unless major reform was achieved. Ensuing approval of most of Reid's nineteen proposed changes included establishment of a \\"neutral zone\\" between the offensive and defensive lines. The offense was henceforth required to keep at least six men on the line of scrimmage and to make to make ten yards (rather than five) for a first down. The forward pass was legalized, though this revolutionary modification was delayed by an accompanying penalty for an incompletion. Subsequent career Reid craftily sought to confine his reform agenda to play itself. He especially did not want any alteration to the current eligibility of graduate students because he had been resourcefully capitalizing on Harvard's prestigious graduate schools to recruit older students whom he believed to be superior players. However, without apprising Reid of their intent, administrators from Harvard and Yale forged an agreement which banned graduate students from play. After all his work on behalf of reform, Reid felt betrayed and decided, even before it started, the following season would be his last. He produced another outstanding team that went undefeated until the final game against Yale and again lost 6-0. Afterwards Reid returned to teaching at his father's school. Several years later he moved back to Boston to sell bonds which gained him a lucrative but unfulfilling career.

Since 2005 Ocoee High School has served students from the cities of Ocoee, Apopka, Winter Garden, and Pine Hills. Ocoee High School is currently serving 2,479 students. Mascot The Ocoee High School's mascot is a Knight wearing a gold tunic that bears the image of a rising cardinal. A cardinal was the mascot of the old Ocoee High School which was converted into a middle school in 1975. The knight symbolizes a protector that guards against forces that would cause the school to become dismantled and fold like its predecessor. Campus Ocoee High School is on fifty-two acres near Lake Apopka. It was the largest of nine new schools opening in Orange County in 2005. Before the high school opened, the school board members considered naming the high school Crown Point High, Platinum High or Unity High. The Orange County Public School (OCPS) decided on the name, Ocoee High School, in memory of the old Ocoee High School. Ocoee High School is built on the Smaller Learning Communities Model. This places students in one of the four sub- schools for their core classes. The Ocoee sub-schools are called: Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Each sub-school has two counselors, a dean, and an assistant principal. Each of these smaller schools has approximately 150 students. Ocoee High School is built on this model because research has shown that schools within a school have decreased dropout rates and they experience fewer discipline issues. \\"The idea is to create a small learning community for students,\\" explained former Principal Mike Armbruster. \\"Instead of mingling with 2,700 students, they'll be with 700, so they don't get lost between the cracks.\\" Ocoee High School adopted the smaller learning community model (SCL) as a part of school reform. The school board wanted students to stop getting lost in the crowd. SCL allow students to get to know each other and counselors, who push them to take more-advanced classes. \\"A kid who is connected...is more likely to graduate,\\" said former principal Armbruster.  Agriculture  Ocoee High School has a premier Agriculture education. The Animal Science program is led by Ms. Amy Anderson. Ms. Anderson was the agriculture teacher at Ocoee Middle School until 2017. Mr. Jordan leads the Plant Science portion. Music The foremost program in the Ocoee High School Music Department is the band. The Ocoee High School bands include: the Freshman Band, the Symphonic Band, the Jazz Band, the Percussion Ensemble, the Winter Guard, the Spring Dance Company, the Wind Ensemble, the Marching Band, the Knights Visual Ensemble (dance team and color guard), and the Indoor Percussion Unit. The Marching Band has performed in the Cotton Bowl Music Festival, the Florida Citrus Parade, the Ikea Thanksgiving Parade, multiple Under Armour Football All-American Games that were broadcast on Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN), multiple Macy's Christmas Day Parades at Universal Studios Florida, and the New York City Veteran's Day Parade. The band is also often featured in the Florida Classic Battle Of The Bands. The band staff is headed by director Bernard Hendricks, Jr. The Ocoee High School music program also includes a concert choir, a show choir (Knight Fever), and an advanced show choir (Excalibur) in which is an auditioned group that is similar to Glee, and a newly formed gospel choir, among other organizations. Academics The Class of 2009 had 680 graduates. 54% of students reported that they planned to attend either a two year college or a vocational college, 37% of students reported that they plan on attending a four-year college. Ocoee High School's average score for both the verbal and math sections of the SAT in 2009 was 530, and for the writing section of the SAT, the average score was 500. These scores are below average on both the Florida and national scales. The Sword in the Stone \\"Sword in the Stone\\" trophy is a peer acknowledgement award. The \\"Sword in the Stone\\" concept was suggested by Matt Fitzpatrick, a former teacher at Ocoee High School. Fitzpatrick had seen this concept in action at another school, where they called it \\"You Rock.\\" The \\"Sword in the Stone\\" trophy is a hand sized rock with a small sword in it. It is passed among faculty when a staff member does something special for another staff member. The award is also announced in an email to the entire staff so that everyone knows the reason for the recognition. The recipient holds the trophy for a week before passing it on to the next deserving teacher. For example, Ms. Gillam, a teacher at Ocoee High School, passed the trophy to Ms. Thorpe, because the students that Ms. Gillam received from Ms. Thorpe's class were very well prepared. Ms. Gillam said, \\"they say you can tell the quality of a teacher by the quality of the student, and I can tell that she is a great teacher by the students that she has given to me.\\" Notable people=Students *Cap Capi, football defensive end for Jacksonville Jaguars https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CapiNo00.htm *Grant Riller, college basketball player for Colonial Athletic Association https://www.orangeobserver.com/article/ocoee-high-honors-grant-riller-with- jersey-retirement-ceremony Faculty *Jason Boltus (athletic coach), football quarterback *Buck Gurley (athletic coach), defensive tackle for NFL External links *Ocoee High School References Category:High schools in Orange County, Florida Category:Orange County Public Schools Category:Public high schools in Florida Category:Ocoee, Florida Category:2005 establishments in Florida Category:Educational institutions established in 2005 ","title":"Ocoee High School"},{"id":"12726375","text":"The Valea Caselor (also: Sibi»ôel) is a right tributary of the river Sebe»ô in Romania.

The team was founded in 1999 by the twin brothers Thomas and Johannes Kofler and previously known as Team Volksbank. In 2009, the Austrian federal state of Vorarlberg replaced Volksbank as title sponsor. In 2006 it became the first ever Austrian professional cycling team and was registered as a UCI Professional Continental team until June 2010, when their UCI license was suspended due to financial insecurity. The team was later re-registered as a UCI Continental team, and retained that status in 2011. In 2007, the team received international attention when former German Tour de France-winner Jan Ullrich announced to join the team in an official function after having been suspended by his T-Mobile Team due to his involvement in the Operaci√≥n Puerto doping case. After pressure from the team's sponsors, the plan was discarded. Team Vorarlberg was the first Austrian cycling team to participate in events of the UCI ProTour, the top tier racing league in professional cycling. It did so by receiving a wild card for the 2007 Deutschland Tour, also returning in 2008 with Daniel Musiol winning the mountains classification.

He started his teaching career at the King Edward VI Middle School, of which ultimately he became house master. In 1910, the school was amalgamated with the Higher Grade School and the Presbyterian School to form the City of Norwich School.

Shiva can be recognized by the third eye in the middle of his forehead and by the attribute of the trident. The hands above his head are making the gesture called uttarabodhi mudra, which is regarded as a symbol of perfection. Champa was an Indianised civilization within the Greater India that flourished along the coasts of what is now central and southern Vietnam for roughly a one thousand-year period between 500 and 1500 AD. The original Chams were probably colonists from the Indonesian islands, who adopted as their principal vocations those of trade, shipping, and piracy. Their cities were ports of call on important trade routes linking India, China and the Indonesian islands. The history of Champa was one of intermittent conflict and cooperation with the people of Java, the Khmer of Angkor in Cambodia and the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát of what is now northern Vietnam. It was to the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát that Champa finally lost its independence. The architecture of the Indian rock-cut temples, particularly the sculptures, were widely adopted in South Indian, and Indianised architecture of Cambodian, Annamese (Champa) and Javanese temples. The artistic legacy of Champa consists primarily of sandstone sculptures - both sculpture in the round and relief sculpture - and brick buildings. Some metal statues and decorative items have also survived. Much of the remaining art expresses religious themes, and though some pieces would have been purely decorative, others would have served important functions in the religious life of the Chams, which synthesized elements of Hinduism (especially Saivism), Buddhism and indigenous cults. This artistic legacy has been decimated by neglect, war, and vandalism. Much of the damage has been done in the 20th century. Some French scholars such as Henri Parmentier and Jean Boisselier were able to take photographs, create drawings, and pen descriptions of works which have been destroyed in the meantime. Neglect continues to endanger the legacy of Champa to this day, especially the neglect of the inscribed stone steles, the source of much valuable information on the history of Champa. The participants in the Vietnam War wrought their share of devastation, wiping out for example the vestiges of the Buddhist monastery at Dong Duong (Qu·∫£ng Nam).Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.36. Willful vandalism and pilfering are an ongoing concern. The largest collection of Cham art is on exhibit at the Museum of Cham Sculpture in Da Nang. Substantial collections are housed in the Guimet Museum in Paris, the Museum of Vietnamese History in Saigon, and the Museum of History in Hanoi. Smaller collections may be found in the Museum of Fine Arts in Saigon and the Museum of Fine Arts in Hanoi.  Forms of visual art  The remnants of classical Cham art extant today consist mainly in temples of brick, sandstone sculptures in the round, and sandstone sculptures in high and low relief. A few bronze sculptures and decorative items made of metal remain as well. There are no works of marble or other higher quality stone. Likewise there are no paintings or sketches. The people of Champa wrote, and perhaps also sketched, on leaves, which have not withstood the hot and humid climate of coastal Vietnam. Items made of perishable materials, such as wood, for the most part have not survived.  Metal statues and jewelry  The remaining works of art made of metal include bronze statues of the Mahayanist deities Lokesvara and Tara dated approximately 900 AD and associated with the Buddhist art of Dong Duong. An even older bronze statue of the Buddha bears a strong resemblance to Indian Buddhist statues of the Amaravati style; scholars doubt that it was originally from Champa, surmising instead that it must have come into the country as part of the maritime trade that linked India with Southeast Asia and China.Boisselier, \\"Un Bronze de Tara\\", p.319-320. This Cham kosa, or metal sleeve to be fitted over a linga, is the face of Siva, as can be recognized from the third eye in the center of the forehead and the chignon hairstyle known as jatamukuta. We have abundant textual evidence of much classical Cham art that once existed that has been lost to the ravages of time and the depredations of human vandals, looters, and conquerors. For example, the early 14th-century Chinese historian Ma Duanlin reported the existence of a large statue of the Buddha made of gold and silver; the current whereabouts of this statue are unknown. The Cham kings themselves have left us stone inscriptions describing the gifts of now lost precious objects they made to the shrines and sanctuaries of the realm. Especially noteworthy was the practice of donating decorated metallic sleeves (kosa) and diadems (mukuta) to important lingas and the divinities with which they were affiliated. For example, an inscription on a stone stele dated approximately 1080 and found at M·ªπ S∆°n reports that King Harivarman donated a \\"large, resplendent golden kosa adorned with the most beautiful jewels, more brilliant than the sun, illuminated day and night by the rays of shining gems, decorated by four faces\\" to the deity Srisanabhadresvara, a local embodiment of Siva. A few years later, around 1088, Harivarman may have been outdone by his successor Indravarman, who donated a golden kosa with six faces (facing in the four cardinal directions, toward the Northeast and the Southeast) topped off by a nagaraja (serpent-king) ornament, and decorated with precious gemstones including a ruby, a sapphire, a topaz, and a pearl.Finot, \\"Notes d'Epigraphie: XI. Les inscriptions de My-Son.\\" Neither of these treasures has survived. The written sources, including the Chinese books of history and the Cham inscriptions, also report on some of the catastrophic events, primarily acts of war, that led to the loss of Cham art. In the second quarter of the 5th century AD, according to the historian Ma Duanlin, a Chinese general named Yuen Kan sacked the capital of Champa, making off with many \\"rare and precious objects\\", including \\"tens of thousands of pounds of gold in ingots coming from statues which he had smelted.\\" Similarly, at the beginning of the 7th century a marauding Chinese general named Liu Fang made off with \\"eighteen massive tablets of gold\\" commemorating the 18 previous kings of Champa.Hervey, Ma- Touan-Lin, Volume 2, Chapter entitled \\"Lin-y.\\" The Chinese recognized a succession of Cham states: first Lin-yi (from the late 2nd century to the 8th century), then Huan-wang (from the 8th to the 10th century), and finally Chen- ching (from the 10th century onward). It is to be assumed that in the centuries that followed, frequent raids and conquests by Khmer and Vietnamese armies, which led to the eventual destruction of Champa as an independent political entity, likewise resulted in the removal of any portable works of art, including of course any works made of precious metals.  Temples  Chi√™n ƒê√†n temple in Qu·∫£ng Nam province. The profile of the 13th-century temple Po Klong Garai near Phan Rang includes all the buildings typical of a Cham temple. From left to right one can see the kalan, the attached mandapa, the saddle-shaped kosgrha, and the gopura. D∆∞∆°ng Long Towers in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh, the tallest still-existing Champa temple. Unlike the Khmer of Angkor, who for the most part employed a grey sandstone to construct their religious buildings, the Cham built their temples from reddish bricks. Some of these brick structures can be still be visited in the Vietnamese countryside. The most important remaining sites include M·ªπ S∆°n near Da Nang, ƒê·ªì B√†n near Quy Nh∆°n, Po Nagar near Nha Trang, and Po Klong Garai near Phan Rang. = Buildings constituting a temple = Typically, a Cham temple complex consisted of several different kinds of buildings.Tran Ky Phuong, Vestiges of Champa Civilization. * The kalan was the brick sanctuary, typically in the form of a tower, used to house the deity. * The mandapa was an entry hallway contiguous with a sanctuary. * The kosagrha or \\"fire-house\\" was the construction, typically with a saddle-shaped roof, used to house the valuables belonging to the deity or to cook for the deity. * The gopura was a gate-tower leading into a walled temple complex. These building types are typical for Hindu temples in general; the classification is valid not only for the architecture of Champa, but also for other architectural traditions of Greater India. = Most significant temples = The temple of Po Nagar in Nha Trang. The culturally most important temples of historical Champa were the temple of Bhadresvara located at M·ªπ S∆°n near modern Da Nang, and the temple of the goddess known as Bhagavati (her Hindu name) or Yan Po Nagar (her Cham name) located just outside modern Nha Trang. * The temple of Bhadresvara was the principle religious foundations of northern Champa (known as Campadesa, Campapura or nagara Campa in the inscriptions). Scholars have identified the temple of Bhadresvara, a local incarnation of the universal deity Siva, with the edifice \\"A1\\" at M·ªπ S∆°n. Though today A1 is in the process of devolving into a pile of rubble, it still existed as a magnificent tower when French scholars described it at the beginning of the 20th century.Tran Ky Phuong, Vestiges of Champa Civilization, p.32. * The temple of Yan Po Nagar was the principal religious foundation of southern Champa (or Panduranga, a word that is the basis for the modern name \\"Phan Rang.\\") Its buildings date from between the 8th and 13th centuries. The temple remains standing to this day across the Cai River from Nha Trang, and is in relatively good condition.Tran Ky Phuong, Vestiges of Champa Civilization, p.95 ff.  Sandstone sculptures  A decorative theme that originated in Java, and from there emanated to other parts of Greater India, is that of the makara sea monster disgorging some other being. In this 10th- or 11th-century Cham sculpture, the makara disgorges a naga. The Cham created freestanding sandstone sculptures in the round, as well as high and bas-relief carvings of sandstone. In general, they appear to have preferred sculpting in relief, and they excelled especially at sculpture in high relief. Cham sculpture went through a marked succession of historical styles, the foremost of which produced some of the best works of Southeast Asian art.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.31. The subject-matter of Cham sculpture is drawn mostly from the legends and religion of Indian civilization. Many of the sculptures are representations of particular Hindu and Buddhist deities, most prominently Siva, but also Lokesvara, Visnu, Brahma, Devi, and Shakti. Such sculptures may have served a religious purpose rather than being purely decorative. Any sculpture in the round of an important deity that is completely forward-oriented, not engaged in any particular action, and equipped with symbolic paraphernalia, would have been a candidate for ritual or devotional use. Cham sculptors also created numerous lingas, phallic posts linked symbolically with Siva (if the cross-section is a circle) or with the trimurti (if the post is segmented, consisting of a lower square section symbolic of Brahma, a middle octagonal section symbolic of Visnu, and a top circular section symbolic of Siva). The ritual uses of the linga are familiar from modern Hinduism. This carving of an elephant is found on a pedestal belonging to the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 style. A few of the sculptures in the art of Champa depart from the Indian subject-matter to reveal something of the life of the historical Cham people. An example are the especially well-executed representations of elephants that serve as decorative details in some pieces: from written sources we know that the Cham relied on elephants for military and other purposes, since they lacked a steady supply of horses. Other sculptures reflect the cultural legacy of Greater India and express legendary themes more typical of Javanese or Cambodian art than the art of India. An example of such a theme is the motif of the makara sea-monster, which came to Champa from Java, where it is prominent in the art of the Borobudur and other temples of the same period.  Periods and styles of Cham art  Scholars agree that it is possible to analyze the art of Champa in terms of distinct \\"styles\\" typical for various historical periods and different locations. Several have attempted through their study to set down a classification of historical styles. Perhaps the most influential of these attempts are those of the French scholars Philippe Stern (The Art of Champa (formerly Annam) and its Evolution, 1942) and Jean Boisselier (Statuary of Champa, 1963).Hubert, The Art of Champa, p.39 ff. Summarizing the conclusions of these scholars, art historian Jean-Fran√ßois Hubert has concluded that it is possible to distinguish at least the following styles and sub-styles:Hubert, The Art of Champa, pp.33-34. * M·ªπ S∆°n E1 (7th to 8th century) * Dong Duong (9th to 10th century) * M·ªπ S∆°n A1 (10th century) ** Khuong My (first half of 10th century) ** Tr√† Ki·ªáu (second half of 10th century) ** Chanh Lo (end of 10th century to mid-11th century) * Thap Mam (11th to 14th century) Each style is named after a place in Vietnam at which works exemplative of that style have been found.  M·ªπ S∆°n E1 Style  The ruins at M·ªπ S∆°n are not all of the same style and do not all belong to the same period of Cham history. Scholars have coded the ruins to reflect the diversity of periods and styles. The earliest identifiable style has been dubbed the M·ªπ S∆°n E1 Style. It is named after a particular structure, which scholars refer to as M·ªπ S∆°n E1. Works of this style reflect foreign influence from a variety of sources, primarily from the Khmer of pre-Angkorian Cambodia, but also from the art of Dvaravati, the Javanese art of Indonesia, and of southern India.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.33 ff. Perhaps the most famous work of the M·ªπ S∆°n E1 style is a large sandstone pedestal dated from the second half of the 7th century. Originally, the pedestal had a religious function, and was used to support a huge lingam as a symbol for Siva, the primary deity in Cham religion. The pedestal itself is decorated with relief carvings featuring scenes from the lives of ascetics: ascetics playing various musical instrument, an ascetic preaching to animals, an ascetic receiving a massage. To the Cham, the pedestal symbolized Mount Kailasa, the mythological abode of Siva which also accommodated numerous forest- and cave-dwelling ascetics, just as the lingam it supported represented the god himself.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.50ff.; Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.73. Another important work of the M·ªπ S∆°n E1 style is the unfinished sandstone pediment that was once affixed over the main entrance to the temple at M·ªπ S∆°n E1. The pediment shows the dawn of the present era according to Hindu mythology. Vishnu is reclining at the bottom of the ocean. His bed is Sesha the serpent. A lotus grows upwards from Vishnu's navel, and Brahma emerges from the lotus in order to recreate the universe.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.72. Image:Vishnu Brahma My Son E1.jpgAn unfinished pediment shows the birth of Brahma from a lotus growing from the navel of Vishnu. Image:Musician on pedestal MySonE1.jpgA detail from the M·ªπ S∆°n E1 pedestal shows a flutist playing his instrument. Image:Master and Disciple.jpgAnother detail shows an ascetic holding a flywhisk and giving instruction to a disciple. Image:Male dancer My Son E1 pedestal.jpgThis image of a male dancer is on the riser of a step leading onto the M·ªπ S∆°n E1 pedestal.  Dong Duong Style  In 875, the Cham king Indravarman II founded a new dynasty at Indrapura, in what is now the Qu·∫£ng Nam region of central Vietnam.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.72. Departing from the religious traditions of his predecessors, who were predominantly Shaivists, he founded the Mahayana Buddhist monastery of Dong Duong, and dedicated the central temple to Lokesvara.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.73. The temple complex at Dong Duong having been devastated by bombing during the Vietnam War, our knowledge of its appearance is limited to the photographs and descriptions created by French scholars earlier in the 20th century.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.36 ff. A fair number of sculptures of the period have survived, however, in the museums of Vietnam, and collectively they are known as the works of the Dong Duong Style. The style lasted until well into the 10th century. The Dong Duong style of sculpture has been described as a highly original style of \\"artistic extremism\\", \\"with exaggerated, almost excessively stylized features.\\"Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.40. The figures are characterized by their thick noses and lips and by the fact that they do not smile.Hubert, The Art of Champa, p.43. Prominent motifs include scenes from the life of the Buddha, Buddhist monks, dharmapalas (guardians of the Buddhist law), dvarapalas (armed temple guardians), the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, and the goddess of compassion Tara, who was also regarded as the shakti or spouse of Avalokiteshvara.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.81 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, Cham Sculpture, p.66 ff. Image:DD Dvarapala 00.jpgA sandstone guardian dvarapala is shown stomping on a bull, who in turn disgorges a small warrior.

Image:Th√°p ƒê·ªìng D∆∞∆°ng 2.jpgThe ruins of ƒê·ªìng D∆∞∆°ng (Indrapura)  M·ªπ S∆°n A1 Style  The art of the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 style belongs to the 10th and 11th centuries, a period of Hindu revival following the Buddhist period of Dong Duong, and also a period of renewed influence from Java. This period has been called the \\"golden age\\" of Cham Art.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.41. The style is named after a temple at M·ªπ S∆°n, \\"the most perfect expression of Cham architecture\\" according to art historian Emmanuel Guillon, that fell victim to the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Most of the remaining monuments at M·ªπ S∆°n also belong to the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 style, including most of the constructions of groups B, C, and D.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, M·ªπ S∆°n Relics, p.140-141. As to the sculpture of the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 style, it is known as being light and graceful, in contrast with the more severe style of Dong Duong. According to Guillon, \\"It is an art of dance and movement, of grace, and of faces which sometimes wear a slight, almost ironic style, as though surprised by their own beauty.\\" Indeed, dancers were a favorite motif of the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 sculptors. The style is also known for its fine relief images of real and mythical animals such as elephants, lions and garudas.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.128 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, Cham Sculpture, pp.55 ff. The M·ªπ S∆°n A1 style encompasses not only works of art found at M·ªπ S∆°n, but also works found at Khuong My and Tr√† Ki·ªáu, though the latter are sometimes treated as representing distinct styles. The works of Khuong My in particular are frequently treated as transitional between the styles of Dong Duong and M·ªπ S∆°n A1.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.45, 105 f. Likewise, works found at Chanh Lo are sometimes treated as belonging to the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 style and sometimes treated as transitional between the M·ªπ S∆°n A1 and Thap Mam styles.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.134. = Khuong My Style = In the village of Khuong My in the Vietnamese province of Qu·∫£ng Nam stands a group of three Cham towers dating from the 10th century. The style of the towers and the artwork associated with them is transitional between the powerful style of Dong Duong and the more charming and delicate M·ªπ S∆°n A1 style. The style of Khuong My also exhibits Khmer and Javanese influence.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, Ch.5: \\"Khuong My\\", p.95 ff. = Tr√† Ki·ªáu Style = Although the Cham monuments at Tr√† Ki·ªáu in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province have been destroyed, a number of magnificent pieces of sculpture associated with the site remain and are preserved in museums. Especially noteworthy are a large pedestal serving as a base for a lingam that is known simply as the \\"Tr√† Ki·ªáu Pedestal\\" and another pedestal known as the \\"Dancers' Pedestal.\\"Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.110 ff. The Tr√† Ki·ªáu Pedestal, consisting of a base decorated with friezes in bas relief, an ablutionary cistern, and a massive lingam, is regarded as one of the masterpieces of Cham art. The figures on the friezes are especially beautiful, and represent episodes from the life of Krishna as related in the Bhagavata Purana. At each corner of the pedestal, a leonine atlas appears to support the weight of the structure above him.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.110-116. The Dancers' Pedestal, likewise, is regarded as a masterpiece. The purpose and function of the pedestal, which has the shape of a corner piece, remain obscure. Each side of the corner is graced by a dancing apsara and a music-playing gandharva. The base underneath these figures is adorned with leonine heads and makaras.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.120-127. Image:Dancing Shiva 10th c.jpgThis 10th-century tympanum of the dancing Shiva is transitional between the Dong Duong and Khuong My styles. Image:Tra Kieu Pedestal.jpgThe Tr√† Ki·ªáu pedestal of the 10th century supports a massive lingam and ablutionary cistern. Image:Apsaras on Tra Kieu Pedestal.jpgA row of apsaras, or celestial nymphs, is depicted on the base of the Tr√† Ki·ªáu Pedestal. Image:Apsara Gandharva Dancer Pedestal Tra Kieu.jpgThe Dancers' Pedestal of Tr√† Ki·ªáu features this apsara or dancer and gandharva or musician.  Thap Mam Style  After the 10th century, Cham art went into gradual decline. Both architecture, as exemplified by the temples of Po Nagar and Po Klong Garai, and sculpture became more stereotyped and less original. Only the sculptures of mythical animals, such as the makara or the garuda, could rival their counterparts of the earlier styles.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.54 f. The Thap Mam Style of the 11th through the 14th centuries is named for an archaeological site in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, formerly Vijaya. The sculpture of this style is characterized by \\"a return to hieratic formalism and the simplification of shape, leading to a certain loss of vitality.\\"Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.57. The sculptors seem to have been concerned more with the detail of ornamentation than with the grace and motion of the figures themselves. Indeed, the style has been characterized as \\"baroque\\", in reference to the proliferation of ornamental details that distinguishes it from its more \\"classical\\" predecessors. One of the most original motifs of the Thap Mam period was the sculpting in stone of a row of female breasts around the base of a pedestal. The motif first emerged in the 10th century (the Tr√† Ki·ªáu Pedestal at one point had such a row of breasts) and became characteristic of the Thap Mam Style. It appears to have no counterpart in the art of other Southeast Asian countries.Guillon, Treasures from Champa, p.147 ff. Some scholars have identified this theme with figure of Uroja (\\"breasts\\"), the mythical ancestor of an 11th-century dynasty at M·ªπ S∆°n, and claim a connection between this Uroja and the goddess venerated at Po Nagar.Tran Ky Phuong, Vestiges of Champa Civilization, p.146.

He played seven seasons of Major League Baseball from 1895 to 1904, including three with the Washington Senators. He later worked as a college athletics coach (mostly baseball and basketball) at Yale University, Columbia University, Fordham University, the United States Naval Academy, St. John's University, the University of Baltimore and Trinity College, Hartford. He also held athletic director positions at Fordham and the Naval Academy. In the 1930s, he coached athletic teams at Sing Sing prison in Ossining, New York. Early years Lush was born at Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1873. His father, Charles H. Lush, was a Massachusetts native who worked in a sewing machine factory. At the time of the 1880 United States Census, Lush, at age 7, was living in Bridgeport with his parents, Charles and Annie, and two younger brothers, Walter and George.Census entry for Charles H.

Baseball player Lush played seven seasons of Major League Baseball with the Washington Senators (1895‚Äì1897), Boston Beaneaters (1901‚Äì1902), Detroit Tigers (1903), and Cleveland Naps (1904). He appeared in 489 major league games, including 461 as an outfielder. He had a career batting average of .249 and an on-base percentage of .360 (fueled by 291 walks in 2,096 plate appearances). Lush led the American League with 34 sacrifice hits for the Tigers in 1903. His .379 on-base percentage for the Tigers in 1903 was fourth best in the American League, and his 70 bases on balls was second best in the league. Lush was among the league leaders in walks four times. Lush was also a good fielder in the outfield. In 1902, Lush had 24 assists as the Beaneaters' center fielder, and a range factor of 2.37 (0.44 points higher than the league average). For the Tigers in 1903, Lush had a range factor of 2.42 (0.50 points higher than the league average). Athletic coach After his playing career ended, Lush became a coach of college baseball and college basketball. He held coaching positions at Yale University, Columbia University, Fordham University, the United States Naval Academy, St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, the University of Baltimore and Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. Lush began work as Yale's baseball coach in 1905, with Walter Camp serving as the team's advisory coach. In his first year, Lush led Yale to its first baseball championship in six years. In February 1906, Yale engaged him for a term of three years.(available at newspaperarchive.com) He remained in charge of the Yale baseball team in 1906 and 1907, but he was replaced by Tad Jones in 1908. Yale decided not to retain Lush when the school decided to cease using professional coaches. As Lush had another year remaining on his contract, Yale paid him in full for his services. After separating from Yale, Lush coached the basketball team at the United States Naval Academy in the 1908‚Äì09 season. In February 1909, he was rehired as Yale's baseball coach. He remained the baseball coach at Yale through the 1911 season. He was dropped as Yale's baseball coach in August 1911. In 1912, Lush was hired as the manager of the Montreal professional baseball team. In 1914, Lush coached the baseball team at Columbia. In the middle of the 1915 season, Lush took over as the coach of the baseball team at Fordham University. The team compiled an 8‚Äì2 record under Lush. In September 1915, he was hired as the physical director at Fordham. He assumed responsibility to oversee all branches of athletics at the school, including full responsibility for the baseball and track teams and assistant coaching duties with the football and crew programs. His contract stipulated, however, that he was allowed to coach that New York University basketball team in the winter of 1915‚Äì16. As permitted by his Fordham contract, Lush began coaching the NYU basketball team in November 1915. In July 1916, Lush purchased a fifty percent interest in the baseball club at Bridgeport, Connecticut. He announced at the time that he would serve as the team's manager. In November 1916, he was hired by the Naval Athletic Association to coach the baseball and basketball teams at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. Lush's 1918‚Äì19 basketball team finished the season with a 16‚Äì0 record and was retroactively named the 1918‚Äì19 national champion by the Premo- Porretta Power Poll. In May 1922, Lush resigned his position at the Naval Academy. The press reported there was mutual dissatisfaction between Lush and the Navy Athletic Association.(available at newspaperarchive.com) After leaving the Naval Academy, Lush coached the baseball and basketball teams at St. John's College in Maryland. By 1923, he had been placed in charge of athletics at St. John's. He was the basketball coach at St. John's through the 1926‚Äì27 season. In October 1931, he was appointed as the head basketball coach at the University of Baltimore. Family and later life Lush was married in approximately 1897 to Mary E.

The state of New York intervened with the intention of closing the home and transferring the residents to other facilities outside of Greenwich Village.

(in Italian) was the first modern female Italian advocate. Her disbarring led to a movement to allow women to practice law and hold public office in Italy. Career Born in 1855 in the hamlet of Traverse, Perrero comune, in the Valle Germanasca, she passed her examinations in jurisprudence at the University of Turin, Faculty of Law and received her degree on June 17, 1881. For the following two years, she \\"attended forensic practice\\" in the office of an advocate and assisted at the sessions of the tribunals. She then underwent the theoretical and practical examination of the Order of Advocates of Turin and, approved by 45 of 50 votes, was inscribed in the roll of advocates (albo degli avvocati) on August 9, 1883. However, the inscription of a woman on the roll \\"did not please\\" the office of the attorney general (procuratore generale), who entered a complaint with the Court of Appeal of Turin. Despite rejoinders, arguments, and examples of women advocates in other countries (such as Clara S. Foltz), the attorney general argued that women were forbidden by law and public policy to enter the milizia togata. The Court of Appeal subsequently found that the inscription of Signorina Po√´t was illegal. She then appealed to the Court of Cassation of Turin, but the decision of the court below was confirmed. Debate on women and the legal profession in Italy Public debate ensued, with 25 Italian newspapers supporting women's public roles and only three against. Those against made statements such as that the only men who supported women's public roles were themselves unmarried celibates. A teacher at the University of Padua named Taverni interviewed William Waldorf Astor, and reported that the Minister said, \\"that the public opinion of the Americans was not in favor of the exercise of professions by women, inasmuch as the female physicians, lawyers, etc., practicing in America, do not belong either to the aristocracy of money or to that of intellect.\\" However, Taverni himself favored public lives for women, as it would save the 250,000 unmarriageable Italian women who, if society did not give them a role, would spend their lives as nihilists. All of this aside, the central questions came down to whether a husband would incur liability for his wife's practicing advocacy and whether in the construction of the statutes, the words in the masculine gender were meant to apply to men only. Later life Sources report that, for the rest of her life, Po√´t was active in the international women's movement. Under Law n. 1176 of July 17, 1919, women were allowed to hold certain public offices. A year later, at the age of 65, Po√´t was finally inscribed in the role of advocates in Turin.

Garbage compactors and waste collection vehicles compress waste so that more of it can be stored in the same space. Waste is compacted again, more thoroughly, at the landfill to conserve valuable airspace and to extend the landfill's life span. Consumer and post-collection compaction Pre-landfill waste compaction is often beneficial, both for people disposing of waste and the company collecting it. This is because waste collection companies frequently charge by volume or require use of standard-volume containers, and compaction allows more waste to fit in the same space. Trash compactors are available for both residential and commercial use. Compacting garbage after it is collected allows more waste to fit inside the collection vehicle, meaning fewer trips to a dump or transfer station are required. The collection company also incurs lower landfill fees, if the landfill charges by volume.http://www.sp-industries.com/documents/WasteGuide%2012-09.pdf Landfill compaction Landfill compactor A landfill compaction vehicle has two main functions: to spread the waste evenly in layers over the landfill, and to compact waste to reduce its volume and help stabilize the landfill. Proper waste compacting includes the process of using a steel wheeled/drum landfill compactor to shred, tear and press together various items in the waste stream so they consume a minimal volume of landfill airspace. The higher the compaction rate, the more trash the landfill can receive and store. This will also reduce landslides, cave-ins and minimize the risk of explosions of landfill gas (see landfill gas migration). Main compaction is produced by the landfill compactors steel tooth on the wheel drums. Special teeth can penetrate the waste and deliver a focused compression point, providing compaction and increased density. Ground pressure of the tooth can exceed over (PSI). The design of the machine and more importantly the wheels and the teeth is very critical in compaction. Power transmission from engine to the wheel drums is another key factor in compactors, depending on the application and size of the landfill the correct machine size and configuration should be selected. Advantages and disadvantages of waste compaction Loose, non- compacted trash occupies up to 20 times more dumpster space than compacted waste. Waste hauling (A waste hauler is anyone who hauls waste to a landfill or transfer station) costs are reduced by fewer or smaller dumpsters, and dumpster pickup frequency can be reduced by 50%. A side effect of waste compaction is that important items, like evidence in a crime, may be difficult to recover from the garbage. Due to reduced oxygenation, biodegradation of organic waste is also slowed.

Biography Grossman was born in 1964 in New York, the older of two boys. Both of his parents worked in the optical business‚Äîhis father owned a shop. Grossman attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California, graduating in 1982. He went on to study music theory at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, but dropped out to focus on his music. It was also at Pierce College that he met Dr. Gerald Eskalin, founder of the L.A. Jazz Choir, with whom he performed in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s he performed in the band Iannello, playing with guitarist Joel Shearer and drummer Jimmy Paxson for six years. It was through Shearer that Grossman connected with K's Choice. Shearer had been playing with the band Super 8, which had the same manager as K's Choice. The manager recommended Grossman to the leaders of K's Choice, at a time when they were auditioning for a new bass player. Grossman won the part, and in 1997 toured with K's Choice in support of their album Paradise in Me. He then joined the band full-time, and with them has recorded four gold and platinum records, including Almost Happy and Cocoon Crash. His work with the band included thousands of performances, and many appearances on European television, such as the French program Taratata. He also appeared with the band on a 1999 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, \\"Doppelgangland\\". Grossman currently lives with his wife and children in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2005, Grossman started recording and touring with Sam Bettens (who he has also worked with as a member of K's Choice), and in 2007 he began performing with Javier Mendoza.

Construction, commissioning, and shakedown Shelikof was laid down on 20 September 1942 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington. She was launched on 31 January 1943, sponsored by Mrs. F. D. Wagner, and commissioned on 17 April 1944 with Lieutenant Commander R. E. Stanley in command. Upon completion of fitting out, Shelikof departed for Alameda, California, on 8 May 1944 and loaded aircraft spares. She then moved to San Diego, for shakedown and to San Pedro, California, for a yard period. World War II operations 1944-1945=Eniwetok On 30 June 1944, Shelikof departed San Pedro for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 9 July 1944, she was underway from Pearl Harbor with a convoy bound for Eniwetok. While at Eniwetok from 18 July to 1 August, Shelikof had her aviation machine shop and carpenter shop converted into combination aircraft and aircraft radar maintenance facilities. The Mariana Islands and Ulithi Atoll Shelikofs next port of call was Tanapag Harbor, a former Japanese seaplane base on Saipan. Her personnel went ashore daily to clear debris from the hangars and the surrounding area in order to make the base operable, thereby relieving the congestion at aircraft tenders. When Shelikof departed on 3 December 1944, Naval Air Base Saipan, was being used as a supply depot and a major overhaul facility. Shelikof spent the next three months shuttling spare parts and supplies between Guam, Ulithi Atoll, and Saipan. Supporting the Okinawa invasion Shelikof sailed from Saipan with Task Unit 51.20 on 23 March 1945 for the invasion of the Ryukyu Islands. The seaplane group moved into the anchorage at Kerama Retto on 28 March 1945 as United States Army units were still battling to secure those small rocky islands before the major assault on Okinawa began on 1 April 1945. Shelikof laid eight seaplane mooring buoys on 28 March 1945 and three of them were put into use on 29 March 1945 when the first Martin PBM-5 Mariner flying boats arrived. The anchorage was under constant Japanese air attack during April 1945, but the only casualties aboard Shelikof occurred on 28 April 1945 when friendly fire wounded two men. On 6 May 1945, Shelikof took under fire a Japanese plane which approached within 1,000 yards (915 m), 50 feet (15 m) off the water, but no damage to the plane was noted. The seaplane base was shifted to Chimu Wan, Okinawa, on 15 July 1945 and Shelikof operated there until the end of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945, which brought World War II to a close. Honors and awards Shelikof earned three battle stars for her World War II service. Peacetime service 1945-1947 After the end of the war, Shelikof shuttled between Okinawa and ports in Japan until departing for the United States on 25 October 1945. En route she made port at Midway Atoll; Pearl Harbor; San Diego; Acapulco, Mexico; and Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, before arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 December 1945. After an overhaul, Shelikof departed Norfolk on 12 March 1946 for the Azores. Back in Norfolk on 30 March 1946, she made four voyages to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and two to Trinidad by 11 June 1946. By 14 June 1946, she was at Coco Solo, and she operated from there until 16 March 1947, when she sailed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for inactivation. Shelikof was decommissioned on 30 June 1947 and laid up in reserve in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Second period in commission 1952-1954 Shelikof was recommissioned at Philadelphia on 3 January 1952. She operated along the United States East Coast from her home port at Norfolk for the next two and a half years. Shelikof commenced inactivation in July 1954. She was placed out of commission in reserve in the Texas Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange, Texas, in December 1954. Final decommissioning and disposal Shelikof was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1960. She was sold on 20 December 1960 to Panagiotis Kokkinos of Piraeus, Greece. Greek commercial service Shelikof was converted for commercial service as the Greek passenger ship MV Kypros. She subsequently was renamed MV Myconos in 1964, MV Artemis in 1973, MV Artemis K in 1974, and MV Golden Princess in 1979. Golden Princess sank in a storm at Perama, Greece, while laid up in January 1981.

This type of equipment is used to detect a gas leak or other emissions and can interface with a control system so a process can be automatically shut down. A gas detector can sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity to leave. This type of device is important because there are many gases that can be harmful to organic life, such as humans or animals. Gas detectors can be used to detect combustible, flammable and toxic gases, and oxygen depletion. This type of device is used widely in industry and can be found in locations, such as on oil rigs, to monitor manufacture processes and emerging technologies such as photovoltaic. They may be used in firefighting. Gas leak detection is the process of identifying potentially hazardous gas leaks by sensors. Additionally a visual identification can be done using a thermal camera These sensors usually employ an audible alarm to alert people when a dangerous gas has been detected. Exposure to toxic gases can also occur in operations such as painting, fumigation, fuel filling, construction, excavation of contaminated soils, landfill operations, entering confined spaces, etc. Common sensors include combustible gas sensors, photoionization detectors, infrared point sensors, ultrasonic sensors, electrochemical gas sensors, and metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors (MOS sensors). More recently, infrared imaging sensors have come into use. All of these sensors are used for a wide range of applications and can be found in industrial plants, refineries, pharmaceutical manufacturing, fumigation facilities, paper pulp mills, aircraft and shipbuilding facilities, hazmat operations, waste-water treatment facilities, vehicles, indoor air quality testing and homes.  History  Gas leak detection methods became a concern after the effects of harmful gases on human health were discovered. Before modern electronic sensors, early detection methods relied on less precise detectors. Through the 19th and early 20th centuries, coal miners would bring canaries down to the tunnels with them as an early detection system against life-threatening gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. The canary, normally a very songful bird, would stop singing and eventually die if not removed from these gases, signaling the miners to exit the mine quickly. The first gas detector in the industrial age was the flame safety lamp (or Davy lamp) was invented by Sir Humphry Davy (of England) in 1815 to detect the presence of methane (firedamp) in underground coal mines. The flame safety lamp consisted of an oil flame adjusted to specific height in fresh air. To prevent ignition with the lamps flame was contained within a glass sleeve with a mesh flame arrestor. The flames height varied depending on the presence of methane (higher) or the lack of oxygen (lower). To this day, in certain parts of the world flame safety lamps are still in service. The modern era of gas detection started in 1926‚Äì1927 with the development of the catalytic combustion (LEL) sensor by Dr.Oliver Johnson. Dr Johnson was an employee of Standard Oil Company in California (now Chevron), he began research and development on a method to detect combustible mixtures in air to help prevent explosions in fuel storage tanks. A demonstration model was developed in 1926 and denoted as the Model A. The first practical \\"electric vapor indicator\\" meter begun production in 1927 with the release of the Model B. The world's first gas detection company, Johnson-Williams Instruments (or J-W Instruments) was formed in 1928 in Palo Alto, CA by Dr Oliver Johnston and Phil Williams. J-W Instruments is recognized as the first electronics company in Silicon Valley. Over the next 40 years J-W Instruments pioneered many \\"firsts\\" in the modern age of gas detection, including making instruments smaller and more portable, development of a portable oxygen detector as well as the first combination instrument that could detect both combustible gases/vapors as well as oxygen. Before the development of electronic household carbon monoxide detectors in the 1980s and 1990s, carbon monoxide presence was detected with a chemically infused paper that turned brown when exposed to the gas. Since then, many electronic technologies and devices have been developed to detect, monitor, and alert the leak of a wide array of gases. As the cost and performance of electronic gas sensors improved, they have been incorporated into a wider range of systems. Their use in automobiles was initially for engine emissions control, but now gas sensors may also be used to ensure passenger comfort and safety. Carbon dioxide sensors are being installed into buildings as part of demand-controlled ventilation systems. Sophisticated gas sensor systems are being researched for use in medical diagnostic, monitoring, and treatment systems, well beyond their initial use in operating rooms. Gas monitors and alarms for carbon monoxide and other harmful gases are increasingly available for office and domestic use, and are becoming legally required in some jurisdictions. Originally, detectors were produced to detect a single gas. Modern units may detect several toxic or combustible gases, or even a combination. Newer gas analyzers can break up the component signals from a complex aroma to identify several gases simultaneously. Metal-oxide- semiconductor sensors (MOS sensors) were introduced in the 1990s. The earliest known MOS gas sensor was demonstrated by G. Sberveglieri, G. Faglia, S. Groppelli, P. Nelli and A. Camanzi in 1990. MOS sensors have since become important environmental gas detectors.  Types  Gas detectors can be classified according to the operation mechanism (semiconductors, oxidation, catalytic, photoionization, infrared, etc.). Gas detectors come packaged into two main form factors: portable devices and fixed gas detectors. Portable detectors are used to monitor the atmosphere around personnel and are either hand-held or worn on clothing or on a belt/harness. These gas detectors are usually battery operated. They transmit warnings via audible and visible signals, such as alarms and flashing lights, when dangerous levels of gas vapors are detected. Fixed type gas detectors may be used for detection of one or more gas types. Fixed type detectors are generally mounted near the process area of a plant or control room, or an area to be protected, such as a residential bedroom. Generally, industrial sensors are installed on fixed type mild steel structures and a cable connects the detectors to a SCADA system for continuous monitoring. A tripping interlock can be activated for an emergency situation.  Electrochemical  Electrochemical gas detectors work by allowing gases to diffuse through a porous membrane to an electrode where it is either chemically oxidized or reduced. The amount of current produced is determined by how much of the gas is oxidized at the electrode,Detcon, http://www.detcon.com/electrochemical01.htm indicating the concentration of the gas. Manufactures can customize electrochemical gas detectors by changing the porous barrier to allow for the detection of a certain gas concentration range. Also, since the diffusion barrier is a physical/mechanical barrier, the detector tended to be more stable and reliable over the sensor's duration and thus required less maintenance than other early detector technologies. However, the sensors are subject to corrosive elements or chemical contamination and may last only 1‚Äì2 years before a replacement is required.United States Patent 4141800: Electrochemical gas detector and method of using same, http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4141800.html Electrochemical gas detectors are used in a wide variety of environments such as refineries, gas turbines, chemical plants, underground gas storage facilities, and more.  Catalytic bead (pellistor)  Catalytic bead sensors are commonly used to measure combustible gases that present an explosion hazard when concentrations are between the lower explosion limit (LEL) and upper explosion limit (UEL). Active and reference beads containing platinum wire coils are situated on opposite arms of a Wheatstone bridge circuit and electrically heated, up to a few hundred degrees C. The active bead contains a catalyst that allows combustible compounds to oxidize, thereby heating the bead even further and changing its electrical resistance. The resulting voltage difference between the active and passive beads is proportional to the concentration of all combustible gases and vapors present. The sampled gas enters the sensor through a sintered metal frit, which provides a barrier to prevent an explosion when the instrument is carried into an atmosphere containing combustible gases. Pellistors measure essentially all combustible gases, but they are more sensitive to smaller molecules that diffuse through the sinter more quickly. The measureable concentration ranges are typically from a few hundred ppm to a few volume percent. Such sensors are inexpensive and robust, but require a minimum of a few percent oxygen in the atmosphere to be tested and they can be poisoned or inhibited by compounds such as silicones, mineral acids, chlorinated organic compounds, and sulfur compounds.  Photoionization  Photoionization detectors (PIDs) use a high-photon-energy UV lamp to ionize chemicals in the sampled gas. If the compound has an ionization energy below that of the lamp photons, an electron will be ejected, and the resulting current is proportional to the concentration of the compound. Common lamp photon energies include 10.0 eV, 10.6 eV and 11.7 eV; the standard 10.6 eV lamp lasts for years, while the 11.7 eV lamp typically last only a few months and is used only when no other option is available. A broad range of compounds can be detected at levels ranging from a few ppb to several thousand ppm. Detectable compound classes in order of decreasing sensitivity include: aromatics and alkyl iodides; olefins, sulfur compounds, amines, ketones, ethers, alkyl bromides and silicate esters; organic esters, alcohols, aldehydes and alkanes; H2S, NH3, PH3 and organic acids. There is no response to standard components of air or to mineral acids. Major advantages of PIDs are their excellent sensitivity and simplicity of use; the main limitation is that measurements are not compound-specific. Recently PIDs with pre-filter tubes have been introduced that enhance the specificity for such compounds as benzene or butadiene. Fixed, hand-held and miniature clothing- clipped PIDs are widely used for industrial hygiene, hazmat, and environmental monitoring.  Infrared point  Infrared (IR) point sensors use radiation passing through a known volume of gas; energy from the sensor beam is absorbed at certain wavelengths, depending on the properties of the specific gas. For example, carbon monoxide absorbs wavelengths of about 4.2-4.5 Œºm.Muda, R., 2009 The energy in this wavelength is compared to a wavelength outside of the absorption range; the difference in energy between these two wavelengths is proportional to the concentration of gas present. This type of sensor is advantageous because it does not have to be placed into the gas to detect it and can be used for remote sensing. Infrared point sensors can be used to detect hydrocarbonsInternational Society of Automation, http://www.isa.org/Template.cfm?Section=Communities&template;=/TaggedPage/DetailDisplay.cfm&ContentID;=23377 and other infrared active gases such as water vapor and carbon dioxide. IR sensors are commonly found in waste-water treatment facilities, refineries, gas turbines, chemical plants, and other facilities where flammable gases are present and the possibility of an explosion exists. The remote sensing capability allows large volumes of space to be monitored. Engine emissions are another area where IR sensors are being researched. The sensor would detect high levels of carbon monoxide or other abnormal gases in vehicle exhaust and even be integrated with vehicle electronic systems to notify drivers.  Infrared imaging  Infrared image sensors include active and passive systems. For active sensing, IR imaging sensors typically scan a laser across the field of view of a scene and look for backscattered light at the absorption line wavelength of a specific target gas. Passive IR imaging sensors measure spectral changes at each pixel in an image and look for specific spectral signatures that indicate the presence of target gases. The types of compounds that can be imaged are the same as those that can be detected with infrared point detectors, but the images may be helpful in identifying the source of a gas.  Semiconductor  Semiconductor sensors, also known as metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors (MOS sensors), detect gases by a chemical reaction that takes place when the gas comes in direct contact with the sensor. Tin dioxide is the most common material used in semiconductor sensors,Figaro Sensor, http://www.figarosensor.com/products/general.pdf and the electrical resistance in the sensor is decreased when it comes in contact with the monitored gas. The resistance of the tin dioxide is typically around 50 kŒ© in air but can drop to around 3.5 kŒ© in the presence of 1% methane.Vitz, E., 1995 This change in resistance is used to calculate the gas concentration. Semiconductor sensors are commonly used to detect hydrogen, oxygen, alcohol vapor, and harmful gases such as carbon monoxide.General Monitors, http://www.generalmonitors.com/downloads/literature/combustible/IR2100_DATA.PDF One of the most common uses for semiconductor sensors is in carbon monoxide sensors. They are also used in breathalyzers. Because the sensor must come in contact with the gas to detect it, semiconductor sensors work over a smaller distance than infrared point or ultrasonic detectors. MOS sensors can detect different gases, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia. Since the 1990s, MOS sensors have become important environmental gas detectors.  Ultrasonic  Ultrasonic gas leak detectors are not gas detectors per se. They detect the acoustic emission created when a pressured gas expands in a low pressure area through a small orifice (the leak). They use acoustic sensors to detect changes in the background noise of its environment. Since most high-pressure gas leaks generate sound in the ultrasonic range of 25 kHz to 10 MHz, the sensors are able to easily distinguish these frequencies from background acoustic noise which occurs in the audible range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz.Naranjo, E., http://www.gmigasandflame.com/article_october2007.html The ultrasonic gas leak detector then produces an alarm when there is an ultrasonic deviation from the normal condition of background noise. Ultrasonic gas leak detectors cannot measure gas concentration, but the device is able to determine the leak rate of an escaping gas because the ultrasonic sound level depends on the gas pressure and size of the leak. Ultrasonic gas detectors are mainly used for remote sensing in outdoor environments where weather conditions can easily dissipate escaping gas before allowing it to reach leak detectors that require contact with the gas to detect it and sound an alarm. These detectors are commonly found on offshore and onshore oil/gas platforms, gas compressor and metering stations, gas turbine power plants, and other facilities that house a lot of outdoor pipeline.  Holographic  Holographic gas sensors use light reflection to detect changes in a polymer film matrix containing a hologram. Since holograms reflect light at certain wavelengths, a change in their composition can generate a colorful reflection indicating the presence of a gas molecule. However, holographic sensors require illumination sources such as white light or lasers, and an observer or CCD detector.  Calibration  All gas detectors must be calibrated on a schedule. Of the two form factors of gas detectors, portables must be calibrated more frequently due to the regular changes in environment they experience. A typical calibration schedule for a fixed system may be quarterly, bi-annually or even annually with more robust units. A typical calibration schedule for a portable gas detector is a daily \\"bump test\\" accompanied by a monthly calibration. Almost every portable gas detector requires a specific calibration gas which is available from the manufacturer. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) may set minimum standards for periodic recalibration.  Challenge (bump) test  Because a gas detector is used for employee/worker safety, it is very important to make sure it is operating to manufacturer's specifications. Australian standards specify that a person operating any gas detector is strongly advised to check the gas detector's performance each day and that it is maintained and used in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and warnings. A challenge test should consist of exposing the gas detector to a known concentration of gas to ensure that the gas detector will respond and that the audible and visual alarms activate. It is also important to inspect the gas detector for any accidental or deliberate damage by checking that the housing and screws are intact to prevent any liquid ingress and that the filter is clean, all of which can affect the functionality of the gas detector. The basic calibration or challenge test kit will consist of calibration gas/regulator/calibration cap and hose (generally supplied with the gas detector) and a case for storage and transport. Because 1 in every 2,500 untested instruments will fail to respond to a dangerous concentration of gas, many large businesses use an automated test/calibration station for bump tests and calibrate their gas detectors daily.  Oxygen concentration  Oxygen deficiency gas monitors are used for employee and workforce safety. Cryogenic substances such as liquid nitrogen (LN2), liquid helium (He), and liquid argon (Ar) are inert and can displace oxygen (O2) in a confined space if a leak is present. A rapid decrease of oxygen can provide a very dangerous environment for employees, who may not notice this problem before they suddenly lose consciousness. With this in mind, an oxygen gas monitor is important to have when cryogenics are present. Laboratories, MRI rooms, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and cryogenic suppliers are typical users of oxygen monitors. Oxygen fraction in a breathing gas is measured by electro- galvanic oxygen sensors. They may be used stand-alone, for example to determine the proportion of oxygen in a nitrox mixture used in scuba diving, or as part of feedback loop which maintains a constant partial pressure of oxygen in a rebreather. Hydrocarbons and VOCs Detection of hydrocarbons can be based on the mixing properties of gaseous hydrocarbons ‚Äì or other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) ‚Äì and the sensing material incorporated in the sensor. The selectivity and sensitivity depends on the molecular structure of the VOC and the concentration; however, it is difficult to design a selective sensor for a single VOC. Many VOC sensors detect using a fuel-cell method. VOCs in the environment or certain atmospheres can be detected based on different principles and interactions between the organic compounds and the sensor components. There are electronic devices that can detect ppm concentrations despite not being particularly selective. Others can predict with reasonable accuracy the molecular structure of the volatile organic compounds in the environment or enclosed atmospheres and could be used as accurate monitors of the chemical fingerprint and further as health monitoring devices. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) techniques are used to collect VOCs at low concentrations for analysis. Direct injection mass spectrometry techniques are frequently utilized for the rapid detection and accurate quantification of VOCs. PTR-MS is among the methods that have been used most extensively for the on-line analysis of biogenic and antropogenic VOCs. Recent PTR-MS instruments based on time-of-flight mass spectrometry have been reported to reach detection limits of 20 pptv after 100 ms and 750 ppqv after 1 min measurement (signal integration) time. The mass resolution of these devices is between 7000 and 10,500 m/Œîm, thus it is possible to separate most common isobaric VOCs and quantify them independently. Considerations for detection of hydrocarbon gases/risk control * Methane is lighter than air (possibility of accumulation under roofs) * Ethane is slightly heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels/pits) * Propane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels/pits) * Butane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground levels/pits) Ammonia Gaseous ammonia is continuously monitored in industrial refrigeration processes and biological degradation processes, including exhaled breath. Depending on the required sensitivity, different types of sensors are used (e.g., flame ionization detector, semiconductor, electrochemical, photonic membranesJ. L. Martinez Hurtado and C. R. Lowe (2014), Ammonia-Sensitive Photonic Structures Fabricated in Nafion Membranes by Laser Ablation, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 6 (11), 8903-8908. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am5016588). Detectors usually operate near the lower exposure limit of 25ppm;(OSHA) Source: Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials (Sixth Edition) by N. Irving Sax however, ammonia detection for industrial safety requires continuous monitoring above the fatal exposure limit of 0.1%.

Carbon monoxide is a very dangerous, but odorless, colorless gas, making it difficult for humans to detect. Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased for around US$20‚Äì60. Many local jurisdictions in the United States now require installation of carbon monoxide detectors in addition to smoke detectors in residences. Handheld flammable gas detectors can be used to trace leaks from natural gas lines, propane tanks, butane tanks, or any other combustible gas. These sensors can be purchased for US$35‚Äì100. Research The European Community has supported research called the MINIGAS project that was coordinated by VTT Technical Research Center of Finland.Matthew Peach, Optics.org. \\"Photonics-based MINIGAS project yields better gas detectors.\\" Jan 29, 2013. Retrieved Feb 15, 2013. This research project aims to develop new types of photonics-based gas sensors, and to support the creation of smaller instruments with equal or higher speed and sensitivity than conventional laboratory-grade gas detectors.

Personal life Gabi is married and has a young son that he left back in the Philippines to fight overseas in the United States. \\"We come from a very poor family. My father is a fisherman. All we eat sometimes is what he catches. I try to send them as much money as often as I can\\". Boxing career=Early career On May 8, 2001, after building an undefeated record of 11-0, Gabi fought for the minor World Boxing Federation (WBF) super flyweight title against the then holder of the title, Samson Dutch Boy Gym (40-0) of Thailand. Gabi suffered his first loss as a professional, losing on points to Dutch Boy Gym, who later retired undefeated with a record of 43-0. After two wins following his loss to Dutch Boy Gym, he suffered yet another setback when he faced another undefeated Thai, Peesaddaeng Kiatsakthanee (11-0), whom he lost to by unanimous decision (UD) for the latter's WBC Asian Boxing Council Super Flyweight title. Gabi won seven more bouts, and drew once (after his loss to Kiatsakthanee) before he was able to vie for the WBC International flyweight title, then held by compatriot, Randy Mangubat. Gabi won the belt by technical decision (TD) through twelve rounds, winning by scores of 116-111, 114-112, 116-110. After winning three more fights after his win against Mangubat, Gabi fought Eric Barcelona (whom he defeated six years ago, in 1999, in just his fourth pro fight). The result of the fight was just the same, Gabi defeated Barcelona by TD through 5 rounds, after an accidental headbutt caused the fight to be stopped. First and Last World Title shot On March 3, 2006, in Chumash Casino in Santa Ynez, California, in Gabi's second fight in the United States, he got his first (and last) shot at a world title. He fought the then undefeated IBO and IBF Flyweight World Champion, Vic Darchinyan (24-0). Unfortunately, Gabi was caught with a fierce left punch in the 8th round, resulting in an eight round technical knockout win for Darchinyan. In an effort to help his fellow friend and fellow Filipino boxer Nonito Donaire prepare to fight Darchinyan, Gabi gave advice that the young fighter acknowledged after the bout. Donaire went on to knock out Darchinyan to become a world champion, something Gabi never accomplished, but he did help a friend, and that's what matters. Donaire said \\"Gabi taught me a little bit and told me what this guy (Darchinyan) did and he helped out a lot for this fight\\". The Prince's Farewell On March 15, 2008, after winning four more bouts after his loss to Darchinyan, Gabi faced the then WBO NABO Bantamweight Champion, Abner Mares for his title in the undercard of Manny Pacquiao's rematch with Juan Manuel M√°rquez. Mares, who was undefeated coming into the bout with 15 wins and 0 losses, stopped Gabi in his tracks in just two rounds. Gabi later retired from the sport following the loss. Controversy On August 17, 2007 Gabi was ordered arrested for breaching a contract with Cotabato Vice Governor, Emmanuel Pi√±ol. MTC Judge Antonina Escovilla issued the warrant of arrest based on the complaint of Pi√±ol who sought P4.8 million from Gabi.

It was aerodynamically and structurally advanced for its time (1920s), a clean, low- wing all-metal cantilever monoplane. Almost 200 were produced. It is remembered in aviation history for the first east‚Äìwest non-stop heavier-than- air crossing of the Atlantic. Design and development The Junkers W 33 was a transport development of the 1919 four-seat airliner, the Junkers F 13. The latter was a very advanced aircraft when built, an aerodynamically clean all- metal cantilever (without external bracing) monoplane. Even later in the 1920s, it and other Junkers types were unusual as unbraced monoplanes in a biplane age, with only Fokker's designs of comparable modernity. Like all Junkers designs from the J 7 fighter onwards, it used an aluminium alloy duraluminum structure covered with Junkers' characteristic corrugated dural skin. The wings had the same span as the F 13, though the platform was a little different, and the length was the same as the F 13FE. The fuselage, though, was flatter-topped than that of the F 13. A large port-side door gave access to the freight compartment. The 228 kW Junkers L5 upright inline water- cooled engined was also the same as in the F 13FE, though much more powerful than the BMW motors of the F 13A, giving improved weightlifting compared with that early model. The designer of the W 33 was Herman Pohlmann. The cockpit and undercarriage were of their time, the former enclosed with two seats, and the latter fixed and divided with a tailwheel. The Junkers W letter labelled the type as a seaplane (floatplane), but in practice W 33s flew as both at different times. The prototype W 33, registered D-921, first flew, as a seaplane, from Leopoldshafen on the river Elbe near Dessau on 17 June 1926. Production began in 1927 and ran until 1934 with 198 production machines built. Most of these were built at the Junkers works at Dessau, but a small number were assembled at Junker's Swedish subsidiary AB Flygindustri at Limhamn near Malm√∂ and in the USSR.Gunston 1995, p.131. The Swedish plant had been set up in the early 1920s to avoid the post-war restrictions on aircraft building, which included civil types during 1921‚Äì2. The Russian works at Fili near Moscow was used initially to build the H 21 and H 22 fighters for the Red Army. There were over 30 W 33 variants, so only a few are listed below. Operational history The Transatlantic W 33 on display at Bremen airport Junkers W 33 first prototype D-921 at the Deutschen Seeflug competition, July 1926 The first two W33 prototypes competed very soon after their first flights at the Deutschen Seeflug seaplane competition at Warnem√ºnde in July 1926. The first prototype W 33, D-921, flew as no.7 and came second in the contest. The second prototype, a W 33a, flew as no.8. W 33s were used by many operators across the world in the late 1920s and 1930s. They served as general transports and specialised mailplanes. Deutsche Luft Hansa had only four, which ran mail from 1929. Others were used as survey aircraft and crop- sprayers. Later, the Luftwaffe used some as trainers. The Colombian Air Force used Junkers W 33, W 34 and K 43 in the Colombia-Peru War (1932‚Äì1933).von Rauch 1984, pp.3‚Äì4. The Ethiopian Air Force had one W 33c during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. One Junkers W 33g was used by the Swedish Air Force from 1933‚Äì5 as an air ambulance and known as the transport type Trp2. It is possible that this aircraft was assembled at Linhamm, as were four W 33s bound for Australia. After World War II, this aircraft served in a utility role with the Swedish Air Force squadron F2 flying out of H√§gern√§s. From there, in June 1952, it participated in the search and rescue operations during the famous Catalina Affair, in which two Soviet MiG-15s engaged and shot down a Swedish intelligence aircraft (a C-47) and then later another SAR aircraft, a PBY Catalina.http://fly.historicwings.com/2012/06/the-catalina-affair/ Russian- registered W 33s (17 of them, mostly assembled in Russia at Fili from imported parts) were designated PS-4 for Passazhirskii Samolyot (passenger aircraft or airliner). At least 9 Russian-built W 33s appeared on that country's pre-war civil register.http://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/hero/pulp/resources/vehicles/junkers.html Aeronautical distinctions The Junkers W 33 set numerous records, and one made the first east-to-west crossing of the Atlantic by airplane. The North Atlantic had been first crossed, non-stop and by a heavier-than-air craft, by Alcock and Brown in 1919 in a Vickers Vimy. They flew west to east, with the prevailing winds from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Clifden, Ireland, in just under 16 hrs. The east-to-west flight was always more challenging, but became feasible as aircraft performance improved through the 1920s. Nearly nine years after the British R34 rigid airship had pioneered the feat of a nonstop trans- Atlantic east-west flight; on April 12‚Äì13, 1928, W 33 D-1167 Bremen flew from Baldonnel near Dublin in Ireland to Greenly Island, Canada, off Labrador in 37 hours. Strong westerly winds took them north of their intended destination, New York, but they landed safely. The crew were K√∂hl, von H√ºnefeld and Fitzmaurice. The aircraft is now on display at Bremen Airport, Germany. A W 33 set class C world records for both endurance of 52 h 22 m and distance (4661 km or 2896 mi) on one flight at Dessau between 3 and 5 August 1927, piloted by Johann Risztics and Edzard. A little earlier Fritz Loose and W.N. Schnabele had set another Class C record for duration and distance, this time carrying a useful 500 kg load. They stayed aloft for 22 h 11 m and travelled 2736 km (1701 mi). At about the same time, the W33 set a similar pair of records in Class Cbis (Seaplanes).Flight, 3 November 1927, p.763 A W 33 (much modified and sometimes referred to as a W 34) established a world altitude record on 26 May 1929, piloted by Willy Neuenhofen at 41,800 ft (12740 m). There were failures, too. The first Swedish-assembled W33 was ready by May 1930, and was delivered two months later to Mitsubishi in Japan. This aircraft was used in an attempt in 1932 to fly across the Pacific Ocean to the US, but the attempt failed and the aircraft disappeared. Neither aircraft parts nor any survivors were found, although the search lasted over six months.

She is one of the founding members of the Judson Dance Theater.\\"Deborah Hay\\", 10.31.12, Art Forum Early life and work (1960s) Deborah Hay was born in 1941 in Brooklyn. Her mother was her first dance teacher and directed her training until she was a teenager. She moved to Downtown, Manhattan in the 1960s, where she continued her training with Merce Cunningham and Mia Slavenska. She was part of the collective of dancers, composers, and visual artists who performed at the Judson Memorial Church and became known as the Judson Dance Theater. This was a group of experimentalists who rejected the confines of Modern dance practice and theory, inventing the precepts of Postmodern dance. In 1964, Hay danced with the Cunningham Dance Company during a 6-month tour through Europe and Asia. Hay Bio She and her Judson colleagues focused on shedding the artificial distinction between trained and untrained performers. She created large-scale dance projects involving untrained dancers, fragmented and choreographed music accompaniment, and the execution of ordinary movement patterns performed under stressful conditions. In October 1966 she along with other artists worked with Bell Labs computer experts in collaborative performances, that led to the creation of a seminal piece of art, Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon's Studies in Perception #1, an image of a reclining nude using typographic symbols for halftone densities.\\"Bell Labs & The Origins of the Multimedia Artist\\", November 8, 1998 This image of Deborah Hay was printed in The New York Times on 11 October 1967, and exhibited at one of the earliest computer art exhibitions, The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age, held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in from November 25, 1968 through February 9, 1969.  1970s-1980s  In 1970 she left New York to live in a community in northern Vermont. There, she distanced herself from the performing arena, producing 10 Circle Dances, performed on 10 consecutive nights with no audience whatsoever. Thus began a long period of reflection about how dance is transmitted and presented. Her first book, \\"Moving Through the Universe in Bare Feet\\" (Swallow Press, 1975), is an early example of her distinctive \\"memory/concept mode\\" of choreographic record, and emphasizes the narratives underlining the process of her dance-making, rather than the technical specifications or notations of their form. In 1976 Hay left Vermont and moved to Austin, Texas. Her attention focused on a set of practices (\\"playing awake\\") that engaged the performer on several levels of consciousness at once. While developing her concepts, she instituted a yearly four-month group workshop that culminated in large group public performances Gus Solomons, Jr., \\"The Deborah Hay Dance Company\\" in Dance Magazine (May, 2004) and from these group pieces she distilled her solo dances. Her second book, \\"Lamb at the Altar: The Story of a Dance\\" (Duke University Press, 1994), documents the unique creative process that defined these works.  1990s-2000s  In the late 1990s Deborah Hay focused almost exclusively on rarified and enigmatic solo dances based on her new experimental choreographic method, such as \\"The Man Who Grew Common in Wisdom\\", \\"Voil√†\\", \\"The Other Side of O\\", \\"Fire\\", \\"Boom Boom Boom\\", \\"Music\\", \\"Beauty\\" and \\"The Ridge, Room\\", performing them around the world and passing them on to noted performers in the US, Europe, and Australia. \\"My Body, The Buddhist,\\" her third book, was published by Wesleyan University Press, 2000. It is an introspective series of reflections on the major lessons of life that she has learned from her body while dancing. Her fourth book, \\"Using the Sky: a dance,\\" was published by Routledge Books in 2016. Hay conducted 14 annual Solo Performance Commissioning Projects from 1998 through 2012, first on Whidbey Island in Washington state and then at the Findhorn Community Foundation in Findhorn, Scotland. A film about this groundbreaking experiment, \\"Turn Your F*^king Head,\\" was made by Becky Edmunds in 2012. Rutledge Books produced and is now distributing this one hour documentary. In 2000, Hay strayed from her preferred method of solo dance-making to create a duet for herself and Mikhail Baryshnikov, which toured extensively with the Past/Forward project, a series of performances that updated the work of the Judson Dance Theater. In 2002, Hay began applying what she had learned from 30 years of working with mostly untrained dancers to choreographing dances for experienced dancer/choreographers. In 2004, she received a NYC Bessie Award for her quartet \\"The Match.\\" In 2006 she choreographed ‚ÄúO, O‚Äù for 5 New York City choreographer/dancers and then for 7 French dancers of comparable experience. The Festival d‚ÄôAutomne, in Paris, presented \\"The Match\\" in 2005, ‚ÄúO, O‚Äù in 2006, and \\"If I Sing To You\\" in 2008, which was commissioned by The Forsythe Company and toured extensively in Europe and Australia. In 2009, The Toronto Dance Theatre premiered her work \\"Up Until Now,\\" and in 2010 \\"Lightening\\" premiered at the Helsinki Festival, a dance for 6 Finnish dancers/choreographers.  2010s-present  After a two-year research collaboration with Motion Bank, a project of the Forsythe Company directed by Scott delaHunta, an online interactive website dedicated to Hay's choreographic aesthetics was launched in June 2013. One outcome of that collaboration was Hay's first museum installation, Perception Unfolds: Looking at Deborah Hay's Dance, curated by Annette Carlozzi for the Blanton Museum in Austin, TX. The installation also travelled to Yale Art Museum in New Haven, Connecticut. Hay, in collaboration with Laurie Anderson and lighting designer Minna Tikkainen created an evening length work Figure a Sea, for 21 dancers and commissioned by the Cullberg Ballet in Stockholm, Sweden. It premiered September 24, 2015. May 5, 2015 France's Minister of Culture and Communication awarded Hay the title of CHEVALIER DE L'ORDRE DES ARTS ET DES LETTRES. In October 2016, Deborah Hay presented a trilogy of works at the University of California Los Angeles's Center for the Art of Performances. It included multiple works including \\"As Holy Sites Go\\", performed by UCLA faculty members Ros Warby and Jeanine Durning, and \\"Figure a Sea\\", performed by the Cullberg Ballet of Sweden and featuring the music composition of Laurie Anderson. Both works were revisions of her original score, \\"No Time to Fly\\", which she adapted to be, respectively, a duet and a group piece. Deborah Hay says of the work, \\"It is a space for self-reflection: for seeing oneself seeing.\\" All works were performed at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.  Honors and awards  In October 2009 Deborah received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Dance from the Theater Academy in Helsinki, Finland, and in 2010 she was awarded a US Artist Friends Fellowship and a 2011 artist's grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, based in New York. In April 2012, Deborah Hay became one of the 21 American performing artists to receive the inaugural and groundbreaking 2012 Doris Duke Artist Award.

He won another three Scotland caps at Arsenal, and one more against Wales on 1 March 1909 during his Fulham spell, to bring his total to five.

He appeared in nearly 70 films, mostly B-westerns, between 1936 and 1956. Among these, Terhune starred in the Three Mesquiteers and Range Busters series. Early years Terhune's father died when he was seven (1898).  Baseball  Terhune worked as a tool maker and when he was 20 he played semi-pro baseball for teams in Minneapolis, Indianapolis, and Newark; he also spent the 1913 season playing Class-D baseball for the Vincennes Alices of the Kitty League. During this time he became friends with Kermit Maynard, a star university athlete who launched a career as a silent western movie star that continued into the sound era. Kermit's younger brother was Ken Maynard, a hugely popular western star from the early 1920s through the 1930s.  Whistling and imitations  When Terhune was 23, an uncle, \\"a left-handed fiddler\\", Terhune recalled, convinced the young man to come with him to a talent contest where Max won first prize with his whistling routines. He began seeking work in vaudeville houses and soon played with acts like the Hoosier Hotshots and toured 46 weeks with Roy Lee Brown's Hickville Follies. Terhune said when he received an excellent newspaper review (\\"Max Terhune made a tremendous hit with his bird and barnyard animal imitation.\\") while playing a Chevrolet dealers' convention in Muncie, Indiana he was able to use it as an introduction in 1932 to the National Barn Dance radio program on WLS in Chicago. This is where he formed a strong friendship with Gene Autry. It was Autry who introduced him to Republic Pictures and featured him in several of his early films before Terhune joined the Mesquiteers series. Film career Terhune performed in 21 episodes of a popular Republic Studios western series called The Three Mesquiteers. His character, Lullaby Joslin, was launched by another popular character actor, Syd Saylor, but then Terhune stepped into the series which, involving 12 different actors, lasted for a total of 51 pictures over eight years. His co-stars in 15 of the pictures were Robert Livingston and Ray \\"Crash\\" Corrigan. He then worked with Corrigan and John Wayne, who took over Livingston's role shortly before Wayne's career was launched by his starring role in \\"Stagecoach\\". Terhune and Corrigan went on to work together in another trio western series, The Range Busters (24 entries with Ray Corrigan and John King at Monogram Pictures). He did several supporting roles with Gene Autry (at Republic). It was Autry, with whom he had worked in radio in Chicago, who convinced him to come to Hollywood. Later he worked in Johnny Mack Brown westerns at Monogram. Terhune played the comic sidekick (Lullaby Joslin in the Mesquiteers movies and usually a character called Alibi thereafter) ‚Äî with a major distinction. He always traveled the range with his dummy Elmer sharing his saddle. Elmer received a film credit for his appearances.  Magic  Besides being a ventriloquist, whistler and animal imitator, Terhune was a magician. Card tricks were his forte, and he often performed such in his movies. His former vaudeville act included juggling, bird calls and barnyard animal impressions, talents also incorporated into his sidekick roles. His hands doubled for those of Clark Gable in \\"The King and Four Queens\\" in 1956. He performed on occasion at The Magic Castle in Hollywood. (Source: Audio interview: Max Terhune 1971)  Later years  He appeared frequently on weekends in the 1950s at Corriganville, a popular western film location developed by his co-star and friend who purchased the land in the late 1930s. Tourists paid to see stunt shows and musical performances as well as wander around the western streets where scores of films and TV episodes were filmed over 25 years. His last film role was in the major Hollywood film Giant, in which he played the dramatic role of the physician Dr. Walker. Terhune married Maude Cassady and they had three children: Donald Roltaire, Robert, and Maxine. His son Robert was a stuntman who doubled burly actors like George Kennedy in films. Donald Roltaire was killed at age 27 in an automobile accident near Fresno, California, in 1958. Terhune died in Cottonwood, Arizona, at the age of 82.

He was mustered out of the Union Army in 1863 but served in the New York Militia in 1865. In 1866, in consideration of his prior service, he was nominated and confirmed for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865. Early life Hawkins was born in Pomfret, Vermont to Lorenzo Dow Hawkins and Maria Louisa (Hutchinson) Hawkins. At age 15, Hawkins enlisted in the 2nd United States Dragoons for service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After the war, he settled in New York City where he studied law. Hawkins married Annmary Brown in 1860; she died in January 1903 of pneumonia. Civil War In 1861, Hawkins helped raise the 9th New York Infantry, a Zouave-styled regiment, popularly known as \\"Hawkins Zouaves\\" for service in the Civil War. Hawkins was appointed colonel of the regiment on May 4, 1861 and served with distinction in North Carolina early in the war. He was part of Benjamin F. Butler's expedition to capture Fort Hatteras in 1861. Expecting to win a promotion to brigadier general for his service at Fort Hatteras he was instead relieved of command for insubordination. On October 8, 1861 a disgruntled Hawkins wrote \\"brigadier generals are made of such queer stuff nowadays, that I should not esteem it any great honor to be made one.\\"Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p.xiii. Hawkins would in fact receive a brevet promotion to brigadier general in 1866 to rank from March 13, 1865. Despite his belligerence an early dispatch of Hawkins' caught the attention of President Abraham Lincoln. Hawkins was invited to the White House to confer with the President and General-in-Chief George B. McClellan. There he was instrumental in convincing the Union high command of the possibility of a combined operation against Pamlico Sound in North Carolina.Symonds, Craig L. Union Combined Operations in the Civil War. New York: Fordham University Press, 2010. . p. 12. The idea became the objective Ambrose Burnside's North Carolina Expedition. Hawkins was again conspicuous at the battles of Roanoke Island and New Bern in 1862. Upon the arrival of significant reinforcements to North Carolina in April 1862, he assumed command of a brigade. Hawkins' brigade was attached to Jesse L. Reno's division and fought at the battle of South Mills on April 19, 1862 where he was wounded in the left arm.Eicher, 2001, p. 288. After recovering Hawkins returned to Virginia with his regiment and briefly commanded the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division in the newly formed IX Corps. He was not present with the brigade during the Maryland Campaign but resumed command during the battle of Fredericksburg. After Fredericksburg, the 3rd Division, commanded by George W. Getty, was transferred to the VII Corps in southeast Virginia. Hawkins led his brigade (now the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, VII Corps) during the siege of Suffolk. Just two days before the siege was lifted, Hawkins turned over command of his brigade and on May 20, 1863 was mustered out of the volunteer service with his old regiment. He did not return to active duty. On July 9, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Hawkins for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 747. He remained active in the New York Militia receiving a brevet promotion to brigadier general of New York Militia in 1865. Later life Hawkins was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 11th D.) in 1872. He became a noted‚Äîand certainly obsessive‚Äîrare book collector, having started shortly before the Civil War. He amassed a collection of 225 incunabula; his goal was to have the first and second books from every European printer before 1501. Remarkably, he was able to acquire 130 of the 238 known fifteenth century European printers. In 1990, the book collection was moved from the Annmary Brown Memorial at Brown University and transferred to the John Hay Library. Hawkins and his wife were also avid art collectors and created an excellent collection of 19th century American art. Hawkins was appointed Assistant to the Commissioner General for the United States Commission to the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris, France. Hawkins was \\"Commissaire Expert des Beaux Arts\\" and was responsible for selecting and organizing American art works for the exhibition. Hawkins feuded with James McNeill Whistler, who removed all of his work in protest and later wrote The Gentle Art of Making Enemies (1890), which in-part details his experiences with Hawkins. While attempting to cross the street in front of his home at 42 5th Avenue in New York City, Hawkins was struck by an automobile and died from his injuries on October 25, 1920. He is buried with his wife in a crypt at the Annmary Brown Memorial on the Brown University campus in Providence, Rhode Island.

In February 2007 Publisher YNK acquired the rights for the game, and in January 2009, the game was moved to the internal studio YNK Games. As of 7 February 2008, official versions of the game are available in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, and the United States. The English version of Seal Online was expected to be released in Quarter 3 of 2005 when Grigon Entertainment announced that there would be an English version of Seal Online. An English website was made by them. However within two months, the site closed and there was no more news of an English translated version of the game. After two years, a website was created for Seal Online. It had a post announcing the arrival of Seal Online in English to the United States. The English Seal Online was finally released on 19 November 2007 at 8pm EST by YNK Interactive.  Gameplay  Seal Online is mostly a point-and-click MMORPG; movement, combat, and many other commands are all controlled by mouse, though the combo system is done with the A, S, and D keys. The player can choose from 7 different classes to start with. However, if the player chooses to start with the Beginner, he/she can choose to job change into the other 6 classes when he reaches Level 10. 21 additional new classes were added in early 2009. The game experienced a server wipe on 27 September 2010 bringing all players back to level 1. Seal Online's travel system uses a method called 'Warp Gates'. These gates, located in various towns, allow the player to move to other maps. Players may use scrolls, set revive points, use the Wagon Driver NPC, or just type out a Teleport command for a small fee to warp to different maps. Players can learn skills to trade, open or join a guild after completing a quest, open a chat room, create a party to fight monsters more effectively, open an in-game bank account to hold or collect more items and money, nurture a pet, do quests, and fish. Seal Online's level up system uses a point method. Skills level up with skill points. Each time a player levels up, they receive a set number of skill points and status points, which they then may use to strengthen their character. The Combo System is more complicated than most other MMORPGs. As a player attacks an enemy, the XP bar fills up. Once the bar is halfway filled, the player can start a combo by pressing the game's combo buttons. After starting a combo, players must press a combination of buttons. Combos do more damage than normal attacks, and are executed faster. Classes There are 9 classes: Knight, Jester, Mage, Craftsman, Warrior, Priest, Beginner, Hunter, Cook. There are two second Classes for each first classes that can be chosen after reaching level 150. *Knight: Defender or Regenade *Jester: Gambler or Assassin *Mage: Ice Wizard or Fire Wizard *Craftsman: Demolitionist or Artisan *Warrior: Swordmaster or Berserker *Priest: Apostle or Templar *Hunter: Gunner or Archer *Cook: Chef or Food Fighter Server shutdown After offering entertainment for many years, many servers were shut down by their local server company.

It was fought between men of the Clan Keith and Clan Mackay from Strathnaver against men of the Clan Gunn and possibly their allies the Clan Oliphant and Clan Sutherland from Caithness. The date is uncertain, it was probably in 1464 but may have been in 1438. Background The cause of the battle seems to have been a claim made by one of the Oliphants, then allies of the Sutherlands of Duffus to some lands held by the Keiths. The lands were later granted to the Oliphants by King James IV. Also the Keiths requiring the assistance of the Mackays indicates that they were opposed by a powerful force.Mackay, Robert. (1829).

In 1931, the biggest-selling version was either by Russ Columbo or by Wayne King; both versions and recordings by Benny Krueger's orchestra (with a vocal by Smith Ballew) and by Kate Smith all had significant popularity. In 1946, three versions, by Tommy Dorsey's orchestra (with a vocal by Stuart Foster), by Frank Sinatra, and by Skinnay Ennis, all contended for popularity. In 1961, a US hit recording was issued by Linda Scott. It reached a peak position #12 in 8 weeks on the Billboard chart; in early 1962, Eden Kane reached the British Top 10 with his version.

Life and career  Born in Olbernhau, Saxony, Kretzschmar was son of the organist and cantor Karl Dankegott Kretzschmar and Karoline Wilhelmine, n√©e Leupold. He was from 1862 a student in the Kreuzschule in Dresden, where from 1867‚Äì1868 he was twice Prefect of the Dresdner Kreuzchor. In addition, from 1870 he studied Philology at Leipzig University as well as Music at the Leipzig Conservatory and was awarded his doctorate there. From 1871 he was actively teaching in Theory, Composition, Piano and Organ at the Leipzig Conservatory, and acted as director/conductor for various musical societies. In 1876 he spent a year as theatre orchestra conductor in Metz (described as an in an \\"adventurous episode\\"), and undertook research expeditions in England and Italy for the study of musical history; from 1877 to 1887 he was Director of Music at the University of Rostock, and city music director there from 1880. Institute for Church Music, Berlin From 1887 to 1904 he renewed his position in Leipzig as active University Music Director. From 1888-1898 he was Director of the Riedel Choral Society. In the year 1890 he was awarded an honorary professorship, and in 1890 he founded the Leipzig Academic Concerts which he conducted until 1895. In 1904 he was appointed as regular Professor of Music at the University of Berlin, and from 1907‚Äì1922 he was Director of the Royal Institute for Church Music. From 1909 to 1920 (as successor to Joseph Joachim) he was Director of the K√∂niglich Akademischen Hochschule f√ºr aus√ºbende Tonkunst founded in 1869, later the Musikhochschule Berlin (the Berlin High School for Music). In 1912 he was elected Chairman of the de:Preu√üische Musikgeschichtlichen Kommission (Prussian Music History Commission) and thus the editor of the Denkm√§ler deutscher Tonkunst. This historical music edition was begun in 1892 by Brahms, Joachim and Philipp Spitta. He was a government privy counsellor. One of his students was composer and musicologist Walter Niemann. Hermeneutics Kretschmar founded the discipline of musical hermeneutics in around 1900. Gravesite of Kretzschmar at the Friedhof Nikolassee in Berlin According to the musicologst Maria Fuchs, :\\"The discipline of musical hermeneutics explores the discursive meanings of musical works...[It] concentrates on the \\"interpretation and paraphrasing of the affects, feelings, expressive characters, and moods\\" of a piece of music. In contrast to the formal-aesthetic approach to concert music analysis‚Äîclosely connected to German music critic Eduard Hanslick (1825‚Äì1904) and his idea of 'absolute music'‚Äîmusical hermeneutics was based on an aesthetics of content and affects.\\" Death He died in Berlin-Schlachtensee in 1924, after which he was buried in a grave of honour in the de:Protestant Nicholassee churchyard of the :de:Kirche Nikolassee in Berlin. Personal life Kretzschmar was married in 1880 to the British pianist Clara Meller (Bristol, 3 February 1855 - 6 May 1903, Leipzig). She gave her d√©but concert at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1877, and accompanied the Austrian soprano Minna Peschka-Leutner in a number of concerts that year. In G√∂ttingen in March she played Beethoven's Kreutzer sonata, pieces by Schumann, Liszt and Wagner arr. Tausig, and one or other of Chopin's A-flat major waltzes. In October 1878 she played Schumann's Piano Concerto in a concert at the Rostock Konzertverein, conducted by Kretschmar, who was the music director at Rostock University She continued to give concerts after their marriage; her repertoire included Brahms' 2nd piano concerto, Saint-Sa√´ns' second, the concerto for three keyboards, BWV 1064 by J. S. Bach, and the F-sharp minor concerto by Hans von Bronsart. She died aged 48 in Leipzig. They had no children.  Literary allusion  In his novel Doktor Faustus, Thomas Mann creates the character of Dr Wendell Kretschmar, the inspirational and eccentric musicologist, lecturer and teacher of the composer Adrian Leverk√ºhn. The name is probably given in homage to his real- life contemporary Hermann Kretzschmar, whose essays in musical interpretation were widely read and appreciated around the turn of the twentieth century.

It is the story of Lady Jane Grey, who was Queen of England for nine days in 1553. Previously known for her non-fiction publications, Innocent Traitor was Weir's first work of fiction; she later spoke of its impact on her, saying she \\"learned so much from the editorial process about the writing and craft of fiction.\\" Summary This book tells the life of \\"The Nine Day Queen\\" through various characters' eyes, from Lady Jane to Queen Mary. This book tells of Jane's childhood and offers explanation to her conversion to the Protestant faith. It tells of her relationship to the future Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth I along with her forced and unwanted marriage. It ends with her final days. Plot The story starts with her birth in 1537. The daughter of Lady Frances Brandon and Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Jane is seen as a burden by her parents, both of whom resent her for being a girl instead of a boy, and is regularly beaten by her mother. Jane grows up close to her nurse, Mrs. Ellen and is highly educated, to the standards of a princess. After Henry VIII's death and Catherine Parr's marriage to Thomas Seymour, Jane goes to live with the former queen and her husband to further her education while her elders plot her marriage to Edward VI of England. When it becomes clear that the young king will not live long, other plans are made for Jane. John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, gets the young Edward to proclaim Jane as his successor. He does this by proclaiming his half sisters, Mary and Elizabeth I of England, both bastards and not fit to take the throne. According to Edward's father's will, if all his children were to die without heirs, then the succession to the crown would follow the lineage of his late younger sister, Mary Tudor. Frances, the daughter of Mary, relinquishes her right to the crown in order for it to go to her eldest daughter, Jane, since she had no sons. To secure his position Northumberland marries Jane off to Guilford Dudley, his youngest son. Jane is openly displeased with the man chosen to be her husband. On Edward's death, Northumberland and Henry Grey go forward with their plan and put Jane on the throne, proclaiming her to be the rightful heir to the throne. At first, a reluctant Jane instead proclaims Mary the rightful queen, but is forced by her elders to take the throne as her own. There is little support for her claim, though. Even many Protestant nobles, whose support had been counted on, rally to Mary. When Mary rides into town proclaiming herself the rightful queen, Jane puts up no fight and is happy to relinquish the title to her cousin. Thinking Mary will be kind to her, Jane is not worried, even though she is confined to the Tower of London; she had spent her brief \\"reign\\" there, and the main change is that she is no longer living in the royal apartments. Mary's fiance, Philip II of Spain, pressures Mary to rid England of the usurper Jane after yet another attempt by Jane's father to overthrow Mary and put Jane back on the throne. Mary reluctantly acquiesces for fear of displeasing her husband-to-be. Mary signs a warrant for execution of both Lady Jane Grey and her husband, Guilford Dudley. She is sympathetic towards Jane, offering her a few more days before the execution, while promising to spare her life, if she converts from the Protestant faith to the Catholic faith. Stubborn in her religious ways, Jane refuses and pays the price. On 12 February 1554 Jane is taken to the Tower Green, where she faces the scaffold and dies a traitor's death. Even the executioner feels sorry for her.

It would have studied the Sun during its solar maximum, the last before the beginning of the Orion program. Six spacecraft would have been launched, which would separate into three groups. The Solar Sentinels were proposed to be part of the NASA program Living With a Star. Goals The goals of the Solar Sentinels are: # Understand the acceleration and transit of solar energetic particles # Understand the initiation and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and interplanetary shocks in the inner heliosphere This mission's driving purpose was that the solar maximum of solar cycle 24 would have been the final one before the first upcoming crewed missions to the Moon and Mars. This was the last chance in 11 years to understand the solar storms and the deadly radiation of a solar maximum. Spacecraft There would have been six spacecraft: four identical spacecraft which would explore the inner heliosphere, one spacecraft which would take its post near Earth, and the final sentinel to trail slowly behind Earth. Inner Heliospheric Sentinels The majority of the sentinels are the Inner Heliospheric Sentinels (IHS), which would observe the Sun at distances of 0.25 AU. This would be a challenge to scientists and engineers working on these probes, as this is one-fourth the distance between the Earth and the Sun. These probes would make in-situ measurements of energetic particles and plasma. Instruments to measure X-ray, radio, and neutron emissions would be included. Part of the mission concept includes Venus flybys. Near Earth Sentinel The Near Earth Sentinel (NES) would study the solar corona in UV and visible light. Farside Sentinel The Farside Sentinel (FSS) would study the photospheric magnetic field. As three spacecraft are needed to completely monitor this magnetic field, partnerships with two other spacecraft would be made: NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory and the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter. Launch The three Inner Heliospheric Sentinels would have been launched together. The proposed launch dates were 2014, 2015, or 2017. The nominal mission lasts three years, with an extension to five years if possible. Cooperation Several other solar spacecraft would have helped with this mission, such as STEREO, Japan's Hinode, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and ESA's Solar Orbiter. Ground-based telescopes would also assist the mission. It would have been part of a group of four missions, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Geospace missions (Radiation Belt Storm Probes and Ionosphere-Thermosphere Storm Probes), from the Living With a Star program.

The lead vocal is sung by Dave Davies, with occasional parts vocalized by his brother Ray, the band's usual lead singer. The song is a defiant anthem of non-conformity. It has been covered by various artists, notably the Chocolate Watchband in their 1968 rendition of the song. History Davies had written the song for The Animals, but it was turned down, so the Kinks released their own version with guitarist Dave Davies on lead vocals. This went against the norm where each brother usually sang songs they had written themselves. Later performances of the song were sung by Ray, with Dave providing backing vocals and Eric Clapton-influenced guitar solos. Both the Davies brothers continue to perform the song in their solo concerts. Dave Davies described the song as \\"a Kinks fans favourite.\\" He also said, \\"[I]t was never a hit for The Kinks, but over the years every true Kinks fan relates to that particular song, and it's funny, because that particular version is one of the only songs where Ray and I actually swap lead vocals. Elsewhere, when he sings lead I do the octave harmonies, or where I sing lead he's doing background vocals. Ray and I have very different ranges, fortunately, and our textures are different, which really helps for distinctive harmonies.\\" Music and lyrics The song is a defiant anthem of non-conformity, and its lyrics exhibit sentiments of frustration, accompanied by the outsider perception of being different from the rest, while yearning to seek and find, as well as assert, one's own individual identity. The song begins with an opening signature played somewhat menacingly on a twelve-string electric guitar in the key of A-minor, punctuated by subtle drum beats, which then shifts into a key of G-major when the lyrics begin, highlighting the song's angry stance. ::I won't take all that they hand me down ::And make out a smile though I wear a frown ::And I'm not gonna take this all lying down ::'Cause once I get started I go to town ::'Cause I'm not like everybody else... Yet the mood also conveys a sense of sadness, and in the third verse expresses love and a sense of remorse, but with a cautious warning: ::But darling, you know that I love you true ::Do anything that you want me to ::Confess all my sins like you want me to ::There's one thing I will say to you ::I'm not like everybody else... As the song progresses into its last bars, it builds up to a cathartic finale with intense playing from all of the members of the Kinks and then comes to a crashing close. Release and reception The song was first released as the B-side to their single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" but soon became a favourite and was often part of the Kinks live act. Ray Davies continues to play the song regularly and used the song as an opening number in his 2006-2008 solo live appearances. The song has been included on many compilations including Sunny Afternoon in the UK in 1967, The Great Lost Kinks Album in the US in 1973 and the 2002 greatest hits release The Ultimate Collection. It also appears as a bonus track on the 1998 CD reissue of Face to Face, the 2011 deluxe edition of The Kink Kontroversy, and the compilation \\"The Anthology 1964-1971\\".

It runs an annual national championship, and has hosted a number of international competitions. History Cyprus Archery Federation grounds The Cyprus Archery Federation was founded in 1972World Archery but became active much later. In 1987 the Cyprus Archery Club (CAC) in Nicosia was founded later followed by Artemis and Kentavros clubs. On April 8, 1989 the first Pancyprian Archery Tournament was held at Lapatsa Sporting Club using training bows at a distance of 30 m. One year later CAF held the international Tournament Theofanideia in memory of Stelios Theofanides, a major figure in Cypriot archery. Subsequently Theofanideia become an annual event that CAF holds every year at an international level archery tournament. Since 1991, the CAF runs a Pancyprian Championship in all age categories and disciplines. In 1993 the first beginners championship was held which was then renamed as the Academies Championship. The two championships are incorporated into the Federation's plans and the winners from each championship are awarded monetary prizes at the end of each championship year. In 1993 CAF was awarded the first European Archery Grand Prix. It was the biggest athletic event ever held by the Federation and led to CAF organizing the same event in 1994. Since then it held the Grand Prix in 1999 with the participation of 180 athletes from 28 countries and in 2001 with the participation of 135 athletes from 20 countries. In 2007 the European Junior Championship was held in Limassol with the participation of 191 athletes from 18 countries. In 1996 CAF held the first ever biannual European Small Nations Games. In 1998 they were held by San Marino, 2000 by Malta, 2002 by Luxembourg, 2004 by San Marino and in 2006 again by Cyprus as Monaco was unable to hold them. Today CAF has more than 1000 registered athletes from 22 Member Clubs.Cyprus Sports Organisation It enjoys recognition by the Cyprus Sports Organisation (KOA) and the Cyprus Olympic Committee (KOE). In addition to its activities at the competitive level, it supports training in coaching, judging and technical equipment setup.

It was also released as the album's only single. Background The title is borrowed from John Keats' 1817 poem \\"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\\": The song was frequently used to open the group's live performances and features as the first track on their 1973 live album Genesis Live. The song opens with a Mellotron intro. According to Tony Banks, the introductory section was intended to take advantage of idiosyncrasies in the tuning of the Mellotron model he was using at the time: The two chords in question are Bmaj7/F# and C#/F#.Transcription of song opening The long keyboard introduction crossfades into the main ensemble section, which features a prominent single-note staccato pattern in a 6/4 time signature (reminiscent of the 5/4 rhythmic pattern from \\"Mars\\" in Gustav Holst's The Planets suite) played over a pattern of sustained organ chords. Following the vocal sections of the song, there is an unusual polyrhythm part, where the staccato riff changes to 8/4 time, played against a Mellotron/organ chord part in 6/4. The lyrics were written by Banks and Mike Rutherford during a soundcheck for a gig in Naples. While they were surveying the deserted landscape of the airfield where they were rehearsing, they wondered what an empty Earth would look like in this state if surveyed by an alien visitor. The lyrics were influenced by the Arthur C. Clarke 1953 science fiction novel Childhood's End (as were Pink Floyd's 1972 \\"Childhood's End\\" and Van der Graaf Generator's 1976 \\"Childlike Faith in Childhood's End\\"). It opened the band's shows during 1972‚Äì74 and (in abridged form) remained a staple in the band's live set into the 1980s. In later years, it has been played in a medley following the track \\"It\\" (from 1974 The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway), as can be heard on Three Sides Live (1982). The song was never performed with lyrics after Peter Gabriel's departure. \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", Gabriel in Toronto, 1974 During performances, Peter Gabriel wore bat wings on the side of his head, glowing UV make-up around his eyes, and a multicoloured cape. The song was re-recorded in 1972 in a radically altered and shortened single version. This version was re- released in 1998 as part of the Genesis Archive 1967‚Äì75 box set. The song title was used in naming of the tribute album Watcher of the Skies: Genesis Revisited (1996) by ex-Genesis member Steve Hackett. On the album, the lead vocal was provided by John Wetton. In the liner notes to the album, Steve Hackett wrote: The song was played live during the Foxtrot, Selling England by the Pound, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, A Trick of the Tail, and Three Sides Live encore tours. The song was performed live by Phish at the 2010 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on 15 March 2010 at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City. The band also performed \\"No Reply at All\\" after Trey Anastasio's induction speech.

It was headquartered in Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939.

The division was subordinated in peacetime to XVIII Army Corps (XVIII. Armeekorps) when that corps was formed in 1899.Bredow, p. 737. The division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. As the formal name indicates, the division was raised and recruited in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Evolution of the Grand Ducal Hessian Division The Grand Ducal Hessian (25th) Division was officially formed on December 20, 1842, as the Infantry Division Command (Infanterie-Divisions-Kommando), but the division- strength Hessian Army had been around before that date. During the Napoleonic Wars, Hesse fielded a division-strength troop corps (Truppenkorps). In 1820, as part of the Hessian troop contribution to the German Confederation's Federal Army (Bundesheer), Hesse reorganized its army into two brigades of infantry, 1/2 company of horse artillery, two companies of foot artillery, one light horse regiment, one trains company and one sapper (later pioneer) company. This force was placed under the Infantry Division Command in 1842. On February 5, 1849, this force was redesignated the Grand Ducal Army Division (Gro√üherzogliche Armee-Division).Bredow, pp.769-774 The organization of the Grand Ducal Army Division in 1858 was as follows:Bredow, p.772 *Army Division Staff *Guard NCO Company *General Quartermaster Staff with Pioneer Company *Guard Light Horse Regiment *Grand Ducal Artillery Corps *Two infantry brigades of two regiments of two battalions each (8 total battalions, each with 5 companies). In 1860, the cavalry was expanded to brigade strength.Bredow, p.773 In 1867, Hesse, on the losing side of the Austro- Prussian War, entered into a convention with Prussia on military matters and reorganized its division along Prussian lines. The division was redesignated the Grand Ducal Hessian (25th) Division. It formally became a part of the Prussian Army in 1872, in accordance with the military convention of June 13, 1871.Bredow, p.776 The organization of the division at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 was as follows: A.

It then fought at Noiseville and in the Second Battle of Orl√©ans.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935); Wegner, p.777. During World War I, the Grand Ducal Hesse (25th) Infantry Division served on the Western Front. It fought in the opening campaigns, including the Allied Great Retreat that culminated in the First Battle of the Marne, and the subsequent Race to the Sea. After a period in the trenches, the division was heavily engaged in 1916 in the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme. In 1917, it fought in the battle of Passchendaele, also known as the Third Battle of Ypres. In 1918 it participated in the German Spring Offensive and ended the war resisting the subsequent Allied counteroffensives. Allied intelligence rated the division as first class.25\\\\.

Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, he threw and batted right- handed and was listed as tall and . Playing career Gatewood was a graduate of North Little Rock High School and Arkansas State University. He signed with the Detroit Tigers in 1960 and won 11 games in his debut pro season, which was split between the Class C Northern League and Class B Carolina League. During the offseason, he was selected by the brand-new Los Angeles Angels with the 11th pick in the 1960 American League expansion draft. Gatewood struggled to a 3‚Äì10 record and a mediocre 4.64 earned run average for three teams ranging from Class B to Triple-A in 1961. His poor record notwithstanding, he was taken from the Angels in the 1961 Rule 5 draft by another expansion team, the New York Mets, who were set to enter the National League in . But when Gatewood could not crack the Mets' maiden roster in spring training, he was offered back to the Angel organization, where he divided his 1962 campaign between Triple-A and Class B affiliates. Gatewood spent the full minor league season of with the Double-A Nashville Vols, where he made 20 starts and posted a 3.95 ERA. His campaign earned him a September call-up to the Angels for his first taste of major league service. In his first-ever MLB game, on September 11, 1963, he started against the Boston Red Sox at Chavez Ravine and earned a complete game, 4‚Äì1 victory. Gatewood permitted only four hits and one base on balls, striking out five. Gatewood had a shutout until the ninth inning, when Red Sox slugger Dick Stuart led off with a triple and scored two batters later on Russ Nixon's sacrifice fly.Retrosheet box score (11 September 1963): \\"Los Angeles Angels 4, Boston Red Sox 1\\" Gatewood would make another dozen starts as a big leaguer, but his MLB debut would witness his only career complete game. He appeared in four total games that September and out up a stellar ERA of 1.50 in 24 innings pitched. After he spent the first three months of at Triple-A, Gatewood returned to the Angels in July. He once again posted a strong earned run average (2.24, in 15 total games, including seven starts, and 60 innings pitched). That performance paved the way for Gatewood's only full year in the majors, . Working in 46 games, among them three starts, he won four of nine decisions and compiled a 3.42 ERA in 92 innings. But 1965 would be Gatewood's last year in an Angel uniform. He was sent to the minor leagues in , then acquired by the Cincinnati Reds, signaling a journeyman phase of his career that would see him pitch for five different MLB organizations through 1971. Only during the midpoint of the season would Gatewood again experience the major leagues, when he worked in three games in relief for the Atlanta Braves. His first two appearances as a Brave were effective ones; but in his third, on July 8, Gatewood allowed six runs (although only one was earned) in only one-third of an inning in a 13‚Äì0 pasting at the hands of the San Francisco Giants.Retrosheet box score (8 July 1970): \\"San Francisco Giants 13, Atlanta Braves 0\\" It was Gatewood's last game in the big leagues. During his 68-game MLB career, he compiled an 8‚Äì9 won‚Äìlost record and a 2.78 career earned run average; in 178 innings pitched, he permitted 166 hits and 67 bases on balls, striking out 75.

He rose to fame as the manager of the Jaguar Cars sports car racing team in the 1950s, during which time Jaguar cars won the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race on five occasions. After the company's withdrawal from racing England moved into the mainstream management of Jaguar Cars, later succeeding Sir William Lyons as its chairman and Chief Executive, before retiring in 1974. Early life Frank England was born in Finchley, Middlesex, and found an aptitude and interest in motor engineering during his schooling at Christ's College.Wood, J. 1995. Obituaries: Lofty England. The Independent. 9 June 1995. At the age of 14 the England family moved to Edgware. Here the young Frank was able to watch Bentley chassis, built in nearby Cricklewood, being tested along the long, straight A5 road, formerly part of the Roman Road of Watling Street. England was apprenticed as an engineer to the Daimler Company in 1927 where, owing to his 6' 5\\" (196 cm) height, he quickly acquired the nickname, \\"Lofty\\", which would stick with him for the rest of his life. Daimler had not been England's first choice; his early experiences had led him originally to apply to Bentley, but without success. During his five-year apprenticeship Lofty England also made his first appearances in motorsport. In 1932, his final year as an apprentice, England finished second in the inaugural RAC Rally, driving one of Laurence Pomeroy's Daimler Double Six cars. Being based in Hendon also meant that England could easily attend race meetings at the Brooklands circuit in Surrey, and he became a familiar face at the Track. England the race engineer On completing his apprenticeship Lofty England found that his technical skills, allied to his motorsport enthusiasm, meant that he was in great demand among the gentlemen racers of the early 1930s. His first employer was 1931 Le Mans winner \\"Tim\\" Birkin. Under Charles Newcombe, England developed Birkin's Blower Bentley cars at his Welwyn Garden City workshop. Although Birkin took the lap record at Brooklands, at over 137 mph, the car was not a success, and following Birkin's death in 1933 the Blower Bentley project folded. Both England and Newcombe transferred to American Whitney Straight's new motor racing team in 1934, where results began to flow immediately. The team was extremely well financed ‚Äì Straight was head of Straight Corporation Ltd., an early service provider in the booming aeronautical sector ‚Äì and could afford for his Maserati 8C to be serviced at the Maserati factory in Italy, accompanied by England. Straight and his team not only raised the Brooklands lap record for 5-litre cars to over 138 mph, but Straight also won the inaugural South African Grand Prix in 1934. However, following Straight's marriage in 1935 the team was wound up and Lofty England found himself out of work once again. A brief spell at ERA was punctuated with spells working for Alvis, before Raymond Mays fired him in 1936. His time at ERA was not happy, mainly due to the works' lax attitude toward their customers' cars, but he was employed by Dick Seaman almost immediately following his ignominious exit. Unfortunately for England, what may have proved to be a productive relationship with the up-and-coming Grand Prix star was curtailed in late 1936 when Seaman signed for the dominant Mercedes-Benz racing team. When Seaman's Delage was sold to Siamese princes Chula and Bira, England moved with it. Prince Chula ran the cousins' White Mouse Stable racing team with efficiency and organisation, a pattern that England would come to model his own teams on. During nearly two years with the aristocratic pair, England's ERA experience meant that R2B Romulus and R5B Remus were always immaculately prepared and, along with the team's more modern Maserati, provided B. Bira (Prince Bira's nom de course) with many race wins both in the UK and throughout Europe. Although the initial intention had been to rebuild Seaman's Delage, England was fully occupied with the operational race cars and the project was abandoned. Throughout his time as a race engineer Lofty England maintained his own active motorsport career. An early gift of a Douglas motorcycle from his father had started him on a successful motorcycle racing path. His best result was second place in the 1936 Manx Grand Prix. In 1938 England moved out of racing for the first time, taking a job back with Alvis, but this time at the Coventry company's headquarters. He rapidly rose from service engineer to become superintendent of the service department by the outbreak of the Second World War. This was Lofty England's first experience of management responsibility, and as a reserved occupation he remained with Alvis, now a military contractor, for the first two years of conflict. However, in 1941 England volunteered for pilot training and qualified as a bomber pilot, probably excluded from fighter pilot postings due to his height. He served as a training instructor to the USAAF in Texas until 1943, when he returned to the RAF for active service flying Avro Lancasters. Post-war Jaguar motorsport After demobilisation in 1945 Lofty England briefly moved back to Alvis, but the company had been badly affected by wartime bombing raids and through close friend Walter Hassan he secured a move to fellow Coventry firm Jaguar Cars in early 1946. He initially joined Jaguar in the same role that he had filled at Alvis, that of service manager. The company did not have any motorsport plans at this stage, but in the hands of a few privateer owner-drivers Jaguar's new XK120, introduced in 1948, proved to be competitive with the more specialised offerings from continental manufacturers. 1949‚Äì1952: The XK120 era William Heynes' straight-6 XK engine proved eminently tunable and Heynes and England were quick to see the potential benefits of a works motorsport effort. Jaguar's newly formed Engineering Competition Department provided six top pre-war drivers (including England's old employer Prince Bira) with lightweight, pre-production, aluminium-bodied XK120s in 1949, and results were encouraging. Leslie Johnson won major sports car races in Britain and America that year and took fifth in the 1950 Mille Miglia, the Jaguar beaten only by works Ferraris and Alfa Romeos. At the 1950 24 Hours of Le Mans Johnson and Bert Hadley ran as high as second before mechanical failure forced them out when lying third near the end, while other XK120s finished 12th and 15th. Stirling Moss drove another of the pre-production cars, entered by Tommy Wisdom, to a dominant victory in the 1950 Dundrod TT, his speed in the rain also winning him a place in Jaguar's 1951 Le Mans team.Porter, P. 1995. Jaguar Sports Racing Cars Bay View Books, Works-prepared XK120s won numerous other events including the Tulip Rally in 1950 and the Alpine Rally in 1950, 1951 and 1952. In 1952 Lofty England and several factory mechanics supported a high-speed endurance run at Linas- Montlh√©ry, where Johnson, Moss, Hadley and Jack Fairman drove a works-modified XK120 coup√©, the personal car of William Heynes, at an average of just over 100 mph for seven days and nights to break nine speed and endurance records. 1951‚Äì1953: The C-Type era While results continued to come with the production XK120 model, England and Heynes realised that it was too overweight and aerodynamically compromised to have a serious chance of winning the Le Mans race. Their solution was to take the drivetrain from the XK120 and to install it in a lightweight chassis. William Heynes developed a new design with a new frame chassis and new bodywork with air flow shape developed by aerodynamist Malcolm Sayer. The XK120C (for competition), later known as the C-Type, made its debut at the Le Mans race. Lofty England's racing experience and sharp strategic thinking required that Moss and co-driver Jack Fairman act as a \\"hare\\", driving hard from the start to draw other cars into chasing it in the hope that their cars would fail. The strategy worked almost entirely as planned. Moss posted a new lap record of 105.232 mph before the lead Jaguar failed after 92 laps. However, the failure of the Ferrari and Talbot-Lago competition by this time allowed Peter Walker and Peter Whitehead's car to inherit the lead, which by the end of the 24 hours they had extended to nine laps. Lofty England's debutant team had scored a striking victory over 19 cars with engines larger than the C-Type's, but more was to come. The event was nowhere near as successful, as modifications made to the bodywork caused overheating and all three works cars failed before an hour had elapsed. However, for England's Jaguars were back at La Sarthe with improved engines, the original bodywork, and innovative all-wheel disc brakes. On this occasion the team scored another victory, improved reliability allowing the green cars to take second and fourth places as well. Lofty England's contribution to the C-Type's success was crucial. Taking a lead from Alfred Neubauer's running of the pre-war Mercedes team, he ran the Jaguar squad always with an eye for the greater good of Jaguar, rather than the individual demands of any one driver. The 1953 Le Mans event was a case in point, as the Jaguar cars were initially excluded for a technical infringement. The eventual winning driver pairing of Duncan Hamilton and Tony Rolt repaired to a bar, while Lofty England took matters in hand and managed to persuade the Automobile Club de l'Ouest to reinstate the cars. Legend has it that, unfortunately for England, his drivers were, by this time, a little the worse for wear, and it took all of England's managerial and motivational talents to get them into the car for the start.Randall, H. 2003. Replay: 14 June 1953. The Independent on Sunday. 22 June 2003. England and Rolt both later denied that the drivers had been at all drunk at the time.Daily Telegraph obituary of Tony Rolt, February 2 2008. Retrieved on 3 August 2008.Obituary of Tony Rolt by Alan Henry, February 9 2008. Retrieved on 3 August 2008. 1954‚Äì1957: The D-Type era For 1954 Lofty England decided that Jaguar had taken the C-Type as far is they could, and a new car was designed around the successful XK engine. Appropriately, the iconic D-Type made its debut at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans race, where Hamilton and Rolt were beaten into second place by only one lap, by the Ferrari 375 of Formula One stars Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez and Maurice Trintignant. The event was poised to be a direct contest between England's Jaguars, and the Mercedes team of Alfred Neubauer. Tragically, an accident triggered by the D-Type of Mike Hawthorn caused the deaths of Mercedes driver Pierre Levegh and 83 spectators, plus injuring 120 others. Neubauer's team were withdrawn from the race some hours later and invited Jaguar to share the gesture, but England decided to keep the Jaguars running. Lofty England attracted some criticism for his decision after the race but, as he maintained for the rest of his life, England did not regard Hawthorn as being at all responsible for the tragedy and therefore the team had no reason to withdraw. The decision was typical of the unsentimental, hard nosed manner in which Lofty England ran the team, demanding complete loyalty and adherence to the team principal from his drivers. When, at Reims in early 1956, Le Mans hero Duncan Hamilton ignored England's pit signals, the team manager fired him on the spot. The 1956 24 Hours of Le Mans was to be the last outing for the works Jaguar team. However, there was to be no swansong for Lofty England's squad. The new longnose D-Type variant could only manage sixth place. Fortunately for Jaguar, Lofty England had always encouraged privateer teams and ensured that serious contenders received as much help as the works could offer, and it was one of these teams, Ecurie Ecosse which scored the D-Type's victory that year. The Scottish team would also go on to win the race with an England-supplied, ex-works longnose car the following year. England also ensured that Jaguar's name remained prominent in motorsport by providing support for both privateer entrants of Jaguar cars, and for Jaguar-engined specials built by the likes of Lister and John Tojeiro. England's hope of helping Jaguar return to Le Mans in 1966 with the Jaguar XJ13 unfortunately came to nought and the one-and-only Le Mans Prototype was destined to never race. Jaguar management career Immediately following Jaguar's withdrawal from racing Lofty England returned to his role as director of the Jaguar service department. In 1958 Tony Vandervell offered to sell England the Vanwall Formula One team, after the death of Vandervell's prot√©g√© Stuart Lewis-Evans during the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix. England refused the offer and was never directly involved in motorsport again. Instead, Lofty England began to climb the corporate ladder within Jaguar. England's alma mater, Daimler, merged with Jaguar in 1960, and in 1961 Lofty England joined the Jaguar board as assistant managing director. During the following five years he was heavily involved in the negotiations which resulted in the merger of Jaguar with BMC to form British Motor Holdings in 1966. At the end of 1967, on the retirement from the managing directorship of Sir William Lyons, Lofty England and William Heynes succeeded him as joint managing directors of the company. In turn, BMH merged with Leyland Motors in 1968 to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation. In between the management upheaval, Lofty England invited back old friend Walter Hassan to develop Jaguar's XJ V12 engine. The engine made its debut in the Series III version of Jaguar's ageing E-Type in 1971, one year before Lofty England succeeded William Lyons as chairman and Chief Executive of Jaguar Cars. It was during his time as CEO that England had to negotiate with the unions to ensure that the car the V12 was built for, the V12 version of the Jaguar XJ saloon, was not delayed into production. Reflecting his own previous success and the Daimler company history, England decided that the Daimler version of the V12 should be called the Double Six. With increasing industrial tensions and centralised decision making within British Leyland, England felt that his position was untenable and, aged 63, he retired to Austria in 1974. Post- retirement During his time at Jaguar, Frank \\"Lofty\\" England was probably second only to Sir William Lyons himself in determining the corporate direction and public image of Jaguar Cars. Following his retirement, although he had no direct involvement with the company, England always maintained an interest in Jaguar's fortunes. After moving to Austria during retirement, England became a consultant to Reliant Motor Company of Tamworth, Staffordshire, UK. The company wished to establish a European distribution network for its Scimitar GTE sports estate car following the development of its more refined SE6 version in 1986. England was successful in assisting Reliant to appoint importers and distributors in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. England died in 1995, at the age of 83.

It is located on the B5429 road, to the north east of Denbigh and to the east of St Asaph. The community includes the village of Rhuallt. The town was part of the traditional lands of the Salusbury family and the Cotton baronets. It was dominated by these two families until the early part of the 20th century. It briefly became well known during the fin de si√®cle after a series of dinosaur bones were found in the area. It does not possess a shop or any other commercial activity although one pub, the Salusbury Arms, operates daily with the exception of Monday. Demographics In the 2001 Census, Tremeirchion Ward had a population of 1,589 people, although the civil parish figure for the community was 636. These figures changed at the 2011 census to :Ward population 1,649: Community population= 703 Residents in this community had a median household income of ¬£32,400 as of 2006, and 8.9% of residents claimed some sort of disability payment from the government. As of 2001, 2.64% of residents were immigrants. The population from the 2011 census was 703. Education The community is served by a small Welsh medium primary school, Ysgol Tremeirchion. According to the latest Estyn inspection report in 2018, there are 73 pupils between three and eleven years old on roll, including 12 part-time nursery age children. 66% of pupils came from homes where Welsh is spoken. The majority of secondary school students attend classes in larger regional schools located in St Asaph or Denbigh. Tremeirchion is also home to St Beuno's College, a Jesuit college at which the Victorian era poet and Jesuit priest Gerard Manley Hopkins studied. It now runs spiritual retreats of varying durations.

Like many other songs written by Davies, it is to some degree influenced by British Music Hall. It was originally released as a non-album single, but has since been included as one of several bonus tracks from the Face to Face CD. The song, like many others by the group, deals with the poverty and misery found in the lower classes of English society. The song was a big success in the UK, reaching #5 on the singles charts, but only reached #73 in the United States. In 1976 it ranked #72 on New Musical Express's list of the Top 100 Singles of All Time. Some labels list the song as \\"Deadend Street\\". Promotional film A mimed promotional film (precursor to the modern music video) was produced for the song in late 1966. It was filmed on Little Green Street, a diminutive eighteenth century lane in North London, located off Highgate Road in Kentish Town. Little Green Street, location of the \\"Dead End Street\\" Music Video. The film was shot in black and white, and featured each member of the band dressed as an undertaker, as well as playing various other characters throughout. With a length of roughly 3:15 in total. Dave Davies says that the BBC disliked the film, with the group dressed as Victorian pallbearers and one of their roadies in a nightshirt suddenly leaping out of the coffin as they put it down on the pavement, claiming it was in bad taste. The song was recorded at a time when bassist Pete Quaife had left the band after a scooter accident, and was replaced by John Dalton. Quaife had returned to the group by the time the promotional film was shot. Covers and alternative versions \\"Dead End Street\\" has been covered by the Jam. The song and its music video influenced Oasis's #1 hit \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" from 2005. An unreleased alternative recording of the song from October 1966 was issued in December 2008 on the Kinks 6-CD box set Picture Book. In 2010, Davies also recorded this as a duet with Amy Macdonald on the album See My Friends.

As such, they are only used in inter-frame compression techniques. In older video encoding standards, such as MPEG-2, only one reference frame ‚Äì the previous frame ‚Äì was used for P-frames. Two reference frames (one past and one future) were used for B-frames. Multiple reference frames Some modern video encoding standards, such as H.264/AVC, allow the use of multiple reference frames. This allows the video encoder to choose among more than one previously decoded frame on which to base each macroblock in the next frame. While the best frame for this purpose is usually the previous frame, the extra reference frames can improve compression efficiency and/or video quality. Note that different reference frames can be chosen for different macroblocks in the same frame. The maximum number of concurrent reference frames supported by H.264 is 16. Different reference frames can be chosen for each 8x8 partition of a macroblock. Another video format that supports multiple reference frames is Snow, which can handle up to eight. The Theora codec provides a limited form of multiple reference frames, allowing references to both the preceding frame and the most recent intra frame. DisadvantagesEncoding= Multiple reference frames can considerably increase encoding time because many of the decisions, such as motion estimation, that are ordinarily carried out only on one reference frame have to be repeated on all of the reference frames. Heuristics can be used to reduce this speed cost at the cost of quality. Very high numbers of reference frames are rarely useful in terms of quality for live-action material because frames from farther back in time generally have less and less correlation with the current frame. This is not as true for animated sources, where repetitive motion can make high numbers of reference frames more useful. =Decoding= When decoding, reference frames must be stored in memory until they are no longer needed for further decoding. This can considerably raise the memory usage of the decoder for videos with large numbers of reference frames. The use of several reference frames also decreases locality of reference, which might cause a speed impact. Stand-alone players that can play AVC/MKV files from recorded DVDs or USB sticks may not be able to handle the full 16 REF frames.

It was founded in 1907. The school emphasises science and technology education; in 2006, they invested over RMB30,000,000 in computing and network facilities.  History  Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School was founded in 1907 by Mr. Zhongmo Kuang, a well reputed local entrepreneur. Mr Kuang started his career in cotton yarning and expanded his business into real state and finance. He founded Kuang's Senior High School in his home town, the Yong's Villa, which was the predecessor of Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School. Kuang's Senior High provided local teenagers both traditional confusianism education and modern science like math and physics. During the World War 2, Mr. Kuang's major possession, the Penglai Market in Shanghai downtown, was destroyed by Japanese army, and the Kuang's Senior High was forced to close down until 1952, 3 years after the China Civil War. In 1952, the local Wuxi government wanted to rebuild Kuang's Senior High School, both the campus and the great reputation of the Kuang's education. The Kuang's Senior High School was renamed as the Senior High of Wuxi County. In 1996, it is renamed again as Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School, and became a public high school run by the Jiangsu Province Government.

Like other cleaner wrasses, it eats parasites and dead tissue off larger fishes' skin in a mutualistic relationship that provides food and protection for the wrasse, and considerable health benefits for the other fishes.  Description  This is a small wrasse, averaging 10 cm long (14 cm max). It can be recognized thanks to a wide longitudinal black stripe running along the side and eye; the back and the stomach are white (sometimes slightly yellowish). This white part changes to a bright blue on the front of the animal, while the black band widens at the tail. The young are black with an electric blue line. A genetic analysis of L. dimidiatus revealed the population fell into two monophyletic clades, with Indian Ocean populations generally having different stripe widths to western Pacific fishes. The Japanese cleaner wrasses, though, fell within the same group as Indian Ocean fish, despite differing in appearance, and both clades overlap around Papua New Guinea. Two closely related cleaner wrasse species, Labroides pectoralis and Labroides bicolor, were grouped inside the L. dimidiatus clade, so the bluestreak cleaner wrasse may in fact be polyphyletic, incorporating several species.

It was first recorded from the Kermadec Islands Marine Reserve north of New Zealand in 2015, after researchers examined hundreds of hours of unused documentary film footage. Cleaning Drawing. Cleaner wrasses are usually found at cleaning stations. Cleaning stations are occupied by different units of cleaner wrasses, such as a group of youths, a pair of adults, or a group of females accompanied by a dominant male. When visitors come near the cleaning stations, the cleaner wrasses greet the visitors by performing a dance-like motion in which they move their rear up and down. The visitors are referred to as \\"clients\\". Bluestreak cleaner wrasses clean to consume ectoparasites on client fish for food. The bigger fish recognise them as cleaner fish because they have a lateral stripe along the length of their bodies, and by their movement patterns. Cleaner wrasses greet visitors in an effort to secure the food source and cleaning opportunity with the client.

Another species, the bluestreak fangblenny, Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos, mimics juvenile cleaner wrasse so its presence is tolerated by the cleaners, which, it is assumed, enables it to take advantage of the concentration of potential victims.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and oval to barrel-shaped fruit. Description The pink bloodwood is tree that can reach in height with a spread. The bark is rough, tessellated, light brown to grey in colour and extends from the trunk to the branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, leathery, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded or beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from December to March and the profuse perfumed white or cream flowers are up to in diameter. The fruit is an urn- shaped, oval or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with a short neck and the valves enclosed in the fruit. The pink bloodwood resembles the red bloodwood, and the two species co-occur in central New South Wales. The latter species can be distinguished by its larger gumnuts and winged seeds. Taxonomy Richard Thomas Baker was the first to formally describe the pink bloodwood in 1901, naming it Eucalyptus intermedia, and publishing the description in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The species name is derived from the Latin adjective intermedius and is based on the intermediate nature of the oils between the red and yellow bloodwoods. In 1995, the genus Eucalyptus was split into three genera by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson, with E. intermedia transferred into Corymbia. Hill and Johnson classified Corymbia intermedia in its own series Intermediae, A combined analysis of nuclear rDNA (ETS + ITS) and morphological characters published in 2009 found it to be closely related to C. trachyphloia and C. hendersonii. C. intermedia and other species were placed in the large section Septentrionales within the subgenus Corymbia. The common name comes from the gum veins in the wood. Distribution and habitat The species is found in New South Wales from Gloucester northwards into Queensland, as far as to Cape York ‚Äî a total range of ‚Äî and within of the eastern coastline. It trives on loamy and sandy soils, and has been found on altitudes of up to , with annual rainfall of 750‚Äì2200 mm and predominantly summer rain. It grows in open forest, or occasionally lone trees grow in closed forest or on the margins of rainforests. It is associated with such species as carbeen (Corymbia tesselaris), broad-leaved stringybark (Eucalyptus caliginosa), forest red gum (E. tereticornis), narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra), scribbly gum (E. racemosa), grey gum (E. propinqua), blackbutt (E. pilularis), flooded gum (E. grandis), red mahogany (E. resinifera), and black sheoak (Allocasuarina littoralis) and red wattle (Acacia flavescens) in coastal north Queensland. Ecology In Bungawalbin National Park in northern New South Wales, the squirrel glider( Petaurus norfolcensis) has been observed biting and gouging into the bark to make a wound on the trunk of the pink bloodwood and then lick the sap out. The behaviour has also been recorded for the yellow-bellied glider (P. australis) for this species. Study of the forest habitat of the sugar glider (P. breviceps) and mahogany glider ( P. gracilis) found that the presence of pink bloodwood was corellated with the presence of the former and absence of the latter species. Study of the impact of perioding burning in forest in southeastern Queensland found no significant difference in trunk diameter of pink bloodwoods in unburnt forest compared with forests burnt every two or four years. Uses The dark pink to reddish-brown heartwood is hard and durable usable for building fences and bridges. The sawdust of pink bloodwood is an irritant to eyes and skin.

It's named after Friedhelm Waldhausen, who introduced this notion (under the term category with cofibrations and weak equivalences) to extend the methods of algebraic K-theory to categories not necessarily of algebraic origin, for example the category of topological spaces. Definition Let C be a category, co(C) and we(C) two classes of morphisms in C, called cofibrations and weak equivalences respectively. The triple (C, co(C), we(C)) is called a Waldhausen category if it satisfies the following axioms, motivated by the similar properties for the notions of cofibrations and weak homotopy equivalences of topological spaces: * C has a zero object, denoted by 0; * isomorphisms are included in both co(C) and we(C); * co(C) and we(C) are closed under composition; * for each object A ‚àà C the unique map 0 ‚Üí A is a cofibration, i.e. is an element of co(C); * co(C) and we(C) are compatible with pushouts in a certain sense. For example, if \\\\scriptstyle A\\\\, \\\\rightarrowtail\\\\, B is a cofibration and \\\\scriptstyle A\\\\,\\\\to\\\\, C is any map, then there must exist a pushout \\\\scriptstyle B\\\\, \\\\cup_A\\\\, C, and the natural map \\\\scriptstyle C\\\\, \\\\rightarrowtail\\\\, B\\\\,\\\\cup_A\\\\, C should be cofibration: center Relations with other notions In algebraic K-theory and homotopy theory there are several notions of categories equipped with some specified classes of morphisms. If C has a structure of an exact category, then by defining we(C) to be isomorphisms, co(C) to be admissible monomorphisms, one obtains a structure of a Waldhausen category on C. Both kinds of structure may be used to define K-theory of C, using the Q-construction for an exact structure and S-construction for a Waldhausen structure. An important fact is that the resulting K-theory spaces are homotopy equivalent. If C is a model category with a zero object, then the full subcategory of cofibrant objects in C may be given a Waldhausen structure.  S-construction  The Waldhausen S-construction produces from a Waldhausen category C a sequence of Kan complexes S_n(C), which forms a spectrum. Let K(C) denote the loop space of the geometric realization S_*(C) of S_*(C). Then the group :\\\\pi_n K(C) = \\\\pi_{n+1} S_*(C) is the n-th K-group of C. Thus, it gives a way to define higher K-groups. Another approach for higher K-theory is Quillen's Q-construction. The construction is due to Friedhelm Waldhausen. biWaldhausen categories A category C is equipped with bifibrations if it has cofibrations and its opposite category COP has so also. In that case, we denote the fibrations of COP by quot(C). In that case, C is a biWaldhausen category if C has bifibrations and weak equivalences such that both (C, co(C), we) and (COP, quot(C), weOP) are Waldhausen categories. Waldhausen and biWaldhausen categories are linked with algebraic K-theory. There, many interesting categories are complicial biWaldhausen categories. For example: The category \\\\scriptstyle C^b(\\\\mathcal{A}) of bounded chain complexes on an exact category \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{A}. The category \\\\scriptstyle S_n \\\\mathcal{C} of functors \\\\scriptstyle \\\\operatorname{Ar}(\\\\Delta ^n)\\\\, \\\\to\\\\, \\\\mathcal{C} when \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{C} is so. And given a diagram \\\\scriptstyle I, then \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{C}^I is a nice complicial biWaldhausen category when \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{C} is.  References  * * C.

These products differ from prepackaged dehydrated noodles in a number of ways: in flavor, in texture, and in that they normally come packaged with ingredients besides the noodles, such as vegetables, meat, and soup stock. Types Chilled or frozen applications are applied to udon and Chinese-style noodles. For either type, the idea is that just 20‚Äì60 seconds of immersion in boiling water is necessary to reach a ready-to-eat state. Frozen noodles typically take less than two minutes to thaw and cook when placed in boiling water. Boiled and raw frozen noodles are the most commonly produced varieties, with raw varieties being produced less than boiled ones due to problems with dehydration that may occur when raw noodles are stored frozen. Soba (buckwheat) noodles are also manufactured as frozen noodles. Production The production of both chilled and frozen noodles starts with boiled noodles cooked to an optimum state of doneness, generally considered as having a moisture gradient at the surface of the noodles of 80% moisture absorption, and at the core of the noodles of 50% moisture absorption. After boiling, chilled noodles are placed into packaging followed by refrigeration at between . Frozen noodles, by contrast, are flash frozen using either air blast technology, a contact freezer or a combination of both, usually at for 30 minutes. Both processes induce a swelling of the starch that reduces deterioration and thus extends the noodles' shelf-life. In production, the boiling time for frozen noodles can be determined from a calculation that subtracts the cooking time of frozen boiled noodles from the total boiling time of fresh noodles. Mass-produced frozen noodles are sometimes packaged first, and then flash frozen. Flash freezing noodles can retain their quality of freshness for up to one year when kept properly frozen. Sales Frozen noodles (in the upper-right corner) and frozen dumplings As of 2001, chilled noodles accounted for sales of ¬•400 billion yuan worldwide (approximately $8.5 billion U.S. as of 2001) while frozen noodles accounted for sales of ¬•70 billion yuan worldwide (approximately $48.3 billion U.S. as of 2001). A large part of these revenues were accounted for by sale to restaurants; frozen noodles are mostly sold from factories directly to restaurants. Characteristics Frozen noodles have been cited as having advantages over dried noodles, the process tending to make them less sticky, firmer and thicker than their dried counterparts. Both frozen and dehydrated noodles have a longer shelf-life than chilled noodles, which tend to clump after approximately two weeks of refrigeration due to gelatinisation of starch. While both frozen and chilled noodles offer convenience for the mass market, and for short preparation times, each have been found to cause loss of optimal texture when tested using alkaline and white salted noodles. In a 2001 study by D. W. Hatcher and M. J. Anderson of the Canadian Grain Commission, textural attributes of the frozen variety were tested at 1 and 4 weeks after frozen storage, and the chilled variety at the 30 minute and 1, 2 and 7 days marks. Both the frozen and the chilled noodles showed a decline in textural characteristics which increased in severity the further forward in time they were sampled after storage. It was also indicated that the texture of raw frozen noodles, cooked after defrosting, as opposed to precooked and then frozen noodles, fared much better.

Born in Firlej√≥w near Berezhany, he graduated from a gymnasium in Berezhany and then the Lviv seminary. In 1842, he became a Greek-Catholic priest.http://www.irp.te.ua/content/topicpage/?category_id=43574538&item;_id=447585690 In the late 1860s, a Galician priest, Father Stepan Kachala, made an inquiry into the causes of the Ukrainian peasant‚Äôs poverty and then formulated a social program that the Greek Catholic clergy as a whole soon adopted for its own. He did not find the roots of the peasant‚Äôs poverty where secular investigators have suggested these roots lay: in the inequitable terms of emancipation, in the transition to a money economy, and in the absence of factory industry to absorb the surplus labor in the countryside. Instead, Father Kalacha found the peasant guilty of vices that led to his impoverishment: drunkenness, prodigality, and sloth. As antidotes to these vices, he suggested, among other things, abstinence, thrift, and enterprise.http://www.huri.harvard.edu/pdf/hus_volumes/vII_n2june1978.pdf From 1861, Rev Stepan Kachala was a Ukrainian representative to the Galician Sejm, and a head of the Ruthenian Club (Ukrainian –†—É—Å—å–∫i–π –∫–ª—É–±, Polish Klub Ruski) in the parliament in 1883-1888.

He appeared in 370 major league games, 172 as a second baseman, 73 as a first baseman, 23 as an outfielder, three as a third baseman, and two as a shortstop. During his major league career, he compiled a .249 batting average and a .330 on-base percentage. Early years Kavanagh was born in Harrison, New Jersey, in 1891. His parents Charles and Mary Kavanagh immigrated from Ireland in 1886. At the time of the 1900 U.S. Census, his father worked as a day laborer.1900 U.S. Census entry for Charles Kavanagh and family.

In 111 games with the White Roses, he had a .357 batting average. After the season, the Detroit Tigers bought his contract, and he made his major league debut the following season on April 18, 1914. In July 1914, Kavanagh forgot to set his alarm and missed part of a game; backup infielder Billy Purtell's poor play led to the Tigers losing the game as a result. Kavanagh finished the 1914 season with a .248 batting average and 16 stolen bases in 128 games. In 1915, he had his best year in professional baseball. In 113 games, 44 at first base and 42 at second base, he had a .295 batting average and 13 triples. In 1916, Kavanagh struggled; his average fell to .141 in 58 games for the Tigers. On September 2, 1916, the Tigers released Kavanagh, and he joined the Cleveland Indians. He played 19 games for the Indians in the final month of the 1916 season. In one of those games, on September 24, Kavanagh hit a grand slam as a pinch hitter, the first time in American League history that had happened. He appeared in 14 games with the Indians in 1917 and 13 to start the 1918 season. On May 25, 1918, Kavanagh signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. He spent the rest of the 1918 season with the Cardinals, the minor league Milwaukee Brewers, and the Tigers, retiring from the game after the season ended. In 370 major league games, he had a .249 batting average and .330 on-base percentage. Later years Kavanagh was married to Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Fitzsimmons on December 2, 1916.

Indigenous Australians of different language groups have different names for the tree. The Nungali peoples know the tree as narrga or gunjid, the Mulluk- Mulluk know it as dawart, the Yangman know it as bodog, the Gurindji peoples as jadburru and the Wagiman as jagatjjin. It is a medium-sized tree with rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white or cream-coloured flowers and barrel-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia polycarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes , and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, tessellated, flaky and brownish bark on the trunk and branches. Older bark is grey brown and newer bark is red-brown in colour. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptic to lance-shaped leaves that are up to long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are usually glossy green, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of the branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven or nine buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. The buds have a whitish scaly surface due to the fragmenting rubber cuticle. Flowering occurs from April to August and the flowers are white or cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody, elongated barrel- shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the four valves enclosed in the fruit. The seeds are brown, ellipsoidal and long with a wing on the end. This species is distinguished from C. clarksoniana. C. ligans and C. novoguinensis in the basis of fruit shape. Taxonomy The species was first formally described as Eucalyptus polycarpa by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859 in the Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany. It was reclassified into the genus Corymbia in 1995 by Ken Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in the journal Telopea. Distribution Corymbia polycarpa is found in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and northwestern New South Wales. The species is quite common between Broome and Derby in Western Australia through the Kimberley region of Western Australia extending east over the Top End of the Northern Territory including nearby islands and across the Gulf of Carpentaria and southern Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. It is found near watercourses, in depressions or on floodplains growing in sandy or silty alluvium and less commonly in cracking clays and in skeletal sandstone or lateritic soils. Uses The timber from the tree is a very durable, with an above-ground life expectancy in excess of 40 years which drops to 25 years when used in-ground. The timber is vulnerable to termite attack and untreated sapwood is prone to damage by lyctine borers. It is a hardwood and difficult to work with hand tools. It is mostly used as round timber rather than sawn timber as a result of the numerous kino veins. It has been used as poles, railway sleepers, mining supports, for fencing and house stumps. Indigenous Australians used the gum medicinally as an antiseptic liquid to treat cuts, sores, burns, ulcers and yaws.

License manufacture of the As 014 was carried out in Japan in the latter stages of World War II, as the Maru Ka10 for the Kawanishi Baika kamikaze jet. The United States reverse- engineered the design for the Ford PJ31 powering the Republic-Ford JB-2 cruise missile and the experimental USAAF-developed JB-4 television-guided bomb. Development The origins of the Argus As 014 lie in 1928, when Munich inventor Paul Schmidt began work on a new design of pulse jet engine. Schmidt received a patent on his design in 1931 and received support from the German Air Ministry in 1933. In 1934, along with Professor Georg Madelung, Schmidt proposed a \\"flying bomb\\" to be powered by his pulse jet to the Ministry and received a development contract the following year. In 1938 he demonstrated a pulse jet‚Äìpowered pilotless bomber, but the project was shelved by the Air Ministry as the prototype lacked range and accuracy and was expensive to construct. That same year, however, the Argus Company began work on a flying bomb using Schmidt's engine. Schmidt later joined Argus in 1940. Design Diagram showing operation of a valved pulsejet A model of simplicity and low cost, the engine was made from a sheet of mild steel rolled into a tube. At the front of the engine there was a spring flap-valve grid (shutters), a fuel inlet valve and an igniter. It could run on any grade of petroleum fuel and its shutter system was not expected to last longer than one flight, as it had an operational life of approximately one hour. The engine was a resonant jet which, contrary to popular legend, could operate while the V-1 was stationary on its launch ramp after reaching minimum operating temperature. Ignition was initiated by an automotive-type spark plug located about behind the shutter system, electricity to the plug being supplied from a portable starting unit. Three air nozzles in the front of the pulse jet were connected to an external high pressure air source which was used to start the engine. Acetylene was used for starting, and very often a panel of wood or similar was held across the end of the tailpipe to prevent the fuel from diffusing and escaping before ignition was complete. Once the engine had been started and the temperature rose to the minimum operating level, the external air hose and connectors were removed and the resonant design of the tailpipe kept the pulse jet firing. Each cycle or pulse of the engine began with the shutters open; fuel was injected behind them and ignited, and the resulting expansion of gases forced the shutters closed. As the pressure in the engine dropped following combustion, the shutters reopened and the cycle was repeated, roughly 45 to 55 times per second. The electrical ignition system was needed only to start the engine - a V-1 carried no coils or magnetos to power the spark plug once launched. Since the engine was rather simple, low-grade gasoline could be used and a good amount of thrust -- 2.7 kN (660 lbf) -- was produced, but it was inefficient, limiting the range of the V-1 to The resonant frequency of this combustion process was around 45 Hz, giving the V-1 its nicknames \\"buzz bomb\\" or \\"doodlebug\\", because of the sputtering sound it emitted. Operational history London Science Museum The prototype engine was tested while slung below a Gotha Go 145 Luftwaffe training biplane marked D-IIWS in April 1941] and the first prototype V-1 flew on December 24 of 1942. The As 014, as well as the higher thrust As 044 pulsejet engine, was also under consideration as a power source for various last-ditch German fighters in the closing days of World War II. Production totaled 31,100 units.Gunston 1989, p.17. After the Second World War the As 014 was reverse-engineered / copied for use by the United States as the Ford PJ31 on the Republic-Ford JB-2 (Fieseler Fi 103 copy), and by the Soviet Union as the Chelomey D-3 on the 10Kh (also a Fieseler Fi 103 copy).

She tended seaplanes during World War II in the Pacific in combat areas and earned three battle stars by war's end. After her U.S. Navy career ended, the ship served in the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC Bering Strait (WAVP-382), later WHEC-382, from 1948 to 1971, seeing service in the Vietnam War. The Coast Guard decommissioned her at the beginning of 1971, and she was transferred to South Vietnam and served in the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i (HQ-02) until South Vietnams collapse at the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975. She fled to the Philippines, where she was incorporated into the Philippine Navy, in which she served from 1980 to 1985 as the frigate BRP Diego Silang (PF-9) and as BRP Diego Silang (PF-14) from 1987 to 1990. Construction and commissioning USS Bering Strait (AVP-34) is launched at Lake Washington Shipyard, Houghton, Washington, on 15 January 1944.Bering Strait was laid down on 7 June 1943 at Houghton, Washington, by Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 15 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. George F. Cornwall, and commissioned at her builder's yard on 19 July 1944 with Commander Walter D. Innis in command. United States Navy service After fitting out and conducting her initial sea trials in Puget Sound, Bering Strait departed Seattle, Washington, on 10 August 1944. She reached Naval Air Station Alameda at Alameda, California, on 13 August 1944. From 17 August 1944 to 13 September 1944, she conducted her shakedown, covering areas such as ship control, communications, general drills, engineering and damage control instruction, gunnery training, and antiaircraft and antisubmarine work. Proceeding to Los Angeles, California, upon completion of that training, Bering Strait underwent two weeks of repairs and alterations at Terminal Island Naval Drydocks at Terminal Island, California. World War IITraining operations in Hawaii= Reporting for duty with the United States Pacific Fleet on 2 October 1944, Bering Strait sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 3 October 1944. She arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 9 October, and on 13 October 1944 sailed for Hilo, Hawaii. Arriving there on 14 October, she established a seaplane base at Kuhio Bay and, until 5 November, carried out training with successive detachments of Glenn L. Martin Company PBM Mariner flying boats. She tended six Martin PBM-3Ds from Patrol Bombing Squadron 25 (VPB-25) from 14 to 19 October 1944 and a second detachment of six PBM-3Ds from the same squadron between 19 and 29 October 1944, after which time she tended six Mariners from Patrol Bombing Squadron 26 (VPB-26). Concluding those advanced base activities on 5 November 1944, she sailed for Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay at Kaneohe, Hawaii, the same day. Arriving at her destination on the 6th, Bering Strait received orders to organize and train an air-sea rescue task group made up of herself and the seaplane detachment of Rescue Squadron 2 (VH-2), an assignment that required her to exchange her aviation spare parts allowance for PBM-3D Mariner patrol bombers for spares for PBM-3R Mariner rescue aircraft. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 23 November 1944, Bering Strait underwent a shipyard availability and then loaded the equipment of Rescue Squadron 3 (VH-3), which had been substituted for VH-2. =Operations in the Marshall Islands= Bering Strait sailed for the Marshall Islands on 1 December 1944. During the passage to Kwajalein Atoll, the ship served as antisubmarine screen for the seaplane tender . After pausing at Kwajalein from 9 to 12 December, Bering Strait returned to sea again with Cumberland Sound and steamed to Eniwetok, arriving there on 13 December 1944 to carry out air- sea rescue training, which began after VH-3 arrived from Kaneohe on 15 December. She conducted nine days of training with VH-3 before that squadron transferred to Cumberland Sound on 24 December 1944. Bering Strait, along with the patrol craft and , then escorted the cargo ship and six merchant ships from Eniwetok to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, departing on 24 December 1944. =Operations in the Mariana Islands= Bering Strait and her convoy arrived on 28 December 1944 at Garapan Harbor on Saipan. Shifting on 29 December 1944 to Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, she received VH-3 on board that day. On 1 January 1945, however, Bering Strait transferred her aviation maintenance unit to VH-3 for temporary duty and sent her aviation officer, aviation storekeepers, all aviation spare parts, and three of her boats to the naval air base at Tanapag, so that the organization could be maintained intact ashore. That day, she reported to Commander, Marianas Patrol and Escort Force, for temporary operational control for radar picket and air-sea rescue duty. She departed Tanapag Harbor on 5 January 1945 to take up her new task. From 6 to 15 January 1945, Bering Strait operated west of Sarigan and Guguan Islands, on radar picket station to warn Saipan of approaching Japanese planes. Returning to Saipan for logistics on 16 January 1945, she embarked a fighter-director officer from a United States Marine Corps aircraft group on 18 January 1945, and departed later that day to assume radar picket duties as fighter-director ship in Operation Michigan to intercept Japanese planes operating between Iwo Jima and Truk. Returning to Saipan on 28 January 1945 for logistics and to disembark the U.S. Marine Corps fighter-direction officer, Bering Strait commenced a six days of voyage repairs. On 4 February 1945, she sailed to relieve the destroyer on air-sea rescue lifeguard station. At 23:00 hours on 10 February 1945, Bering Strait made contact with a homeward-bound Boeing B-29 Superfortress, first by radar and then visually. The ship switched on her lights and stood by for a landing, illuminating the sea and then indicating the wind direction with searchlights. The B-29, named Deacons Delight, accomplished \\"an almost perfect ditching,\\" and Bering Straits motor whaleboat took the entire 12-man crew on board and brought them to the ship. Then, after collecting floating debris and gear, and riddling the Superfortress with gunfire in a vain effort to sink it, Bering Strait rammed and sank the hardy bomber. An hour earlier, Bering Strait had picked up a report that another B-29, named Homing Bird, had ditched. After completing the rescue of Deacon's Delights crew, the ship headed for the scene of Homing Birds crash. Guided to the scene by a \\"Dumbo\\" air-sea rescue aircraft the ship arrived there by 16:05 hours on 11 February 1945 and picked up the entire 11-man crew immediately. Work still remained to be done, however, for soon after winding up the rescue of Homing Birds crew, Bering Strait received orders to rendezvous with the high-speed minelayer , to pick up the crew of a Superfortress that had ditched around 22:30 hours on 10 February 1945. The violent landing had claimed the lives of four of the B-29s crew. A patrolling \\"Dumbo\\" spotted the men the next morning, dropped survival gear, and covered them until Robert H. Smith picked them up that afternoon. On the morning of 12 February 1945, Bering Strait embarked the seven survivors of the third B-29. Returning to Saipan on 15 February, the ship disembarked the airmen the same day. On the night of Bering Straits return to her station, on 19 February 1945, a B-29 had ditched at 21:00, north of Pagan Island, but broke up and sank upon landing; five men, trapped in the wreckage, had drowned. Unable to extract all of the life rafts ‚Äì one man had the use of only a partially inflated rubber boat ‚Äì the crew lay at the mercy of the sea. Directed to the scene by a \\"Dumbo,\\" Bering Strait sighted the survivors and hove to in their midst. She picked up five men, one of whom had been swimming without a life jacket for two hours, and sighted two bodies but could not recover them. Fortunately, the airmen had been spotted in the darkness because of tiny lights pinned to their life jackets, lights that had been \\"stolen\\"This quote, from the ships Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b5/bering- strait-i.htm ) is unattributed. from the Navy \\"on personal initiative.\\" Bering Strait disembarked those survivors at Saipan on 21 February 1945, and got underway later the same day to relieve the destroyer on lifeguard station. Returning to Saipan on 3 March 1945, Bering Strait spent the next six days in a shipyard availability before setting out to resume her lifeguard work on 9 March. USS Bering Strait (AVP-34) rescues the crew of the B-29 Superfortress Hopeful Devil on 10 March 1945.On 10 March, Bering Strait established contact with a B-29, nicknamed Hopeful Devil, that radioed a distress call during its return from a bombing mission over the Japanese home islands. The Superfortress ditched alongside at 12:38 hours, and Bering Strait picked up the nine-man crew in short order. Almost immediately, Bering Strait picked up a position report on another ditched B-29, and steered a course to the rescue. Although the position reports provided the ship proved incorrect because a \\"Dumbo\\" pilot mistook Guguan Island for Alamagan, Bering Strait spotted a \\"Dumbo\\" orbiting southwest of Guguan and altered course to investigate. She picked up the 11-man crew of that ditched B-29 and then shaped a course for her lifeguard station.Video of the ditching and rescue of Hopeful Devil , Youtube Bering Strait remained at sea, from Pagan Island, from 11 to 14 March 1945, at which time she relieved her sister ship, the seaplane tender at another air-sea rescue station. Returning to Saipan for logistics on 16 March 1945, Bering Strait disembarked the 20 airmen taken on board since 10 March 1945 before sailing for Guam. Bering Straits performance of her rescue function earned her accolades from the Commanding General of the United States Army Air Forces 313th Bombardment Wing who, upon the ship's detachment from lifeguard duties, sent her a message: \\"Since you have been our guardian angel of the seas you have returned safely to us 50 combat crewmen. Many of them are flying against the enemy again. We are grateful for the splendid work you have done and wish you all the best of luck.\\"This quote, from the ships Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b5/bering-strait-i.htm ) is not sourced in the entry. Invasion of Okinawa On 18 March 1945, Bering Strait began preparations for Operation Iceberg, the invasion of Okinawa. Underway on 19 March 1945, she escorted the seaplane tender to Saipan and completed the preparations for \\"Iceberg\\" by loading VH-3 equipment between 20 and 23 March 1945. This work accomplished, she sailed for Kerama Retto on 23 March 1945 in company with three large seaplane tenders and three of her sister ships, as Task Group (TG) 51.20. Reaching her destination on 28 March 1945, Bering Strait anchored in the Kerama Retto passage, and TG 51.20 established a seaplane base that day. The next day, VH-3 arrived and flew its first \\"Dumbo\\" mission. On \\"L-day,\\" 1 April 1945, the invasion of Okinawa commenced. The first \\"Dumbo\\" mission of the invasion for VH-3 proved successful, as the squadron commander, Lieutenant Commander W. H. Bonvillian, rescued the three- man crew of a Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber from Torpedo Squadron 29 (VT-29). Antiaircraft fire had brought the plane down in a rice paddy, and the three crewmen deemed it prudent to take to their rubber boat and head out to sea where Lieutenant Commander Bonvillian's Mariner picked them up. For the next three months, Bering Strait served as the coordinating control tender at Kerama Retto, not only tending seaplanes but also conducting sonar searches to guard against midget submarine incursions. Planes under her direction carried out 268 missions during April, May, and June 1945, rescuing 105 men from 39 different squadrons ‚Äì 26 U.S. Navy, ten U.S. Marine Corps, two U.S. Army Air Forces, and one British Fleet Air Arm. The aircraft carrier-based squadrons among that number came from 23 ships, including the British fleet carrier . Twice during April 1945, one of Bering Straits planes was forced down by friendly fire and compelled to taxi back to base. On 23 April 1945, one of her PBMs transferred a severely wounded U.S. Marine to the seaplane tender for medical treatment. A little over a month later, on 24 May 1945, her PBMs rescued a pilot from the waters at the mouth of Ariake Bay, on southern Ky≈´sh≈´. Similar rescues took place on 2 June 1945, when Bering Strait-based PBMs rescued the crew of a crashed PB2Y Coronado from inside Kagoshima Bay, as well as a pilot from the fleet carrier . Later that month, on 14 June 1945, Bering Strait-based Mariners rescued pilots under fire from Japanese guns at Kikai Shima in the northern Ryukyu Islands. Pilots and aircrew proved not the only beneficiaries of Bering Straits controlled rescue missions. On 27 May 1945, two kamikaze suicide aircraft crashed the destroyer . One Bering Strait- based PBM rescued ten men from the ship while a second stood by in case the need arose to fly critically hurt sailors to medical treatment. On other occasions, Bering Straits planes escorted damaged aircraft to safety, or directed ships to the assistance of survivors in the water. The ship's stay at Kerama Retto likewise proved eventful, as, during that three-month period the ship went to general quarters 154 times; there was one day, 6 June 1945, on which the ship stood to battle stations six times. On 5 May 1945, two of her men suffered injuries when hit by shrapnel from friendly fire bursting too close to the ship during an attack by Japanese planes; she herself then fired on a Japanese plane attempting to crash on the nearby St. George. On 21 June, Bering Straits guns shot down a Nakajima E4N Type 00 (Allied reporting name \\"Jake\\") reconnaissance floatplane. During that same raid, just after one kamikaze had crashed the seaplane tender , a second overflew Bering Strait and headed for the seaplane tender . Bering Strait took the kamikaze under fire and shot it down short of Kenneth Whiting. Relieved of her duties as coordinating control tender on 30 June 1945, Bering Strait shifted to Chimu Bay, Okinawa, on 15 July. She tended four PBMs from VH-3 until 7 August, when she transferred them to another seaplane tender and assumed duties tending six planes from Rescue Squadron 1 (VH-1). Twice during her first months at Chimu Bay weather compelled her to undertake typhoon evasion, once from 19 to 20 July 1945 and again between 1 and 3 August 1945. Hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945, bringing World War II to a close, while Bering Strait was operating at Chimu Bay. =Honors and awards= Bering Strait was awarded three battle stars for her World War II service. Post-World War II Departing Okinawa on 26 September 1945, Bering Strait headed for Japan to support the occupation of that country. Reaching Sasebo, Japan, soon thereafter, she remained at that port until her sister ship Cook Inlet relieved her on 30 December 1945, then departed for the United States. Proceeding via Pearl Harbor, Bering Strait reached San Francisco, California, on 21 January 1946 and commenced pre-inactivation overhaul. Decommissioning Bering Strait was decommissioned at Naval Air Station Alameda, California, on 21 June 1946 and placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. United States Coast Guard service Coast Guards 1967 adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the cutters. The Navy loaned Bering Strait to the United States Coast Guard on 14 September 1948. After undergoing conversion for Coast Guard use, she was commissioned into the Coast Guard on 14 December 1948 as USCGC Bering Strait (WAVP-382). Pacific operations 1948‚Äì1967 Bering Strait was stationed at Seattle, Washington, beginning on 14 December 1948. Her primary duty during her Coast Guard service was to serve on ocean stations in the Pacific Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and engaged in law enforcement operations. During her Coast Guard career she also visited places as diverse as Adak, Alaska; Yokosuka, Japan; the French Frigate Shoals, and Laysan Island. In 1954 she was transferred to Honolulu, Hawaii, which remained her home port for the rest of her Coast Guard career, and continued her ocean station duties in the Pacific from there. In January 1956, Bering Strait evacuated an injured seaman in need of medical assistance from the merchant ship Madaket. On 13 February 1960, she used one ton of concrete patch material that had been air-dropped to her to assist the Japanese training ship Toyama Maru in making emergency repairs off Palmyra Island. Bering Strait conducted oceanographic experiments on Ocean Station Victor, 34N 164E, in December 1964 and January 1965. On 13 January 1965, she relieved the Coast Guard cutter , which had been damaged while standing by the disabled Liberian merchant ship Saint Helena northwest of Midway Atoll. While Matagorda steamed to Midway and then on to Honolulu in heavy seas, Bering Strait stood by Saint Helena, which was in danger of breaking in two, until a commercial tug arrived to assist the merchant ship. Bering Strait was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-382 on 1 May 1966. She again conducted oceanographic experiments at Ocean Station Victor from 19 June 1966 to 10 July 1966. Her loan period from the Navy came to an end on 26 September 1966, when she was transferred permanently from the Navy to the Coast Guard. Vietnam War service 1967‚Äì1968 USCGC Bering Strait (WHEC-382) during her Vietnam War service.USCGC Bering Strait (WHEC-382) in Subic Bay in the Philippines in 1970 during the Vietnam War. In 1967, Bering Strait was assigned to Coast Guard Squadron Three, which was designated Task Unit 70.8.6. The squadron was activated at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 24 April 1967 when its commander, Captain John E. Day, hoisted his pennant aboard his flagship, the Coast Guard cutter . Coast Guard Squadron Three was tasked to operate in conjunction with U.S. Navy forces in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of North Vietnamese arms and munitions traffic along the coastline of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The squadrons other Vietnam War duties included fire support for ground forces, resupplying Coast Guard and Navy patrol boats, and search-and-rescue operations. Serving in the squadron with Gresham and Bering Strait were cutters , and ; like Bering Strait and Gresham, they all were former Navy Barnegat-class ships. They departed Pearl Harbor on 26 April 1967 and reported to Commander, United States Seventh Fleet, for Market Time duty on 4 May 1967. They were joined by Navy radar picket destroyer escorts (DERs) of Escort Squadrons 5 and 7. The ten Market Time ships arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 10 May 1967. The five Coast Guard cutters and five Navy destroyer escorts continuously manned four Market Time stations off Vietnam, while only Navy warships served on two Taiwan patrol stations. One ship rotated duty as the station ship in Hong Kong. Bering Strait remained in the Western Pacific until 18 February 1968, then returned to the United States. Pacific operations 1968‚Äì1970 Bering Strait returned to her conventional Coast Guard duties in 1968, still operating from Honolulu. From 24 February 1970 to 1 March 1970 she fought a fire on the Panamanian merchant ship Grand Ocean in the mid-Pacific. Vietnam War service 1970 Bering Strait returned to Coast Guard Squadron Three for service in the Vietnam War on 17 May 1970. Her second Vietnam tour of duty ended on 31 December 1970. Decommissioning After her antisubmarine warfare equipment had been removed, the Coast Guard decommissioned Bering Strait in South Vietnam on 1 January 1971, the day after her second Vietnam War tour ended. Republic of Vietnam Navy service Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i (HQ-02) pierside at left, with her sister ships (center) and (right).South Vietnam commissioned the ship into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i (HQ-02).Other spellings encountered include Tran Quang Kha, Tran Quong Khai, and Tran Quang Khia.Per Janess Fighting Ships 1973‚Äì1974, p. 592, \\"HQ\\" is an abbreviation for \\"Hai Quan\\", Vietnamese for \\"Navy\\", used for all Republic of Vietnam Navy ships.This article assumes that the authoritative Janes Fighting Ships 1973‚Äì1974, p. 592, is correct about the ships lineage (i.e., that she was the former USS Bering Strait (AVP-34) and USCGC Bering Strait (WAVP-382/WHEC-382) and was designated HQ-02 in South Vietnamese service; the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS) (see http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b5/bering-strait-i.htm ) and NavSource.org (see http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/43/4334.htm ) agree. However, much confusion exists on these points in print and on the Web. The United States Coast Guard Historians Office (see http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/BeringStrait1948.asp ) agrees that the ship was the former Bering Strait, but does not mention her South Vietnamese \\"HQ\\" designation. Conways All the Worlds Fighting Ships 1947‚Äì1982 Part II: The Warsaw Pact and Non-Aligned Nations, p. 369, agrees that the ship was the former Bering Strait, but claims her designation in South Vietnamese service was HQ-15, a designation that Jane, p. 592, and DANFS say was assigned to , the former and USCGC Absecon (WAVP-374/WHEC-374). Finally, the Inventory of VNNs Battle Ships Part 1 (see Part 1 at http://www.vnafmamn.com/VNNavy_inventory.html ) claims that Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i (HQ-02) was the former and USCGC Cook Inlet (WAVP-385/WHEC-384), while the other sources (less DANFS, which does not mention Cook Inlets South Vietnamese career) all agree that Cook Inlet became in South Vietnamese service. Even here confusion arises, however, in that Janes, p. 592, and NavSource.org claim that HQ-02 was Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i and HQ-06 was Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc To·∫£n, while Conways, p. 369, claims that HQ-02 was Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc To·∫£n and HQ-06 was yet another ship, , which Janes, p. 592, and NavSource.org (see http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/43/4356.htm ) both say was designated HQ-17. By mid-1972, six other former Casco-class cutters had joined her in South Vietnamese service. They were the largest warships in the South Vietnamese inventory, and their 5-inch (127-millimeter) guns were South Vietnam's largest naval guns. Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i and her sisters fought alongside U.S. Navy ships during the final years of the Vietnam War, patrolling the South Vietnamese coast and providing gunfire support to South Vietnamese forces ashore. When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in late April 1975, Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i became a ship without a country. She fled to Subic Bay in the Philippines, packed with South Vietnamese refugees. On 22 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i and five of her sister ships, which also had fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: \\"These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition. Below decks generally would compare with a garbage scow.\\"This quote, from the U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/McCulloch_1946.pdf , is unattributed.

The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (see http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b5/bering-strait-i.htm ), the Naval Historical Center Online Library of Selected Images (see http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-b/avp34.htm ), the United States Coast Guard Historians Office (see http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/BeringStrait1948.asp ), NavSource.org (see http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/43/4334.htm ) and Conways All the Worlds Fighting Ships 1947‚Äì1982 Part II: The Warsaw Pact and Non-Aligned Nations, p. 356, all agree with Janes that Diego Silang was the former Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i and Bering Strait. However, the Inventory of VNNs Battle Ships Part 2 (see Part 2 at http://www.vnafmamn.com/VNNavy_inventory2.html ) claims that Diego Silang was the former , which it in turn claims was the former Bering Strait. she and her three sister ships of the of frigates ‚Äì all former Barnegat- and Casco-class ships ‚Äì were the largest Philippine Navy ships of their time. Modernization The Andr√©s Bonifacio-class frigates were passed to the Philippine Navy with fewer weapons aboard than they had had during their U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast guard careers and with old surface search radars installed. The Philippine Navy addressed these shortfalls through modernization programs. In Philippine service, Diego Silang retained her South Vietnamese armament, consisting of a single Mark 12 5\\"/38 caliber (127-mm) gun, a dual-purpose weapon capable of anti-surface and anti-air fire, mounted in a Mark 30 Mod 0 enclosed base ring with a range of up to yards; two twin Mark 1 Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun mounts, four Mk. 4 single 20-millimeter Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun mounts, four M2 Browning .50-caliber (12.7-millimeter) general-purpose machine guns, and two 81-mm mortars.DLSU N-ROTC Office. Naming and Code Designation of PN Vessels . However, in 1979 Hatch and Kirk, Inc., added a helicopter deck aftPhilippine Naval Forces News Bulletin Naval News Bulletin # 1. which could accommodate a Philippine Navy MBB Bo 105C helicopter for utility, scouting, and maritime patrol purposes, although the ship had no capability to refuel or otherwise support visiting helicopters.Janes Fighting Ships 1980‚Äì1981, p. 370. The Sperry SPS-53 surface search and navigation radar also was installed, replacing the AN/SPS-23 radar, although the ship retained both its AN/SPS-29D air search radar and its Mark 26 Mod 1 Fire Control Radar System. The Philippine Navy made plans to equip Diego Silang and her sister ships with new radar systems and long-range BGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, but this upgrade did not materialize due to the worsening political and economic crisis in the Philippines in the mid-1980s.Harpoon Database Encyclopedia AVP-10 Barnegat class Service history Diego Silang was commissioned into the Philippine Navy in 1980 and served until her decommissioning in June 1985.NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive.

Born in Fajardo, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He was the uncle of infielder Rub√©n Gotay. Career He made his major league debut at age 21 on August 6, 1960, as the host Cardinals defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6‚Äì5. In his first career at-bat, pinch-hitting for pitcher Ed Bauta in the sixth inning, he singled off Cincinnati southpaw Joe Nuxhall for his first big-league hit. Gotay had his most productive season for the Cardinals in . He started 105 games at shortstop and batted .255 with two home runs, 12 doubles and 27 runs batted in in 406 plate appearances. But on November 19, he was sent to the Pirates in a four-player trade that brought veteran shortstop and 1960 National League Most Valuable Player Dick Groat to St. Louis. Groat would help lead the Cardinals to a second-place finish in and the 1964 World Championship and start at shortstop on the 1963 and 1964 National League All- Star teams. Meanwhile, Gotay could not beat out Ducky Schofield for the Pirates' shortstop job in and was sent to Triple-A. He would appear in only seven games for Pittsburgh during the 1963 and campaigns. As a utility infielder, he spent a half-season with the Angels in , then appeared in one full season and parts of three others for the Astros (1966‚Äì69). He retired from baseball after the 1971 minor-league season, which he spent at Triple-A in the Cardinals' organization. In 389 games played in the major leagues, Gotay collected 257 hits, with 38 doubles, three triples, six home runs and 70 RBI. After retiring from baseball, he spent many years as a school master in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Gotay died from prostate cancer on July 4, 2008, at age 69 in Ponce. He was married with his wife, Silvia Irizarry, for 48 years. He had four children, Julio Gotay, Agust√≠n Gotay, Irma Gotay, and Silvia Gotay.

The designs are similar to those of spears found elsewhere in Asia and the world, as much due to a process of convergent evolution as to external influence. Types of Korean spears *Jangchang: This long spear was usually about 10 feet in length with a 4-inch blade on the end. It was used for throwing or just plowing through the enemy with long reach. *Jukjangchang: This spear was longer, about 20 feet long, and was made of bamboo. It was used for even greater distances than the regular jangchang. Although they weren't always quick, they were used in groups to keep many enemies at a distance. (see also pike) *Gichang: This type of spear was about 7 feet long and had a flag near the end to distract enemies. The blade was larger than the jukjangchang. *Dangpa: The main advantage of the Dangpa was that the user could attack someone from a longer distance, was effective against medium swords, a good anti-cavalry weapon, and the ability to strike with heavy damage. The disadvantages were that, like most spears, the Dangpa was not as fast as a skilled swordsman, could not be thrown, and was heavier than other spears. (see also Trident) *Nangseon: This was a multiple-tipped bamboo spear. It was about 25 feet long and has many other tips and blades branching from it. About half of it was blades and the other half was just the handle of the spear. It was designed to deceive enemies into thinking it was a tree. The blades were steel and often poisoned, so that the slightest cut would mortally wound the opponent. *Galgorichang: This was a hook spear that was used as an anti- cavalry weapon. It was about 3 yards long and it had a hook like blade on the side of it; somewhat like a scythe, but with a shorter blade. (see also Guisarme) *Topjang: This was a spear that had a blade with a flat top and saw teeth. \\"Topjang\\" literally means 'Saw Spear'. *Neolbjakchang: Literally means 'wide spear'. This spear was called the wide spear because of its wide blade. The cutting edges weren't on the sides, nor was it a stabbing weapon. It was meant to cut with the top portion of the metal. It was rounded on top and sharpened with precision. The blade faced the opponent when being used. (see also Monk's Spade) *Dajichang: This spear had 2-4 heads and was used only for thrusting. *Sabarichang: This spear had 3 tips but they were in a tripod formation. *Yangjimochang: This spear had a long blade and with a large sword- guard. It was used to trap swords in their defense. *Dongyemochang: This spear was the largest spear ever made in Korea. It was about 9 yards long. It is questioned if there were at least 2-3 people using it at once or if it was used by one great man. The translation literally is 'Very Long and Great Spear'.

Instead, it uses a fine powder of magnetically susceptible material (typically stainless steel) to mechanically link an otherwise free-wheeling disc attached to one shaft, to a rotor attached to the other shaft. This clutch is a form of a powder clutch. Torque is transmitted mechanically, through a metal powder filling. In the magnetically controlled version, an applied magnetic field is used to lock the particles in place. Unlike a pure magnetic coupling though, this field takes no part in transmitting torque magnetically. When a magnetic field is applied by a coil to the powder, it forms chains connecting the disc and rotor. The strength of the chains depends on the strength of the magnetic field. If there is not a magnetic field being applied to the powder, then powder is free floating. In this state the clutch is able to spin freely without any engagement of the input shaft to the output shaft. Magnetic particle clutches have made equipment control easier while also prolonging life of machine components.  Components  * Electrical coil ‚Äì produces the magnetic field for the particles to react to. * Input shaft ‚Äì the end of the main shaft that is attached to the driving force. * Output shaft ‚Äì the shaft that is on the other side of the clutch. This shaft is the one affected by the amount the clutch is being engaged. * Bearings ‚Äì allow the input and output shaft to spin freely without binding. * Magnetic particles ‚Äì the powdered magnetic material inside the clutch.  Applications  In the late 1970s and early '80s, these were used in high-speed line printers to stop a spinning drum stamped with 96 or more columns, and 40 or more rows containing the alphabet. The drum was stopped momentarily by the clutch while hammers struck ink and paper in the appropriate column. Each revolution of the drum, produced a full line of text and symbols. These drums spun at 300 to 1200 RPM. Factories have also used them to regulate the speed in which a spool of material is unwound. A real- world example of this can be found in paper mills. Paper mills require material to be fed into their rollers at a constant rate. These clutches allow the material to be fed into the rollers at the right speed while also maintaining tension on the material. Magnetic particle clutches are also used in cycle controls. They allow cycles to have a constant amount of torque while the cycle is being completed. A great example of this is a machine that puts caps on bottles. Magnetic particle clutches can also be found in gym equipment. They are used in treadmills to control the speed of the belt smoothly. It is also used to protect the electric motor of the machine from being overloaded when people with different weights use it.  Advantages  Advantages over a friction plate clutch include: * it doesn't exhibit stick- slip phenomenon * the torque may be easily and quickly controlled * it is more resistant to wear * it may be used for continuous slip applications * it has a very fast response time * Over load protection. * Works great for soft start applications  Disadvantages  * Can be more expensive than a conventional clutch system * Requires a power source to control the magnetic field References Category:Mechanical engineering stubs Category:Clutches Category:Automotive transmission technologies Category:Electromagnetic brakes and clutches ","title":"Magnetic particle clutch"},{"id":"12728105","text":"Schuyler Antony Carron (August 24, 1921 - June 15, 1964) was an American bobsledder who competed in the late 1940s.

This includes respiration of plant roots, the rhizosphere, microbes and fauna. Soil respiration is a key ecosystem process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of CO2. CO2 is acquired by plants from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of photosynthesis. Plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy. When plant respiration occurs below-ground in the roots, it adds to soil respiration. Over time, plant structural components are consumed by heterotrophs. This heterotrophic consumption releases CO2 and when this CO2 is released by below-ground organisms, it is considered soil respiration. The amount of soil respiration that occurs in an ecosystem is controlled by several factors. The temperature, moisture, nutrient content and level of oxygen in the soil can produce extremely disparate rates of respiration. These rates of respiration can be measured in a variety of methods. Other methods can be used to separate the source components, in this case the type of photosynthetic pathway (C3/C4), of the respired plant structures. Soil respiration rates can be largely affected by human activity. This is because humans have the ability to and have been changing the various controlling factors of soil respiration for numerous years. Global climate change is composed of numerous changing factors including rising atmospheric CO2, increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns. All of these factors can affect the rate of global soil respiration. Increased nitrogen fertilization by humans also has the potential to affect rates over the entire planet. Soil respiration and its rate across ecosystems is extremely important to understand. This is because soil respiration plays a large role in global carbon cycling as well as other nutrient cycles. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO2 but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with positive feedback with global climate change. Positive feedback is when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be affected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change. Sources of carbon dioxide in soil A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO2 flux All cellular respiration releases energy, water and CO2 from organic compounds. Any respiration that occurs below-ground is considered soil respiration. Respiration by plant roots, bacteria, fungi and soil animals all release CO2 in soils, as described below. Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle ‚Äì or citric acid cycle ‚Äì is an important step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar is oxidized.Berg J, Tymoczko J, Stryer L. (2002). Biochemistry. WH Freeman and Company. This oxidation produces the CO2 and H2O from the sugar. Plants, fungi, animals and bacteria all use this cycle to convert organic compounds to energy. This is how the majority of soil respiration occurs at its most basic level. Since the process relies on oxygen to occur, this is referred to as aerobic respiration. Fermentation Fermentation is another process in which cells gain energy from organic compounds. In this metabolic pathway, energy is derived from the carbon compound without the use of oxygen. The products of this reaction are carbon dioxide and usually either ethyl alcohol or lactic acid.Klein D, Prescott L, Harley J. (2005). Microbiology. McGraw- Hill. Due to the lack of oxygen, this pathway is described as anaerobic respiration. This is an important source of CO2 in soil respiration in waterlogged ecosystems where oxygen is scarce, as in peat bogs and wetlands. However, most CO2 released from the soil occurs via respiration and one of the most important aspects of below-ground respiration occurs in the plant roots. Root respiration Plants respire some of the carbon compounds which were generated by photosynthesis. When this respiration occurs in roots, it adds to soil respiration. Root respiration accounts for approximately half of all soil respiration. However, these values can range from 10‚Äì90% depending on the dominate plant types in an ecosystem and conditions under which the plants are subjected. Thus, the amount of CO2 produced through root respiration is determined by the root biomass and specific root respiration rates.Shibistova O, Lloyd J, Evgrafova S, Savushkina N, Zrazhevskaya G, Arneth A, Knohl A, Kolle O. (2002) Seasonal and spatial variability in soil CO2 efflux rates for a central Siberian Pinus sylvestris forest. Tellus 54B, 552-567. Directly next to the root is the area known as the rhizosphere, which also plays an important role in soil respiration. Rhizosphere respiration The rhizosphere is a zone immediately next to the root surface with its neighboring soil. In this zone there is a close interaction between the plant and microorganisms. Roots continuously release substances, or exudates, into the soil. These exudates include sugars, amino acids, vitamins, long chain carbohydrates, enzymes and lysates which are released when roots cells break. The amount of carbon lost as exudates varies considerably between plant species. It has been demonstrated that up to 20% of carbon acquired by photosynthesis is released into the soil as root exudates.Hutsch B, Augustin J, Merbach W. (2002) Plant rhizodeposition ‚Äì an important source for carbon turnover in soils. Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science. 165, 4, 397-407. These exudates are decomposed primarily by bacteria. These bacteria will respire the carbon compounds through the TCA cycle; however, fermentation is also present. This is due to the lack of oxygen due to greater oxygen consumption by the root as compared to the bulk soil, soil at a greater distance from the root.Vance E, Chapin III F. (2001) Substrate limitations to microbial activity in taiga forest floors. Soil Biology and Biochemistry. 33, 2, 173-188. Another important organism in the rhizosphere are root-infecting fungi or mycorrhizae. These fungi increase the surface area of the plant root and allow the root to encounter and acquire a greater amount of soil nutrients necessary for plant growth. In return for this benefit, the plant will transfer sugars to the fungi. The fungi will respire these sugars for energy thereby increasing soil respiration.Harrison M. (2005) Peace Talks and Trade Deals. Keys to Long-Term Harmony in Legume-Microbe Symbioses. Plant Physiology. 137, 4, 1205-1210. Fungi, along with bacteria and soil animals, also play a large role in the decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. Soil animals Soil animals graze on populations of bacteria and fungi as well as ingest and break up litter to increase soil respiration. Microfauna are made up of the smallest soil animals. These include nematodes and mites. This group specializes on soil bacteria and fungi. By ingesting these organisms, carbon that was initially in plant organic compounds and was incorporated into bacterial and fungal structures will now be respired by the soil animal. Mesofauna are soil animals from in length and will ingest soil litter. The fecal material will hold a greater amount of moisture and have a greater surface area. This will allow for new attack by microorganisms and a greater amount of soil respiration. Macrofauna are organisms from , such as earthworms and termites. Most macrofauna fragment litter, thereby exposing a greater amount of area to microbial attack. Other macrofauna burrow or ingest litter, reducing soil bulk density, breaking up soil aggregates and increasing soil aeration and the infiltration of water.Chapin III F, Matson P, Mooney H. (2002) Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Springer-Verlag, New York. Regulation of soil respiration Regulation of CO2 production in soil is due to various abiotic, or non-living, factors. Temperature, soil moisture and nitrogen all contribute to the rate of respiration in soil. Temperature Graph showing soil respiration vs. soil temperature Temperature affects almost all aspects of respiration processes. Temperature will increase respiration exponentially to a maximum, at which point respiration will decrease to zero when enzymatic activity is interrupted. Root respiration increases exponentially with temperature in its low range when the respiration rate is limited mostly by the TCA cycle. At higher temperatures the transport of sugars and the products of metabolism become the limiting factor. At temperatures over , root respiration begins to shut down completely.Atkin O, Edwards E, Loveys B. (2000) Response of root respiration to changes in temperature and its relevance to global warming. New Phytologist. 147, 141-154. Microorganisms are divided into three temperature groups; cryophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles. Cryophiles function optimally at temperatures below , mesophiles function best at temperatures between 20 and and thermophiles function optimally at over . In natural soils many different cohorts, or groups of microorganisms exist. These cohorts will all function best at different conditions, so respiration may occur over a very broad range.Mikan C, Schimel J, Doyle A. (2002) Temperature controls of microbial respiration in Arctic tundra soils above and below freezing. Soil Biology and Biochemistry. 34, 1785-1795. Temperature increases lead to greater rates of soil respiration until high values retard microbial function, this is the same pattern that is seen with soil moisture levels. Soil moisture Soil moisture is another important factor influencing soil respiration. Soil respiration is low in dry conditions and increases to a maximum at intermediate moisture levels until it begins to decrease when moisture content excludes oxygen. This allows anaerobic conditions to prevail and depress aerobic microbial activity. Studies have shown that soil moisture only limits respiration at the lowest and highest conditions with a large plateau existing at intermediate soil moisture levels for most ecosystems.Xu L, Baldocchi D, Tang J. (2004) How soil moisture, rain pulses, and growth alter the response of ecosystem respiration and temperature. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 18. Many microorganisms possess strategies for growth and survival under low soil moisture conditions. Under high soil moisture conditions, many bacteria take in too much water causing their cell membrane to lyse, or break. This can decrease the rate of soil respiration temporarily, but the lysis of bacteria causes for a spike in resources for many other bacteria. This rapid increase in available labile substrates causes short-term enhanced soil respiration. Root respiration will increase with increasing soil moisture, especially in dry ecosystems; however, individual species' root respiration response to soil moisture will vary widely from species to species depending on life history traits. Upper levels of soil moisture will depress root respiration by restricting access to atmospheric oxygen. With the exception of wetland plants, which have developed specific mechanisms for root aeration, most plants are not adapted to wetland soil environments with low oxygen.Lambers H, Chapin III F, Pons T. (1998) Plant physiological ecology. Springer-Verlag, New York. The respiration dampening effect of elevated soil moisture is amplified when soil respiration also lowers soil redox through bioelectrogenesis. Soil- based microbial fuel cells are becoming popular educational tools for science classrooms. Nitrogen Nitrogen directly affects soil respiration in several ways. Nitrogen must be taken in by roots in order to promote plant growth and life. Most available nitrogen is in the form of NO3‚àí, which costs 0.4 units of CO2 to enter the root because energy must be used to move it up a concentration gradient. Once inside the root the NO3‚àí must be reduced to NH3. This step requires more energy, which equals 2 units of CO2 per molecule reduced. In plants with bacterial symbionts, which fix atmospheric nitrogen, the energetic cost to the plant to acquire one molecule of NH3 from atmospheric N2 is 2.36 CO2.Pate J, Layzell D. (1990) Energetics and biological costs of nitrogen assimilation. The biochemistry of plants. 1-42. It is essential that plants uptake nitrogen from the soil or rely on symbionts to fix it from the atmosphere in order to assure growth, reproduction and long- term survival. Another way nitrogen affects soil respiration is through litter decomposition. High nitrogen litter is considered high quality and is more readily decomposed by microorganisms than low quality litter. Degradation of cellulose, a tough plant structural compound, is also a nitrogen limited process and will increase with the addition of nitrogen to litter.Sinsabaugh R, Carreiro M, Repert D. (2002) Allocation of extracellular enzymatic activity in relation to litter composition, N deposition, and mass loss. Biogeochemistry. 60, 1-24. Methods of measurement Different methods exist for the measurement of soil respiration rate and the determination of sources. The most common methods include the use of long-term stand alone soil flux systems for measurement at one location at different times; survey soil respiration systems for measurement of different locations and at different times; and the use of stable isotope ratios. Long-term stand-alone soil flux systems for measurement at one location over time An automated soil CO2 exchange system These systems measure at one location over long periods of time. Since they only measure at one location, it is common to use multiple stations to reduce measuring error caused by soil variability over small distances. Soil variability may be tested with survey soil respiration instruments. The long-term instruments are designed to expose the measuring site to ambient conditions as much as is possible between measurements.  Types of long-term stand-alone instruments  Closed, non-steady state systems = Closed systems take short-term measurements (typically over few minutes only) in a chamber sealed over the soil. The rate of soil CO2 efflux is calculated on the basis of CO2 increased inside the chamber. As it is within the nature of closed chambers that CO2 continues to accumulate, measurement periods are reduced to a minimum to achieve a detectable, linear concentration increase, avoiding an excessive build-up of CO2 inside the chamber over time. Both individual assay information and diurnal CO2 respiration measuring information is accessible. It is also common for such systems to also measure soil temperature, soil moisture and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). These variables are normally recorded in the measuring file along with CO2 values. For determination of soil respiration and the slope of CO2 increase, researchers have used linear regression analysis, the Pedersen (2001) algorithm, and exponential regression. There are more published references for linear regression analysis; however, the Pedersen algorithm and exponential regression analysis methods also have their following. Some systems offer a choice of mathematical methods.Wayson C, Randolph J, Hanson P, Grimmond P, Schmid H. (2006) Comparison of soil respiration methods in a mid-latitude deciduous forest. Biogeochemistry. 80, 173-189. When using linear regression, multiple data points are graphed and the points can be fitted with a linear regression equation, which will provide a slope. This slope can provide the rate of soil respiration with the equation F=bV/A, where F is the rate of soil respiration, b is the slope, V is the volume of the chamber and A is the surface area of the soil covered by the chamber.Field C, Ball J, Berry J. (1989) Photosynthesis, Principles and field techniques. Plant physiological ecology, field methods and instrumentation. Chapman and Hall, New York. It is important that the measurement is not allowed to run over a longer period of time as the increase in CO2 concentration in the chamber will also increase the concentration of CO2 in the porous top layer of the soil profile. This increase in concentration will cause an underestimation of soil respiration rate due to the additional CO2 being stored within the soil.Conen F, and Smith K. (2000) An explanation of linear increases in gas concentration under closed chambers used to measure gas exchange between soil and the atmosphere. European Journal of Soil Science. 51, 111-117. = Open, steady-state systems = Open mode systems are designed to find soil flux rates when measuring chamber equilibrium has been reached. Air flows through the chamber before the chamber is closed and sealed. This purges any non-ambient CO2 levels from the chamber before measurement. After the chamber is closed, fresh air is pumped into the chamber at a controlled and programmable flow rate. This mixes with the CO2 from the soil, and after a time, equilibrium is reached. The researcher specifies the equilibrium point as the difference in CO2 measurements between successive readings, in an elapsed time. During the assay, the rate of change slowly reduces until it meets the customer's rate of change criteria, or the maximum selected time for the assay. Soil flux or rate of change is then determined once equilibrium conditions are reached within the chamber. Chamber flow rates and times are programmable, accurately measured, and used in calculations. These systems have vents that are designed to prevent a possible unacceptable buildup of partial CO2 pressure discussed under closed mode systems. Since the air movement inside the chamber might cause increased chamber pressure, or external winds may produce reduced chamber pressure, a vent is provided that is designed to be as wind proof as possible. Open systems are also not as sensitive to soil structure variation, or to boundary layer resistance issues at the soil surface. Air flow in the chamber at the soil surface is designed to minimize boundary layer resistance phenomena. = Hybrid Mode Systems = A hybrid system also exists. It has a vent that is designed to be as wind proof as possible, and prevent possible unacceptable partial CO2 pressure buildup, but is designed to operate like a closed mode design system in other regards. Survey soil respiration systems ‚Äì for testing the variation of CO2 respiration at different locations and at different times Measuring spatial variability of soil respiration in the field These are either open or closed mode instruments that are portable or semi-portable. They measure CO2 soil respiration variability at different locations and at different times. With this type of instrument, soil collars that can be connected to the survey measuring instrument are inserted into the ground and the soil is allowed to stabilize for a period of time. The insertion of the soil collar temporarily disturbs the soil, creating measuring artifacts. For this reason, it is common to have several soil collars inserted at different locations. Soil collars are inserted far enough to limit lateral diffusion of CO2. After soil stabilization, the researcher then moves from one collar to another according to experimental design to measure soil respiration. Survey soil respiration systems can also be used to determine the number of long-term stand-alone temporal instruments that are required to achieve an acceptable level of error. Different locations may require different numbers of long-term stand-alone units due to greater or lesser soil respiration variability. Isotope methods Plants acquire CO2 and produce organic compounds with the use of one of three photosynthetic pathways. The two most prevalent pathways are the C3 and C4 processes. C3 plants are best adapted to cool and wet conditions while C4 plants do well in hot and dry ecosystems. Due to the different photosynthetic enzymes between the two pathways, different carbon isotopes are acquired preferentially. Isotopes are the same element that differ in the number of neutrons, thereby making one isotope heavier than the other. The two stable carbon isotopes are 12C and 13C. The C3 pathway will discriminate against the heavier isotope more than the C4 pathway. This will make the plant structures produced from C4 plants more enriched in the heavier isotope and therefore root exudates and litter from these plants will also be more enriched. When the carbon in these structures is respired, the CO2 will show a similar ratio of the two isotopes. Researchers will grow a C4 plant on soil that was previously occupied by a C3 plant or vice versa. By taking soil respiration measurements and analyzing the isotopic ratios of the CO2 it can be determined whether the soil respiration is mostly old versus recently formed carbon. For example, maize, a C4 plant, was grown on soil where spring wheat, a C3 plant, was previously grown. The results showed respiration of C3 SOM in the first 40 days, with a gradual linear increase in heavy isotope enrichment until day 70. The days after 70 showed a slowing enrichment to a peak at day 100.Rochette P, Flanagan L, Gregorich E. (1999) Separating soil respiration into plant and soil components using analysis of natural abundance of carbon-13. Soil Science Society of America Journal. 63, 1207-1213. By analyzing stable carbon isotope data it is possible to determine the source components of respired SOM that was produced by different photosynthetic pathways. Responses to human disturbance Throughout the past 160 years, humans have changed land use and industrial practices, which have altered the climate and global biogeochemical cycles. These changes have affected the rate of soil respiration around the planet. Elevated carbon dioxide Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have emitted vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. These emissions have increased greatly over time and have increased global atmospheric CO2 levels to their highest in over 750,000 years. Soil respiration increases when ecosystems are exposed to elevated levels of CO2. Numerous free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) studies have been conducted to test soil respiration under predicted future elevated CO2 conditions. Recent FACE studies have shown large increases in soil respiration due to increased root biomass and microbial activity.Lipson D, Wilson R, Oechel W. (2005) Effects of Elevated Atmospheric CO2 on Soil Microbial Biomass, Activity, and Diversity in a Chaparral Ecosystem. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 71, 12, 8573‚Äì8580 Soil respiration has been found to increase up to 40.6% in a sweetgum forest in Tennessee and poplar forests in Wisconsin under elevated CO2 conditions.King J, Hanson P, Bernhardt E, Deangelis P, Norby R, Pregitzer K. (2004) A multiyear synthesis of soil respiration responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 from four forest FACE experiments. Global Change Biology. 10, 1027-1042. It is extremely likely that CO2 levels will exceed those used in these FACE experiments by the middle of this century due to increased human use of fossil fuels and land use practices. Climate warming Due to the increase in temperature of the soil, CO2 levels in our atmosphere increase, and as such the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to human activities such as forest clearing, soil denuding, and developments that destroy autotrophic processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles, thus it dissolves into streams and rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased turbidity of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more autotrophic organisms die. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover. As mentioned earlier, temperature greatly affects the rate of soil respiration. This may have the most drastic influence in the Arctic. Large stores of carbon are locked in the frozen permafrost. With an increase in temperature, this permafrost is melting and aerobic conditions are beginning to prevail, thereby greatly increasing the rate of respiration in that ecosystem.Oechel W, Vourlitis G, Hastings S. (1995) Change in Arctic CO2 flux over two decades, Effects of climate change at Barrow, Alaska. Ecological Applications. 5, 3, 846-855. Changes in precipitation Due to the shifting patterns of temperature and changing oceanic conditions, precipitation patterns are expected to change in location, frequency and intensity. Larger and more frequent storms are expected when oceans can transfer more energy to the forming storm systems. This may have the greatest impact on xeric, or arid, ecosystems. It has been shown that soil respiration in arid ecosystems shows dynamic changes within a raining cycle. The rate of respiration in dry soil usually bursts to a very high level after rainfall and then gradually decreases as the soil dries. With an increase in rainfall frequency and intensity over area without previous extensive rainfall, a dramatic increase in soil respiration can be inferred. Nitrogen fertilization Since the onset of the Green Revolution in the middle of the last century, vast amounts of nitrogen fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven fertilization. As discussed earlier, nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass.Lutze J, Gifford R, Adams H. (2000) Litter quality and decomposition in Danthonia richardsonii swards in response to CO2 and nitrogen supply over four years of growth. Global Change Biology. 6, 13-24. This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth rates will lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study. With this increase in productivity, an increase in soil activities and therefore respiration can be assured. Importance Soil respiration plays a significant role in the global carbon and nutrient cycles as well as being a driver for changes in climate. These roles are important to our understanding of the natural world and human preservation. Global carbon cycling Soil respiration plays a critical role in the regulation of carbon cycling at the ecosystem level and at global scales. Each year approximately 120 petagrams (Pg) of carbon are taken up by land plants and a similar amount is released to the atmosphere through ecosystem respiration. The global soils contain up to 3150 Pg of carbon, of which 450 Pg exist in wetlands and 400 Pg in permanently frozen soils. The soils contain more than four times the carbon as the atmosphere.Sabine C, Hemann M, Artaxo P, Bakker D, Chen C, Field C, Gruber N, Le Quere C, Prinn R, Richey J, Romero-Lankao P, Sathaye J, Valentini R. (2003) Current status and past trends of the carbon cycle. Toward CO2 Stabilization: Issues, strategies, and consequences. Island Press. Washington DC. Researchers have estimated that soil respiration accounts for 77 Pg of carbon released to the atmosphere each year.Raich J, and Potter C. (1995) Global patterns of carbon dioxide emissions from soils. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 9, 23-36. This level of release is one order of magnitude greater than the carbon release due to anthropogenic sources (6 Pg per year) such as fossil fuel burning. Thus, a small change in soil respiration can seriously alter the balance of atmosphere CO2 concentration versus soil carbon stores. Much like soil respiration can play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, it can also regulate global nutrient cycling. Nutrient cycling A major component of soil respiration is from the decomposition of litter which releases CO2 to the environment while simultaneously immobilizing or mineralizing nutrients. During decomposition, nutrients such as nitrogen are immobilized by microbes for their own growth. As these microbes are ingested or die, nitrogen is added to the soil. Nitrogen is also mineralized from the degradation of proteins and nucleic acids in litter. This mineralized nitrogen is also added to the soil. Due to these processes, the rate of nitrogen added to the soil is coupled with rates of microbial respiration. Studies have shown that rates of soil respiration were associated with rates of microbial turnover and nitrogen mineralization. Alterations of the global cycles can further act to change the climate of the planet. Climate change As stated earlier, the CO2 released by soil respiration is a greenhouse gas that will continue to trap energy and increase the global mean temperature if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, so will the rate of soil respiration across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This is an example of a positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2¬∞ Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from soil respiration.Friedlingstein P, Dufresne J, Cox P. (2003) How positive is the feedback between climate change and the global carbon cycle? Tellus. 55B, 692-700. This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting. Climate models have suggested that this positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature will lead to a decrease in soil stored carbon by the middle of the 21st century.Cox P, Betts R, Jones C, Spall S, Totterdell I. (2000) Acceleration of global warming due to carbon- cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model. Nature. 408, 184-187. Summary Soil respiration is a key ecosystem process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon is stored in the soil as organic matter and is respired by plants, bacteria, fungi and animals. When this respiration occurs below ground, it is considered soil respiration. Temperature, soil moisture and nitrogen all regulate the rate of this conversion from carbon in soil organic compounds to CO2. Many methods are used to measure soil respiration; however, the closed dynamic chamber and utilization of stable isotope ratios are two of the most prevalent techniques. Humans have altered atmospheric CO2 levels, precipitation patterns and fertilization rates, all of which have had a significant role on soil respiration rates. The changes in these rates can alter the global carbon and nutrient cycles as well as play a significant role in climate change. References * * Su B.

Bosworth FAIA (born 1930) is an American architect and architectural educator. His best-known structures are those he designed for the Pilchuck Glass School between 1971 and 1986, but his primary focus in his thirty-five year professional career has been the design of single-family residences across the Pacific Northwest. Biography Bosworth was born and raised in Oberlin, Ohio, where his father and grandfather were ministers and faculty members. Bosworth received his undergraduate degree from Oberlin College, where he studied architectural history with an emphasis on classical architecture and graduated with a B.A. in 1952. He attended Princeton University graduate school studying art and archaeology, but returned to Oberlin after a year and earned his M.A in 1954. After military service, he studied briefly at Harvard University as a Ph.D. student, then entered the four-year professional program in architecture at Yale University, graduating with an M.Arch. in 1960. Bosworth spent four years working in the office of Eero Saarinen, then joined the faculty at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 1964. He headed the Architecture Department beginning in 1966 but left after two years to move to the Pacific Northwest. Bosworth came to Seattle in 1968 to serve as Chair of the Department of Architecture at the University of Washington, a position he held until 1972; he continued thereafter as a professor of architecture until his retirement about 2003. In 1971 he was commissioned by John Hauberg and Anne Gould Hauberg to develop designs for the Pilchuck Glass School. Bosworth drew on the rustic architecture of the American West as a source for his design of the Hot Shop for kilns for glass blowing (1973), Flat Shop for smaller glass projects (1976), Lodge (1977), and a series of other structures. By 1986 he was responsible for fifteen structures at Pilchuck. He also served as Director of the school from 1977 to 1980. Bosworth's residential practice flowered in the 1980s and has continued to the present. Between 1980 and 2004, Bosworth was responsible for the design of approximately 60 single-family residences across the Northwest, many of them vacation homes in rural settings. With their symmetries, axial composition, and studied proportions, Bosworth's designs often show the influence of his classical background. Over the years, Bosworth's work was recognized with numerous design awards. During his years at the University of Washington, he was instrumental in initiating the Architecture Department's Rome Program. And an exchange program with Kobe University, Japan. Bosworth was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1979. He received a mid-career fellowship (Rome Prize) from the American Academy in Rome in 1980. He was awarded the AIA Seattle Chapter Medal and an honorary doctorate from Kobe University, Japan in 2003. In 2012 Bosworth was awarded the AIA Northwest and Pacific Region Medal of Honor Award, which is the highest honor presented by the AIA NW&P; Region. He is also a member of the ultra-secret Bohemian Grove Society. Bosworth's architectural practice was carried on as Bosworth Hoedemaker Architecture in Seattle, Washington; the successor firm is Hoedemaker Pfeiffer.

As the film opens, four youths (Del, Roy, Chris and Geoff) are seen breaking into a cafe in Stratford, East London, but they only get away with about ninepence and some cake, and it is clear that they are hardly master criminals. Back at their hut on waste ground they mention Jo, known as 'Bronco Bullfrog' (for reasons which are never explained), who has just got out of Borstal. Once Del and Roy (Chris and Geoff are hardly seen again in the film) meet Jo in a cafe, they link up with him to carry out a bigger robbery. Meanwhile, Del meets Irene, a friend of a cousin of Chris's and they start a relationship despite the disapproval of Irene's mother and Del's father.

A week later, Princess Anne did go to see the latter at the Mile End ABC. Sam Shepherd claims that he was arrested by police for attempting to kiss the princess's hand. Accolades The film has been described as \\"Mod poetry\\" and a \\"masterpiece\\". However, the film became obscure after its cinema run, and was only shown twice on television between 1969 and 2010. In the mid-1980s, the master negative was disposed of in a rubbish skip but was retrieved by an employee of a film laboratory who placed it in an archive. Home Media The film has been released in the BFI Flipside series dual format edition (DVD and Blu-ray), with other films (such as 1975's Seven Green Bottles, and Platts-Mills' 1968 film Everybody's an actor, Shakespeare said) as extras. When submitted for home release, the film was originally given a 12 certificate in 2004 but this was changed to a 15 certificate in 2010.BBFC page for Bronco Bullfrog, see \\"Related work\\" section The change is believed to come from the appearance of the taboo word cunt in graffiti in a very brief clip that the censors could have missed originally. A new HD version of the film opened the ninth East End Film Festival on 22 April 2010, prior to its re-release in summer 2010.

Through cars from the train operated between Spokane, Washington and Portland, Oregon via the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway. It operated from 1951 to 1971. History The Western Star was inaugurated on June 3, 1951, replacing the Oriental Limited as the secondary train along the Great Northern's transcontinental route. The Great Northern's primary train was the famed Empire Builder, which made the run in 45 hours. The Western Star required a more leisurely 58 hours, making more intermediate stops and serving branches the Empire Builder bypassed, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota and Great Falls, Montana. The Star used equipment from the Empire Builder, which had been completely reequipped. Amtrak did not retain the Western Star as part of its national route network and the train was discontinued on May 1, 1971, although it did re-route the Empire Builder to serve Grand Forks. Equipment The 1951 Western Star required six sets of equipment to operate; it inherited five of these from the faster Empire Builder.

It was originally conceived by Ralph Pelikan, who was hired by McDonnell Aircraft, later worked for McDonnell Douglas after the merger of McDonnell with Douglas and, after another merger, retired from Boeing. His design has not to date been incorporated into any publicly available aircraft. However, it has been considered or included in design specifications in the original Boeing X-32 fighter design. Advantages and disadvantages The Pelikan design differs from the typical layout of flight control surfaces and empennage (incorporating ailerons on the wing, a horizontal stabilizer with elevators and a vertical stabilizer with a rudder), in that it uses only two moveable surfaces in order to achieve control of pitch, yaw and roll. When evaluated by Boeing engineers in October 1998 while designing what became the X-32, they found advantages of greater pitch control at high angles of attack and that two tail surfaces would have a lower radar signature than the four surfaces eventually adopted. However, they also found that using two larger control surfaces instead of four might actually make the aircraft heavier. The bigger hydraulic pumps and cylinders needed to operate the larger surfaces would add of weight to the design. This and other factors made them use a four-surface tail instead.

Sixty units were built, with thirty units later converted to subclasses 36200, and 36300 - locomotives with additional safety equipment for cross border trains between France and Italy. As of 2012 there are 30 units of the original 36000 class and 30 units of the 36300 subtype. Locomotives operating in Italy have been given the Italian designation FS Class E436. The subgroup 36001-36030 operates mostly on French- Belgian freight corridors. History=Background and design The first 30 locomotives of Class BB 36000 were built as a result of a modification of an order for 264 of the dual voltage SNCF Class BB 26000 (Sybic); instead only 234 Sybics were built, the last 30 of the order were instead built as a triple voltage design capable of also operating under 3 kV DC with a different electric motor type (AC induction) and newer power semiconductor device technology (GTO type); the multi-voltage specifications came from an expected increase in cross-border traffic, as encouraged by the European Unions specification of \\"freight corridors\\".Alain Jeunesse et al; La BB36000 : la locomotive multitension europ√©enne The locomotives were designed to achieve the same traction performance when operated under 25 kV AC, and 3 and 1.5 kV DC; Other design features required or introduced were conformity with European electromagnetic interference standard EN 50121, increased energy efficiency (using regenerative braking), water cooled power electronics,Use of freon based coolants as used on the SNCF BB 26000 had been limited by the Montreal Convention. and (partial) redundancy of components on failure, and improved maintainability. The locomotives were given the name Astride, derived from Asynchrone Tri-system Drive Engine, the external design was by MDB design. When powered by a 25 kV AC overhead supply, the primary winding of a electrical transformer is connected to the 25 kV 50 Hz supply; with equivalent outputs on four secondary windings.Alain Jeunesse, et al; La BB 36000, une locomotive \\"passe fronti√®res\\" Each secondary winding supplies 1450 V AC which is rectified, and the outputs connected in parallel to a smoothed 2.8 kV intermediate DC link supplying four parallel-connected inverters, each of which individually drives a traction motor.Jean-Marc Allenbach et al; Traction √©lectrique, pp. 325‚Äì7 When operating under a DC supply, the electrical circuit is configured with two separate intermediate 2.8 kV DC links, one per bogie; each DC bus powers two parallel-connected inverters, one for each traction motor. When powered from 1.5 kV DC, choppers are used to step up the voltage to 2.8 kV, under 3 kV supply the circuit is re-used with the connection of the DC-DC converter's inductors reconfigured. The four electric traction motors are force-ventilated, 2070 V (phase difference) 600 A three-phase induction motors weighing ; the motors have integrated reduction gear and are bogie- mounted. Each of the traction motors has a separate inverter. Dynamic rheostatic electrical braking effort is dissipated through electronically switched resistances connected to the DC link. A maximum braking force of is achieved from , above electric braking is limited to . When operating under 25 kV AC, the electrical circuit allows regenerative braking. Auxiliary electrical supply is taken via a step-down chopper to a 525 V DC supply; there are four (380 V max) three-phase inverters. Two of them supply variable speed and voltage power for cooling fans for the traction motors, transformer, rheostatic brake, locomotive main electronics block. Another one supplies fixed voltage and frequency (air compressor, oil pumps, other loads), the inverters are switchable with one unit providing redundancy. Additionally there are two 72 V 40 A inverters for battery charging. Subclasses and operations left An additional thirty units were ordered by SNCF in addition to the modified Sybic order. Sixty locomotives were delivered between 1997 and 2002; numbered BB36001 to BB36060. BB36001 to BB36030 received a red livery, and were primarily used for trains to Belgium. The remainder received a green freight livery, and were mainly used for trains to Italy. At the same time the closely similar SNCB Class 13 and CFL Class 3000 for Belgium and Luxembourg were manufactured. The class were designed as mixed-use locomotive, and were to be used Nightstar cross-channel passenger sleeper services (cancelled 1997/9). In July 2010 the locomotives numbered 36001 to 36030 were transferred to SNCF's rolling stock leasing subsidiary Akiem. =France-Italy= From 2003 locomotives were modified for work into Italy; two subclasses were created BB36200 and BB36300. 12 units of the BB36200 class were created, modified to allow multiple unit operation, and with fire extinguishers fitted. 8 units of the BB36300 subclass were created with the same modifications as the BB36200 plus the addition of the SAFI (Signal d'Alarme √† Freinage Inhibable) safety system. Later, all BB36200s were converted to BB36300s, along with remaining units 36051 to 36060. Since 2003, rolling road trains (operated by Trenitalia / SNCF Geodis subsidiary AFA Autostrada Ferroviaria Alpina) have been hauled by Astride units between Aiton, Savoie, France and Orbassano, Italy using Modalohr wagons.Sources:  The class had reliability problems, with an availability of 80%, and an incident rate of 23 per million km in 2005. As part of the joint venture Trenitalia acquired numbers 36339 and 36348 for AFA. Locomotives operating in Italy for SNCF Fret's Italian subsidiary 'Monferail' were given the Italian numbering E 436.

Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 8/11/07. Methodist career In 1884 Moses Shinn was a Methodist minister in Keokuk, Iowa, and a member of the Fort Madison, Iowa Masonic Lodge. Shinn was a powerful leader in his church and his Lodge, and reportedly was greatly appreciated by many people. That year local Methodist leadership asked Shinn to increase his participation in the church by requiring him to renounce Masonry and devote all his energy to the church. At the next general conference of the church, a resolution to that end was adopted by Shinn's fellow ministers. In response, Shinn acknowledged the will of his peers and choose to leave the ministry. Seeing this as a powerful example by an admirable man, one of his fellow pastors stood up to ask Shinn to teach him about Masonry and have him inducted into Shinn's lodge. One after another, other ministers joined in the request, and soon Masonry was accepted throughout the Methodist Episcopal Church. That action is said to have influenced the spread of the Freemasons throughout the American West. Shinn was also instrumental in the development of the Nebraska Territory's first college proposal for Simpson University. Meant to be developed on of land donated by the federal government, the university never came to fruition.Chapter XXV. A history of Nebraska Methodism. Retrieved 8/11/07. Death After accumulating almost $250,000 of land in his time, before his death Shinn became concerned about the wealth he accumulated. He wanted to go to heaven the way the Beatitudes of the Bible told him to, poor. So he gave his wealth away until he was down to assets of $10,000 at the time of his death in 1885. A portion of the money went to help some families, including relatives; however, the majority of it went to building new churches across Iowa and Nebraska.\\"Priority for the Poor\\", St. Luke United Methodist Church Sermons.

History  The group was formed in 1986 when Harte-Hanks bought Transcript Newspapers Inc. of Dedham, Massachusetts, merging it with the Middlesex News. Later that year, Harte-Hanks bought Century Newspapers and combined its operations with News-Transcript. In the mid-1990s, as Harte-Hanks divested its newspaper holdings, the company announced in 1994 that it would sell the 14-newspaper chain to Fidelity Investments.\\"Middlesex News Changing Owners\\".

Antecedents The Gore Baronetcy, of Artarman in the County of Sligo, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 30 August 1760 for Booth Gore. His father, Sir Robert Gore-Booth, 4th Baronet was an Anglo- Irish landowner who according to some sources was accused of evicting his starving tenant farmers during the period of the Great Irish famine and of packing them into coffin ships to emigrate. In contrast, other reports state that he mortgaged his estates and assisted his tenants by both providing them with food and refusing to accept any rents during the famine. Life and adventures Sir Henry enjoyed a much better relationship with the tenants on his 32,000 acre (12,950 ha) estate and he was seen as a \\"progressive landlord\\". Sir Henry was not involved in public affairs and was interested in the development of his estate, the welfare of his tenants and served both as the president of the Sligo Agricultural Society and the chairman of the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway. He was appointed High Sheriff of Sligo for 1872, and was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Sligo. During his Arctic expeditions, Sir Henry was involved in the rescue of a fellow Arctic explorer called Benjamin Leigh Smith in 1882. Sir Henry was also a prolific writer on a variety of topics including Arctic exploration, yachting, whaling, polar bear hunting and shark fishing. He sailed his own yacht to the Arctic. He also hunted big game in Africa. Much of his Arctic memorabilia is now on display in The Billiard Room of the now refurbished Lissadell House. Sir Henry died at St. Moritz, Switzerland, on 13 January 1900, the cause of death being an attack of influenza. Family Sir Henry married, in 1867, Georgina May Hill of Tickhill Castle, Yorkshire, England, daughter of Colonel Hill and a niece of the Earl of Scarbrough. They lived at Lissadell House, Drumcliffe, County Sligo and were visited frequently by a childhood friend, the poet W. B. Yeats. The eldest son, Josslyn Augustus Richard Gore-Booth succeeded to the title. The two daughters Constance and Eva were both prominent political activists. Eva became involved in the labour movement and women's suffrage in England and Constance became a Sinn F√©in politician, revolutionary, Irish nationalist and suffragette. Constance, more commonly known as Countess Markievicz was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons, although along with the other Sinn F√©in MPs she did not take her seat, and set up the first D√°il √âireann. She was also the first woman in Europe to hold a cabinet position (Minister of Labour of the Irish Republic, 1919‚Äì1922).

After the war, she was in commission in the United States Coast Guard from 1949 to 1966 as the cutter USCGC Coos Bay (WAVP-376), later WHEC-376. Construction and commissioning Coos Bay (AVP-25) was laid down on 15 August 1941 by Lake Washington Shipyards, Houghton, Washington, and was launched on 15 May 1942, sponsored by Mrs. L. E. Geheres. She was commissioned on 15 May 1943 with Commander W. Miller in command.  United States Navy service =World War II Coos Bay cleared San Diego, California on 22 July 1943 for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Espiritu Santo, and Cavutu, where she established a seadrome for Patrol Squadron 71 (VP-71) from 13 October 1943 until 23 November 1943. She was based successively at Tulagi, at Blanche Harbor in the Treasury Islands, and at Green Island until 16 June 1944. After carrying men and equipment of Fleet Air Wing 1 (FAW-1) from New Georgia to Espiritu Santo, Coos Bay sailed on 21 August 1944 for Guadalcanal, where she unloaded aviation equipment. From 8 September 1944 to 9 December 1944 she served at Saipan as station tender, then returned to San Pedro, California, for an overhaul. Coos Bay returned to Pearl Harbor on 17 March 1945. On 21 March 1945 she departed for Ulithi Atoll. During her passage, on 31 March 1945, she collided with the oceangoing commercial tug M/V Matagorda, which took her in tow for emergency repairs at Eniwetok. Coos Bay proceeded to San Pedro for repairs and overhaul. Returning to Pearl Harbor, Coos Bay remained there until 1 September 1945. Meanwhile, hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945. =Honors and awards= Coos Bay received two battle stars for World War II service. Post-World War II On 1 September 1945, Coos Bay departed Pearl Harbor for Ominato Ko, Honsh≈´, Japan. The formal Japanese surrender to the Allies took place aboard the battleship in Tokyo Bay the following day. Arriving at Ominato Ko on 13 September 1945 for station tender duty, Coos Bay remained there until 2 December 1945, when she proceeded to Orange, Texas, where she arrived on 11 January 1946 for inactivation. Decommissioning Coos Bay was decommissioned and placed in reserve in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange on 30 April 1946.  United States Coast Guard service  Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The Navy loaned Coos Bay to the Coast Guard on 4 January 1949. After she underwent conversion for service as a weather-reporting ship, the Coast Guard commissioned her as USCGC Coos Bay (WAVP-376) in May 1949. Service history racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Coos Bay was stationed at Portland, Maine, throughout her Coast Guard career. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and she engaged in law enforcement operations. Coos Bay rescued the 10-man crew of a downed U.S. Navy patrol aircraft midway between Bermuda and the Azores on 27 February 1953. On 11 March 1953 she assisted the commercial tanker Angy. On 26 January 1955, Coos Bay rescued six crewmen of a downed United States Air Force transport aircraft about east of Bermuda. In December 1960, Coos Bay rescued four inexperienced seamen aboard the Lamont Geological Observatory research vessel Grace about southwest of Bermuda. Grace was towed back to Bermuda in heavy seas. On 19 February 1964, Coos Bay rescued survivors from the British merchant ship Ambassador in the North Atlantic. Coos Bay was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-376 on 1 May 1966.  Decommissioning and disposal  Coos Bay being sunk as a target off Virginia on 9 January 1968.The Coast Guard decommissioned Coos Bay on 1 September 1966, and berthed her at Curtis Bay in Baltimore, Maryland.

It describes the general relation between resistance to change (persistence of behavior) and the rate of reinforcement obtained in a given situation. B.F. Skinner (1938) proposed that all behavior is based on a fundamental unit of behavior called the discriminated operant. The discriminated operant, also known as the three-term contingency, has three components: an antecedent discriminative stimulus, a response, and a reinforcing or punishing consequence. The organism responds in the presence of the stimulus because past responses in the presence of that stimulus have produced reinforcement. Resistance to change According to behavioral momentum theory, there are two separable factors that independently govern the rate with which a discriminated operant occurs and the persistence of that response in the face of disruptions such as punishment, extinction, or the differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors. (see Nevin & Grace, 2000, for a review). First, the positive contingency between the response and a reinforcing consequence controls response rates (i.e., a response‚Äìreinforcer relation) by shaping a particular pattern of responding. This is governed by the relative law of effect (i.e., the matching law; Herrnstein, 1970). Secondly, the Pavlovian relation between surrounding, or context, stimuli and the rate or magnitude (but not both) of reinforcement obtained in the context (i.e., a stimulus‚Äìreinforcer relation) governs the resistance of the behavior to operations such as extinction. Resistance to change is assessed by measuring responding during operations such as extinction or satiation that tend to disrupt the behavior and comparing these measurements to stable, pre- disruption response rates. Resistance to disruption has been considered a better measure of response strength than a simple measure of response rate.(Nevin, 1974). This is because variations in reinforcement contingencies such as differential-reinforcement-of-high- or low-response-rate schedules can yield highly variable response rates even though overall reinforcement rates are equal. Thus it is questionable whether these differences in response rates indicate differences in the underlying strength of a response (see Morse, 1966, for a discussion). According to behavioral momentum theory, the relation between response rate and resistance to change is analogous to the relation between velocity and mass of a moving object, according to Newton's second law of motion (Nevin, Mandell & Atak, 1983). Newton's second law states that the change in velocity of an object when a force is applied is directly related to that force and inversely related to the object's mass. Similarly, behavioral momentum theory states that the change in response rate under conditions of disruption (Bx) relative to baseline response rate (Bo) is directly related to the force or magnitude of disruption (f) and inversely related to the rate of reinforcement in a stimulus context (r): :\\\\log{\\\\left({Bx\\\\over Bo}\\\\right)}\\\\ = \\\\ -\\\\left({f\\\\over r^b}\\\\right)(1) The free parameter b indicates the sensitivity of resistance to change to the rate of reinforcement in the stimulus context (i.e., the stimulus‚Äìreinforcer relation). Resistance to disruption typically is assessed when two distinctive discriminative stimulus contexts alternate and signal different schedules of reinforcement (i.e., a multiple schedule). Equation 1 can be rewritten to account for resistance to change across two stimulus contexts (Nevin, 1992; Nevin, Grace, & McLean, 2001) when a disrupter is uniformly applied across contexts (i.e., f1 = f2): :{ {\\\\log(Bx_1/Bo_1)} \\\\over{\\\\log(Bx_2/Bo_2)} }\\\\ = \\\\ \\\\left({r_2\\\\over r_1}\\\\right)^a(2) The subscripts indicate the different stimulus contexts. Thus, Equation 2 states that relative resistance to change is a power function of the relative rate of reinforcement across stimulus contexts, with the a parameter indicating sensitivity to relative reinforcement rate. Consistent with behavioral momentum theory, resistance to disruption often has been found to be greater in stimulus contexts that signal higher rates or magnitudes of reinforcement (see Nevin, 1992, for a review). Studies that add response-independent (i.e., free) reinforcement to one stimulus context strongly support the theory that changes in response strength are determined by stimulus‚Äìreinforcer relations and are independent of response‚Äìreinforcer relations. For instance, Nevin, Tota, Torquato, and Shull (1990) had pigeons pecking lighted disks on separate variable-interval 60-s schedules of intermittent food reinforcement across two components of a multiple schedule. Additional free reinforcers were presented every 15 or 30 s on average when the disk was red, but not when the disk was green. Thus, the response‚Äìreinforcer relation was degraded when the disk was red because each reinforcer was not immediately preceded by a response. Consistent with the matching law, response rates were lower in the red context than in the green context. However, the stimulus‚Äìreinforcer relation was enhanced in the red context because the overall rate of food presentation was greater. Consistent with behavioral momentum theory, resistance to presession feeding (satiation) and discontinuing reinforcement in both contexts (extinction) was greater in the red context. Similar results have been found when reinforcers are added to a context by reinforcing an alternative response. The findings of Nevin et al. (1990) have been extended across a number of procedures and species including goldfish (Igaki & Sakagami, 2004), rats (Harper, 1999a, 1999b; Shull, Gaynor & Grimes, 2001), pigeons (Podlesnik & Shahan, 2008), and humans (Ahearn, Clark, Gardenier, Chung & Dube, 2003; Cohen, 1996; Mace et al., 1990). The behavioral momentum framework also has been used to account for the partial-reinforcement extinction effect (Nevin & Grace, 1999), to assess the persistence of drug-maintained behavior (Jimenez- Gomez & Shahan, 2007; Shahan & Burke, 2004), to increase task compliance (e.g., Belfiore, Lee, Scheeler & Klein, 2002), and to understand the effects of social policies on global problems (Nevin, 2005). Although behavioral momentum theory is a powerful framework for understanding how a context of reinforcement can affect the persistence of discriminated operant behavior, there are a number of findings that are inconsistent with the theory (see Nevin & Grace, 2000, and accompanying commentary). For instance, with equal reinforcement rates across stimulus contexts, resistance to change has been shown to be affected by manipulations to response‚Äìreinforcer relations, including schedules that produce different baseline response rates (e.g., Lattal, 1989; Nevin, Grace, Holland & McLean), delays to reinforcement (e.g., Bell, 1999; Grace, Schwendimann & Nevin, 1998; Podlesnik, Jimenez-Gomez, Ward & Shahan, 2006; Podlesnik & Shahan, 2008), and by providing brief stimuli that accompany reinforcement (Reed & Doughty, 2005). Also, it is unclear what factors affect relative resistance to change of responding maintained by conditioned reinforcement (Shahan & Podlesnik, 2005) or two concurrently available responses when different rates of reinforcement are arranged within the same context for those responses (e.g., Bell & Williams, 2002). Preference and resistance to change As resistance to disruption across stimulus contexts is analogous to the inertial mass of a moving object, behavioral momentum theory also suggests that preference in concurrent-chains procedures for one stimulus context over another is analogous to the gravitational attraction of two bodies (see Nevin & Grace, 2000). In concurrent-chains procedures, responding on the concurrently available initial links provides access to one of two mutually exclusive stimulus contexts called terminal links. As with multiple schedules, independent schedules of reinforcement can function in each terminal-link context. The relative allocation of responding across the two initial links indicates the extent to which an organism prefers one terminal-link context over the other. Moreover, behavioral momentum theory posits that preference provides a measure of the relative conditioned-reinforcing value of the two terminal-link contexts, as described by the contextual-choice model (Grace, 1994). Grace and Nevin (1997) assessed both relative resistance to change in a multiple schedule and preference in a concurrent-chains procedure with pigeons pecking lighted disks for food reinforcement. When the relative rate of reinforcement was manipulated identically and simultaneously across stimulus contexts in the multiple schedule and concurrent-chains procedure, both relative resistance to change and preference was greater with richer contexts of reinforcement. When all the extant resistance to change and preference data were summarized by Grace, Bedell, and Nevin (2002), they found that those measures were related by a structural relation slope of 0.29. Therefore, relative resistance to change and preference both have been conceptualized as expressions of an underlying construct termed response strength, conditioned reinforcement value, or more generally, behavioral mass of discriminated operant behavior (see Nevin & Grace, 2000).

The political pro-SWAPO stance of his father forced him into exile in 1979 to Angola and Zambia. There he started to develop his love for the reggae-music and begin to play guitar. In Zambia for the first time he got in contact with the Rastafari and Reggae culture. During the time at a highschool in Lagos, Nigeria between 84 and 88 he played in several Reggaebands. When he returned home in 1990 to witness the first free elections in his home country, he brought huge experiences to Namibia. Since 1990 he has released several LPs and cassettes which are only available in Namibia and South Africa. From these tapes several hits were successful continuously in Namibia. Sheehama was able to win several national prices. The recording band of Ras Sheehama was composed of famous musicians from well-known South African bands Stimela and Bayete which was also of Lucky Dube. Ras Sheehama is an outstanding singer, who understands to show African joy of life and criticism of the political and social situation of past and future. Rastafari is always a central point in his songs without becoming pathetic at all. In the end of May 1999 Ras Sheehama celebrated his first show in Germany together with the former Lucky Dube's Band The Slaves at the Africa Festival in W√ºrzburg, Germany. Ras has performed in Germany, UK,[Cuba], Portugal and Switzerland. He also opened the show for the legendary reggae act Don Carlos in Johannesburg in 2001 and for Manu Di Bango in 1995 in Windhoek. Ras Sheehama won the Music Award Category for his song Inotela in 1996 which led him to perform at the Music Festival Le Printemps de Bourges in France. In 1997 and thereafter to open for Ismael Lo at the Reunion Island the same year. In March 2005, Ras launched his fifth album Pure Love followed quickly in June 2006 by his 6th album Trevelling On..., a blend of some of Ras's most popular songs spanning two decades.

This includes regulating the wages, benefits, and duties of the employees and the duties and responsibilities of the employer or employers and often includes rules for a dispute resolution process. Finland In Finland, collective labour agreements are universally valid. This means that a collective agreement in an economic sector becomes a universally applicable legal minimum for any individual's employment contract, whether or not they are a union member. For this condition to apply, half of the workforce in that sector needs to be union members, thus supporting the agreement. Workers are not forced to join a union in a specific workplace. Nevertheless, with 70% average unionization, most economic sectors are under a collective labour agreement. An agreement does not prohibit higher wages and better benefits, but establishes a legal minimum, similarly to a minimum wage. Furthermore, a national income policy agreement is often, but not always reached, which includes all trade unions, employers‚Äô associations, and the Finnish government. Germany Collective agreements in Germany are legally binding, and this is accepted by the population, and it causes no alarm. Whereas in the UK there was (and arguably still is) a \\"them and us\\" attitude in industrial relations, the situation is very different in post-war Germany and in some other Northern European countries. In Germany, there is a much greater spirit of cooperation between the two sides of industry. For over 50 years, German workers by law have had representation on company boards. Together, management and workers are considered \\"social partners\\". Sweden In Sweden about 90 per cent of all employees are covered by collective agreements, in the private sector 83 per cent (2017).Anders Kjellberg (2019) Kollektivavtalens t√§ckningsgrad samt organisationsgraden hos arbetsgivarf√∂rbund och fackf√∂rbund, Department of Sociology, Lund University.

Collective bargaining in Europe: towards an endgame, European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) Brussels 2019. Vol. III (pp. 583-604) Collective agreements usually contain provisions concerning minimum wages. Sweden does not have statutory regulation of minimum wages or legislation on extension of collective agreements to unorganized employers. Non-organized employers can sign substitute agreements directly with trade unions, but many do not. The Swedish model of self-regulation applies only to workplaces and employees covered by collective agreements.Anders Kjellberg (2017) ‚ÄùSelf-regulation versus State Regulation in Swedish Industrial Relations‚Äù In Mia R√∂nnmar and Jenny Jul√©n Votinius (eds.) Festskrift till Ann Numhauser-Henning. Lund: Juristf√∂rlaget i Lund 2017, pp. 357-383 United Kingdom At common law, Ford v A.U.E.F. [1969],Ford v A.U.E.F. [1969] 2 QB 303 the courts once held that collective agreements were not binding. Then, the Industrial Relations Act 1971, introduced by Robert Carr (Employment Minister in Edward Heath's cabinet), provided that collective agreements were binding unless a written contract clause declared otherwise. After the demise of the Heath government, the law was reversed to reflect the tradition in British industrial relations policy of legal abstentionism from workplace disputes. The law is now contained in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s.179, whereby In the United Kingdom, collective agreements are conclusively deemed to be not legally binding. This presumption may be rebutted when the agreement is in writing and contains an explicit provision asserting that it should be legally enforceable. Although the collective agreement itself is not enforceable, many of the terms negotiated will relate to pay, conditions, holidays, pensions and so on. These terms will be incorporated into an employee's contract of employment (whether or not the employee is a union member); and the contract of employment is, of course, enforceable. If the new terms are unacceptable to any individuals, they can object to his employer; but if the majority of workers have acquiesced, the company will be able to sack the complainants, normally with impunity. The British law reflects the historic adversarial nature of UK industrial relations. Also, there is a background fear by employees that if their trade union sued for breach of a collective agreement, the union could become bankrupt, leaving employees without representation in collective bargaining. This unfortunate situation may be slowly changing, partly through EU influences. Japanese and Chinese firms that have UK factories (particularly in the motor industry) try to imbue their workers with the company ethic. This approach has been adopted by indigenous UK firms such as Tesco. United States The United States recognises collective bargaining agreements.

At the urging of a classmate there, Warner Wada, she began considering adapting her drawing style to animation.Counts, pp. 40‚Äì41 Returning to Smith for her senior year and obtaining the primer Animation by Preston Blair, Cruikshank, with additional research, arranged for a special-studies class in animation. With an animation stand consisting of a Bolex camera attached to a photo enlarger, constructed by instructor David Batchelder, she produced her first animated short, the three-minute, 16mm \\"Ducky\\". Done with watercolor and paper animation, it starred a prototype versionCounts, p. 41 of her future recurring character Quasi, which one writer characterized as \\"an infantile duck with buck front teeth, thick glasses and a red cape\\".Counts, p. 43 Cruikshank, describing her anthropomorphic characters, said, \\"My ducks are based on the ducks from Carl Barks' comics. But I guess they got twisted in memory, because people don't seem to see much similarity between them.\\" Encouraged by the response of \\"Ducky\\", Cruikshank, after graduation, enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute, in San Francisco, California, to study filmmaking. Under instructor Larry Jordan, she made the five-minute animated short \\"Fun on Mars\\" (1971), which used watercolor, crayon markers on paper, cutouts, and collage. Produced for $100, it also featured early versions of her trademark duck-creatures. Her next short, \\"Chow Fun\\" (1972), created with a $400 grant secured in association with PBS, mixed paper animation and cutouts glued onto animation cels. \\"Quasi at the Quackadero\\" While editing \\"Chow Fun\\" at San Francisco's Snazelle Films, a commercial-film company that also rented out space and film equipment, Cruikshank, at an employee's suggestion, showed her work to company president E. E. Gregg Snazelle, who gave her a job a week later \\"to experiment in animation and do TV commercials when there was work\\".Counts, pp. 41‚Äì42 By the end of summer 1972, Cruikshank was head animator there.Counts, p. 42 In 2009, she recalled of her time with Snazelle, Still from 6:49 of Cruikshank's signature work, \\"Quasi at the Quackadero\\", depicting Anita and Quasi at left. In 1975 Cruikshank made a comic strip based on her characters Anita and Quasi, which was published in the third issue of the underground comics magazine Arcade.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/cruikshank_sally.htm At Snazelle, Cruikshank began developing her best-known work, \\"Quasi at the Quackadero\\" (1975), working titles of which included \\"I Walked with a Duck\\", \\"Hold That Quasi\\", and \\"Quasi Quacks Up\\". The 10-minute, 35mm short, with 100 watercolor backgrounds and approximately 5,000 cels, took two years for Cruikshank to draw, followed by four months for photography and post-production. Cruikshank independently financedCounts, p. 44 the $6,000 budget, which went primarily for cel painting, sound recording and lab and camera work. Underground cartoonist Kim Deitch, then Cruikshank's boyfriend, did much of the inking, using dip pen and rapidograph, with Kathryn Lenihan doing most of the cel painting. The short starred Quasi, voiced by Deitch; Anita, which one writer described as \\"Betty Boop with a New Wave wardrobe\\" and whose Mae West-like voice was supplied by Cruikshank; and robot Rollo. They progress through the Quackadero, a Coney Island-esque sideshow with such attractions as the Hall of Time Mirrors, which depict the viewer as he or she will look in \\"old age\\" or \\"100 years from now\\", and the Time Holes, in which one can lean on a railing and see a live slice of three million years B.C. unfold.Counts, p. 43-44 The music, by the Berkeley, California band the Cheap Suit Serenaders, used slide flute, xylophone, ukulele, duck call, boat whistle and bagpipe to create what Cruikshank called the \\"strange, gallopy feeling\\" of 1920s/1930s dance-band music, of which she is a devotee.Counts, p. 45 \\"Quasi at the Quackadero\\" won awards and was shown at the Los Angeles Film Exposition, and made its first theatrical booking at the Northside Theater in Berkeley, not far from Cruikshank's home at the time at 1890 Arch Street in that city.\\"A letter from Jan. 18, 1981\\", Cruikshank blog, December 23, 2009 Other early projects Cruikshank's next short, the eight-minute, 35mm \\"Make Me Psychic\\" (1978; working title \\"Mesmeroid Madness\\") returns Quasi and Anita and adds the suave Snozzy. Built around a device that taps into one's latent telekinetic power, leading to slapstick at a party, the $14,000 film also was financed by Cruikshank, with the higher budget going toward the hiring of additional cel painters and increased lab fees. Of its slicker look than her previous short, Cruikshank said, \\"People didn't know what to make of 'Quasi.' It was pretty hard to absorb in one sitting, solid. So, I thought I would try directing the eye more, by simplifying things and giving the next film a clearer focus.\\" The Cheap Suit Serenaders again supplied music. In 1980, Cruikshank won a $10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to create a storyboard and three-minute sample reel for a proposed animated feature, Quasi's Cabaret, which she described as involving \\"three hedonistic ducks who try to open the ultimate tropical nightclub.\\" She also tried developing feature projects combining live action and animation, one a comedy set in a mental institution, the other, Joystick, \\"sort of a humorous horror story\\" about the effects of computer animation on an artist modeled on herself. Additionally, she attempted to sell cable-TV networks on \\"Weird Airways\\", a projected series of three-minute shorts starring Snozzy as the owner-pilot of a charter airline and Anita as a flight attendant. Later work and life Cruikshank evolved a recognizable style with surrealistic and psychedelic elements.

Activism Downey has been active in a variety of causes including feminism and anti-smoking campaigns before becoming a public representative of atheism. Margaret Downey is known for her activities in this area. Her first major involvement as a publicly active nontheist was when her son Matthew was not allowed to renew his membership in the Boy Scouts of America since he was raised in a nontheist household. This led to Margaret Downey v. Boy Scouts of America, which did not go far in the courts before the United States Supreme Court's 2000 decision in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale that the Boy Scouts constituted a private organization and could thus choose their own membership criteria, thus preventing Downey from taking her case further. Since then Downey has been a prominent public representative of atheism in the United States as well as representing atheists and other non-theists at United Nations conferences. Her work has been incorporated into United Nations reports on religious discrimination. Downey is also affiliated with a variety of other organizations that promote atheism and the separation of church and state such as Freedom From Religion Foundation of which she is a board member and the American Humanist Association of which she is a past board member.

Smelting occurred during the first period (1635-1659) at Skellefte√§lven; during the second period (1770-1810) at Adolfstr√∂m in Arjeplog . History=During First Phase It was an indigenous Sami man by the name of Peder Olofsson who had made the first discovery of ore. Although it was a commercial fiasco, the mine never delivered much silver about 860 kg and 250 tons of lead, however it was historically important as it contributed to the development of infrastructure in this part of Lappland, most notably the Nasa trail and the city of Arjeplog. And was the beginning of Sweden's efforts to become a major power. Many men were conscripted to work the mines, and were noted to have been worked hard and brutishly, along with receiving little or none of their wages of flour, salt, tobacco and liquor. It was found that the foreman Isak Tiock had been keeping most of the wages for himself as well as cruelly treating those who would not work. Afterwards a royal commission imprisoned him and had all depths paid. The main supply route for the mine, worked by the Sami and their reindeer Operations during the first period (1635-1659) were carried out with forced recruited labor. The Sami were not forced to work in the mines but were conscripted into supply and transport work using their sleds and reindeer. They would take the ore for smelting in Silbojokk, about 60 km away, however many fled to Norway to escape the harsh work on themselves and their animals. In August 1659, a Norwegian invasion force under the command of Preben von Ahnen (1606-1675), came over the mountains plundering and burning the mine, bringing an end to the operations.  During Second Phase The mine was deserted until the late 1770s when a new attempt was made to mine ore at Nasafj√§ll. A new mining company was formed in 1770 with mining privileges granted on February 17, 1774. Mining was conducted on a small scale. The first smelting of ore was made in the autumn of 1775. The mining operation continued with severe difficulties, however silver production remained insignificant. Major Georg Bogislaus Sta√´l von Holstein took ownership in autumn 1801. In 1810 the mining operation at Nasafj√§ll and smelting at Adolfstr√∂m completely ceased.

It is in the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Historically, the village is part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, but was transferred to Lancashire for administrative purposes on 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972. It stands above a bend in the River Hodder. The hamlet comprises Upper and Lower Whitewell. Lower Whitewell is the site of St Michael's, a chapel of ease built in the late medieval period, certainly no later than 1400, which comes under the Lancashire parish of Whalley. The restaurant and hotel, The Inn at Whitewell, is also situated in Lower Whitewell. History From the late 14th century, the Inn anciently housed the forest courts of the Forest of Bowland and provided lodgings for the Master Forester. There is evidence of Master Foresters in Bowland dating back as early as the late 12th century. It is thought that the ancient administrative centre of the forest was at Hall Hill, north-north-east of the current hamlet. It is conjectured that this motte ‚Äì now merely an earthwork mound surmounted by trees overlooking the old keeper's cottage at Seed Hill Farm ‚Äì formed the centre of an early medieval hunting laund (enclosure) known as Radholme which is mentioned as a vill in Domesday.MC Higham, \\"The Mottes of North Lancashire, Lonsdale and South Cumbria\\", Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmoreland Archaeological & Antiquarian Society, Vol 91: 79‚Äì90 (1991) Sir Walter Urswyk was Master Forester to John of Gaunt, 11th Lord of Bowland and it is Urswyk who seems to have been responsible for the shift to Lower Whitewell sometime between 1372‚Äì1403. Bowland appears to undergone wholesale manorial reorganisation in the second half of the 14th century, a process that may have been driven by a fall in population resulting from the Black Death (1348‚Äì50) and the absorption of Bowland into the Duchy of Lancaster after 1360. After 1660, the office of Master Forester fell into abeyance. The forest courts at Whitewell ‚Äì a swainmote and a woodmote ‚Äì were presided over by a Chief Steward or more often his deputy, one of whose duties was to appoint a bowbearer (or more often two bowbearers) on behalf of the Lord of Bowland. The responsibilities of the bowbearer were akin to those of a chief verderer ‚Äì an unpaid official appointed to protect vert and venison and responsible for supervising and assisting in the enforcement of forest laws.R Cunliffe Shaw, \\"The Royal Forest of Lancaster\\" (Guardian Press: Preston 1956) The Parkers of Browsholme Hall have traditionally claimed the office of bowbearer as an hereditary right but this claim was an early 19th fabrication and has now been discredited. The family were certainly bowbearers for successive generations between the 17th and 19th centuries but the right of appointment was always a prerogative of their local lord, the Lord of Bowland,M Greenwood & C Bolton, \\"Bolland Forest and the Hodder Valley\\" (Landy Publishing: Blackpool 2000; orig. pub. 1955) the so-called Lord of the Fells. Although the forest courts at Whitewell fell into disuse in the first half of the 19th century, the 16th Lord of Bowland chose in April 2010 to appoint Robert Parker of Browsholme Hall his bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, the first Parker to be so appointed in more than 150 years.Official Forest of Bowland AONB website ) Whitewell Estate Since 1938, much of the land and property in the area has formed part of the Duchy of Lancaster Whitewell Estate, as black plaques throughout the area serve to remind. The surrounding forest has been the hunting ground of kings since the time of William Rufus. The present monarch is said to be fond of the area, visiting the Inn at Whitewell for lunch in 2006. Nearby settlements include Dunsop Bridge which claims to be the centre of the United Kingdom, and Clitheroe, the administrative centre of the borough. Contemporary Whitewell enjoyed brief media attention in 2009 when it was reported that Charles Towneley Strachey, 4th Baron O'Hagan had stepped forward on behalf of the Towneley family to claim the title of 15th Lord of Bowland. Previously, the Lordship of Bowland had been thought lost or in the possession of the Crown having disappeared from the historical record in late 19th century. The Towneleys had owned the Bowland Forest Estate from 1835 and it transpired that the title had been retained by an extinct family trust. Controversially, Lord O'Hagan went on to sell the title. The 16th Lord of Bowland was later revealed to be a Cambridge University don. In April 2010, it was announced that the 16th Lord of Bowland had appointed Charles Bowman, landlord of the Inn at Whitewell, as Chief Steward of the Forest of Bowland, the first such appointment since 1922. The appointment was short-lived, however, and in May 2011, chartered surveyor Michael Parkinson of Ingham & Yorke of Clitheroe assumed the role. The Inn at Whitewell was featured in TV series The Trip directed by Michael Winterbottom, starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon.

He finished 4th out of 5th place in the block vote. The winners was the other Conservative candidate in the slate Richard Bennett and Liberal incumbent William Henry Cushing. The province's electoral districts would see significant redistribution in the 1913 Alberta general election and Calgary would be divided up into 3 constituencies. Blow ran as the Conservative candidate in the new South Calgary riding. He won the new district in a landslide over Liberal candidate Clifford Jones. Blow served in the official opposition. Blow stood for re-election in the 1917 Alberta general election this time defeating Labor candidate and future federal Member of Parliament William Irvine and alderman John McNeill to earn a second term in office. Calgary would grow to 5 seats in the 1921 Alberta general election and be changed back to a block vote, Blow would run for re-election amongst 20 other candidates.

Several major cities like Toronto in Canada and New York City in the United States have programs to abate this, such as Toronto's Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) and New York City's Lights Out New York, a program of New York City Audubon an environmental organization. According to FLAP, between one and nine million birds die each year in the city from hitting skyscrapers due to mistaking reflective windows for open sky, or being drawn to lights at night. According to a 2014 article in the ornithological journal Condor, an estimated 365 million to 988 million birds die each year by colliding into buildings in the United States.  Legislation  Governments of Canada and the United States have recently introduced legislation to make new and existing buildings bird friendly. Examples include Toronto's Bird-Friendly Development Guidelines that requires new buildings to be bird friendly, and Chicago's Design Guide For Bird-Safe Buildings New Construction And Renovation. On the Federal level the Federal Bird-Safe Buildings Act of 2011 calls for each public building constructed, acquired, or altered by the General Services Administration (GSA) to incorporate bird-safe building materials and design features. The legislation would require GSA to take similar actions on existing buildings, where practicable. In New York City, where an estimated 230,000 birds collide with buildings each year, New York's Bird Friendly-Buildings Act required new and existing building be bird friendly effective Jan 1, 2012. In December 2019, a bill passed mandating that the lowest 75 feet of new buildings, and structures above a green roof, must use materials such as patterned glass which are visible to flying birds. Compliance with these new standards will also be required for building renovations beginning in December 2020.  Solutions  Recent developments in legislation necessitate architects and property managers to take mitigating measures to combat the bird collision issue. There are a variety of different solutions including special window film, specialized glass, decals, screens and external shutters. Some of these solutions have been proven to significantly reduce bird collisions with buildings, but others are unproven, and require more testing to prove the claims made.

First constructed in 1933, it was used by the Soviet Union for a number of record-breaking flights. History and records The ANT-25 was designed as the result of a recommendation by Kliment Voroshilov to the Revolutionary Military Council Revvoyensovyet on 7 December 1931, to build an aircraft for long-range flights. The aircraft was designed by the brigade of the Experimental Aircraft Design Department of TsAGI led by Pavel Sukhoi under the overall supervision of Andrei Tupolev. The first prototype, designated Experimental Airplane RD-1, (also designated TsAGI-25, ANT-25), RD standing for Rekord Dalnosty, i.e. \\"Range Record\\") made its maiden flight on 22 June 1933, piloted by Mikhail Gromov, using a direct- drive M-34 engine. The first crew, Gromov, Filin and Spirin, began with a long-range test flight in September 1934 on the second prototype, the RD-2. The RD-2 used a geared M-34R engine, which substantially increased its range. They spent 75 hours in the air, covering in a single trip, (Moscow‚ÄìRyazan‚ÄìTula‚ÄìDnepropetrovsk‚ÄìKharkov). The aircraft was unable to return to Moscow because of a fuel shortage. Gromov was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. The flight was not recognised as a world record as it could not complete the circuit to Moscow, and so could not claim the closed-circuit record, while the direct distance between Moscow and Kharkov was too short for the distance in a straight-line record. Gromov and Yumashev decided to make their next long-range flight an attempt at the straight-line record. They wanted to fly the traditional long-range route via Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to South America. A crewman, Sigizmund Levanevsky, on studying some maps, suggested they fly in a completely different direction ‚Äì to the north. Polar aviators were extremely popular at that time, so his plan was considered plausible. The flight was cancelled in the spring of 1935 when he fell seriously ill. The next long-range flight planned was from Moscow to the US via the North Pole. A sloping concrete runway, in length, was built at Schelkovo air base near Moscow. In the early morning of 3 August 1935, Levanevsky, Baydukov and Levchenko climbed aboard their RD and took to the air. For the first , the aircraft ascended to only . They then steadily increased their altitude to , maintaining an average speed of . After approximately , an oil leak was discovered, but the aircraft was able to make an emergency landing at Krechevits near Novgorod. Levanevsky was called to a Politburo meeting, where he blamed Tupolev, declaring that his single-engined ANT-25 was underpowered. It seemed to be the end for the aircraft. His second pilot, Georgy Baydukov, who was also an aviation engineer, disagreed and proposed Valery Chkalov for a second attempt. Chkalov was at first sceptical about his selection, as he was a fighter pilot with little navigational knowledge. Baydukov briefed Chkalov on the finer points of flying the ANT-25 and proposed Alexander Belyakov, who was the chief instructor of their flight academy, as their third crewman. Chkalov's authority was enough to convince Joseph Stalin. In July 1936, the record was broken by Chkalov, Georgy Baydukov and Belyakov flying the same aircraft from Moscow to the Far East (Stalin's Route) in 56 hours 20 minutes, a distance of . They passed Franz Josef Land‚ÄìSevernaya Zemlya‚ÄìTiksi‚ÄìYakutia‚ÄìPetropavlovsk- Kamchatsky‚ÄìKhabarovsk‚ÄìOkhotsk Sea and landed on a beach at Udd Island (now called Chkalov Island), near the Amur River. The next day, the Pravda newspaper published a leading article \\"Glory to Stalin's Falcons!\\" (¬´–°–ª–∞–≤–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º —Å–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–º!¬ª).See also Glory to Stalin's Sokols ‚Äì conquerors of the air!

Dolgorukov, 1937 A wooden runway was constructed on Udd island, and on 2 August the ANT-25 departed for Moscow. The trip back lasted a week, with stops at Khabarovsk, Chita, Krasnoyarsk and Omsk, with a grand welcome at each. Chkalov's trio each became a Heroes of the Soviet Union. Two islands nearby were renamed after Baydukov and Belyakov. Chkalov's achievement became world-famous; however, the Politburo still wanted the publicity of a direct flight. Gromov was ordered to fly to Brazil on 14 August 1936 in a second ANT-25, but as he prepared for the start on 25 September, Brazilian officials denied access to the Soviet plane, and the flight was cancelled. Both Chkalov's and Gromov's crews were now destined to fly north from Moscow to San Francisco. Over 18‚Äì20 June 1937 ‚Äì the same crew of Valery Chkalov, co- pilot Georgy Baydukov and navigator A. Belyakov made a non-stop flight from Moscow to Portland, United States, in bad weather. At the 60-hour point they passed Seattle, and after two more hours they passed the Portland lighthouse on the Columbia River and headed deeper into US territory. Over the city of Eugene they found they were short of fuel and turned back for the army airbase at Fort Vancouver Barracks at Vancouver, Oleg Shushakov, Chkalov Valery Pavlovich, last updated 21.08.2008 at Maksim Moshkow's Library (accessed 18.01.2009) landing at Pearson Airfield.

In 1975, an obelisk was erected on the airfield to commemorate this event. Commemorative stamp illustration of the Moscow-San Jacinto transpolar flight Another widely publicized feat was the Moscow‚ÄìSan Jacinto non-stop flight in a backup aircraft just three weeks after Chkalov's. This journey, via the North Pole, covered and ended in a dairy pasture outside of San Jacinto, California, after they had encountered fog conditions in San Diego and as far inland as March Air Force base in Riverside. The landing site is marked by California State Historical Landmark Number 989. The crew, still composed of Gromov, Yumashev, and Danilin, flew for 62 hours and 17 minutes between 12 and 14 July 1937. After landing, the aircraft still had sufficient fuel for approximately , enough to reach Panama. This would have involved crossing the Mexican border without the permission of FAI sporting officials. Gromov became an unofficial Soviet Pilot No. 1, though Chkalov remained the favourite pilot of the Soviet people. Joy at the achievements were tempered by Levanevsky crashing on the same route in a brand-new four-engined DB-A. The record set by the Soviets was broken by two British Vickers Wellesley bombers which flew from Egypt to Australia in November 1938; a distance of .Andrews C.F. and E.B. Morgan.

Aim in life. Moscow, 1966. Page 77 Nikolai Polikarpov escaped arrest. The Soviets displayed the ANT-25 flown by Chkalov from Moscow to Vancouver at their pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Technology The main reason for the aircraft's success was its wing design. The wide-span wings gave the aircraft good range and fuel-efficiency, and they could also house large fuel tanks. The proportion of the wingspan to the chord was more than a factor of 13. Fuel was 52% of the takeoff weight, the tanks had been moved from the fuselage ‚Äì this allowed the wings to tension as fuel weight opposed the aerodynamics forces. Research was conducted into special forms of vibration of the aircraft because of the longer wings and at a speed greater than some critical point ‚Äì the so-called flutter effect. To stay afloat after ditching, the ANT-25 used air-filled bags made of rubberised fabric. According to the archives, the idea of a military variant of the RD first came to the engineer Zhemchuzhin of the 7th sector of the Soviet Air Force Scientific Research Institute. However, its slow speed, low altitude, poor maneuverability and large wingspan made it a perfect target for fighters and anti-aircraft guns. Only two aircraft were manufactured, which were followed by the Tupolev DB-1.Note: According to Bill Gunston in \\"The Encyclopedia of Russian Aircraft\\", 13 additional RDs were built for military use, four of which were converted to BOK-1, ‚àí7 , ‚àí11, and ‚àí15 for pressurization development.Another source gives 16 military variants abbreviated to the RDD; later models used Jumo 4 (Junkers Jumo 004?) and AN-1 engines.

Provenzano said he believed himself to be Jesus Christ and also compared his execution with Christ's crucifixion.  Murders  Provenzano was an unemployed electrician when, on January 10, 1984, he entered the Orange County courthouse in Orlando carrying a shotgun, an assault rifle, and a revolver, along with a large quantity of ammunition. He opened fire with the revolver when two bailiffs approached to search him.http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/provenzano647.htm Provenzano had been charged with disorderly conduct five months earlier and had gone to the courthouse with the intention of shooting the officer who had charged him.http://www.odmp.org/officer/14186-deputy-sheriff-arnold-william-wilkerson Instead, he killed 60-year-old Deputy Sheriff William Arnie Wilkerson, a retired Navy Lt. Commander who had served 14 years with the Sheriff's Department. In addition, 53-year-old Deputy Sheriff Harry Dalton was wounded and suffered brain damage, becoming partially paralyzed and eventually dying from his injuries in 1991.http://www.prosecutor.co.clark.in.us/html/death/US/provenzano647.htm 19-year-old Correctional Officer Mark Parker was hit in the spine and paralyzed from the neck down after being caught in the crossfire as he used his own body to shield a civilian from the gunfire.http://www.odmp.org/officer/195-deputy-sheriff-harry-jordan-dalton-jr Parker eventually died in March 2009 due to complications from his injuries. Provenzano would be found guilty and sentenced to death for the attack.Defendant opens fire in courtroom, kills 1  Legal proceedings  In 1999, the state of Florida heard a petition from Provenzano that argued that the electric chair was a cruel and unusual punishment. During the proceedings, Michael Minerva, who had witnessed Jerry White's execution, said that \\"White's body stiffened and was thrust upward and backward to the back of the electric chair\\" after the current had been switched on. He stated he heard air moving through White's lips and throat, though he could not tell whether the air was going in or out. But even after the execution by electric chair of Allen Lee Davis had caused many irregularities, the constitutionality of the electric chair remained upheld. However, by the time the inmate following Davis was to be executed, Florida inmates sentenced to death could choose between lethal injection and the electric chair. Provenzano was originally scheduled to be the second person executed in Florida's newly built electric chair on July 14, 1999, but the execution was stayed following the gruesome death of Allen Lee Davis six days before. Provenzano‚Äôs eventual execution was carried out using a lethal injection protocol subsequently adopted by the Florida state legislature. Provenzano had spent almost 16 years on death row before being executed at Florida State Prison in Starke on June 21, 2000. He was the 48th murderer executed in Florida since that state's reintroduction of the death penalty in 1976.

Coming out of high school, Charles was heavily recruited by perennial basketball powerhouses like Oklahoma, Mississippi State, Alabama, and Arkansas.http://rivalshoops.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?Sport=2‚â∫_key=13364 Rhodes committed early on in his senior year to Mississippi State and had a solid season leading Lanier High School to a state runner up finish that year by averaging 18.4ppg, 12.1rpg, and 2.7bpg. College As a freshman at Mississippi State University, Rhodes was used sparingly due to minor off court incidents like showing late for practices and missing a team flight to a game. Playing time was also in short supply due to senior All American Lawrence Roberts starting ahead of Rhodes. Through these setbacks, Rhodes made 16 appearances and averaged 2.9ppg and 1.9rpg in 6.5 minutes per game. At the end of the season, Rhodes declared his intention to transfer out of MSU, but after meetings with head coach Rick Stansbury, Rhodes ended up staying. Rhodes' sophomore campaign fared much better than his first. Due to the team being quite young, Rhodes started in 25 game and was called upon to be a team leader. He responded by co-leading the team in scoring with 13.8ppg and leading the team with 7.1rpg. The increased production led to post season recognition from the AP as well as the SEC Coaches by being voted Second Team All SEC by both groups.http://www.mstateathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=90867&SPID;=10994&DB;_OEM_ID=16800&ATCLID;=944342&Q;_SEASON=2006 Entering his junior year, Rhodes was tabbed as a preseason second team ALL SEC player as well as the preseason defensive player of the year in the SEC. Again starting in 25 games, Rhodes averaged 13.7ppg and 6.2rpg through the season. Injuring his wrist in a non-conference game against Charlotte, Rhodes sat out the next game and struggled to regain his form through the following four games. Once the SEC season rolled around, Rhodes was healthy and averaged 15.4ppg in conference games. Offense always being the strong art of his game, Rhodes scored over 20 points seven times through the season. He also compiled two double doubles over the season (against University of Tennessee and West Virginia University).http://www.nmnathletics.com/fls/16800/pdf/mbb/mbk_quickfacts_200708.pdf With the help of Rhodes, the Bulldogs fought their way to the NIT semi-finals only to lose on a last second shot to the eventual champions West Virginia. Once again, Rhodes was named to the postseason Second Team ALL-SEC by the coaches. Following his junior year, Rhodes declared for the 2007 NBA Draft. Choosing not to hire an agent allowed Rhodes to test the waters without leaving school for good. Though he was not invited to the NBA predraft workouts in Orlando, and no teams invited him for private workouts, Rhodes stayed in the draft until the last possible day. Rhodes released this official statement after withdrawing: > \\"I have officially withdrawn my name from the 2007 NBA Draft by faxing the > required paperwork to the NBA office. The NBA put this policy in place to > allow underclassmen like myself to test the draft waters, and I simply took > advantage of the opportunity. I now have a better perspective on the areas > of my game that I need to work on in order to improve my status for next > year's draft. I'm now looking forward to getting back to work and helping my > teammates compete for another championship. At the same time, it has always > been a goal of mine to earn my degree from Mississippi State, and I'm in a > position to accomplish that goal this coming May with another solid year in > the > classroom.\\"http://www.mstateathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=90865&SPID;=10994&ATCLID;=945546&DB;_OEM_ID=16800 In his final year, Rhodes looks to break the 1000 point barrier needing only 87 more points to do so. By returning for his senior year, Rhodes will be half of one of the most dangerous inside-out teams in the conference, with Jamont Gordon being the other part. Having only made it to the NCAA tournament one time, during his freshman year, he has said that it is a personal goal to help lead the Bulldogs back to the tournament. Professional career In the 2010-11 season, Rhodes played for Busan KT Sonicboom in South Korea. He had a successful season, leading the team to the best regular-season record for the first time in its history. He then re-signed with the team for the 2011-12 season, getting as far as the second round of the KBL playoffs. On April 3, 2012, he signed with CAI Zaragoza in Spain. In summer 2012, he signed with Royal Halƒ± Gaziantep of the Turkish Basketball League. In summer 2013, he played again in South Korea after being drafted by Incheon ET Land Elephants. In March 2017, he was signed by the San Miguel Beermen as their import for the 2017 PBA Commissioner's Cup. The team won the cup in six games.

Petrohu√© Waterfalls (pronounced petro-WEH; ) is a chute-type waterfall in the upper reach of Petrohu√© River in Chile, a short distance downstream of the source of this river in Todos los Santos Lake. This waterfall is inside the Vicente P√©rez Rosales National Park, close to the road leading to the Petrohue locality on lake Todos los Santos. Tourists on the international route between Puerto Montt in Chile and Bariloche in Argentina are generally offered a stop for a walk to enjoy the sights. The waterfall is supported by basaltic lava (andesite) stemming from the Osorno Volcano that sits in between Todos los Santos and Llanquihue Lake and provides an interesting background for pictures. The average water flow of these falls is of 270 m3 per second, but it can be much larger during the rainy season when the surface level of lake Todos los Santos rises by up to 3 meters. The water, decanted in the lake, is usually clear with a green hue; however, occasionally, when lahars descending from the volcano are active, water at the falls can be loaded with sand and silt. Transport of these abrasive materials explains the polished aspect of the rocks. Attentive visitors may spot a couple of torrent ducks mastering the rapids, with their chicks when in season.

The channel launched in 1991 and existed until 2002.  History  Sneak Prevue logo used from 1996 to 1999. Sneak Prevue launched in 1991 as a service for promoting pay-per-view services, providing viewers with a listing and showcase of the events and movies that were showing in the next 30 minutes, up to previews of coming films and events. It was originally owned by the Prevue Networks subsidiary of United Video Satellite Group, and was spun off from the television listings service Prevue Channel (which would become TVGN, and is now known as Pop). In 1999, when the Prevue Channel transformed into the TV Guide Channel, Sneak Prevue remained under its respective name and format. On June 11, 1998, United Video Satellite Group purchased TV Guide from News Corporation for $800 million and 60 million shares of stock worth an additional $1.2 billion (this followed an earlier merger attempt between the two companies in 1996 that eventually fell apart).News Lite: TV Guide Deal Sets Up Broadcast Opportunity, Los Angeles Daily News, June 12, 1998.

Retrieved on February 12, 2014 from HighBeam Research. This resulted in subsequent renaming of Prevue Channel to the TV Guide Channel on February 1. Following the purchase, a revamp of Sneak Prevue's software and on-air presentation was implemented after February 1, 1999, or whenever cable companies upgraded their equipment for TVGC's new presentation mode. On October 5, 1999, Gemstar International Group Ltd. purchased United Video Satellite Group, which was renamed Gemstar-TV Guide International; the two companies had previously been involved in a legal battle over the intellectual property rights for their respective interactive program guide systems, VCR Plus+ and TV Guide On Screen, that began in 1994.Electronic Rival To Buy TV Guide, The Washington Post, October 5, 1999.

Retrieved on 2014-02-12 from http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-629280.html. In December 1999, the new management planned another revamp for the network, with plans to rename the channel as Screen TV. These plans included more focus on other services from participating providers, such as digital cable and high-speed internet, and short-form programming relating to the types of programming seen on PPV, as well as celebrity interviews. However, these plans were eventually scrapped for various reasons (including the move to digital cable, as well as the lack of customization providers carrying Screen TV would've had, in comparison to Sneak Prevue), and the channel quietly ceased operations in April 2002 as its content was merged within the scrolling listings grid of parent network TV Guide Channel, including pricing and ordering information. This was most likely due to the fact that dominant pay-per-view provider In Demand provided its own barker channel, and as a result of other cable systems deciding to advertise their film lineups on their own. The ending also coincided with the discontinuation of Laserdisc production by Imation.  Format  Like the Prevue Channel, Sneak Prevue was personalized for cable and satellite providers, featuring the individual provider's logos with advertisements and listings. The service also utilized Amiga 2000 hardware, which the Prevue Channel used to provide its scrolling listings grid.Sneak Prevue Amiga 2000 hardware , amiga-hardware.com Since Sneak Prevue used the same brand of computer hardware as Prevue Guide (although the terminal powering the Sneak Prevue video and graphics was hooked up to headends separately from the terminal used to power the Prevue system), the Amiga system was known for crashing periodically, often with a screen notifying viewers to stand by due to difficulties with the system. Additionally, the system would also freeze frequently. A black line would often run across the entire screen until cable system technicians finally restored the service by rebooting its hardware. The channel featured shortened trailers to preview movies and events expected to air on the provider's pay-per-view services, which were provided to cable and satellite operators regularly both on laserdisc as well as via a continuous satellite feed. These short trailers, whether sourced locally or delivered via satellite, would feature listings information at the bottom of the screen, which was locally overlaid into their video feed to provide system-specific scheduling information, with countdowns to the next telecast of the program appearing at the top left of the screen. The main listings were displayed behind a series of colorful backgrounds with the current date on the top left of the screen, the current time (displayed in the same hour/minute/second format as that used on Prevue/TV Guide Channel's on-screen grid) on the top right, the cable or satellite provider's logo in the top center and pay-per- view listings text on the remaining three-quarters of the screen. Various clips of production music played over the full-screen listings, with an audio track of an announcer promoting the channel and pay-per-view. Throughout its nearly 11-year tenure, many changes were made to the on-screen backgrounds and music. Segments similar to those seen on Prevue/TV Guide Channel were featured on the service including \\"Sneak Prevue Tonight\\" (which featured information on that evening's pay-per-view programming), \\"Up Next\\" (featuring information on programs starting in the next half-hour or hour), \\"Adults Only\\" (featuring previews of programming on adult-oriented networks such as Hot Choice; video trailers seen during this segment did not include any overt sexual content) and \\"Premiering Soon\\" (which provided previews of films and events set to air on pay-per-view in the next few weeks). Often, advertisements from the local cable provider would be inserted onto the channel, promoting that company's products and services.

Military forces from the state of Shu Han, led by their chancellor-regent Zhuge Liang, planned to seize control of Chang'an, a strategic city in Shu's rival state, Cao Wei. The three commanderies of Nan'an, Tianshui, and Anding were captured by Shu forces, but these territorial gains were later lost after the Battle of Jieting. As mentioned in the biography of the Wei general Zhang He: \\"The commanderies of Nan'an, Tianshui and Anding rebelled and defected to (Zhuge) Liang, (Zhang) He pacified all of them.\\"(ÂçóÂÆâ„ÄÅÂ§©Ê∞¥„ÄÅÂÆâÂÆöÈÉ°ÂèçÊáâ‰∫ÆÔºåÈÉÉÁöÜÁ†¥Âπ≥‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17. Background At Hanzhong Commandery, during a war council meeting, Zhuge Liang proposed a wide left flanking manoeuvre to seize the upper Wei River valley to capture the city itself. Wei Yan objected to the plan and proposed a strike through a pass in the Qinling Mountains with 10,000 elite troops to take Chang'an by surprise. Zhuge Liang rejected the plan because it was too ambitious and went for a more cautious approach. The objective was to seize Chang'an along with Tianshui (Â§©Ê∞¥; around present-day Tianshui, Gansu), Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu), and Nan'an (ÂçóÂÆâ; around present-day Longxi County, Gansu) commanderies, and Mount Qi (Á•ÅÂ±±; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). The revolt In 228, Zhuge Liang declared that he would march through the Xie Gorge to take Mei County (ÈÉøÁ∏£; southeast of present-day Fufeng County, Shaanxi). He sent Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi as decoys to give the appearance of threatening Mei County and to occupy Ji County (ÂÜÄÁ∏£; present-day Gangu County, Gansu). Cao Zhen led his armies to oppose them. Zhuge Liang personally led the armies to besiege Mount Qi; the ranks were ordered, discipline severe and authority apparent. The three commanderies of Nan'an, Tianshui, and Anding all revolted and defected from the Wei side to Zhuge Liang, sending shockwaves throughout Liang Province. Cao Rui moved to Chang'an to oversee the defences. Cao Zhen secured Mei County against Zhao Yun, while a combined cavalry-infantry force of 50,000 under Zhang He went west to oppose Zhuge Liang's main army. At that moment, Jiang Wei was patrolling the outskirts with his commanding officer Ma Zun (È¶¨ÈÅµ), the Administrator of Tianshui Commandery. Afraid that Jiang Wei might be colluding with the Shu army, Ma Zun fled secretly at night to Shanggui County (‰∏äÈÇΩÁ∏£; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu). When Jiang Wei discovered this, it was already too late and on returning to Shanggui County, the defenders refused to open the gates for him. As a result, Jiang Wei defected to the Shu side along with his colleagues Liang Xu (Ê¢ÅÁ∑í), Yin Shang (Â∞πË≥û), and Liang Qian (Ê¢ÅËôî). There was in fact no battle at Tianshui; only a revolt took place. The area surrounding the city submitted quickly to Shu, enabling the army to advance steadily but the Shu army had suffered a setback at the Battle of Jieting, when Zhang He defeated Ma Su who was sent by Zhuge Liang to handle him. Zhuge Liang gave the order for a retreat back to Shu territory. Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi were also ordered to counter Cao Zhen, but their troop strengths were inferior to that of the enemy. Hence they were defeated at Ji Gorge (ÁÆïË∞∑; east of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi), but their centre held firm and thus avoided a great defeat. Zhao Yun and his army withdrew. The commanderies that rose in revolt to join Shu were later pacified by Zhang He and returned to Wei control. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In Chapters 92 and 93 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Jiang Wei was one of the reasons Zhuge Liang went on this expedition, and getting Jiang to defect to Shu became a goal after his quick battle with Zhao Yun. Zhuge Liang sent Zhao Yun ahead first, and after a skirmish and some scheming he comes onto the battlefield. During the battle, Ma Zun (È¶¨ÈÅµ) suspected Jiang Wei of plotting with the enemy. When Jiang Wei was outside Tianshui, Ma Zun closed the city gates and denied Jiang Wei entry. Jiang Wei had no choice but to defect to Zhuge Liang's side. In popular culture Starting from the fourth instalment in Koei's video game series Dynasty Warriors, there is a playable stage called \\"Battle of Tian Shui\\" that is based on the fictional account of the revolt in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. If the player is playing as Jiang Wei, Wei forces will win the battle, but Jiang himself would later join Shu. If the player is playing on the Shu side, he must defeat Jiang Wei to make him defect to Shu. NotesReferences * Chen, Shou.

It replaced the use of the river Loire, which was unreliable during winter floods and summer droughts. Aqueducts were used to cross the Allier at Le Gu√©tin (in the commune of Cuffy) and the Loire at Digoin. However, because of the extreme length required, an aqueduct was not built to cross the Loire at Briare until 1896, when the Briare aqueduct was constructed. History By the late 18th century with the completion of the Canal du Centre, the Bourbonnais route from the Seine to the Sa√¥ne was substantially the same as at present, except for the use of the navigable Loire between Briare and Digoin. The introduction of steam haulage and dredging failed to produce the reliability of the canals, so it was in 1822 that the order to build was finally given to the Compagnie des Quatre Canaux. Although the original intention was to place the canal on the right bank, the towns of Nevers, la Charit√© and Cosne had no room for a canal and eventually construction started in 1827 on a canal on the left bank. Two massive stone aqueducts were built at Digoin and at Gu√©tin to avoid level crossings of rivers with length 243m and 470m respectively, but this was not possible at Briare because of the danger of blocking the river during flood periods. With the adoption of the Freycinet gauge in 1879, and the upgrading of the canal system, the frequent delays of several days to cross the Loire at Briare became intolerable. The Briare aqueduct was built over the Loire in Briare between 1890 and 1896 by the engineer Abel Mazoyer to make a connection with the Canal de Briare four locks up from its initial entrance. The Briare aqueduct stands on fourteen piers. These support a single metal beam carrying a trough with more than 13,000 tonnes of water, 2.2 metres deep. The width of the aqueduct, towpaths included, is 11.5 meters and its length is 662.7 meters. Eight sluices make it possible to empty the aqueduct in the event of severe freezing.

After reading for every Aaron Spelling production, sometimes for 2 or 3 roles in the same episode, she landed the role of Sara Cummings in Spelling's first daytime drama, Sunset Beach. Batten stayed with the show until its cancellation in 1999. She then joined the cast of teen drama Spyder Games where she played the leading role and appeared in 59 out of 60 episodes.

Early history In 1875, the newly established coal mines of Treherbert brought workers from Aberdare and Merthyr and with them the game of rugby;Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp102 and that year saw their first recorded rugby game between a team of players from Treherbert and a team from Merthyr who already had a well established \\"town\\" side. On 18 January 1879 a team from Treherbert travelled to Cardiff to play the city team. By 1884 Treherbert had established regular fixtures with the Cardiff Second XV, Merthyr, Aberdare and Pontypridd. The club's first major success came in 1889-90 by means of the Glamorgan League Championship, a title they were to win on another five occasions. In 1895 Treherbert RFC applied for and were successful in achieving WRU affiliation.Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp101 Early in the 1920s another club was formed in the neighbourhood, Blaenrhondda. They played on a field belonging to a local farmer and under the guidance of Mr. T. L. Mort, the local Colliery Agent, the Hay Field was transformed into a rugby pitch. However, after struggling during a difficult period in the early 1920s the team was close to disbanding. Around this time the private company that owned the Treherbert R.F.C.'s field sold the Hay Field to Great Western Railway and the Treherbert Club found themselves without a home. With Treherbert homeless and Blaenrhondda struggling to survive, the future appeared rather dim. In 1929 Treherbert RFC disbanded due to financial troublesFields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp259 and the remains of the team moved the mile up the valley to Blaenrhondda to merge with the smaller club.

He is noted for being the first actor to play the role of Tonto, the Lone Ranger's Native- American companion, on the screen. Family and education Information available about Daniels is limited and vague. He repeatedly said he was born in the Oklahoma Territory. But his Social Security application lists his birth date as April 12, 1899, and his birthplace as Santa Cruz County in the Arizona Territory. He listed his parents as Jesus Daniels and Tomaca Daniels. Victor Daniels (\\"Chief Thunder Cloud\\") Social Security Application At various times he falsely claimed to be Cherokee and Creek. He had a sister named Anita, born October 6, 1911, in Tucson, Pima County, Arizona Territory. On her birth certificate she listed similar parents with Jesus Daniel (born in Sonora) and Tomaso Acuna (born in Arizona). Thundercloud's first marriage was to 17-year- old Mildred Turner (from Missouri) on May 26, 1925, in Los Angeles. At that time, he called himself ‚ÄúVictor Vasquez.‚Äù Their son Victor Junior Daniels was born on May 7, 1926, and a second son, Norman Daniels, on September 5, 1927, both in Los Angeles. Thundercloud divorced Mildred and later married Frances Courtright on April 26, 1933.The Lone Ranger Rides Again pressbook, via B-Westerns; retrieved 11 August 2007. His Lone Ranger press biography claimed he was derived from the \\"Muskogee aristocracy\\"[sic]‚Äîbut the concept of European \\"royalty\\" and \\"aristocrats\\" is foreign to Native American cultures. He was actually the first of nine children born to Jesus and Tomaca Daniels (as indicated on his Social Security application). The pressbook for The Lone Ranger Rides Again announced his parents as \\"Dark Cloud and Morning Star, aristocrats of the Muskogee tribe\\" [sic], while his death certificate lists his father as Joseph Mahawa. Raised on a ranch in Arizona, he claimed to have attended the University of Arizona at Tucson, where he \\"excelled scholastically and in athletics (football, boxing).\\" However, no record exists of his enrollment or attendance at the school under the name Daniels or any other name he used.Profile, b-westerns.com; accessed August 11, 2007. Work as a character actor Daniels worked many jobs before becoming a stuntman‚Äîcowboy on cattle ranches, miner, rodeo performer, and tour guide‚Äîbefore he went to Hollywood to try his luck at acting. From there he graduated to character actor status. His title \\"Chief\\" was a Hollywood invention, a stage name. He had the title role in Geronimo (1939) and played Tonto in both Republic Lone Ranger serials, The Lone Ranger (1938) and The Lone Ranger Rides Again (1939). Throughout the 1940s, Daniels continued to work as a character actor, maintaining the Chief Thundercloud persona. In most of the films in which he was featured, he played an antagonist opposing the white protagonist. For example, in the film \\"Young Buffalo Bill\\" (1940) he played Akuna, a renegade Native American chief who commits murder while working as a hired hand. In the film Renegade Girl (1946), he played the main villain, Chief Whitecloud, a vengeful antagonist with a vendetta against the protagonist's family. Although featured in a number of films, Daniels was uncredited in some films, such as Gun Smoke (1936), a film about a ranch defending itself from a flood of sheep. He also appeared in the first two parts of the serial Custer's Last Stand (1936), again uncredited. Daniels had a short appearance on early television on The Gene Autry Show (1950). One of his last appearances was on March 1, 1955, as the Apache Geronimo in the premiere episode of the syndicated television series Buffalo Bill, Jr. starring Dick Jones in the fictional title role of a young Texas frontier marshal.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), p. 114. Daniels appeared as Chief Thundercloud in the 1954 episode \\"The Saint's Portrait\\" of the syndicated anthology series Death Valley Days hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, a painting of Saint Joseph is thought by a tribe and its covetous neighbor to be magical. However, the mission priest, Father Mariano (Martin Garralaga), reveals its deeper meaning. The episode also starred Rico Alaniz, George J. Lewis, and Eugenia Paul. Legal problems and later years According to the Los Angeles Daily News, Daniels was fined $200 and sentenced to four years of probation in 1951 after he pleaded guilty to violating the Corporate Security Act. He was told to make restitution of $5,625 to his victims after he had sold them shares in films without a permit.Los Angeles Daily News, 23 March 1951. See also Hollywood Citizen-News, 24 October 1952. During his final years, he worked with other western actors performing in live shows at the Corriganville Movie Ranch, now the Corriganville Regional Park, near Simi Valley, California. Death Victor Daniels died at age 56 following surgery for stomach cancer in Ventura County, California, on December 1, 1955. He was survived by his wife, Frances. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, near Los Angeles.Certificate of Death, Chief Thunder Cloud (aka Victor Daniels), State of California, County of Ventura, 1 December 1955. His last film role was in the John Wayne film The Searchers (1956), which was released after his death. The Lone Ranger and legacy Poster for the 13th episode of the Lone Ranger serial After working for some time as a stuntman and in bit parts, it was Daniels' portrayal of the character Tonto in the serial The Lone Ranger (1938) that was to be his legacy. This is perhaps where he gained the most recognition as a character actor.\\" That same year, he had a small villain-like role in the first part of Flaming Frontiers, a 15-part cliffhanger about murder and double cross. The following year, Thundercloud reprised his role as the Lone Ranger‚Äôs sidekick in The Lone Ranger Rides Again.

As a singer, Say√£o was forever to remain his passion, one which was accentuated by seeing her in Manon performances in Montreal. His passion for opera in general led him to visit the Royal Opera House in London and a lowly paid job with Decca Records in that city. Moving up the ranks in the 1950s, he landed in New York in 1959 and for the next 20 years made London Records, Decca's classical arm, the most significant label in the United States. San Francisco Opera After being approached by San Francisco Opera Director Kurt Herbert Adler regarding a job, McEwen moved to the city in 1980 and immersed himself in learning the operations of an opera company. By January 1982 McEwen was running the Opera. Given his expertise and background in understanding the wonders of the human voice, it is not surprising that his approach in his early years was away from the theatrical and more focused on the vocal. With his Ring Cycle, which began in the Summer 1983 and Fall 1984 seasons (and which was presented in its entirety in June 1985), McEwen demonstrated where his priorities lay: they were focused on hiring the best singers in the world. As a reaction to the economic climate of the times, in 1982 McEwen created the \\"San Francisco Opera Center\\" to oversee and combine the operation and administration of the numerous affiliate educational and training programs. Providing a coordinated sequence of performance and study opportunities for young artists, the San Francisco Opera Center includes the \\"Merola Opera Program\\", \\"Adler Fellowship Program\\", \\"Showcase Series\\", \\"Brown Bag Opera\\", \\"Opera Center Singers\\", \\"Schwabacher Recitals\\", and various Education Programs. By introducing his young singers to the great voices of the past, inviting them to rehearsals, and giving tickets to current productions, McEwen hoped to create rounded performers who could appear in the regular Fall season. Amongst his successes in this regard was the mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick from Nevada. By \\"hand holding\\"\\" her through the various stages of training, he prepared her for the role of Azucena in the summer 1986 season to great acclaim. On 8 February 1988, McEwen announced his resignation. The following day his mentor, Kurt Herbert Adler, died. McEwen died in Honolulu, Hawaii at age 69.

The manga is being published in the monthly sh≈çjo manga anthology Nakayoshi. There are more than ten chapters published and most of them are compiled into volumes issued by Kodansha. It is licensed in German by Heyne. Yume Yume*Yu Yu is loosely based upon the Shinto miko and shrines, as well as four constellations in the Chinese zodiac: Suzaku -- The Vermilion Bird of the South (who represents the summer season and Yin,), Seiryuu -- The Azure Dragon of the East (who represents the spring season as well as Yang), Genbu -- The Black Tortoise of the North (who represents the winter season), and Byakko -- The White Tiger of the West (who represents the fall season, Bai Hu in China). The story follows a young girl, Yume, who is clumsy and unpopular. While dozing in class, she has a vision of a young Miko, telling her that she must be the new Miko. She awakes with a mirror in her hands, and is confused by it. After school, the mirror reveals itself as a portal to a different world as a red-haired boy, named Rekka, appears chasing a unicorn, the peacekeeper of their world. The Azure Dragon of the East, or Seiryuu, shares that he is not happy a human of the Light world has become Miko, and tries to destroy Yume. None of the Guardians from the other world, except Rekka, believes in Yume. Rekka destroys the mirror so that the Other world-ers can not come through to harm Yume. It is revealed that the world in which Rekka lives is suffering due to the Light world's exceptional development in such a short span of time. The Unicorn is the peacekeeper, and without the unicorn the world will become endangered. The goal of Yume and Rekka is to find the Unicorn and take it back to its home, as it is its own portal between worlds. After a time of Rekka living in the Light world, he becomes the Kagura's cousin. Aoi, a boy at Yume's school, is soon revealed to be the King of the Eastern Skies of the Light world. Discovering this, the team decides they must find all the Guardians of the light world to help the Unicorn. Characters=Guardians of the Light World ;Yume Kagura :The main character and Miko of the story. Although a somewhat simple-minded girl who pales in comparison to her perfect and talented twin sister, Yume embodies the power to save two worlds. As the new Miko, she is to gather up the four guardians of her own world in order to save them both. From the beginning of the story it is laid down that she believes in magic and casts protection spells on herself while she sleeps- which is why she was probably more accepting of her newfound abilities compared to other girls. Yume has a crush on Aoi, a boy at her school who is a student council member along with her sister, and who is also one of her protectors from this world, though that crush has begun to fade when she falls in love with Rekka, the Emperor of the South Sky of both worlds. ;Unicorn (Female) :The girl that Kirin, the Other World Unicorn, has been searching for. She was hidden in a comma-shaped jewel, and the love between Rekka and Yume freed her. ;Mizuki Aoi :King of the East Sky. His mark is located on his right chest. He didn't know that he was the Light world's Seiryuu until the bus incident while being forced into photography. He is the only one who noticed Yume from the beginning of the story, and loves her. He is on the student council with Hime. His holy animal's name is DoraDora. He also has a cousin , Kurobe-Sensei ;Kurobe-sensei :The light world's King of the North Sky, Genbu. He discovered his destiny along with Mashiro 10 years previous when she found the mirror in her family's warehouse. The previous Miko told him to hurry and find the new Miko. The mark of Genbu is above his right eyebrow. Kurobe seems to dislike interactions between the opposite sex in teenagers, as he steals their gifts away or keeps couples apart. His cousin is Mizuki Aoi. ;Kaneshiro Mashiro :The Light world's Queen of the West Sky, Byakko. She knew her standing as she appeared to Yume in the attack of Hime, as she found the mirror in her family's warehouse 10 years prior. Her mark is on her right upper chest. She is in love with Kurobe, though he rejected her; when Hime walked in while Mashiro was on Kurobe's lap, she mentions that Hime has the wrong idea. She is sensible and resourceful, even though she is an Idol. Guardians of the Other World ;Miko-sama :The previous Miko before Yume. She was loved and all things were at peace until she gave up her power to Yume. She was like a mother figure to Rekka. ;Kirin, Unicorn (Male) :The keeper of peace in the Other world who escaped to the Light world to search for his other. He heals Yume and reveals he's always been searching for his loved one. ;Rekka Sariu :A boy found in Yume's dreams who must protect the new Miko. He is the Emperor of the South Sky, Suzaku in both worlds. His mark is by his navel on the right side. He knew of his abilities in the beginning, and comes out of the Mirror with Lee (Rii), and destroys the mirror. At first he dislikes Yume being the new Miko, but quickly begins to accept her and starts to like her. Hime likes him, giving him handmade chocolates on Valentine's Day, though Rekka cannot return her feelings since his duty is to Yume, whom he loves. ;Yuu Hokyuu :Rekka's childhood friend, and the Other world's Emperor of the North Sky, Genbu. His mark is under his left eye. He is reckless and has a high sense of loyalty. ;Toufuu Nyan-Nyan :The Empress of the Eastern Sky, Seiryuu. Her Holy animal is Ryuu, a small dragon. She uses the male pronoun, 'boku', to refer to herself, making her a gruff person in speech, though she looks rather young and innocent. ;FuuChii :Emperor of the Western Sky, Byakko. He is an estranged male with a tiger's tail and pointy, elf-like ears. Other major characters ;Hime Kagura :Yume's better twin, who gets good grades, is on the student council, and is well known at school. She has lots of friends and is technically perfect. She is in love with Rekka, whose feelings for her have not been returned, as he is in love with Yume. She goes in an angry frenzy, since she took the mirror and pieced it together. She then becomes the Miko for the Other World. She is jealous of Yume, for getting Rekka's attention. ;Rii :Rii acts as a little guardian to Rekka, following him everywhere. She resembles a butterfly. ;Yue :Yue is another 'little guardian', and is seen with the Other World's Seiryuu when he attacks Yume. She enters Hime's body in the story, and identifies her as the Other world's miko, and controls her.

The series focuses on the life of a preteen girl, Maddison Marples-Macintosh, who assumes the role of an online advice columnist on her school's website. Broadcast The original series ran for 26 half-hour episodes, and premiered on the Nine Network in Australia in 2008. In 2010, the show began airing on CBC Television in Canada. The network also published an online game associated with the series, called G2G: Extra Credit. In 2018 it was picked up on Toonavision.https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/toon-a-vision-kids- channel-launches-in-canada.5674331/ Synopsis The show typically begins with Maddison receiving an e-mail on her PDA about the troubles of anonymous students in her school and her trying to give that personal advice, while facing a problem nearly identical to the one described in the e-mail, which often ends up giving her the answer she needs to help: the troubled sender. Characters G2G features mostly teenage or preteen characters, with the appearance of teachers and parents on occasion, in a fictional North American junior high school. Maddison Marples-Macintosh (Esther Maloney) is the main character on the show, and one of the youngest, being only around 13 years old. She's a very typical preteen girl, full of giggles and gossip. She is still socially shy, yet confident in her own abilities. The full extension of her indefatigable sense of character is brought out in her duties as the \\"Online Oracle\\" of her school, Miss Communication - although this alter ego is an absolute secret. Maddie is best friends with Saffron and Rainbow, whom she usually turns to for advice, sometimes even talk about other peoples' problems. Maddie also has a crush on Ace, every girls dream date at her school. Her confidence and intelligence usually turns into babbling nonsense, invisible around Ace. After her Imaginary Imagination tries countless of times to woo him, talking to him seems more difficult. (The Problem: There is no supportive evidence that suggest Maddison has a crush on Leet (They are colleague friends.) Leet is usually distracted on his Internet Tablet.) Saffron Parker (Pina Crispo) is Maddison's best friend. She's one year older than Maddie, and thus considers herself much more mature and worldly. She's the kind of girl all the guys go for: blonde, beautiful, and highly fashionable. She loves to be noticed wherever she goes, and what attention she doesn't get from others, she gets from her two best friends Maddie and Rainbow. Saffron's brother, Stinky, is always looking for a way to pull a prank on Saffron, which she can usually foil, or at least get him caught in as well. Rainbow (Ann Pirvu) is 13 years old, the third piece of the Maddie- Saffron puzzle. Often found stargazing and meditating, Rainbow is a very spiritual girl, often concerned more with the alignment of her chakras than the algebra due next period. Always a very clear thinker, Rainbow provides insight that the others never see, or believe! Her depth is only outshone by her eccentricity, often showing up for the wrong classes on time, and the right ones late. She hands in phenomenally written poems and essays, but often fails because they're on the wrong topic. Rainbow learns more from her mother than she does from school, taking time each day to analyze auras and balance the flow of positive chi in the classroom with Feng Shui. L33t (Leet) (CJ Sharpe) is the school techno-geek, and extremely proud of it. His technical know-how is often how he gets attention from those who would usually overlook him. His parents put him in school early, which he found almost too easy, and was soon bumped up a grade. Now he's the youngest kid in school and gets at the bottom of the school hierarchy because of it. But because he belongs to none of the cliques in school, he can easily slip between groups, making him very well connected for an 11 year-old. He becomes a cool looking guy after he was wrongly accused of being called: Ms. Communication. He has a crush on Maddie by the end of the series. (Leet tries to Detect, trap-capture and expose the I.P. Address of Miss. Communica8ion. He thinks of her as a Fraud. The Problem Student's: can express and identify with Miss. Communica8ion, a student who is just like them:) (One of Us:) (she get it!) To whom may it Concern? Ace (Jack Troughton) Ace De Silva is the picture of boyhood beauty, which is a really good thing, because brainy he is not. Ace plays bass guitar and sings in the band 'Fever Meter' alongside Stinky, and their pals Mitch Michenbury and Barry Ryan. Ace is a huge soccer fan and if he isn't at band practice, he's usually out on the field. Ace is known for his shiny white smile, his smooth, sultry voice, and having his headphones basically attached to his head. Ace is a strong, charismatic man of very few words, and coveted by every girl in the school, but none more than Maddie. Her long, heartfelt, romantic talks with Ace, imaginary though they may be, are more than proof for her that they're destined to be with each other. Stinky (Justin Richardson) is Saffron's pain in the butt twin brother, and never referred to by his real name, Samuel, by anyone, including himself. He's an average teenage boy, hopelessly lost when it comes to hygiene and high class. Stinky has few endearing traits, but is known and loved for one thing. He's very protective of his sister and her friends, and makes sure that no one causes them any trouble...except for him! He and Ace are the resident soccer geniuses and often found together, so Maddie puts up with him for the sake of Ace. Stinky is the drummer for the band Fever Meter, and regardless of his unpopularity, their band is the biggest thing in school. Mandii and Mac (Lesley Livingston and Bob Oniskyw) are Maddie's loving parents. Mandii is the host of entertainment news show CelebriTV, and often out of the house filming and interviewing. Mac is a correspondent for a big news network and always off discovering ancient civilizations or nesting with polar bears for better insight on their habits; anything far away and fairly dangerous. Maddie sees her mom far more than she does her dad, who is on assignment 200 or more days a year and only able to talk via webcam. Mandii and Mac act as excellent role models for Maddie, even if it's only on screen. Mandii is always a source of gossip, and as popular with Maddie's friends as Maddie is. Amelia is Maddie's dog. Amelia Earhart (her name revealing Maddie's admiration for passionate, powerful women) is always an open ear for Maddie. Because of a thyroid problem, Amelia is overweight, and on a constant dog-diet that she never sticks to. She even has her own miniature treadmill, which she uses to expand her dust collection. Amelia is as fashion-savvy as any teenage girl, spending most of her time flipping through fashion magazines when Maddie isn't around.

She was found murdered on 3 December 2006, along with her elderly housemaid, Malti Devi, apparently as a result of an attempted burglary., www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 Ghosh, an ethnic Bengali, was the sister of Tuktuk Kumar, an officer of Indian Administrative Service, www.papiyaghosh.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 from the West Bengal cadre, and a close associate of the writer Jug Suraiya, www.boloji.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 from the Times of India. Life Papiya Ghosh was born on 8 October 1953, in Dumka (Bihar, India). She was the third of four daughters of Ujjal Kumar Ghosh, an IAS officer, www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 of the Bihar Cadre, and his wife Purnima Ghosh. Her father was a victim of what was widely held to be a political murder, www.purnujjalpapiyaghoshmemorialtrust.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 in 1957. The four sisters were subsequently brought up by their mother, who took up a job as a school teacher to support her daughters after the murder of her husband. Papiya attended St Joseph's Convent High School in Patna, where she was school topper and elected Head Girl in 1971. She earned an undergraduate degree in History from the Patna Women's College (Patna University)University of Patna, www.wikipedia.org, accessed on 8 April 2011 and was also elected Premier of the Students' Union. Papiya was an avid debater, dramatist and writer from an early age, and, together with her sister Tuktuk, became something of a household name as a regular contributor to Kookie Kol, a column in the Junior Statesman,, www.boloji.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 which was a popular youth magazine of the time. As Patna University was closed down indefinitely in 1975 during Jayaprakash Narayan's agitation, Papiya Ghosh moved to Delhi University where she completed her MPhil and PhD, studying the pre-independence civil disobedience movement in Bihar (1930‚Äì34). After her PhD, she taught History at Delhi University for two years. In 1979, she decided to move back to Patna. This was in part to support her mother, who was by then living on her own, but also because she wanted to live and work in the midst of the land, people and society which formed the main focus of her academic research. In Patna, Papiya taught first at Patna Women's College and then at the history department at Patna University. A highly regarded teacher, she took great personal pains to ensure that the content and quality of instruction her students received was at par with the best universities in the country. This was especially challenging given the general decline of standards at Patna University, the very limited funding available, deteriorating facilities, and official indifference. Professional recognition was hard to come by, given the situation in Patna and its remoteness from the more high-profile academic centres of India. Nevertheless, she was awarded the prestigious Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship (twice), as well as fellowships from the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (Shimla) and Teen Murti Bhavan (New Delhi). She also contributed a number of scholarly articles to prestigious academic journals. A follower of the philosopher Rumi, Papiya Ghosh was drawn towards Sufi mysticism, which she saw as a unique amalgam of influences truly representative the assimilative culture of the Indian sub- continent. She also had a keen interest in modern literature, especially writings by and about Indian and Pakistani women. Murder Papiya Ghosh was murdered on the night of 2/3 December 2006, along with her elderly maid, Malti Devi. The post-mortem report listed 34 stab wounds inflicted on her, including to the eyes, throat and stomach. Of the six men accused on the murder, four have been arrested, tried and convicted and two of the named accused, who were absconding, have since been arrested in August 2012 by Bihar Police. However, the trial in their case has yet to commence., www.papiyaghosh.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 Work After her PhD, Papiya Ghosh taught History at Daulat Ram College (Delhi University) briefly, and then at the Hindu College, University of Delhi for two years. In 1979, she moved back to Patna, where she taught at her alma mater, Patna Women's College (Patna University), until 1991. She was subsequently promoted and moved to the Department of History, Patna University. Her research subjects related, inter-alia, to the impact of Partition in 1947, the plight of Dalit Muslims, peoples' movements, popular syncretic culture, secularism, the contribution of the underprivileged to political processes etc., www.oup.com, accessed on 26 March 2011 She was particularly interested in questions of identity, especially how people identify themselves individually and collectively when removed from their place of origin. She spent much of her time travelling to remote areas, meeting key sources (within and outside the country), and conducting first- hand primary research using her own limited resources. She would devote hours on translation, roping in friends and well-wishers to help. She taught herself to read and write Urdu, as many of the manuscripts she studied were written in the Nastaliq script. She immersed herself in local traditions (many obscure, some dying out) and was also a keen student of diasporic sub-continental populations, both contemporary (such as the Bangladeshi population in London) and historical (such as in Mauritius and the West Indies). She was: * Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Chicago, 1994; * Rockefeller Fellow at the Triangle South Asia Consortium at North Carolina State University, 1996‚Äì97; * Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla (India), 1993‚Äì96 * Visiting Scholar at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, Teen Murti Bhavan, New Delhi, 1988‚Äì91; * Adviser to the Asian Development Research Institute, Patna; and * Visiting Scholar at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

Richard Davis (1905 - December 30, 1969), also known as Dixie Davis, was the lawyer for mobster Dutch Schultz. Biography Davis was born in New York City in 1905 and grew up in Tannersville, New York after his father, a tailor named Davidowitz, relocated the family to the Catskills. Davis attended Syracuse University Law School and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1927. He served a clerkship, and then started his own firm in New York City specializing in defending mobsters. Many of Davis' clients were African- Americans involved in the numbers game in Harlem. In 1932 he decided that he could take control and brought in Dutch Schultz as enforcer only to lose control to Schultz. With the murder of Schultz in 1935, Davis took over his numbers racket. On July 14, 1937 a grand jury indicted Davis for racketeering. In exchange for his cooperation, Davis was sentenced to one year in prison and was disbarred. On December 31, 1969, DIXIE DAVIS DIES; RACKETS LAWYER; Partner of Dutch Schultz Was Disbarred in 1937 Dixie Davis died of a heart attack in his home in Bel-Air, California during a break-in. Two masked gunmen had bound his wife and grandson and had stolen jewels, furs and cash. The character Tommy Farrell in the 1958 film Party Girl is loosely based on him.

It is usually between 5.5 ‚Äì 7.75 in (12 ‚Äì 19.9 cm) long and is slender with many small silvery-blue spots on its back and sides. It is brownish grey and the area around its vent is grey. This unisexual Ambystoma hybrid species,Unisexual Salamander Complexes has been grouped with other unisexual ambystomatids that takes genetic material from Jefferson salamander (A. jeffersonianum), Streamside salamander (A. barbouri), Small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum), Tiger salamander (A. tigrinum) and the blue-spotted salamander (A. laterale). \\"Species name designations for unisexual Ambystoma are no longer in use\\".Pfingsten et al. 2013 Instead unisexual Ambystoma should be considered distinct biotypes rather than species.Pfingsten et al. 2013  Behaviour  Lacking its own males, the LJJ biotype breeds with male Blue- Spotted or Jefferson Salamanders from March to April. The males' spermatophores only stimulate egg development; their genetic material does not contribute to the offspring's DNA. This mode of reproduction is called gynogenesis. The females lay cylindrical egg masses and attach them to underwater twigs. It is not often observed and its diet and lifestyle are unknown.  Habitat and range  These salamanders live almost anywhere between south-central Michigan to adjacent Indiana and Ohio to western Massachusetts south to northern New Jersey. They are commonly found in or near shallow rivers and ponds in deciduous forest. There is an extremely limited population of the salamanders in Vermilion County, Illinois with only one remaining natural population known. They are considered endangered within the state. Theory states that the population may have dropped due to the vernal pool in which they live not retaining water for a long enough period for their tadpoles to reach metamorphosis. Illinois Natural History Survey  Predators  The LJJ biotype's predators include birds, fish, raccoons, and dogs.  Diet  Their diet is mainly slugs, ants, spiders, soft insects, and worms.

The board held that, beyond its implementation, a procedural step may contribute to the technical character of a claimed method only to the extent that it serves a technical purpose of the method. In that light, simulation methods which form an essential part of the fabrication process and precede actual production, mostly as an intermediate step, cannot be denied a technical effect merely on the grounds that they do not yet incorporate the physical end product.Special edition 6/2007 EPO Board of Appeal Case Law 2006, page 15.  From 2010  * May 12, 2010, G 3/08 (Programs for computers), opinion issued by the Enlarged Board of Appeal following the referral by the President of the EPO on October 22, 2008.Case Number: G 0003/08, Opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of 12 May 2010 in relation to a point of law referred by the President of the European Patent Office pursuant to Article 112(1)(b) EPC . The referral relating the patentability of programs for computers was dismissed as inadmissible by the Enlarged Board of Appeal.

Solly escaped from custody in 1974 and spent the next 27 years living under numerous pseudonyms. At the time of his arrest in May 2001, he was living in Florida as Daniel \\"Danny C\\" Catalano, a supposed former member of the American rock 'n' roll group Sha Na Na; in fact, he never had any ties to Sha Na Na. Manslaughter conviction and escape On the evening of July 25, 1969, Solly, in a drunken rage, severely beat his girlfriend's two-year-old son, Christopher Welsh, who died of his injuries. Solly turned himself in to local police a few days later. He was convicted of manslaughter on April 16, 1970, and incarcerated at Trenton State Prison. While Solly was in Trenton State Prison, his mother and grandmother began a letter-writing campaign alleging mistreatment on the part of prison guards. As a result of the campaign, Solly was transferred to medium-security Leesburg State Prison in 1974. There, he befriended a prison psychologist, who convinced officials to allow Solly to visit his mother. During the third visit, in June 1974, Solly was accompanied only by the psychologist. Solly asked to be allowed to visit his girlfriend, and he used the opportunity to escape. His escape was not reported to police for six hours, giving Solly sufficient time to disappear. As a fugitive Immediately after his escape, Solly began using a series of assumed identities to evade capture. In 1975, he was arrested in Philadelphia for receiving stolen goods, but because he used a fake name, police did not realize who he was. Similarly, he provided a fake name when he was stopped for a traffic violation in 1979 and avoided detainment. Detectives had few leads in the case, and received no cooperation from Solly's family, particularly his mother, Edna Bolt, who consistently denied knowing her son's whereabouts. Eventually, Solly's escape was considered a cold case. Solly eventually made his way to Florida, where he assumed the identity of Vinnie Taylor, lead guitarist of the rock 'n' roll revival group Sha Na Na. The real Taylor died of a heroin overdose in 1974, but using forged documents, including a Social Security card, a birth certificate, and a baptism certificate, Solly successfully passed himself off as Taylor. Solly, posing as Taylor, claimed that Taylor's death had been staged and so he took on the new stage name of Daniel \\"Danny C\\" Catalano, and began performing and recording under that name. Sha Na Na discovered the fraud and demanded that Solly cease performing as Danny C. When Solly refused, the group considered filing a lawsuit, but decided not to do so in order to deny Solly the free publicity the case would generate. Investigation and capture In 1999, New Jersey State Police, Louis Kinkle, and Cumberland County Sheriff's Office investigators reopened the Solly case. They enlisted the aid of forensic artist Frank Bender, who used 25-year-old photographs of Solly to create an image of what he would look like currently. In March 2000, Edna Bolt died, after which other members of Solly's family began cooperating with investigators. Bolt's husband Harry told police that Solly was living in Florida as a singer using the name Danny C. A web search revealed a website for Danny C, billing himself as the \\"Bad Boy\\" of Sha Na Na. The site featured a picture of Danny C that closely resembled the image produced by Bender. Based on this information, authorities traveled first to Orlando and then to St. Pete Beach. They discovered Solly fishing on a pier near his apartment complex. U.S. Marshals arrested Solly on May 10, 2001, and he was returned to New Jersey on May 18. He was convicted on October 5 for his 1974 escape and was incarcerated at Riverfront State Prison in Camden to serve that sentence and the remainder of his manslaughter sentence. Solly was granted parole in August 2003 for good behavior and time served. He was last reported to be living in a welfare motel in New Jersey. Solly died on November 30, 2007, in Gloucester City, New Jersey.

Often the purpose is to demonstrate to customers that this business is concerned with security and their business identity. The requirements for the displaying merchant vary, but typically involve a dedication to good security practices, or the use of secure methods for transactions, or most importantly verified existence of the company. Trust seals can come in a variety of forms, including data security seals, business verified seals and privacy seals and are available from a variety of companies, for a fee. A Trust seal can be either active or passive. Most seals are validated when they are created and remain so for a specific duration of time, post expiry of which the business/process has to be re-validated. Generic example of a trust seal  Kinds of trust seals =Privacy seal A privacy seal outfits a company with a privacy statement suited to its business practices. It also helps the company identify potential privacy threats that would otherwise go unnoticed. Business practice seals These are seals that endorse an operational practice of a business. For example, an endorsement of the manufacturing quality practices of the company. Privacy seals are a subset of this category but popular enough, specifically with online retailers, to be mentioned separately. Business identity seal A business identity seal, also known as a Verified Existence Seal, is one which verifies the legal, physical and actual existence of the business by verifying multiple parameters such as statutory details, contact details, management details, etc. Verified existence Trust seals add weight to the profiles of the deployers and boost confidence of prospective clients. A major benefit of a verified Trust seal is that it represents due diligence by the grantor before granting a certificate for the business. Security seals Security Trust Seals are the most popular type of trust seal verification. There are two different types; Server Verification and Site Verification. Server Verification services perform daily scans on the hosting server. These scans check to make sure patches have been applied or that the server is otherwise not vulnerable to attacks. Website Verification services ensure that customers are protected under normal circumstances by testing for common vulnerabilities such as Cross site scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. Criticisms Third party verification from a reliable source and a strategically placed trust seal may assure customers about the safety and security. Some trust seals, such as McAfee Hacker Safe, however, have been criticized as not doing enough to protect the security of visitors to a site such as because they intentionally mark as 'Hacker Safe' websites known to McAfee to have an XSS vulnerability . This is possible because most seals are a simple image that a hacker can simply copy and paste onto their own site. Such lapses highlight the importance of anti- XSS protection security measures. Trust seals can give a false sense of security as they are awarded at a certain point of time, unless the website is scanned on a daily basis and the scan date is displayed. When a site is not scanned daily, a change in technology and loopholes are not updated along with the trusted seal, so it doesn't represent flaws in the updated technology. The iconographical value is too high to mislead customers unaware about these changes.\\"On trust in the Internet: Belief cues from domain suffixs and seals\\" by Atticus Y. Evil, Eric F. Shaver, and Michael S. Wogalter, Department of Psychology , North Carolina State University The FTC has fined fraudulent seal companies that provide no real security benefit. Examples , in the US market the BBB On-Line, TrustE, Symantec and WebTrust were generally recognized as significant players. Also notable are: GeoTrust, DigiCert, Norton, Comodo, MerchantCircle. Some good examples of Business Practice Seals are BBB, ScanVerify and TrustLock. CDSBureau Trust Seal is unique among all trust seals because it certifies businesses that ensure security of customer confidential data kept in digital, paper, or any other possible form. CDSBureau is free and comes with privacy, cyber, and data security trust. A study published in 2016 by Copenhagen-based web usability consultancy, Baymard Institute ranked the top four trust seals as (in alphabetical order) BBB, Norton Secured (formerly Symantec Trust Seal), Google Trusted Store and TRUSTe. In February 2017, Google announced that it was closing its Google Trusted Store label and folding it into Google Customer Reviews. GCR is not a certification program but collects reviews from customers after they make a purchase and receive their merchandise. Except for GCR, each of the above offers a \\"For Fee\\" annual subscription service, allowing the Trust Seal to be placed on a subscriber's website for the subscription period.

Construction and commissioning USS Floyds Bay (AVP-40) is launched at Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington on 28 January 1945.Floyds Bay (AVP-40) was laid down at Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington. She was launched on 28 January 1945, sponsored by Mrs. R. R. McCracken, and commissioned on 25 March 1945 with Commander J. R. Ogden in command.  World War II operations 1945  After training at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and in the Mariana Islands, Floyds Bay arrived at Okinawa on 28 July 1945 to operate with Air-Sea Rescue Squadron 6 and other seaplanes. She was on these duties when World War II ended with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945. Honors and awards Floyds Bay received one battle star for her World War II service.  Peacetime operations 1945-1950  Floyds Bay continued her duties at Okinawa until 9 September 1945. From that time, she controlled seadromes at Wakanoura Wan and Nagoya in Japan and at Shanghai and Tsingtao, China. She concluded her post-World War II occupation duties when she departed Yokohama, Japan, on 1 December 1946 bound for San Francisco, California. From her home port, San Diego, California, Floyds Bay sailed on a round-the-world good-will cruise between 6 June 1947 and 27 March 1948. Proceeding eastward, she called at Mediterranean and Far Eastern ports, operating in Japanese waters for several months.

WCST is owned Metro Radio, Inc. and operated by West Virginia Radio Corporation. WCST simulcasts Martinsburg, West Virginia-based sister- station WEPM. History WCST signed on the air on September 7, 1958. WCST started with Dale Brooks, Tom Butcher, Kenny Robertson and Gary Daniels. They offered local programming, advertising and rock n' roll music. The call letters of the station were a tribute to Charles S. Trump, a major force behind getting the station on the air. WCST adopted FM in 1965 and changed its genre to country music with the frequency 93.5. It was sold in the 1980s to Sam and Mary Lou Trump and later to Emmett Capper in 1995. For many years WCST played country music, 23 hours a day; why they went off the air for just one hour remains a mystery. AM1010 was reported to be dark several times, but is just a tough catch even within town limits due to a bad tower location and tower ground system. In the Summer of 2006, Berkeley Springs High School games and other local programming, which were heard on sister station WDHC, were moved to WCST when WDHC moved to 92.9. Also in 2006, WCST and WDHC finally made a presence on the internet of sorts, with a MySpace Group operated by employees of the station. Currently, WCST and WXDC (formerly WDHC) each have an active Facebook page. In March 2014, WCST changed its format from News/Talk to Country, with the branding \\"Cat Country 1010AM WCST\\". In January 2017, WCST was sold with sister station WDHC (now WXDC) to Metro Radio of Fairfax, Virginia, who owns WTNT in the Washington D.C. radio market. The sale was consummated on March 1, 2017 at a price of $365,000. In May 2017, WCST began simulcasting the Classic Hits format of WXDC, which flipped to oldies at the beginning of 2018. WCST was granted a construction permit for FM translator W228DU on January 11, 2018. The translator rebroadcasts WCST on 93.5 FM from the WXDC/WCST transmitter site east of Berkeley Springs. On May 1, 2019, West Virginia Radio Corporation began operating WCST and sister station WXDC as it begins the process of buying the stations from Metro Radio. The local marketing agreement with Diane Smith ended on April 30, 2019. At Midnight on May 1, 2019, WCST's programming shifted from a simulcast of sister station WXDC to a simulcast of Martinsburg-based WEPM's News/Talk/Sports under the branding \\"The Panhandle News Network\\". Translator In addition to the main station, WCST is relayed by an FM translator to widen its broadcast area.

Once the group disbanded Ben began to record 'Insomniac's Guide to a Lonely Heart'. He was the first of the former members to release a solo album. Ben wrote or co wrote on all 12 tracks. He also recorded many of the instruments himself. The album was a mix of pop, rock, and funk. Many of the songs were piano and guitar driven. Being an indie release there was no need for a single. However 'Boyfriend' became a leading track and was planned for an official release though it never did. The album is available at most online retailers and performed well where sold. It was in the top 5% of Amazon.com's US CD sales, as well as being its #1 export to Germany.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1913 to 1921 sitting with the Conservative caucus in opposition. After his political career he was appointed as a judge to the Supreme Court of Alberta. Early life Albert Freeman Ewing was born June 29, 1871 in Elora, Ontario to Alexander Ewing of Ireland and Mary Manarey, of United Empire Loyalist descent. He was educated at Elora High School and later Toronto University where he attained a Bachelor of Arts. He was married to Annie Lafferty, the daughter of James Delamere Lafferty who was the fifth Mayor of Calgary. Political career Ewing ran a seat to the Alberta Legislature as a Conservative candidate in the 1909 Alberta general election. He ran for office in the Edmonton electoral district. Ewing would be defeated finishing in third place out of four candidates in the block vote that elected Liberals Charles Cross and John McDougall. Ewing would run in his second attempt to gain a seat in the provincial legislature in a by-election held on May 27, 1912. He finished a close second in a very tight four-way race losing to William Henry. A year later Ewing ran in his third attempt at provincial office in the 1913 Alberta general election. He would be elected to the second seat in the block vote by a very slim margin over Alexander MacKay. The 1917 boundary redistribution saw the Edmonton electoral district would be divided up into three single member constituencies. Ewing would run in the district of Edmonton (West). He faced incumbent William Henry in a two-way race in the 1917 general election. Ewing would defeat Henry with a solid majority to win his second term in office and pickup the new district of his party. Edmonton would again be re-constituted into a single riding in the 1921 Alberta general election Ewing would attempt to win his seat under the new Block vote system. He would finish seventh in the field of 26 candidates and be defeated. Ewing would also contest the 1924 by-election in the Edmonton electoral district following John Robert Boyle being appointed to the Supreme Court of Alberta, however he would be defeated by William Thomas Henry. Judicial career Ewing was appointed to the Supreme Court of Alberta. On December 12, 1934, Ewing was appointed to Chair the Royal Commission on the Condition of the Halfbreed Population of the Province of Alberta (Ewing Commission) along with members James McCrie Douglas and Dr. Edward A.

The song is now available as a bonus track to their album Face to Face, and an alternate version was also released as a bonus track on the 2011 deluxe reissue of Something Else by the Kinks. \\"Mister Pleasant\\" is lyrically somewhat similar to the earlier track \\"A Well Respected Man\\", as it satirizes the heedless complacency of a nouveau riche who, for all his newfound worldly success, is but a foolish cuckold. Musically, the song has strong English Music Hall influences and a \\"trad jazz\\" backing that features a trombone and ragtime- style piano (played by Nicky Hopkins).

MacDonald was born in Kilwinning, Ayrshire and played for a variety of local junior clubs including Ayr Westerlea, Maybole, Ayr Academical and Beith, before moving south to London to join Woolwich Arsenal in January 1906. McDonald was understudy to Arsenal's regular goalkeeper, England international Jimmy Ashcroft, and played only two league games in what was to be his first spell at Arsenal, his debut coming against Blackburn Rovers on 17 February 1906. At the end of the 1905‚Äì06 season he moved to Southern League Brighton & Hove Albion and spent two years there. In May 1908 he returned to Woolwich Arsenal after they sold Ashcroft to make ends meet, and MacDonald was an ever-present for the entire 1908‚Äì09 season, and only missed two games of 1909‚Äì10. He left Arsenal in July 1910 for Oldham Athletic, spending one season there before moving to Bradford Park Avenue. In December 1912 he returned to Arsenal for a third time, making him, apparently, the only player to have played for the club in three separate spells. As of June 2010, the only other players to have rejoined the club are John Lukic, Jock Rutherford, Martin Keown, Sol Campbell and Jens Lehmann who all rejoined only once. He took over from Sidney Crawford and played 18 of the last 21 league games of the 1912‚Äì13 season, in which Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division. MacDonald left Arsenal for a third and final time in November 1913, having been ousted from the team by Joe Lievesley.

Standing high, Axial Seamount is the youngest volcano and current eruptive center of the Cobb‚ÄìEickelberg Seamount chain. Located at the center of both a geological hotspot and a mid-ocean ridge, the seamount is geologically complex, and its origins are still poorly understood. Axial Seamount is set on a long, low-lying plateau, with two large rift zones trending to the northeast and southwest of its center. The volcano features an unusual rectangular caldera, and its flanks are pockmarked by fissures, vents, sheet flows, and pit craters up to deep; its geology is further complicated by its intersection with several smaller seamounts surrounding it. Axial Seamount was first detected in the 1970s by satellite altimetry, and mapped and explored by Pisces IV, DSV Alvin, and others through the 1980s. A large package of sensors was dropped on the seamount through 1992, and the New Millennium Observatory was established on its flanks in 1996. Axial Seamount received significant scientific attention following the seismic detection of a submarine eruption at the volcano in January 1998, the first time a submarine eruption had been detected and followed in situ. Subsequent cruises and analysis showed that the volcano had generated lava flows up to thick, and the total eruptive volume was found to be . Axial Seamount erupted again in April 2011, producing a mile-wide lava flow. There was another eruption in 2015.  Geology = Tectonic setting  Position of Axial Seamount relative to the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Axial Seamount is the youngest volcano and current eruptive center of the Cobb‚ÄìEickelberg Seamount chain, a chain of seamounts that terminates south of Alaska. Axial lies where the chain intersects with the Juan de Fuca Ridge, approximately west of Oregon. It is a product of the Cobb hotspot, but now sits on an ocean spreading center between the Juan de Fuca Plate and the North American Plate, offset by the Blanco Fracture Zone to the south and a ridge-built triple junction to the north. This position is not yet entirely understood. It is believed that the chain, formed over millions of years by the now-inactive Cobb hotspot, is older than the mid-ocean ridge it bisects. Between 200,000 and 700,000 years ago, the hotspot was encroached by the tectonic spreading center, displacing it by as much as and building up the long Juan de Fuca Ridge. At least 7 spreading centers have been recognized, and plate measurements near Axial show that the ridge is separating at a rate of per year,In south to north order, they are the Cleft, Vance, Coaxial, Cobb, Endeavor, and West Valley segments. producing a complex system of oceanic basins and ridges. However some scientists have questioned this theory, pointing out that the high density of the chain's overlapping seamounts is incompatible with such an origin, as a hotspot would form a well organized, widely spaced chain. Although the exact nature of Axial Seamount remains unknown, its complex origins makes it one of the most geologically interesting features in the North Pacific.  Structure  Axial Seamount is the most active volcanic site in the North Pacific. Study of magnetic delineations along the seamount have modeled the ridge's history up to 30 million years ago, and shown that growth has progressed mostly in the north, with some southward progression dating back 3.5 million years. The base of Axial Seamount is a long, low-lying plateau, and the eastern part of the seamount is defined by a series of linear scarps. Axial Seamount has two major volcanic rifts extending approximately north and south of its main summit, as well as several much smaller, ill-defined ones aligned in a roughly similar pattern. Basins around the volcano increase its irregularity, making it unusually complex (most seamounts of roughly the same size are circular or flattened in shape.) Axial Seamount's summit is marked by an unusual rectangular caldera, in area, ~3¬∞ in slope, and breached on the southeast side. The area is offset by the two rift zones and defined on three sides by boundary faults up to deep. The caldera is roughly deeper at the north side then it is in the south. Flows within the caldera consist mostly of sheet flows pocketed by lava ponds and pit craters. Less common are pillow lavas; their arrangement along the caldera walls suggests that they were an important component in the volcano's early growth. There are several dome-like structures within the caldera with heights of . There are several small craters within the region, the largest of which, nicknamed the D.D. Cone, is in diameter and in relief. However, most of the features do not range over deep and across. The northern rift zone of Axial Seamount is a long ridge running 10 to 20 degrees northeast of the main caldera. The rift is pocketed by multiple fissures, in length, as far as from Axial Volcano's center, and reaching up to long and deep. The area contains high amounts of volcanic glass; a major eruption is still visible in the form of an elongated glassy lava flow extending off the caldera wall, east of the main rift line. Dives in 1983 found extensive low-temperature venting at the northern half of the fissure. The shorter, newer southern rift zone consists of a topographically plunging rift, surrounding by subtle, discontinuous faults. Camera tows along the southern flank reveal that the area is built of delineated sheet flows, small lava ponds, and lava channels. The youngest of the flows on Axial Seamount are aligned along the two rift zones, followed by flows inside the summit caldera; the oldest appear to originate from directly around the caldera, where most of the basalt is completely covered in accumulated sediment. This suggests a bilateral growth pattern, a trend also found in Hawaiian volcanics and other well-known seamounts, for instance Jasper Seamount. Axial Seamount's growth has intersected the growth of many of the smaller seamounts around it. The largest of these is Brown Bear Seamount, to which it is connected by a narrow ridge running roughly perpendicular to its western caldera wall. However, little evidence of interactions between the two seamounts has been found. On the other hand, Axial Seamount's southern rift zone bisects Vance Seamount by as much as , creating a zone of intense fissuring at the northern edge of the smaller volcano.The Vance Seamounts is a group of individually nameless volcanoes, so its northernmost member is sometimes called Vance Seamount for convenience. Interactions with Cobb Seamount to the north are more complex, forming an unusual \\"bent spreading center.\\" In addition there are four smaller structures directly east, north, and south of Axial.  History = Early history The first volcanoes along the Juan de Fuca ridge, including Axial Seamount, were detected in the 1970s by satellite altimetry. Axial Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make it one of the most easily accessible seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state also makes it one of the most interesting, rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest. The first bathymetry of the seamount was compiled by the in 1981, as part of SeaBeam trials in the North Pacific. The survey was specifically meant to find and link seafloor hydrothermal activity to geomorphic features. Four areas of increased temperature concentration, indicative of hydrothermal activity were found, and the then-unnamed Axial Seamount was among them. Submersible dives with Pisces IV and DSV Alvin in 1983 and 1984 discovered the first active black smoker vents in the north Pacific. Soon after Axial Seamount was named for its central position on the intersection of the Cobb‚ÄìEickelberg Seamount chain and Juan de Fuca Ridge. That same year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) founded its VENTS program, providing impetus for studying the volcano more closely. Between 1987 and 1992, a variety of pressure sensors, tilt sensors, temperature probes, and seismometers were dropped on the volcano in what came to be known as the Volcanic Systems Moninters (VSN). Further bathymetries by the in 1991 and RV Sonne in 1996 detailed the seamount further, making it one of the best known features in the North Pacific. Also in 1996, the New Millennium Observatory (NeMO) was established on Axial Seamount, to study volcanic perturbations and the effect they have on hydrothermal communities.  1998 eruption  The 1998 eruption of Axial Seamount was preceded by several large earthquake swarms, common indicators of volcanic activity. The swarms correlated to magma movements in the volcano; bottom pressure recorders deployed on the volcano between 1987 and 1992 recorded five instances of deflation in the summit surface (caused by lava movement), ranging from . In 1991, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was granted access to the United States Navy's SOSUS system, a chain of submerged hydrophones in the North Pacific originally used by the Navy to detect Russian submarines during the Cold War. Since 1993, the NOAA has maintained a real-time monitoring system that alerts the organization whenever an event occurs. The hydrophones are able to detect even very small earthquakes (~ magnitude 1.8) by listening for the acoustic waves generated by T-waves. These waves can propagate over large distances with minimal loss in power, making them an ideal way to record otherwise unnoticeable submarine earthquakes; over the course of the eruption, only 3 earthquakes were strong enough to register on land-based systems. However, they cannot interpret earthquake depth or what caused them. Between 1991 and 1996 Axial Seamount experienced a single earthquake swarm of over 50 events. Between May and November 1997 this activity increased markedly, with SOSUS recording 5 such swarms, culminating with a massive 11-day, 8247-quake event around the time of the eruption, in January 1998. The seismicity began at the summit, but within 6 hours had begun to migrate south as well; by 29 November 1997 the swarm had moved south by . This coincided with lava release along the summit and southern flank. The seamount remained absolutely quiet thereafter, suggesting the completion of an eruptive cycle at the volcano. In all, 9055 earthquakes were detected, and 1669 were strong enough to be located. Earthquake activity was concentrated around the summit and southern rift zones, with the majority of events centered inside the summit caldera; temperature probes and pressure recorders in the caldera recorded an average increase and height deflation, respectively, during the event. This close monitoring gives the 1998 eruption the distinction of being the only submarine eruption ever observed in situ. The first post-eruption expedition was organized and conducted by on 12 February 1998, which conducted conductivity, temperature, depth, and optical casts to unusual results. In May, a dedicated bathymetric survey of the seamount showed topographical changes along the volcano's southern flank, which estimated the thickest flows to . In July DSV Alvin made several dives on the seamount's summit caldera, followed in August through September by an extensive observation and collection program using ROV ROPOS, confirming the bathymetric estimates. A sheet flow more than long and wide was produced from Axial Seamount's upper southern flank, on the site of what was formerly an active geothermal field. The southern flows were in an area marked by a difference between older sediments and newer, glassier rock, and the maximum ridge generated by the eruption, at the crest of the southern flow, was high. The total eruptive volume was roughly . The development, eruption, and close monitoring of Axial Seamount provided a fertile model on submarine volcanic eruptions to scientists; several scientific papers on the topic were published soon after.  2011 eruption  Seismic activity at Axial Seamount virtually disappeared after the 1998 eruption, and monitoring of the volcano was done principally with bottom pressure recorders deployed on the volcano's flanks, supplemented since 2000 by annual measurements using pressure sensors mounted on Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and applied to local benchmarks. The sensors have shown that Axial Seamount is slowly reflating; just after the eruption the seamount was swelling at per month, a number that decreased to by 2006. In eight years Axial Seamount recovered approximately 50% of its of pre-eruption swelling, and in 2006, William Chadwick of the Oregon State University and his associates calculated that the next eruption would occur in approximately 2014: In July 2011, a dive using ROV Jason discovered new lava flows on the volcanoes that had not been present a year before. The expeditionary crew recovered two bottom-pressure recorders and two hydrophones (a third was found buried in lava) off the volcano, which together showed that the eruption had occurred during April, starting on 6 April 2011. Although the instruments recorded hundreds of seismic events, only a handful had been noticed by SOSUS and land-based seismometers, as many components of the system had been offline at the time. The volcano subsided by more than and produced a wide lava flow during the event, which was as much as three times larger than the 1998 eruption.  Ecology  In 1983, a Canadian‚ÄìAmerican collaborative expedition, named the Canadian American Seamount Expedition (CASM), visited the northwestern edge of Axial Seamount's summit caldera to investigate a persistent temperature anomaly in the region. In a series of eight dives conducted by Pisces IV, the scientists discovered a vibrant hydrothermal vent community on the leading edge of a fissure within the caldera. Vent temperatures were measured around , approximately 30 ¬∞C (54 ¬∞F) hotter than the surrounding environment. Camera tows and submersible dives through the 1980s and 1990s revealed Axial Seamount's active state, including the only known black smoker in the northwest Pacific. Three venting centers have been recognized: the original site, named CHASM; a southwestern caldera field discovered in the late 1980s, named ASHES; and a site located on its southeastern rift zone, named CASTLE. All are primarily sulfur/sulfide emitting. The temperature and composition of Axial Seamount's hydrothermal vents changes over time, but always maintains a roughly common identity, as do the vents' individual microbial communities. Vents generally have a lower pH than the surrounding fluid, and are acidic and alkaline as a result. The temperature of the magma feeding the system is uncertain, and may vary between . Curiously, vent fluid are heavily enriched in helium, containing five times the amount of the element as similar vents in the Gal√°pagos, and 580 times that of regular seawater. Tube worms of the Pogonophora family thicket the largest vents on Axial Seamounts, forming colonies up to thick in places; smaller, less nutritious vents feed bacterial mats, smaller tube worms, and limpets. The three most common microbial groups are bacterial epsilonproteobacteria, archaeon thermophilics of the Methanococcus family, and archaeons of the Euryarchaeota family. The most common flora at Axial Seamount's hydrothermal vents is the worm Ridgeia piscesae, which is found at hydrothermal sites of all descriptions on the Juan de Fuca ridge, and is the base of Axial Seamount's hydrothermal ecosystem.The morphology of the worm changes with local morphology, so much so that it was originally considered two distinct species. Other species on the seamount include the tube worm P. palmiformis, the sea snail Lepetodrilus fucensis, the bristle worm Amphisamytha galapagensis, and the sea spider Sericosura verenae.

At 8:00 am on 1 August, a Georgian police lorry was blown up by an improvised explosive device on the road near Tskhinvali, injuring five Georgian policemen. In response, Georgian snipers assaulted some of the South Ossetian border checkpoints, killing four Ossetians and injuring seven. According to majority of reports, the South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities. The Russian deputy defence minister, Nikolay Pankov, had a secret meeting with the separatist authorities in Tskhinvali on 3 August. An evacuation of Ossetian women and children to Russia began on the same day. According to researcher Andrey Illarionov, the South Ossetian separatists evacuated more than 20,000 civilians, which represented more than 90 percent of the civilian population of the future combat zone. Mortar and artillery exchange between the South Ossetian and Georgian forces erupted in the afternoon of 6 August along almost the entire line of contact, which lasted until the dawn of 7 August. Exchanges resumed following a brief gap in the morning. South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity announced that the South Ossetian armed forces were ready to go on the offensive in the next few hours. At 14:00 on 7 August, two Georgian peacekeepers were killed in Avnevi as a result of Ossetian shelling. At about 14:30, Georgian tanks, 122 mm howitzers and 203 mm self-propelled artillery began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks. During the afternoon, OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic, including artillery, on roads near Gori. In the afternoon, Georgian personnel left the Joint Peacekeeping Force headquarters in Tskhinvali. According to Gia Karkarashvili, ex-minister of defense of Georgia, Georgian servicemen of the JPKF were ordered by the Georgian command to leave their posts on August 7, at 3:00 p.m. This was one hour before the Georgian army received an order to move to the borders of South Ossetia. Karkarashvili claimed Georgian JPKF servicemen did not take part in the attack on the city they vowed to protect. However, Sergey Lavrov, minister of foreign affairs of Russia, later accused Georgian JPKF servicemen of taking part in the Georgian onslaught, and of \\"firing at their comrades-in-arms [from JPKF]\\". Shortly before midnight of August 7, Mamuka Kurashvili, then a commander of the Georgian JPKF battalion, claimed Georgia started an operation to \\"reinstate constitutional order\\", and \\"cleanse the Georgian territory of criminal elements\\". Kurashvili took part in the attack on Tskhinvali. According to Russian government, Russian peacekeeping battalion played a major role in the defense of Tskhinvali during the Georgian onslaught. Russian government reported ten peacekeepers from the Russian JPKF force were killed during the Georgian attacks on the base of Russian JPKF peacekeepers in Tskhinvali.IIFFMCG Vol III, p.372 According to Russian government: though vastly outnumbered, 250 Russian peacekeepers present in the cantonment repelled five Georgian attacks, destroyed six tanks, and four armored vehicles of the Georgian army. The peacekeepers were offering resistance for three days, until, on August 10, with Russian army units coming over from Northern Ossetia, Georgian army had to retreat from Tskhinvali. The Georgian army failed to take the cantonment of the Russian peacekeeping battalion. Konstantin Timerman, acting commander of the Russian JPKF unit, was awarded the medal Hero of the Russian Federation, the highest award in the Russian military, and several servicemen of the unit were awarded the Order of Courage and the Cross of St. George for military heroism.

Cook Inlet arrived off Saipan on 26 February 1945 to serve with the escort and patrol group based there, and from 2 March 1945 to 14 March 1945 was on an air-sea rescue station during the invasion of Iwo Jima. Cook Inlet rescued 27 survivors of downed bombers. She was still on duty at Iwo Jima when hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945, bringing World War II to a close. =Honors and awards= Cook Inlet received one battle star for World War II service. Post-World War II  Cook Inlet remained on duty off Iwo Jima until 29 November 1945, when she sailed to Jinsen, Korea, for duty as station tender. She then returned to the United States, calling at Iwo Jima and Pearl Harbor before reaching San Francisco, California, on 22 January 1946.

United States Coast Guard service  Coast Guards 1967 adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The Navy loaned Cook Inlet to the Coast Guard on 20 September 1948. After undergoing conversion for Coast Guard use, she was commissioned into the Coast Guard on 15 January 1949 as USCGC Cook Inlet (WAVP-384). Service historyNorth Atlantic= Cook Inlets home port was Portland, Maine, throughout her Coast Guard career of almost 23 years. She served in the North Atlantic Ocean, where her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and she engaged in law enforcement operations. On 12 October 1953, Cook Inlet rendezvoused with the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Chambers (WDE-491) in the Atlantic to take a medical patient from Chambers which Chambers had evacuated the previous day from the merchant ship Neva West. She then transported that patient to medical facilities ashore. Cook Inlet took part in the United States Coast Guard Academy cadet cruise of August 1965. On 28 January 1966, Cook Inlet rescued survivors in of a swamped pleasure craft. Between 3 and 8 February 1966, she escorted the distressed Liberian merchant vessel Arion to Bermuda. On 8 April 1966, she assisted the burning Norwegian passenger-freighter Viking Princess, sending a fire and rescue party aboard Viking Princess to fight her fires; rushing from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in a three-hour voyage, the U.S. Navy frigate also assisted Viking Princess, taking 13 survivors of the ship aboard from the Republic of China merchant ship Chungking Victory and transporting them to Guantanamo Bay. 5-inch (127-mm) 38-caliber gun fires as she conducts a close fire support mission off the coast of South Vietnam in 1971. Cook Inlet was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and re-designated WHEC-384 on 1 May 1966. Her loan period from the Navy came to an end on 26 September 1966, when she was transferred permanently from the Navy to the Coast Guard. On 8 January 1968, Cook Inlet evacuated a crewman in medical distress from the Swedish merchant ship California. =Vietnam War= Cook Inlet was assigned to Coast Guard Squadron Three in South Vietnam on 2 July 1971. Coast Guard Squadron Three was tasked to operate in conjunction with U.S. Navy forces in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of North Vietnamese arms and munitions traffic along the coastline of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The squadron's other Vietnam War duties included fire support for ground forces, resupplying Coast Guard and Navy patrol boats, and search-and-rescue operations. Cook Inlet served in this capacity until 21 December 1971.

They were the largest warships in the South Vietnamese inventory, and their 5-inch (127-millimeter) guns were South Vietnam's largest naval guns. Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc To·∫£n and her sisters fought alongside U.S. Navy ships during the final years of the Vietnam War, patrolling the South Vietnamese coast and providing gunfire support to South Vietnamese forces ashore. When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in late April 1975, Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc To·∫£n became a ship without a country. She fled to Subic Bay in the Philippines, packed with South Vietnamese refugees. On 22 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc To·∫£n and five of her sister ships, which also had fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: \\"These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition. Below decks generally would compare with a garbage scow.\\"This quote, from the U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/McCulloch_1946.pdf , is unattributed.

He first appeared in 2007 and made his final appearance in 2008. Character creation=Background Danny is the illegitimate child of Leo Valentine (Brian Bovell) who first arrived in the village in September 2007, when his mother Valerie Holden (Samantha Giles) drops him and his sister Lauren (Dominique Jackson), off at the Valentine residence and demanded that Leo looks after them while she takes up a free holiday in Greece. Danny and Lauren were totally unknown to their half- siblings Calvin (Ricky Whittle), Sonny (Devon Anderson) and Sasha (Nathalie Emmanuel), and it was not until Lauren referred to Leo as \\"dad\\" that they realised that Leo had been living a double life. Danny has shown to be extremely protective of Lauren and Sasha with her drug problems. Casting Judge's casting was announced on 13 August 2007. In a turn of events, the actor was sacked from the series on 10 July 2008, due to \\"persistent bad time- keeping\\". This mirrored a similar situation which cost Devon Anderson, who portrayed Danny's on-screen brother Sonny, his job in January 2007. Storylines Much more than his sister Lauren, Danny adapts to his new family, becoming friendly with Calvin and forging a better relationship with him than he has with his other brother, Sonny. When Valerie decides to remain in Greece, Danny and Lauren plan to join her. However, when Lauren decides she wants to stay, Danny also remains in the village. He expresses an interest in Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) when attending Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and Craig Dean's (Guy Burnet) engagement party. Danny befriends Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) and initially tries to help him forget about Katy Fox (Hannah Tointon). However, he soon realises Justin is only interested in winning back Katy's affections and tries giving him support by dressing up as a policeman to lead Katy to a table set out for a romantic dinner, which proves to be unsuccessful. At the Freshers Ball, Danny convinces Justin that this is the opportunity to reconcile with Katy, however this also fails when she believes Justin was arguing with her new best friend, John Paul McQueen (James Sutton), when he was actually trying to stop an argument between John Paul and Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox). Danny tries to impress Steph Dean (Carley Stenson) after helping her fix a burst beer pipe at The Dog in the Pond public house. She offers him a free drink, which he then insists she have with him after her shift. However, she promises Danny she would go for a drink with him anytime, which he tries to take advantage of the following day. When Steph agrees to go out again, Danny begins flirting with her and upsets her by trying to say how his status would be advanced if he dated her. Eventually, this results in Steph dating Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). When the hot water boiler in the Halls breaks, Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall) offers Danny ¬£50 to fix the boiler. Despite telling her he has little experience fixing boilers, Danny agrees to help. While examining the box, he notices a hole which is causing the pilot light to go out. While Jessica's back is turned, Danny blocks up the hole with newspaper. Unfortunately, this causes a buildup of carbon monoxide. Later, at a house warming party for John Paul and Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy), the gas causes everyone to feel ill. Danny leaves with Mercedes before the others begin to lose consciousness. Danny and Mercedes go to the SU Bar and kiss, and were interrupted by a phonecall from Justin, saying that the party guests are unconscious. They rush back to the party and Danny helps Justin save the guests. Danny refuses a lift from Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson), who suggests he ought to go to hospital to be checked, but Danny flees. Jessica visits him the following day, suggesting that the two of them keep a low profile. However, Danny cannot handle the guilt and confesses the truth to Mercedes. Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) overhears, threatening to beat Danny up, but Mercedes protects him. Later, Jacqui and Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) force Danny into confessing that Jessica was the one who allowed him to fix the boiler. Myra and Jacqui then threaten to sue Jessica. A few days later, Myra takes some money Jessica was given by Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister), resulting in the McQueens forgetting the incident. Danny meets Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) at the SU Bar and both are instantly attracted to each other. With encouragement from Sarah, Nancy and Beth Clement (Sin√©ad Moynihan), Hannah offers Danny her phone number. They begin with a passionate kiss behind the bike sheds at HCC. While Justin and Danny are attempting to turn on the Christmas lights for the village, Danny is electrocuted and causes a blackout. He recovers almost immediately, and goes to The Dog with Hannah, Katy and Justin. He joins Justin and Katy in a drinking game which involved shoveling crushed crisps down their throat, unaware that Hannah is struggling from eating disorders. When Hannah refuses to participate, Danny asks if she is on a diet, causing Hannah to flee to the toilets. Justin forces a reluctant Katy to go after Hannah, and informs Danny of Hannah's eating disorders. When Hannah returns, Danny supports her and apologises for his comments. Hannah later asks Danny out again and the two went to Il Gnosh. Danny decides it would be romantic if they ordered spaghetti and met in the middle like in the animated film, Lady and the Tramp, holding a forkful of pasta to Hannah's face. This reminds Hannah of when her brother Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood) force-fed her during her anorexia nervosa, causing her panic and flee. After reconciling, Danny's ex-fianc√©e, Michelle, arrives in the village. It transpires that Danny told Michelle he was leaving to join the army, unable to officially separate from her. Hannah manages to handle herself when Michelle brands her \\"Barbie\\", but wonders what other lies Danny has told. Danny and Hannah later make up at Sarah's house party. Danny later dumps Hannah again when he accuses her of taking things too slow. Hannah is crushed and tries to accept it initially, but discovering that the real reason is because her father Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea) dislikes Danny was because he is black, Hannah reconciles with Danny. Danny backs out of the relationship once more, causing her to have a relapse in her recovery from anorexia. This makes Danny realise that he wants to be with Hannah and support her in her recovery, and so they reconcile once again. However, following a drunken evening at The Dog with Nancy, Hannah is accompanied home by Darren. When Hannah is fixing her top, Darren takes an incriminating photograph of her on his mobile phone to convince Mercedes that he has slept with her and win a bet. Mercedes does not believe Darren but sends the photo to Danny, who punches Darren and dumps a bewildered Hannah, who has no memory of the photo being taken, and has sex with Mercedes. Danny later leaves the village to find his mother, Valerie, in Spain. Reception Virgin Media opined that while he caused the odd disaster, Danny did have \\"a good heart\\".

Tourist traffic was a dominant part of the motivation for building the line, and road tours to the Trossachs from Aberfoyle formed a significant part of the traffic. The first section to open was the Campsie branch of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, to Lennoxtown, in 1848; this became known as the picnic line, and was much used for the purpose by city dwellers. This was followed by the independent Blane Valley Railway in 1866, which reached Killearn. Finally the Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway constructed the northernmost section, which opened in 1882. Running through sparsely populated terrain, the line never made money although the tourist traffic was useful. When road transport became practicable from the 1920s, the decline of the line was inevitable. Cost reduction measures achieved little and in 1951 the passenger service was withdrawn. Some goods traffic continued until 1966. The entire line is now closed. History=The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened in 1842; it was Scotland's first main line railway. Its passenger business surpassed all expectations, and the railway was profitable. The E&GR; made a connection with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at a station called Kirkintilloch, some distance east of the present-day Lenzie. However the M&KR; had a different track gauge, and the connection involved a change of train for passengers and transshipment for goods and minerals.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, The Campsie branch The first section: the Campsie branch of the E&GROn; 5 July 1848 the E&GR; opened its Campsie branch. This left the E&GR; main line at Lenzie Junction, near the Kirkintilloch station referred to above; the junction was more commonly known later as Campsie Junction. The line ran north from there in the Kelvin Valley, passing through the town of Kirkintilloch and Milton of Campsie to Lennoxtown. The branch ran into and through exceptionally picturesque terrain, and it became popular as the picnic line. The Blane Valley Railway The Blane Valley RailwayLocal people promoted the Blane Valley Railway, which extended the Campsie branch as far as Killearn; it was authorised in 1861. They hoped to generate high class residential construction in the attractive area for wealthy Glasgow businesspeople, but the hope was not fulfilled. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway subscribed a third of the capital and agreed to work the line.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, In addition the promoters hoped to reach the Trossachs, then an exceptionally popular tourist destination. However the company ran out of money when the line had been constructed as far as the turnpike road some distance south of Killearn. The line opened for goods traffic on 5 November 1866, and for passengers on 1 July 1867, to a \\"Killearn\\" station some way short of the town.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 2, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1975, (At this time the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had been absorbed by the North British Railway.) The new line was eight and a quarter miles in length. The Lennoxtown terminus of the Campsie branch was unsuitable for the extension, so the Blane Valley line built its own Lennoxtown station, but the earlier terminus remained in use, with trains reversing out to continue their journey. The station was known then as Lennoxtown (Old) and the arrangement lasted until 1 October 1881. Connection from Kilsyth On 3 June 1877 the first section of the Kelvin Valley Railway was opened. The line was planned to run from Maryhill, on the north-western margin of Glasgow, to Kilsyth, but only the short section from a junction with the Campsie branch to Kilsyth was ready. Kilsyth was an important town and there were great celebrations at its linkage to the railway network. Passenger trains from Glasgow ran via Lenzie and Lennoxtown. It was not until 4 June 1879 that the Kelvin Valley Railway was extended to Maryhill, and even then the connection at Maryhill was not properly formed; this was finally achieved on 1 October 1879. The link from the Kilsyth line to the Campsie branch was a short spur between Kelvin Valley East and West Junctions. The Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway Reaching Aberfoyle in 1882The Blane Valley Railway had planned to reach the Trossachs, but had run out of money a little way south of Killearn. On 16 September 1879 James Keyden, the driving force behind the Blane Valley line, held a meeting at which a Strathendrick and Loch Lomond Railway was proposed. This would continue from the Blane Valley line from Killearn through Aberfoyle to Inversnaid, on the east shore of Loch Lomond. However the Duke of Montrose, who owned much of the land in the Trossachs, was opposed to the scheme and it fell into temporary abeyance. In October 1879 Keyden proposed a modified scheme, that would run from Killearn to Aberfoyle. The Forth and Clyde Junction Railway had been opened between Balloch and Stirling in 1856, and the Aberfoyle line would run over the F&CJR; between Gartness and Buchyvie, then striking north again to reach Aberfoyle. A private road was to be built from Aberfoyle to Loch Katrine, and a connecting coach service would run to Loch Lomond. The railway would be called the Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway, and the North British Railway and the Blane Valley Railway promised financial support. (In fact the Blane Valley company subscribed ¬£11,000, but there were extreme sensitivities among NBR shareholders about the allocation of the company's capital, and the chairman had to undertake that the NBR would not be subscribing for shares.) The cost of construction was estimated at ¬£51,947. On 12 August 1880 the Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway was authorised. Seven months later subscribed capital amounted to ¬£7,534, but nonetheless tenders were invited for construction. Kennedy tendered ¬£29,682. The meeting to award the contract was in progress when Kennedy learnt that a competitor had tendered ¬£28,521. He burst into the tender meeting and declared that a mistake had been made in his tender, and that it should have been ¬£28,435, and that he would take some stock in the company if necessary. This astonishing irregularity was overlooked and Kennedy was awarded the contract. The North British Railway now heard of the contract award when only a quarter of the contract sum had been subscribed, and demanded that the contract be cancelled. The Strathendrick set about a further round of canvassing for subscriptions, with various dubious benefits offered. Kennedy subscribed a further ¬£20,000 and was given a directorship. The North British Railway also insisted on its own technical standards for the line being observed; the S&AR; had intended lower standards and cheaper construction, but the NBR declined to work the line in that case. The NBR Engineer inspected the progress in the summer of 1882 and found that Kennedy's work was seriously deficient, and Kennedy was required to make good the shortcomings. The line was submitted to Major-General Hutchinson of the Board of Trade on 27 July 1882,Thomas says 1880 but this must be a misprint. but he found it unfit to accept traffic of any kind; in particular he objected to a proposal to have the signalling arranged as a long tablet section from Lennoxtown (the junction with the NBR Campsie Branch) to Gartness Junction (on the F&CJR;), and he insisted on a tablet station being provided at Killearn station. The line was opened on 1 October 1882, with full public operation the following day.Paterson says 1 August 1882, on page 81 and page 280. The passenger train service was from Glasgow Queen Street to Aberfoyle, the entire line being worked as a throughout route.Of course the Forth and Clyde Junction trains ran normally on their own route. However the S&AR; complained that the timetable adopted by the NBR was \\"most unsatisfactory and disappointing\\". Aberfoyle station was not equipped to handle cattle traffic that was on offer, nor to crane quarried stone that was brought to the line from the extensive quarries nearby. A new Killearn station was opened, nearer the village than the Blane Valley Railway station of the same name. The inevitable confusion for passengers was only partly reduced by renaming the station New Killearn and the Blane Valley station Old Killearn. The Blane Valley station was later named Dumgoyn Hill after a local beauty spot, and later again renamed Dumgoyne. The coach link with Inversnaid failed to be started, as the road intended to be used was little more than a farm track. However the toll road to Loch Katrine was built, its cost being shared with the North British Railway, the Duke of Montrose, and the Aberfoyle Quarry. The road proved immensely popular with tourists and regularly provided income to the railway company. The company badly needed the money; in its first three months of operation its revenue was ¬£138, ¬£88 and ¬£82 respectively. Keyden now projected a further railway across the sparsely populated terrain: a proposed Milngavie, Strathendrick and Port of Mentieth Railway. A director of the Blane Valley observed that \\"it is directly antagonistic to our interests and bound to abstract a large amount of traffic\\". Keyden was secretary of the S&AR;Thomas, volume 2 page 131, is ambiguous as to whether this related to the S&AR; or the BVR. and at the next board meeting, in an office provided by himself, was required to record his own dismissal in the minute book. He added that he expected a year's salary in lieu of notice, but the directors erased that part of Keyden's entry from the official record. Absorption On 1 August 1891 the S&AR; and the BVR were absorbed by the North British Railway. Passenger train service The 1895 Bradshaw shows four through journeys daily from Glasgow Queen Street to Aberfoyle; the trains called at both Killearn (Old station) and Killearn (New station); there were also a number of short journeys. In addition there were five trains from Queen Street to Kilsyth and Bonnybridge Central, running over the line from Campsie Junction to Kilsyth West Junction.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, By 1922 the service had been augmented to 6 trains daily, with a typical journey time of 105 minutes; there were also several short journeys on the line. Two trains gave road connections to the Trossachs; for example the 08:08 train from Queen Street gave a connection to the Trossachs arriving at 11:15. There were also four trains running from Queen Street to Kilsyth New and Bonnybridge Central.Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985 In 1938 there were seven journeys but all except one of these required a change of train at Blanefield, in most cases into the Sentinel rail car (see below). There were also seven journeys from Queen Street to Kilsyth.Bradshaw's July 1938 Railway Guide, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1969, Decline and closure  By the 1920s the rail services were suffering heavily from competition from cheaper and more flexible services offered by charabanc and motor bus operators. Passenger services on the Forth and Clyde Junction Railway from Stirling to Loch Lomond were suspended entirely from 1934, with the Aberfoyle passenger service continuing for the time being, on the section of the F&CJR; between Gartness Junction and Buchlyvie. Soon most services from Glasgow terminated at Blanefield, and passengers for Aberfoyle had to change there for a shuttle service operated by a Sentinel steam railcar. By the summer of 1950 Kirkintilloch was served by twelve trains a day; Lennoxtown by seven; Blanefield by five; and Aberfoyle by three. The line from Kirkintilloch to Aberfoyle closed to passengers the next year, on 1 October 1951. The Aberfoyle line north of Campsie Glen closed completely eight years later, with the ending of the remaining goods services in October 1959. The original Campsie Branch part of the line lasted a little longer, but in 1964 the last remaining passenger services to Kirkintilloch were ended, followed in April 1966 by closure of the final remaining goods services to Lennoxtown, and the entire line was closed and soon lifted.

After the war, she was in commission in the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC Unimak (WAVP-379), later WHEC-379, WTR-379, and again WHEC-379, from 1949 to 1975 and from 1977 to 1988 Construction and commissioning Unimak was laid down on 15 February 1942 at Harbor Island, near Seattle by Associated Shipbuilders, Inc. She was launched on 27 May 1942, sponsored by Mrs. H. B. Berry, the wife of Captain H. B. Berry, the personnel officer of the 13th Naval District, and commissioned on 31 December 1943 with Commander Hilfort C. Owen in command. United States Navy service=World War IIOperations in Central America, the Gal√°pagos Islands, and the Caribbean= Unimak was engaged in shakedown and fitting-out into late January 1944. With that completed, she departed San Diego, California, on 20 March 1944, bound for the Panama Canal Zone. Arriving at Balboa, Panama, on 28 March 1944, Unimak operated on the Pacific coast of Central America into April 1944, providing logistics support to advanced seaplane bases at Santa Elena Bay, Ecuador, and at Aeolian Bay, Battra Island, in the Gal√°pagos Islands. She soon shifted to Coco Solo on the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal and transported men and materiel to Barranquilla, Colombia, arriving there on 25 April 1944. After escorting the merchant ship SS Genevieve Lykes back to Coco Solo on 23 and 24 June 1944, Unimak conducted routine exercises with patrol planes into July 1944. On 4 July 1944 she received reports that a tanker near her position had been torpedoed, and headed for the damaged ship. When she arrived on the scene late that day, Unimak found the tanker still underway, making for the Panama coast. She immediately commenced screening the disabled ship and, aided by an escort of United States Army Air Forces and U.S. Navy planes, shepherded the tanker safely to Col√≥n, Panama, late on the afternoon of 5 July 1944. Soon thereafter, Unimak shaped her course towards the last reported position of the U.S. Navy K-class blimp K-53. At 15:32 hours on 9 July 1944, she sighted two yellow rubber life rafts and the wreckage of the crashed blimp floating on the water. At 15:58 hours, Unimak took on board nine survivors and sank the unsalvageable blimp by collapsing the bag with 40-millimeter gunfire. She then landed the survivors at Portland Bight, Jamaica. On 13 July 1944, Unimak joined with the destroyer in hunting for a submarine reported to be lurking nearby. Within a few days, word of a crashed plane sent the two ships speeding for the last reported position of the aircraft. When they arrived at the crash site, they found widespread debris and small floating pieces of the crashed plane. It was noted in the ship's diary that they recovered a \\"mutilated unidentifiable crewmember's body\\" that was \\"badly blasted and burned\\". The aviator was buried at sea with full military honors on 16 July 1944 at . Unimak remained in the Caribbean through the autumn of 1944, tending patrol planes, conducting logistics support missions for advanced seaplane bases, and occasionally towing targets for the patrol planes training in the area. On 15 December 1944, the seaplane tender relieved Unimak, releasing her to steam north via Norfolk, Virginia, to Boston, Massachusetts. =Voyages to England= Arriving at Boston at the end of December 1944, Unimak underwent availability at the Boston Navy Yard for the entire month of January 1945. She got underway for England on 14 February 1945, but an engineering casualty forced her to return to Boston for a major propeller shaft alignment which lasted into March. On 7 April 1945, Unimak got underway for the British Isles and proceeded, via Bahia Praia in the Azores, to Bristol, England, on the first of two voyages to England to bring back supplies and men from decommissioned U.S. Navy patrol plane squadrons in the United Kingdom, and was engaged in these activities when the war with Germany ended in May 1945. On the second voyage, from 5 June 1945 to 15 June 1945, Unimak transported the men and material of Patrol Bomber Squadron 103 (VPB-103 and 105) from Bristol to Norfolk. =Transfer to the Pacific= Departing Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 20 July 1945, bound for the United States West Coast, Unimak transited the Panama Canal on 26 July 1945 and arrived at San Diego on 3 August 1945. She got underway for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 12 August 1945. She was en route when hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945 bringing World War II to a close. Post-World War II Unimak operated in the Hawaiian Islands until 7 September 1945, when she headed for the Aleutian Islands. She operated in the northern Pacific Ocean - calling in the Territory of Alaska at Adak and Attu in the Aleutians and at Kodiak on Kodiak Island, and once at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union - into November 1945 before heading southward to prepare for inactivation. Reporting for inactivation in December 1945, Unimak was decommissioned on 26 July 1946 and placed in reserve. United States Coast Guard service Coast Guard cutter USCGC Unimak (WHEC-379) on 8 June 1987. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The Navy loaned Unimak to the United States Coast Guard on 14 September 1948. After undergoing conversion for Coast Guard use, she was commissioned into the Coast Guard on 3 January 1949 as USCGC Unimak (WAVP-379). Service history1949‚Äì1975= Unimak was home-ported in Boston, Massachusetts, from 3 January 1949 to 1 September 1956. Her primary duty during her Coast Guard service was to serve on ocean stations to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and she engaged in law enforcement operations. In June 1956, Unimak patrolled the Newport, Rhode Island-to-Bermuda race. Unimak was stationed at Cape May, New Jersey, from 1 September 1956 to 7 August 1972 and used primarily for training United States Coast Guard Reserve personnel, including training cruises to Brazil and Nova Scotia. She took part in the United States Coast Guard Academy cadet cruise of August 1965. Unimak was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-379 on 1 May 1966. Her loan period from the Navy came to an end on 26 September 1966, when she was transferred permanently from the Navy to the Coast Guard. On 7 March 1967, Unimak rescued six Cuban refugees in the Yucat√°n Channel. On 10 March 1967 she rescued survivors from the fishing vessel Bunkie III in Florida waters. On 15 March 1967, she rescued 12 Cuban refugees who were stranded on an island. On 29 May 1969, she towed the fishing vessel Sirocco - which was disabled east of Fort Pierce, Florida - to safety. Unimak was reclassified as a training ship and again redesignated, this time as WTR-379, on 28 November 1969. On 3 April 1970, she stood by the grounded merchant ship Vassiliki near Mayaguana Island until a commercial tug arrived to assist Vassiliki. From 7 August 1972 to 31 May 1975, Unimak was stationed at Yorktown, Virginia, and was again used to train Coast Guard reservists. The Coast Guard decommissioned Unimak on 31 May 1975 and placed her in reserve at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland. =1977‚Äì1988= On 22 August 1977, the Coast Guard recommissioned Unimak, reclassifying her as a high-endurance cutter and returning her to the designation WHEC-379. She was home-ported at New Bedford, Massachusetts, for the rest of her Coast Guard career. During this stint in commission, she was used primarily for fisheries patrol. Unimak also interdicted the trafficking of illegal drugs. On 6 October 1980, she seized the merchant ship Janeth southeast of Miami, Florida; Janeth was carrying 500 bales of marijuana. On 14 October 1980, she seized the pleasure craft Rescue, which was carrying approximately 500 bales of marijuana, and the pleasure craft Snail, with two tons of marijuana on board, in the Gulf of Mexico. On 17 October 1980, she seized the merchant vessel Amalaka southwest of Key West, Florida; Amalaka was carrying 1,000 bales of marijuana. On 19 October 1980, she seized the fishing vessel Wrights Pride southwest of Key West; Wright‚Ä≤s Pride had 30 tons of marijuana aboard. In March 1981, while on an Officer Candidate School training cruise, she intercepted the merchant ship Mayo with 40 tons of marijuana on board. On 9 October 1982, Unimak towed the disabled fishing vessel Sacred Heart away from Daid Banks, east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, in seas. Between 28 January 1983 and 9 March 1983, Unimak again deployed to the Caribbean for a law-enforcement patrol. On 27 and 28 February 1983, she towed the dismasted sailing vessel Wandering Star to Matthew Town on Great Inagua in the Bahamas. On 3 March 1983, she towed the disabled merchant vessel Yadrina to Matthew Town. On 30 November 1984, Unimak seized the sailboat Lola north of Barranquilla, Colombia; Lola had 1.5 tons of marijuana on board. Another drug seizure occurred on 2 November 1985, when Unimak seized the tug Zeus 3 and a barge south of the Dominican Republic; the two vessels were carrying 40 tons of marijuana. Decommissioning and disposal Unimak was the last of the 35 Barnegat-class ships and the last of the 18 Casco-class cutters in service in the United States when the Coast Guard decommissioned her on 29 April 1988 and transferred her to the U.S. Navy. She was then sunk that year as an artificial reef off the Virginia coast in 150 feet (46 meters)USCGC Unimak WHEC 379: The Last of Its Class of water.

When Calvin finds out after lodger Cheryl Brady eavesdrop the family argument, he grabs Gaz and throws him out, leading everyone to believe that Gaz is the father, when in fact Lauren's actually not pregnant at all. Calvin's friend arrests Gaz after an argument which Lauren blames Calvin for. Gaz is released and makes plans with Lauren to run away that day however their plans are cut short when Calvin is shot dead by Theresa. Lauren later lies to Sasha and Leo, telling them that she has had a miscarriage before running away with Gaz. Gaz is arrested for Calvin's murder and when he is later released he asks Lauren to run away with him again however she can't when she sees her dad needs her. Lauren and Gaz's relationship later deteriorates, she then starts to reconcile with Anita and accepts to go to Paris with her to visit her sister Leila Roy. Gaz is furious about this and gives Lauren an ultimatum to choose between him and Anita. Lauren then decides to choose Anita and they make a proper reconciliation and sh breaks up with Gaz. Lauren then later hears that Gaz has been arrested. She is then told by Anita that he held a gun, in which Lauren didn't believe and angrily thought she was lying. However she realises this when Gaz was actually arrested and goes to apologise to Anita. Lauren doubts that Gaz would actually shoot Anita with a real gun, but Anita convinces her that he probably would. Gaz is charged with Calvins murder Lauren believes him when he says he didn't but still wants nothing to do with him. Sasha finds out about the scam to fleece Spencer and argues with Lauren, during the argument Lauren falls down the stairs of the Loft. Lauren is hospitalised but discharges herself so she can go to Calvin's funeral. During the funeral Lauren shouts horrible things about Calvin then knocks his casket over. Valerie returns and reveals she wants to take Lauren back to Spain. Lauren visits Gaz in prison. He assumes that she cares about him, but she realises that she doesn't love Gaz anymore and leaves him. She then reveals to both Leo and Valerie that she wants to go to Spain with Valerie to reconnect with her. Out of guilt, Lauren then apologises to Spencer about her scheme and then is being forgiven by him. She later finds out that Valerie isn't going to Spain after all, but is then shocked to hear the rest of the family are joining them and that Spencer is going with them too. They attend the opening launch of the Chez Chez bar that replaces The Loft and they are cheered on as they leave the village. Reception Grace Dent of The Guardian joked about one of Lauren's light hearted storylines which featured after tragic storylines stating: \\"cruel, skint January has been brightened with a lawnmower race featuring Gaz and Lauren astride killer-bladed mowers, larking about like people who'd clearly forgotten they were stalked habitually by bad luck and tragedy.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Lauren Valentine on the E4 website Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Fictional Black British people Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional people from London ","title":"Lauren Valentine"},{"id":"12730553","text":"Hugh Jenkin High (October 24, 1888 - November 16, 1962), nicknamed \\"Bunny,\\" was an American baseball player.

He compiled a career batting average of .250 and led the American League's outfielders with a .981 fielding percentage in 1915. He later played for the Vernon Tigers in the Pacific Coast League from 1919 to 1923. Early years High was born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in 1888. He is the older brother of Andy High and Charlie High, both of whom also played in Major League Baseball Professional baseball High began playing professional baseball with the Hartford Senators in 1911 and 1912. He compiled a .327 batting average in 1912. After the 1912 season, High signed with the Detroit Tigers as insurance in the event that Ty Cobb held out due to a salary dispute. Cobb did hold out during the early weeks of the 1913 season, and High stepped in as the Tigers' starting center fielder. During the 1913 and 1914 seasons, High appeared in 171 games for the Tigers, principally as a backup for Ty Cobb in center field, and compiled a .248 batting average and .349 on- base percentage. On February 4, 1915, High was sold to the New York Yankees along with Wally Pipp. Between 1915 and 1918, High appeared in 345 games for the Yankees, served as the team's starting left fielder in 1916 and 1917, and compiled a .250 batting average and .343 on-base percentage. He also led all American League outfielders with a .981 fielding percentage in 1915. He appeared in his final major league game on May 22, 1918, but he continued to play in the minor leagues for several years thereafter.

The amine is often an alkaloid, such as nicotine, cocaine, morphine, and ephedrine, or derivatives thereof. Freebasing is a more efficient method of self- administering alkaloids via the smoking route.  Properties  Some alkaloids are more stable as ionic salts than as free base. The salts usually exhibit greater water solubility. Common counterions include chloride, bromide, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, citrate, and tartrate. Ammonium salts formed from the acid-base reaction with hydrochloric acid are known as hydrochlorides. For example, compare the free base hydroxylamine (NH2OH) with the salt hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH3OH+ Cl‚àí). Freebasing Cocaine hydrochloride (\\"powder cocaine\\"), for example, cannot be smoked, as it decomposes at the high temperatures produced by smoking. Free base cocaine, on the other hand, in which the cocaine alkaloid, which contains a nitrogen (which acts as a Lewis base) is \\"freed\\" from the hydrochloride salt, has a melting point of 98¬∞C and is volatile (i.e. tends to vaporize) at temperatures above 90¬∞C, and is therefore, unlike the hydrochloride salt, actively smokable. After inhalation the alkaloid is absorbed into the blood stream and rapidly transported throughout the body. However, since blood is buffered with carbonate at physiological pH (near 7.4), free-base amines will be rapidly converted back into their acid form. In fact, 94.19% of cocaine will exist as the acid form under equilibrium at pH=7.4, calculated using the Henderson- Hasselbalch equation assuming a pKa of 8.61. A small portion (5.81%) of cocaine will remain as free-base and pass through the blood-brain barrier; according to Le Chatelier's principle the acid form of cocaine will be continually converted to free-base as the base form is continually removed across the blood-brain barrier. Extraction kits for converting the hydrochloride to the base are commercially available. Freebasing also tends to remove water-soluble impurities and adulterants such as sugars (lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, inositol), which are often added to street cocaine. Cocaine freebase is only slightly soluble in water (1 in 600 of water) as compared to the high solubility of cocaine hydrochloride (1 in 0.5 of water).  Preparation  Cocaine freebase (\\"white tornado\\") is prepared from cocaine hydrochloride by extracting the cocaine with an alkaline solution (sodium hydroxide or ammonia) and adding a non-polar solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. The mixture separates into two layers, the top solvent layer containing the dissolved cocaine. The solvent is then evaporated leaving almost pure cocaine crystals, white and crumbly like feta cheese. A solution of cocaine hydrochloride can also be heated (\\"cooked\\") in a pan with baking soda added until a solid \\"rock\\" is formed, pieces of which can be smoked directly (crack cocaine).  History  The smoking of cocaine base first appeared in the United States in 1974 and was mostly confined to the state of California. The first hospital admission for a problem related to free-basing was in 1975, the year in which extraction kits and smoking accessories became commercially available. In 1978, distribution of these accessories or paraphernalia spread from California throughout the United States. In 1979, only 1% of cocaine-related hospital admissions involved the use of free base, but by 1982 this figure had increased to 7%.  Other  In South America, coca leaves are traditionally chewed with a quantity of an alkaline lime substance (\\"llipta\\") typically derived from the ashes remaining after burning plants, shells or limestone. In South America, coca paste, also known as cocaine base or basuco and, therefore, often confused with cocaine freebase in North America, is relatively inexpensive and is widely used by low-income populations.

The single known species, Neogaeornis wetzeli, was described from fossils found in the Campanian to Maastrichtian Quiriquina Formation of Chile. It lived about 70-67 million years ago. It remains known from the single tarsometatarsus described in 1929 by Lambrecht, and today housed in the Pal√§ontologisches Institut und Museum in Kiel, Germany.Chiappe (1991)  Taxonomy  It is controversial because of its uncertain placement. While clearly related to modern birds, N. wetzeli might not be a particularly close relative, but rather belong to the Baptornithidae, a member of the flightless and toothed Hesperornithes. If this is so, Neogaeornis is among the very youngest records of this lineage, and the first one from the Southern Hemisphere. However, the Hesperornithiformes are known to have been birds of the open epicontinental and shelf seas which avoided the outer oceans as surrounded South America at that time. And though apparently somewhat migratory, they are only known from temperate to warm subtropical climates, and it seems that towards the end of the Cretaceous their range shifted polewards. Others consider it a close relative of certain modern birds, such as the Gaviiformes (loons/divers). Both theories are problematic, as neither group is known from the Southern Hemisphere. The even more controversial supposed loon ancestor Polarornis from Seymour Island, Antarctica presents a similar dilemma and Neogaeornis and there is little consensus about the age of Polarornis, and so all that can be said is that Polarornis and Neogaeornis were similarly-sized birds with similar lifestyles.Mayr (2004) N. wetzeli may also be the ancestor to the grebes or Podicipediformes.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2012) Most recent phylogenetic studies seem to favour its position as a basal loon.Carolina Acosta Hospitaleche, Javier N. Gelfo, New Antarctic findings of Upper Cretaceous and lower Eocene loons (Aves: Gaviiformes), Annales de Pal√©ontologie Volume 101, Issue 4, October‚ÄìDecember 2015, Pages 315‚Äì324 Alongside Polarornis and some yet unnamed Antarctic specimens, it seems to suggest a Gondwanan origin for this group. In 2017 a phylogenetic study Agnol√≠n and colleagues have found Neogaeornis to be stem-anseriforms along with Polarornis, Australornis and Vegavis in the family Vegaviidae.

It is dedicated as a permanent shrine to Major League Baseball player and local alumni Roger Maris, centering on his life and baseball career, most notably for the New York Yankees during the 1961 season in which Maris hit a then-record 61 home runs. The museum is open during mall hours and is free to the public. History The Roger Maris Museum was created by Fargo American Legion members Robert Smith and James McLaughlin. Originally, Maris declined to have a museum erected in his honor. However, he initially agreed only at the request that it be on public display and charge no admission, as he did not want to capitalize on his success. Maris also personally chose to have the museum site be located within West Acres. It was constructed and opened in 1984. In 2003, the museum was remodeled during the mall's renovation. On July 26, 2016, the museum was burglarized during closing hours. Among the items stolen were the 1960 AL MVP plaque and the S. Rae Hickok Belt awarded to Maris in 1961. The culprits were never found nor the items ever recovered.http://www.startribune.com/fargo- thief-steals-trophy-belonging-to-baseball-great-roger-maris/388284781/ Exhibits The museum is located in the southeast wing of West Acres.

Khalid is the son of Salem Bin Mahfouz, a Saudi entrepreneur who rose from being a smalltime moneychanger to becoming the founder of the NCB, the first private Saudi bank. With a personal wealth estimated to be around $3.2 billion, Bin Mahfouz ranked 24th in Arabian Business magazine's list of the world's most influential Arabs in 2008. In the same year, Bin Mahfouz ranked number 214 in Forbes Billionaires List After the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, considerable suspicion fell on Saudi financiers and charities as sources of financing for terrorism and Khalid Bin Mahfouz faced accusations in books, newspapers and magazines that he and his family had funneled money to Al Qaeda. Biography Khalid bin Mahfouz was the second eldest son of Salem Ahmed bin Mahfouz, a Saudi who rose from being an illiterate moneychanger to the founder of the first bank in his country, the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia (NCB). Salem Ahmed then became the personal banker of the Saudi royal family. He handed management of NCB, the largest bank in the country, to Khalid sometime in the 1980s. In the 1970s Khalid bin Mahfouz bought and lived in a $3.5 million chateaux-style house, later named \\"Versailles,\\" in the River Oaks area of Houston. He also bought a four thousand acre (16 km¬≤) ranch along the Trinity River in Liberty County, Texas, near the ranch of James Bath.Unger, Craig. House of Bush House of Saud. Scribner.

In 1990 Khalid bin Mahfouz acquired Irish citizenship through inward-investment procedures. Bin Mahfouz was married with three children. His personal net worth was $3.2 billion in 2006, making him one of the richest people in the world at the time; his family fortune was estimated to have been worth over $4 billion. Controversies and allegations=Alleged Brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden This allegation came from high-profile people, book authors and well respected newspapers in the US and Europe such as The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. All turned out to be based on false information. For example, James Woolsey, former Director of CIA, testified to a congressional subcommittee that Khalid Bin Mahfouz was a brother-in-law of Osama Bin Laden. He later on told Los Angeles Times 'I don't know what to say other than there was some confusion, but I never meant to refer to Bin Mahfouz's sister'. \\"Silverstein, Ken. ‚ÄúSaudi Billionaire Alleges Significant Errors in Book on Terrorist Financing Linking Him to Bin Laden.‚Äù Los Angeles Times, February 26, 2003 Page A18 The Wall Street Journal issued a correction. ‚ÄúNone of Khalid bin Mahfouz's sisters is, or ever has been, married to Osama bin Laden.\\" \\"The Wall Street Journal, May 29, 2004. https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1022636498974443720 $225 million BCCI scandal fine Bin Mahfouz was a non-executive director of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a financial conglomerate later convicted of money laundering, bribery, support of terrorism, arms trafficking, and many other crimes. Mahfouz personally owned a 20% stake in BCCI. He was indicted by a New York state grand jury for fraud but denied any culpability. The fraud charges were settled for $225 million in lieu of fines. Mr. Bin Mahfouz has claimed that he simply settled as a business decision rather than using resources to fight further. Donations to Osama bin Laden in 1988 Craig Unger's book House of Bush, House of Saud claims that bin Mahfouz donated over $270,000 to Osama bin Laden's Islamist organization at the request of Osama's brother Salem bin Laden. Bin Mahfouz's lawyer stated: \\"This donation was to assist the US-sponsored resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and was never intended nor, to the best of Sheikh Khalid's knowledge, ever used to fund any 'extension' of that resistance movement in other countries.\\" Alleged NCB funding of al-Qaeda Khalid bin Mahfouz has denied that NCB, his bank, was involved in funding an al-Qaeda group. According to reports, high-placed Saudi businessmen transferred millions of dollars through NCB to charities operating as fronts for al-Qaeda. Mahfouz states that he could not have been aware of every wire transfer moving through the bank, and that he would not have allowed such transactions had he known they were taking place. Additionally, Forbes reports: NCB senior officials vehemently deny the existence of this audit. He eventually won a string of lawsuits against writers who had accused him of supporting terrorism, with a notable exception of Rachel Ehrenfeld. Ehrenfeld, the author of Funding Evil and a U.S. citizen based in New York, had not written or marketed her book internationally and refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the English court over her case, instead alleging that Mahfouz was using the High Court of Justice for libel tourism.David Pallister, \\"US author mounts 'libel tourism' challenge\\". The Guardian, 15 November 2007 Her refusal resulted in Justice Eady in the High Court awarding a default judgment against her in 2005. Dr Ehrenfeld was ordered to apologize, destroy all copies of her book and pay him $230,000 in damages. The New York State Legislature, however, passed a law preventing the judgments from being enforced by providing greater protection against libel judgments in countries whose laws are inconsistent with the freedom of speech granted by the United States Constitution .Samuel A. Abady & Harvey Silverglate, \\"Rachel's Law: NY's 'Libel-Tourism' Fix\\". New York Post, 25 February 2008 Sheik Mahfouz did acknowledge making one contribution to Al Qaeda during the epoch of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Muwafaq Foundation Khalid bin Mahfouz helped set up a charity organization called the Muwafaq Foundation, Muwafaq being Arabic for \\"blessed relief\\". He funded this charity with $30 million, and put his eldest son, Abdulrahman bin Mahfouz, on the board of directors. In October 2001, the U.S. Treasury Department named Muwafaq Foundation - a charity devoted to famine relief - a front organization. Neither Khalid nor Abdulrahman were accused of funding terrorism by the United States; however Yasin al-Qadi, a Saudi national hired to run the charity, was named a supporter of terrorism and had his assets frozen by the U.S. Treasury Department. UN designation There have been numerous allegations that Khalid bin Mahfouz has been named a terrorist financier by the United Nations. The controversy springs from a report prepared by French investigator Jean-Charles Brisard and his research agency, the JCB Consulting Group, for the President of the Security Council of the United Nations in December 2002.

They are approximately high and are topped by four sculptures that make up the city's skyline. The Sky Stations The sculptural elements that crown the Bartle Hall pylons, called \\"Sky Stations\\", were designed by artist R.M. Fischer in 1994. Each of the works is made of aluminum and steel, approximately 24x15-feet in diameter, and 20x25-feet in height. They were primarily inspired by the 1930s Art Deco chandelier and decorative design elements throughout Municipal Auditorium, which is adjacent to Bartle Hall. The Sky Stations were placed atop each pillar via helicopter. Lightning damage was found to the easternmost Sky Station during an inspection in the fall of 2015.

Early life  White was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, the son of Robert White, journeyman shipwright, and his wife Janet, n√©e Dunn. White was apprenticed to a plasterer and studied modelling at South Kensington. White made anatomical models for hospitals in London.  Australian period  The Queen Victoria Memorial in the Queen Victoria Gardens in Melbourne White came to Sydney around 1884 and worked for Achille Simonetti on the monument to Governor Arthur Phillip in Sydney Botanical Gardens. White won the Wynne Prize for the group 'In Defence of the Flag' at Sydney in 1902. Despite a long list of commissions, White was by no means a distinguished sculptor. White came to Australia when there were few sculptors there of ability, and it must be presumed that his sketch models were better than his finished works, as in later years he more than once obtained important commissions in competition with better men.  Later life  White died of cancer while visiting Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.White James -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search He was survived by his wife, son and two daughters.  Selected works  White executed a large number of statues and memorials in Australia, including the Queen Victoria memorial (1907) and the Fitzgibbon statue at Melbourne, statues of George Bass, Daniel Henry Deniehy, Sir John Robertson and William Bede Dalley at Sydney, the John McDouall Stuart statue at Adelaide, South African war memorials at Perth and Ballarat and statues of Queen Victoria and George Lansell at Bendigo. White's head of an Australian aboriginal is in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. References Additional resources listed by the Australian Dictionary of Biography: *K.

The monastery was founded in the 1130s by Gotebold II, Count of Henneberg, and his wife Liutgard on a site near the confluence of the Schleuse and the Werra. The church was dedicated in 1138; the foundation received papal confirmation three years later. For the whole of its existence of more than four hundred years the abbey was the house monastery of the Hennebergs. It also had a close association with the von Bibra family, particularly in the 15th century. During the Reformation in 1543, the monastery was turned into an estate. The former monastery served another four hundred years as an agricultural estate, mostly in private hands, but after World War II as a possession of the East German state, and from 1953 as the site of a collective farm (Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft, or LPG). In 1975 the site was taken over by the Museum of the History of Agriculture of the DDR (Agrarhistorisches Museum der DDR). Since 1990 the site has been the home of the Hennebergische Museum, an open-air museum specialising in the display of re-located local buildings. The abbey church, dedicated to Saint Mary, was converted to the parish church, with much of the space used for storage. Most of the church structure was heavily damaged in a 1939 fire. One chapel continues to be used. The ruins are nevertheless substantial and after stabilisation it remains the most significant Romanesque building in the region. Of the monastic buildings themselves there remain the gate chapel and the accommodation block, with the ruins of the cloister.

Mrs. Wilson is the former covert CIA officer whose then-classified non-official cover (NOC) identity as \\"Valerie Plame\\" was leaked to the press in July 2003, after her husband, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson, IV, had criticized the George W. Bush administration's rationale for the Iraq War. The outing made her the center of the American political scandal known as the Plame affair. Her public outing led to her decision to resign from the CIA in December 2005, when she attempted to retire early at the age of 42. Being told that she could not collect her pension until the age of 56, she determined to write this book both as a means of telling her own story in her own words and as a means of earning income to replace her deferred retirement annuity.

Many White House staffers are potential suspects, but various press reports have suggested that the Feds will want to interview I.

(He told me the same weeks ago when I made a similar inquiry about this chat with Rove.)Cf. Michael Isikoff, \\"The Rove Factor: Time Magazine Talked to Bush's Guru for Plame Story\\" , Newsweek, July 11, 2006, accessed August 23, 2007.\\"Legal Affairs: Reporter Says Libby, Rove Told Him of Plame's Work\\", All Things Considered, National Public Radio, January 31, 2007, accessed August 23, 2007; includes audio link (NPR Player). Matthews was one of over twenty- five journalists subpoenaed by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald regarding their conversations with high-level Bush administration officials pertaining to the CIA leak grand jury investigation (2003‚Äì2005), leading to the indictment and prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of Scooter Libby in United States v. Libby (2007). Ultimately, whereas Fitzgerald's grand jury did not indict Rove for committing any alleged crimes, and, in October 2005, it did indict Libby not for allegedly having leaked Mrs. Wilson's identity but for allegedly having lied in his sworn testimony pertaining to the leak investigation, federal felonies for which a jury convicted and a judge sentenced him, a sentence which was commuted by Presidential proclamation. On July 19, 2007, a district court judge dismissed the Wilsons' civil lawsuit (Plame v. Cheney) which charged related offenses by the various government officials. The dismissal was on jurisdictional grounds, that the case belonged in federal court. The Wilsons appealed that decision, but on August 12, 2008, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the dismissal in a 2‚Äì1 decision. On June 21, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. On April 6, 2006, Matthews stated his own point of view on the CIA leak publicly in some detail in his conversation with Senator John Kerry on Hardball with Chris Matthews, describing as \\"high drama\\" Scooter Libby's testimony that the President of the United States via the Vice President of the United States had \\"ordered\\" Libby to leak classified information pertaining to national security in order to bolster the case for the Iraq War after it began in March 2003.\\"Kerry: 'Immoral to allow our kids to be killed': Sen. John Kerry talks to Chris Matthews about Iraq, CIA leak: Following the CIA leak disclosure, Chris Matthews sat down with Senator John Kerry in his Capitol office to discuss the big developments in the CIA leak case and vision for Iraq policy\\", Hardball with Chris Matthews, NBC News, April 6, 2006, accessed August 22, 2007 (Transcript): >>>> >>>>> Let's talk about the timing of this and we all remember this. It was July 6th that Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who had been sent down there by the CIA to the government of Niger to check out the story which appeared mysteriously in an Italian newspaper, that there had been a deal by Saddam Hussein to purchase nuclear materials, uranium yellow cake, from the government of Niger. Within two days, the vice president of the United States said the president of the United States wanted Scooter Libby to leak to Judy Miller, someone he had been working with on stories, had written stories that were supportive of the war, in effect, if not in intent, to tell her, this is a specific determination by the president. You tell Scooter to go tell Judy that there was a real case for these aluminum tubes being material for use in developing a nuclear weapon. You tell her this. This is the conversation we're getting recounted under oath from Scooter Libby. Pretty high drama here, isn't it? I mean, it tells you that the president himself was in charge of this operation. He wasn't some, faded backroom guy getting orders from the vice president. He was in fact, calling the shots particularly, and making the case for the war after the fact. On June 7, 2007, the day after Lewis Libby's sentencing, in a conversation with actor and political activist Ben Affleck about other matters, Chris Matthews used the phrase \\"fair game\\" several times, initially citing its use in a question submitted for Affleck by a viewer, whose own use of the phrase could reflect Matthews' already well-publicized reported use of it by Wilson, Newsweek, and many other media sources.Chris Matthews, \\"'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for June 7\\", NBC News, updated June 8, 2007, 12:09 p.m. ET, accessed August 23, 2007: \\"Here's a question from [...]. 'Are the personal or religious beliefs of candidates fair game for scrutiny when deciding for whom to vote?' What do you make of that, Ben? It's been happening in these debates, lots of questions about, you know, evolution, Genesis, the whole thing, creationism. Are they fair game, or is that a religious test?\\" (Italics added.) (Transcript; \\"Guests: Ben Affleck, Loretta Sanchez, Brian Bilbray, Ezra Klein, Karen Hanretty.\\") His later usage of the phrase \\"fair game\\" in talking with Affleck about other matters raises a possibility that the phrase \\"fair use\\" that he reportedly used in talking with Wilson about Rove's comments about \\"Wilson's wife\\" (as quoted in The Politics of Truth [2004, 2005] and as previously quoted in Newsweek [2003]) was his own phrase and not Rove's, as Rove later disavowed it. Nevertheless, whether or not Rove originated it, the phrase still conveys metaphorically what Matthews and the Wilsons appear to think that Rove literally may have intended: to \\"target\\" (in Gregory's later terminology) Wilson and, collaterally, to leak the information about his wife's CIA identity in the process. The CIA leak grand jury investigation did not result in charging that anyone leaked her name intentionally while knowing that it was a classified covert identity, in part, Special Counsel Fitzgerald later argued in United States v. Libby, because of Libby's obstruction of justice. The jury convicted Libby on four of the five counts in the indictment: one count of obstruction of justice; two counts of perjury; and one count of making false statements to federal investigators, he was sentenced on June 5, 2007, and President Bush commuted his 30-month prison sentence on July 2, 2007.\\"I. Lewis Libby Jr. (Index): The Counts\\", The New York Times, Times Topics, updated periodically, March 6, 2007, accessed August 23, 2007. On July 3, 2007, the day after President Bush commuted Libby's sentence, Chris Matthews talked again with former Ambassador Wilson, who reiterated his belief that the Bush administration had inappropriately leaked his wife's then-classified covert CIA identity to retaliate against him politically, in effect targeting her. Matthews asked Wilson: \\"When did you sense that the White House was trying to destroy your reputation?\\" and he replied: \\"Well, it was pretty clear to me shortly after I wrote my article \\"What I Didn't Find in Africa\\", when Mr. Novak spoke to a friend of mine on the street and said that, Wilson's a 'blank,' and his wife works for the CIA, that the nature of the smear campaign they were going to run against me was going to include the betrayal of her identity as a covert CIA officer. And that would have been around July 8 or July 9 [2003].\\"\\"'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for July 3, 5 p.m. ET\\", Hardball with Chris Matthews, MSNBC, updated: July 5, 2007, 2:54 p.m. ET, accessed August 22, 2007.

The Alpha Media outlet operates at 94.1 MHz with an effective radiated power of 10.5 kw and its city of license is Floresville, Texas. Its studios are located in Northeast San Antonio, and the transmitter site is in southeast Bexar County. Station History KTFM was originally a move-in, where in 1991 it had a Tejano format as KRIO (\\"94.1 K-RIO\\"), KRIO started out as a Texas Music Station then flipped to Country. The country format was short-lived and lasted no longer than 8 months. This was during the Gillespie Broadcasting days which had a LMA with KONO-AM-FM. but by September 1998 they would flip to Regional Mexican as KLEY (\\"La Ley 94.1\\"). On January 7, 2005, BMP would revive the KTFM calls after it acquired KLEY from Spanish Broadcasting System. When KTFM was revived, its name was \\"Jammin' 94.1\\" and its focus was on Rhythmic Oldies. But as the station struggled to get ratings, KTFM shifted to a Rhythmic AC direction by adding more current product and putting less emphasis on older material to keep up with the changing musical taste along with the (mostly female) 25-44 and Hispanic demographics KTFM targets in the San Antonio radio market. By November 2008 KTFM began shifting to a Rhythmic contemporary direction and was added to the BDS Top 40/Rhythmic reporting panel. In February 2009, KTFM tweaked the format and started broadcasting a Hot AC format. For many years, the call sign \\"KTFM\\" was at 102.7 under the name \\"FM 103 The New KTFM\\", \\"KTFM 103\\", \\"Hot 103 KTFM\\", and \\"102.7 KTFM\\", where it was first an automated pop station, then album rock, them various flavors of Top 40 including an Urban AC-leaning version of Top 40 trying to top then-rival KSJL's numbers, then to a Rhythmic/Freestyle-leaning Top 40, and then back to rock. Today, 102.7 carries the adult hits format \\"Jack FM\\" and uses the call letters KJXK. By April 2010, BMP flipped KTFM to Top 40/CHR, with a heavy emphasis on Dance crossovers. On January 7, 2016, at 9 a.m., following \\"Blondie & Nugget in the Morning\\", (on which the last song was \\"Here\\" by Alessia Cara), KTFM began stunting as \\"94.1 El Taco,\\" giving away free tacos at various locations around San Antonio, playing the Parry Gipp novelty song \\"It's Raining Tacos\\" (a spoof of \\"It's Raining Men\\" by The Weather Girls) on a loop, and its website emitting a green lightning strike with the word \\"Energize.\\" At 4 p.m. that same day, KJXK began stunting with country music, leading listeners and rivals to believe KTFM was moving back to 102.7; at the same time as KTFM's relaunch, the stunt on 102.7 was revealed to be a publicity stunt. At 5 p.m., KTFM transitioned back to Rhythmic Top 40 and relaunched as \\"Energy 94.1\\", with the first song being \\"Sorry\\" by Justin Bieber. The rebranding was done to emphasize its Rhythmic/Dance-focused presentation of current hits and club mixes featuring local talent, as well as distinguishing themselves from KBBT and KXXM whose ratings are higher than KTFM's, but does consistently well.\\"KTFM San Antonio Is Now 94.1 The Taco\\" from Radio Insight (January 7, 2016)KTFM Relaunches As Energy 94.1 On February 23, 2016, \\"Blondie & Nugget in the Morning\\" were released from the station and replaced by the nationally syndicated radio show \\"Brooke & Jubal in the Morning\\". The show started airing on KTFM on March 1, 2016. On August 1, 2016, nationally syndicated \\"Tino Chochino Radio\\" was added as a show that runs on weeknights. On August 20, 2018, \\"The Dana Cortez Show\\", hosted by Dana Cortez and Anthony Almanzar, began airing on KTFM after transferring from Top 40/CHR rival KBBT, as the show became syndicated by ABC Radio. By July 2019, KTFM shifted back to a more mainstream Top 40/CHR.  KTFM-HD2 and K277CX 103.3  On February 10, 2015, KTFM launched an alternative rock format on its HD2 sub channel, branded as \\"103.3 The App\\", relayed on translator K277CX (103.3 FM) in Terrell Wells. The first song on \\"The App\\" was \\"Take Me to Church\\" by Hozier.Alternative App Launches in San Antonio The station was named \\"The App\\" because it heavily promoted listeners to download the app from iTunes and/or Google Play due to the station's weak signal over San Antonio, in addition to the lack of HD radios. Throughout the month of February and March, \\"The App\\" started off with 10,000 songs in a row, with a blend of 90's and 2000's rock and alternative mixed with today's alternative but tends to be more indie rock leaning. Eventually, the station began airing short commercial breaks and promoted concerts, such as the Maverick Music Festival and Vans Warped Tour, and bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Awolnation, Falling in Reverse, and Breaking Benjamin. By late 2015, the App has hosted concerts in the Alamo Lounge, owned and operated by Alpha Media, with bands such as Jimmy Eat World, Saint Motel, Blue October, Nothing But Thieves, Colours, and several local rock bands. By late April 2015, The App added one live personality, DJ Mighty Iris, and until May 2016, more personalities have been added such as REZ, Sam (from Jack FM), and even a morning show hosted by Tony Cortez from Energy 94.1. On April 21, 2017, at 5 p.m., after playing \\"Steady, As She Goes\\" by The Raconteurs, KTFM-HD2/K277CX flipped to classic hip-hop (a format that was dropped by KMYO two days earlier, as both KMYO and KZEP-FM (which aired a classic-leaning Rhythmic Top 40 format) flipped to Spanish Top 40/CHR) as \\"G103.3\\". The flip comes as the ratings for the alternative rock format failed to attract listeners, posting a 0.8 in the March 2017 Nielsen Audio book.

It lies on the State Highway #10 between the cities of Rourkela and Rajgangpur, about 25 km from Rourkela; and on the main railway route between Howrah (Kolkata) and CST/Kurla (Mumbai). Kansbahal comes under the Rourkela municipality.  History  Kansbahal remained a rather unknown tribal village and forested area in the Sundargarh district of Odisha until its emergence into prominence with the establishment of \\"Utkal Machinery Limited\\" (UTMAL), a heavy engineering company, mainly serving the Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) of the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL).SAIL Utkal Machinery Limited soon evolved into Larsen and Toubro's Heavy Engineering Works.Larsen & Toubro Limited Geography Kansbahal abounds in naturally beautiful and man made places, among others, Mandira Dam, towards the northwest, Water Point, towards the north, Pitamahal Dam, towards the southeast and Kansbahal Dam, towards the south that are very suitable for the picnic spots. Two rivers run by Kansbahal - Ghoghar river and Sankh river, with the Ghoghar river finally merging into the Sankh river. The Sankh river merges downstream with the Koyal river at Vedvyas, giving birth to the famous Brahmani river of Odisha. It is believed that before authoring the epic Mahabharat, the legendary sage Vedavyas used to reside in the caves and forested area beside the river. Outside the L&T; Township, a civil township has emerged with the name Bhilaigarh colony. It has almost all the latest facilities like concrete roads, telephone lines, electricity and above all a peace-loving society of vintage persona retired from L & T Kansbahal works. Economy Today, Kansbahal is a modern township - a planned mini city for its employees. Resources were poured into developing the unknown place into an ideal city. The projects included housing for over 1000 employees and their families, schools, medical facilities, transportation, road network and recreational facilities,L&T; Kansbahal Works like the bigger RSP, attracted rich talent from all over the country. This helped Kansbahal become a culturally rich and diversified township. While L&T; Kansbahal Works has had its ups and downs due to changes in the structure of L&T; Ltd., the economy of the region and that of the country, the place itself has rapidly developed into a modern mini-city, comparable in many ways to those in developed nations. Many smaller communities have developed around and outside Kansbahal because of the growing importance of Kansbahal. The schools here, largely aided by L&T;, have played a very important role in developing the region as a whole. Earlier, Montfort School Complex was the local high school. It prides in having regular classes up to the 10+2 level in 3 separate languages - English, Hindi and Odiya - a unique feature not found anywhere else in the region. The generations that have studied at Montfort School Complex are now placed at important places in India as well as abroad. Right now, D.A.V. has taken up the same responsibility. The plant premises of L&T; township are divided into two major sections - the North Colony and the South Colony. Other smaller sections are Old Colony, New Colony, L.I.C Colony, New L.I.C Colony, Central Colony, Security Colony, Teachers Colony, R.S. Colony, Gwalapada and Mehtab Road, Bilaigarh. For guests, there is a fully furnished AC Guest House in North Colony. All schools are located in the South Colony. D.A.V. Public School (formerly Montfort School) and Utmal School have two football grounds each. All major sports events are held in one or more of these grounds. Residents of L&T; Township actively participate in different cultural and recreational activities at the many clubs of Kansbahal. These include the North Colony Club, South Colony Club, Utkal Jyoti, Milani Club, Gunjan Club, Kansbahal Kala Kendra and the Mahila Samiti. Transport Kansbahal railway station on the Tatanagar‚ÄìBilaspur section of Howrah-Nagpur- Mumbai line is located in the southernmost end of the L&T; Township while the SH 10 passes through the Mahtab Road area on the northernmost end. Education Indian Institute of Production Management (IIPM), formerly Indian Institute of Foreman Training (IIFT), is another internationally recognized institute located in Kansbahal. IIPM serves to train professionals from India and abroad in advanced industrial fields. IIPM, was established by ICICI Limited in 1983 with the active support of L&T; Ltd and the Government of Odisha. IIPM in collaboration with L&T;, ICICI and Usha Martin has also set up a B- School named IIPM School of Management in 2007, under the Biju Patnaik University of Technology (BPUT). This B-school is also recognized by AICTE. IIPM completed 25 years of its glorious existence on 24 October 2008.Indian Institute for Production Management Purushottam Institute of Engineering and Technology is a B.Tech engineering college affiliated to BPUT located in Mandiakudar. Mandiakudar is a small village, it gained popularity because of its proximity to engineering colleges. Presently there are two institutes in Mandiakudar located in the same campus of Purushottam Vihar. Purushottam School of Engineering and Technology is one of the diploma engineering college located in Mandiakudar of Purushottam Vihar campus. This college is affiliated to SCTE & VT which was opened in 2008. Mandiakudar has well connectivity of buses through national highway 24 to city of Rourkela and Sambalpur. Purushottam vihar campus has one small post office run by Indian Post Office with hostels for boys and girls studying in these engineering college.

Division (1. K√∂niglich W√ºrttembergische)), was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866‚Äì1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. The Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg remained semi-autonomous on some military matters, but its army was fully integrated into the Prussian Army. It was headquartered in Stuttgart, the capital of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815‚Äì1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabr√ºck, 1993), Bd. 1, p.122; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deuschen Heeres (1905), p.1125. The division was subordinated in peacetime to the XIII (Royal W√ºrttemberg) Corps (XIII. (K√∂niglich W√ºrttembergisches) Armeekorps).Bredow, p. 1123. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was raised and recruited in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Evolution of the 26th Division The 26th Division was formed in 1817 as W√ºrttemberg's 1st Infantry Division. It was merged with W√ºrttemberg's 2nd Infantry Division on July 27, 1849, to form W√ºrttemberg's Infantry Division and was dissolved in 1868.Bredow, p.1124. The division was reestablished after the Franco-Prussian War on December 18, 1871, as the 26th Division (1st Royal W√ºrttemberg), taking its new numbering as part of the Prussian Army structure. Combat chronicle Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach, divisional commander from 1912 to 1917 Although the 26th Division was not formed until 1871, its predecessors saw action in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 against Prussia and in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 on the side of Prussia against France. The W√ºrttemberg Infantry Division saw action in the Main campaign in 1866, suffering a reverse at Tauberbischofsheim. During the Franco-Prussian War, the W√ºrttemberg Field Division fought at the battles of W≈ìrth and Sedan, and then participated in the Siege of Paris and the Battle of Villiers (November 30 and December 2, 1870).Bredow, p. 1124 During World War I, the division initially served on the Western Front. In 1914, led by Duke Wilhelm von Urach, it fought in the Battle of the Frontiers and then participated in the Race to the Sea.Wm. Von Urach dates, 1912-17 It was then transferred to the Eastern Front, and fought in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive and the invasion of Serbia. It returned to the Western Front and fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the Battle of Arras in 1917. In late 1917, it was sent to the Italian Front, and fought in the Battle of Caporetto. Returning to the Western Front, the division served in the 1918 German Spring Offensive and the subsequent Allied counteroffensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive. Allied intelligence rated the division as first class.26\\\\.

During the war, most divisions became triangular ‚Äì one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, the engineer contingent was increased, and a divisional signals command was created.

During the Soviet period he was a human rights activist, being exiled, then imprisoned in a corrective-labour colony, for publication of his book Punitive Medicine in Russian and in English.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents: Between prison and liberty, Moscow:AST, 2014. In 1987, while still forced to live outside Moscow in internal banishment, Podrabinek became the founder and editor-in-chief of the Express Chronicle weekly newspaper. In the 1990s he set up and ran the Prima information agency. Over the past ten years he has worked, variously, for the Novaya gazeta newspaper, the Yezhednevny Zhurnal website and the Russian Services of Radio France Internationale and Radio Liberty.  Biography  Alexander Podrabinek was born on 8 August 1953 in Elektrostal, a large provincial town in the Moscow Region to which his parents moved from Moscow in the early 1950s, to avoid the campaign against rootless cosmopolitans, i.e. Jews. He and his younger brother Kirill were brought up there by their Jewish father Pinkhos after his Russian wife died.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents: between Prison and Liberty, 2014, p. 13 (in Russian). At secondary school, aged ten, they joined the Young Pioneers, but later Alexander and Kirill did not apply to join the Komsomol, the only two non-members in their respective classes: the only explanation the school administration could find was that they were either Baptists or open enemies of the regime.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents: between Prison and Liberty, 2014, pp. 20-22 (in Russian). Alexander enrolled in the Department of Pharmacology of a medical institute in 1970 and worked as an assistant in a biology laboratory at Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry. From 1971 to 1974 Alexander studied at a college for medical auxiliary staff and received certification as a paramedic. He went on to work in the Moscow ambulance service.

For political reasons, Podrabinek was denied entrance to medical school, and, at the age of 20, began working for the ambulance service instead. At an early age, Podrabinek became acquainted with dissident circles in Moscow and began to take part in their activities. (His medical father, himself the son of an \\"Enemy of the People\\" shot in 1937, did not discourage him.) After reading the notes that dissident poet Vladimir Gershuni's smuggled out of the Oryol Special Psychiatric hospital, Alexander became interested in the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.\\"Notes from Oryol Special Psychiatric Hospital by Vladimir Gershuni\\", A Chronicle of Current Events, 19:2, 30 April 1971. Soon he was a contributing editor to the Chronicle of Current Events (1968-1982),A Chronicle of Current Events, 1968-1982. covering psychiatric issues. In January 1977, he also travelled to Siberia as a courier for the Social Fund, delivering money to the needy families of political prisoners, held in the camps or forced to live in exile.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents, 2014, pp. 86-93. Punitive Psychiatry On 5 January 1977, Podrabinek launched the Working Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes. The Commission at first had three other members (Vyacheslav Bakhmin, Irina Kaplun and Felix Serebrov), and its consultant psychiatrist was A.A. Voloshanovich. Around the Commission formed a circle of supporters \\"without whom we could have done nothing,\\" comments Podrabinek. \\"The volume of work was too great.\\".Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents, 2014, p. 226. They visited psychiatric hospitals, wrote appeals to hospital doctors, and published information on psychiatric abuse in their own information bulletins, and in other samizdat publications like the Chronicle of Current Events. In 1977, Podrabinek published Punitive Medicine [–ö–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω–∞], the Russian edition of his book on the systematic abuse of psychiatry for political purposes in the USSR. In December 1977, the KGB approached Podrabinek's father Pinkhos, and threatened to arrest and imprison both his sons (Kirill was suffering from TB) if the three of them did not agree to emigrate to Israel. (In an essay circulated in samizdat Kirill had criticized the treatment of conscripts in the Soviet army.) They discussed their predicament with other dissidents, notably Tatyana Velikanova, at the apartment of Andrei Sakharov. Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, urged the three to take the opportunity to leave the USSR. Alexander, supported by Velikanova, rejected the proposal and later held a press conference at the home of Andrei Sakharov, publicly asserting his refusal to given in to such blackmail.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents, 2014, p. 160 onwards. On 15 August 1978, Alexander Podrabinek was convicted of \\"anti-Soviet slander\\", sentenced to five years' banishment or internal exile, and was first transported to the Irkutsk Region, Siberia.\\"The Trial of Alexander Podrabinek\\", A Chronicle of Current Events, 50:7, November 1978. (His brother Kirill, meanwhile, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon and was sent to a camp for ordinary criminals.\\"The fate of the brothers Podrabinek\\", Vesti iz SSSR, 1979, 1-8, 15 January 1979 (in Russian).) After the English edition of Punitive Medicine appeared, Podrabinek was again charged with political offences ‚Äî he was by then exiled to Yakutia in the Soviet Far East ‚Äî and at his trial in Ust-Nera on 6 January 1981, he was sentenced to three years in a local corrective-labour camp.\\"The trial of Alexander Podrabinek\\", Vesti iz SSSR, 15 January 1981 (in Russian). Return from the Far East In autumn 1986, prompted by Anatoly Marchenko's hunger strike in Chistopol Prison, Podrabinek, veteran dissident Larisa Bogoraz, and lawyer Sophia Kalistratova launched a campaign for the release of the Soviet Union's hundreds of political prisoners. They sent letters requesting a wide amnesty to the presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet and to Mikhail Gorbachev, the new leader of the Soviet Communist Party. There was no response. Then they began sending their two letters to prominent members of the artistic and technical intelligentsia: to writers, poets and artists; and to scientists and scholars. The result was disheartening. With notable exceptions, e.g. the world-famous anim√© artist Yury Norstein, very few would put their name to such a document.Alexander Podrabinek, \\"Our campaign for an amnesty\\", Znamya, April (No. 4), 2015 (in Russian). Retrieved 25 March 2018. In 1987, Podrabinek founded the weekly samizdat newspaper Express Chronicle, which appeared in Russian and English between 1987 and 2000. As the first uncensored media outlet in the USSR, with the Glasnost journal of Sergei Grigoryants, the Chronicle drew the interest of Western journalists in Moscow . The Chronicle circulated in a hundred major Soviet cities.Alexander Podrabinek, \\"Our campaign for an amnesty\\", Znamya, April (No. 4), 2015 (in Russian). In March 1989, Alexander participated in the founding of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia. Career as a journalist Podrabinek started working as a journalist during the Gorbachev years. From 1987 to 2000 he was editor-in-chief of the weekly human right magazine Express Chronicle (¬´–≠–∫—Å–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å –•—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–∞¬ª). In 2000, he became editor-in- chief of the Prima information agency, which specialized in human right issues. In 2004, Alexander Podrabinek became involved in the distribution of Blowing up Russia: Terror from within, the expos√© written by Alexander Litvinenko and Yuri Felshtinsky. Unable to find a publisher in Russia, the authors printed an early draft in Latvia, intending to distribute it in Moscow. On 29 December 2003, however, units of the Russian Interior Ministry and the FSB seized 4,376 copies of the book purchased by Podrabinek's Prima information agency. The books had passed customs and were being driven by truck from Latvia to Moscow to be sold there. Podrabinek was summoned by the FSB for questioning on 28 January 2004, but he refused to answer their questions.–ì–æ—Å—Ç–∞–π–Ω—É –Ω–µ –≤—ã–¥–∞–ª by Orhan Cemal, Novaya Gazeta, 29 January 2004.–§–°–ë: –í –∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ \\"–§–°–ë –≤–∑—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é\\" —Ä–∞–∑–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∞ –≥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–π–Ω–∞, Grani.ru, 28 January 2004.–§–°–ë –∑–∞–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∞ —Ç–∏—Ä–∞–∂ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ \\"–§–°–ë –≤–∑—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é\\", Grani.ru, 29 December 2003. In certain articles for Novaya gazeta, and comments on Radio Liberty, Podrabinek expressed concern that the use of psychiatry for political repression was reviving in Russia, in the enforced hospitalization of Larisa Arap, for instance. In 2009, Podrabinek was targeted by the nationalist youth movement Nashi after writing on the Yezhednevny Zhurnal website about a Moscow eating place opposite the \\"Soviet\\" Hotel which had renamed itself the \\"Anti- Soviet\\" Restaurant and put up a sign using its popular nickname. Local officials said the title was offensive to \\"Soviet veterans and should be removed.\\"Pamfilova Won't Apologize to Nashi, The St. Petersburg Times (October 9, 2009) (In early 2014 new legislation enabled the Communications Oversight Agency (or Rozkomnadzor) to block the Yezhednevny Zhurnal and Kasparov.ru websites.) Since 2014, Podrabinek has been host of the \\"D√©j√† vu\\" programme on Radio Liberty and his articles have been published by the Institute of Modern Russia. Activism Podrabinek has been interviewed, talking about his past as a Soviet dissident, in two documentaries: They Chose Freedom (2005) and Parallels, Events, People (2013). His contributions, past and present, were acknowledged in 2015 by the award of the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom. Podrabinek remains active and vocal as an opposition figure today. In March 2006 Podrabinek was briefly arrested in Minsk for involvement in peaceful protests against the re-election of the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko for the third term. In 2008 he supported the campaign to gain the admission of Vladimir Bukovsky to the presidential elections. On 3 June 2008, he became a founding signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism. In March 2010 Alexander Podrabinek signed the online anti-Putin manifesto of the Russian opposition \\"Putin must go\\". On 25 September 2013, he held a protest in support of imprisoned Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot band. On 4 May 2016, Podrabinek published An Open Letter to the Prosecutor of Crimea. In October 2017 Podrabinek drafted and launched a petition, calling on Russia's citizens not to support the hypocrisy of the Russian authorities who, on the one hand, unveiled the massive Wall of Sorrow a monument in Moscow to the victims of political repression, and, on the other, were responsible for the re-appearance of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in post-Soviet Russia. The petition was signed by many former Soviet dissidents from Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, the USA and France.\\"Do not support their hypocrisy!\\", 30 October 2017.
