It is pitched in either F (quint bass) or G (quart bass) a fifth or fourth, respectively, below the bassoon. These instruments were used mostly in the 18th century and are remnants of the old quart bass dulcians. They were considered easier to make than the larger contrabassoon. A semi- contrabassoon was shaped like an oversized bassoon, between tall with a long descending bocal. Little literature exists that indicate that these instruments were used, although it is possible that they may have been used to some extent in military bands. No attempt to revive this instrument in the present day has been made. The great organist Charles Marie Widor in his book on orchestration expected that the semi-contra would be added to the orchestra‚Äôs roster. No instruments were ever constructed on his instigation. Widor's remarks come in light of the dismal state of the French contrabassoon in the late 19th century, which was generally replaced with a contrabass sarrusophone. Famous operetta composer Arthur Sullivan is said to have owned a semi-contra in F and included parts for it in some of his operettas. Aside from the Great (quart) bass dulcians, the only modern reproductions of historical semi-contras are being made by Guntram Wolf of Germany.

These are opposed to isozymes, which are enzymes that perform the same function, but which are coded by genes located at different loci. Alloenzymes are common biological enzymes that exhibit high levels of functional evolutionary conservation throughout specific phyla and kingdoms. They are used by phylogeneticists as molecular markers to gauge evolutionary histories and relationships between different species. This can be done because allozymes do not have the same structure. They can be separated by capillary electrophoresis. However, some species are monomorphic for many of their allozymes which would make it difficult for phylogeneticists to assess the evolutionary histories of these species.Parker, Patricia G. et al. (March 1998). \\"What Molecules Can Tell Us About Populations: Choosing and Using a Molecular Marker\\". Ecology 79 (2): 361‚Äì382. In these instances, phylogeneticists would have to use another method to determine the evolutionary history of a species. These enzymes generally perform very basic functions found commonly throughout all lifeforms, such as DNA polymerase, the enzyme that repairs and copies DNA. Significant changes in this enzyme reflect significant events in evolutionary history of organisms. As expected DNA polymerase shows relatively small differences in its amino acid sequence between phyla and even kingdoms. The key to choosing which alloenzyme to use in a comparison between multiple species is to choose one that is as variable as possible while still being present in all the organisms. By comparing the amino acid sequence of the enzyme in the species, more amino acid similarities should be seen in species that are more closely related, and fewer between those that are more distantly related. The less well conserved the enzyme is, the more amino acid differences will be present in even closely related species.

It employs a creative curriculum, integrating both academics and art. It runs from pre-primary through grade 12.  Beginnings  In 1993, parents of the Halifax Shambhala community were concerned with Nova Scotia's public school system and set out to create a school which would create a nurturing and delightful environment for learning. With this conceived, the school began as a private entity.http://www.shambhalaschool.org/about/about-school  Curriculum and learning styles  Although Shambhala School is not a religious school, the school does use eastern/Shambhala meditation techniques every day to encourage learning and expansion of the mind. For younger students (primary - grade 5) this might include movement and awareness activities. For the older grades (grade 6 - 12) this includes 5‚Äì10 minutes of simple yoga each morning and 10 minutes of Shambhala sitting meditation every morning and before dismissal. Usually on the morning returning from each major break (i.e., winter and March breaks) the entire upper school participates in an approximately hour-long yoga session followed by sitting meditation.  Extracurricular activities  Each year, the Upper Grades attend a camping trip in September to Kejimkujik National Park in South Central Nova Scotia. It is usually about a 3-day trip and includes bike trips, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, camp fires, swimming, large games of capture the flag/track down/manhunt, tenting, playing of musical instruments, and much more. The group usually consists of between 60-90 people and includes teachers, students and parents. The Group eats communally of 3 meals a day and smaller groups take turns cooking and cleaning. Many Students and Faculty members claim this is an excellent way to bring the school closer and creates a community. In addition to the \\"Keji\\" outing, each class attends a trip each year to Redtail Nature Camp. The Camp is located in Pictou County, Nova Scotia and has approximately of forested land. The Camp activities include much hiking, camp fires, nature/educational games, nature spotting, tracking, guided meditation, pseudo-Aboriginal rituals such as smudging and sweat lodge, swimming and much more. Every year, around Canadian Thanksgiving time, the school organizes the \\"Turkey Trot\\". This raises money for under-privileged families in the community to receive Turkeys and other foods for Thanksgiving. Due to the small population on a school based level, Shambhala and other Private schools (e.g. Sacred Heart School of Halifax) have teamed up to conduct dances. This is usually open to 6-9 grades and sometimes 10-12 respectively. Each student is allowed 1-2 guests from any school (even public).  Facilities  The Shambhala School is currently housed in the former Alexander Mckay School building in the Hydrostone area of Halifax. Built in 1917, the building withstood the Halifax Explosion. The school has three floors and a mezzanine including the basement area. The bottom floor has a small carpeted room sometimes used for music-now used for drama equipment, a large open space used for concerts, circles and other activities, restrooms, a utility room, a canteen room with a kitchenette and a large room formerly used for art and aikido, and now used for large gatherings. The basement also includes a gymnasium with hardwood flooring. The gym also has a stage used for concerts and plays. The mezzanine includes a number of classrooms (currently used for music and visual art) and a staff room. The music room includes a resident drum kit, keyboards, stereo and PA system. The art room includes, among the many mediums, a number of pottery wheels and a kiln. The first floor mainly houses the elementary classes as well as a preschool. The top floor houses the older grades. This includes many more classrooms, a kitchen/lunchroom (which doubles as a classroom in some cases).. There is also an outdoor classroom made of a sustainable material which was an exercise by architecture students from Dalhousie University. All grades use cubbies for storage which are on the sides of all classrooms.

An early experience of working alongside a senior health visitor was crucial, for she then determined on a career in the community. She saw how important and fulfilling it could be, although it was a choice that lacked the glamour of hospital specialties. However she had energy, a sense of humour, humility and a willingness to learn, the wisdom and irreverence of ‚Äòhow things are done‚Äô to make her own way up the hierarchy, but also to improve the importance of nursing in the community, and its status and recognition at the highest levels, nationally and internationally. Never one to seek self-publicity, her work has been recognised by nurse leaders and politicians internationally. In her own career she became in succession the primary care adviser to the Royal College of Nursing, the Chief Nurse/Director of Quality at Ealing Health Authority, and the Regional Director of Nursing and Director of Quality at the South East Thames Regional Health Authority. She was seconded to the Department of Health which included working part-time on London‚Äôs health care reforms. She then moved to the World Health Organization subsequently becoming the Regional Adviser on Nursing and Midwifery for Europe. Whilst at WHO she also played a key role in the Organisations work on health system reform. Her energy, competence and enthusiasm made her many friends not only in nursing but in management and among doctors, but also inevitably some enemies among nursing colleagues. She had no easy ride. More important than the posts she held were the contributions she made to her discipline, which have had a lasting impact. By 1986 she had developed the concepts of nurse prescribing and quality circles. She had realised the contribution that nurses practitioners could make to primary care developing a training programme whilst at the RCN. Family doctors were not her natural allies, but she got them on her side. There are penalties that come with being a pioneer, but she put her ideas into practice in Ealing and South East Thames. Her concepts were submitted through the RCN to the Cumberlege Review and influenced the final Report in 1987. She spent ten years in Copenhagen with the WHO where her ability to develop effective relationships helped the introduction of the principles that she cherished, and resulted in a European Strategy for Nursing and Midwifery Education as well as a research initiative on the potential of a role for family health nurses. She was responsible for organising the first ever WHO European Ministerial conference on Nursing. A serious physical illness then intervened and made early retirement essential. She made a good recovery and the many honours and awards that she received are evidence of the wide respect in which she is held. Most important of all, however, is the extent to which her younger colleagues have found her an inspiration. During 2015/6 she undertook a degree at the University of Limerick under Professor Joseph O'Connor in Creative Writing, achieving her Masters. Subsequently, in 2018, on the 70th anniversary of the NHS, the Nursing Standard named her as among the 70 most influential nurses who had helped to shape the NHS.

He is principally remembered as an assiduous antiquary and student of British church architecture. He was a brother-in-law of the Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone.  Background and education  Hawarden Castle Stephen Glynne was born on 22 September 1807, the son of Sir Stephen Glynne, 8th Baronet, and Hon. Mary Griffin, second daughter of the 2nd Baron Braybrooke. His father died on 5 March 1815, aged 35, and so at the age of seven Stephen inherited both the baronetcy and the family estates, including Hawarden Castle in Flintshire. He was educated at Eton, where he displayed a \\"singular indisposition to mix or associate even with his school fellows\\", although his intellect and prodigious memory were remarked on.Butler 2013, p. 93. He went on to study at Christ Church, Oxford, but was too indolent to flourish, and graduated with a third class degree in Classics.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, pp. 153‚Äì4. In 1839 his sister Catherine married William Ewart Gladstone. Gladstone's father, Sir John Gladstone, helped rescue Glynne from near bankruptcy after the failure of Oak Farm brick and iron works near Stourbridge, of which Glynne was part-owner.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, pp. 158‚Äì61, 165‚Äì6. He was able to resume occupancy of Hawarden only by selling part of the estate, and agreeing to share the castle with William and Catherine. Politics Glynne served as Member of Parliament for Flint Boroughs from 1832Historical list of MPs: F , at Leigh Rayment's Peerage Pages to 1837, and for Flintshire from 1837 to 1841 and 1842 to 1847. He was also High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1831, and Lord Lieutenant of Flintshire from 1845 to 1871. He sat in the Conservative interest, and, although he remained on excellent terms with Gladstone throughout his life, he shared few of Gladstone's Liberal ideals.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, pp.157‚Äì8. He was an extremely shy individual who found public speaking an ordeal, and he never spoke in Parliament. During the 1841 election campaign, Glynne found himself obliged to start libel proceedings against the Chester Chronicle for having published allegations of homosexuality against him. The newspaper was eventually forced to offer an apology.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, pp. 155‚Äì7. Gladstone frequently consulted Glynne on ecclesiastical matters, including, for example the appointment of a Welsh- speaking bishop, Joshua Hughes, to the diocese of St Asaph in 1870.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, pp. 161‚Äì2. Gladstone later wrote that Glynne's memory \\"was on the whole decidedly the most remarkable known to me of the generation and country\\". Antiquarianism Glynne's real interests were not in politics, but in music and, more particularly, in church architecture. He was a committee member, later an honorary secretary, and eventually a vice-president of the Ecclesiological Society; and he helped edit one of the society's tracts, the Hand-Book of English Ecclesiology, published in 1847.Butler 2013, p. 94. He served as first President (1847‚Äì49) of the Cambrian Archaeological Association; and as chairman (1852‚Äì74) of the Architectural Section of the Archaeological Institute, afterwards the Royal Archaeological Institute.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, p. 165.Butler 2011, p. 6. His remarkable memory in architectural and antiquarian matters was often the subject of comment. Archdeacon D. R. Thomas wrote: \\"Those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance will remember how complete and accurate were the details that he could so readily call to mind, and that an extraordinary memory underlay his quiet and unassuming manner.\\" In the course of his life Glynne probably visited over 5500 churches (the precise figure is debated), making detailed notes on their architectural details and fittings: this amounted to over half the surviving medieval churches in England, and well over half in Wales.Butler 2007, p. 5.Butler 2013, p. 95. He spent several months of each year on this activity, travelling by rail, horse- drawn transport, boat and on foot, and staying at hotels, inns and guest houses.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, p. 164.Butler 2011, pp. 11‚Äì12. In keeping with the principles of the Ecclesiological Society and the Oxford Movement, he was a devotee of the Gothic style of architecture, and was damning of 18th-century classicism, and of fittings such as box pews and galleries. His manuscript notes, dating from 1824 until a few days before his death, cover churches in England, Wales and the Channel Islands, and a few in Scotland and Ireland. Prior to 1840, they are generally undated: from that point onwards, he usually dated each visit precisely. He kept up to date with current trends in ecclesiology: thus, he used the stylistic classifications devised by Thomas Rickman (Norman, Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular) until about 1842; then switched to the Ecclesiological Society's preferred terms (First Pointed, Middle Pointed, and Third Pointed) until 1851; but reverted to Rickman's terminology from 1852.Butler 2007, p. 10.Butler 2011, pp. 13‚Äì14. His notes are greatly valued by architectural historians, as they frequently provide a brief but informed record of the buildings as they were before Victorian restorations and re-orderings. Glynne often revisited the churches on two or three occasions at several years remove, and so the notes also provide a record of changes over time. Lawrence Butler considers that \\"in some ways he was the precursor of the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments in terms of ordering his descriptions\\".Butler 2011, p. 8. Glynne also toured widely in Europe and Turkey, keeping detailed diaries, but here he showed considerably less insight, and his notes are considered to be of far less interest than his British material.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, p. 163. Glynne's tomb in St Deiniol's Church, Hawarden Death Glynne collapsed and died outside Bishopsgate railway station, London, on 17 June 1874 after visiting churches in Essex and Suffolk.Veysey 1981‚Äì2, pp. 165‚Äì6.Butler 2007, p. 4. He was buried in St Deiniol's Church, Hawarden, where he is commemorated by a recumbent effigy by Matthew Noble in a tomb recess designed by John Douglas. He never married, and the baronetcy became extinct on his death. The Hawarden estate and castle was left to his nephew William Henry Gladstone, the eldest son of William and Catherine. Notebooks Glynne's church notes, in 106 volumes, are now housed at Gladstone's Library (formerly St Deiniol's Library), Hawarden; but are made available to researchers through Flintshire Record Office. A single notebook of a six-week tour made in 1824 is in the National Library of Wales. Glynne generally made his notes on the right-hand pages of his notebooks, reserving the left-hand pages for later addenda and sketches.Butler 2011, pp. 19‚Äì20. His original manuscript notes for Kent, which were published by W. H. Gladstone in 1877, are believed to have been destroyed. Published editions In the years 1845‚Äì8, Glynne published 72 of his descriptions of churches anonymously in The Ecclesiologist (journal of the Ecclesiological Society). Otherwise, his notes remained unpublished during his lifetime. Following his death, his nephew W. H.

Rochelle Sobel, president and founder of ASIRT, created the organization in 1995, in response to her son Aron's death in a bus crash in Turkey. ASIRT helped found the US Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety, and is an internationally influential and active organization. Working under the premise that road crashes are predictable and preventable, ASIRT serves the global community in a variety of ways to help reduce injuries and deaths and the associated social and economic impacts that result from them. ASIRT serves as a resource to governments, corporations, travel organizations, guidebooks, study abroad programs, health/travel clinics and non-governmental organizations. ASIRT also helps to foster the development of new road safety organizations in other countries.  Mission  ASIRT's mission is to improve the safety of travelers on the roads through education, advocacy and the creation and support of exemplary, sustainable road safety programs and partnerships worldwide.  Organization  ASIRT's headquarters are in Potomac, Maryland; however, ASIRT works nationally, in the U.S., and globally through the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC), the Global Alliance of NGOs for Road Safety, and many other organizations.  Political achievements and goals  Working with Members of U.S. Congress: Alongside the Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety, ASIRT works to increase awareness of U.S. legislators about the crisis in global road safety. This bi-partisan caucus has spearheaded the passing of many resolutions, including H. Con. Res. 87. This resolution solidified the United States' support for the United Nation's resolution for a World Remembrance Day for Road Crash Victims and their Families. Working with Members of the U.S. State Department: ASIRT encourages State Department efforts on road safety by: * Providing information to American travelers on the risks of road travel abroad through expanded road safety sections of Consular Information Sheets, and Embassy and State Department websites * Collecting and disseminating road fatality statistics of U.S. citizens abroad by country and making information available on the U.S. State Department website. * Facilitating the creation of partnerships between ASIRT and local organizations throughout the world, especially countries where the needs appear the greatest. Working with the international community: ASIRT is a leader in the global road safety community, informing and cooperating with the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. and the World Bank. *ASIRT-Kenya: ASIRT's first global chapter works to reduce fatalities and injuries among passengers of Matatus (local privately owned transportation vehicles) by offering driver training, emergency medical training for health professionals and child safety seat distribution. ASIRT- Kenya currently works to reduce speed around school zones thereby protecting the lives of children going to and from school.  Citizens traveling abroad  ASIRT provides road safety information to tourists, students and corporate travelers. *Road Safety Reviews (RSRs): ASIRT's user-friendly reports on over 100 countries describing general road conditions; frequent road crash sites; national road safety statistics; driver behaviors; driving regulation; urban, rural, night, and seasonal travel precautions; pedestrian, passenger and cycle safety tips; quality and availability of emergency medical care, emergency procedures and contact information. *A Global Road Safety Toolbox for the Study Abroad Community: a manual that helps study-abroad professionals to plan safe itineraries and students to make safe, informed travel choices while studying abroad. *Training Seminars and webinars: ASIRT provides workshops and webinars that incorporate road safety education training, as well as student pre-departure campus and on-site orientations. Modules are tailored to the specific needs of the participants.  Publications and media  Faces Behind the Figures: A compilation of interviews of road crash victims and their families to memorialize and inspire road safety choices that save lives.

The documentary is named one of the best five documentaries of the year 2005 by Israeli Film Academy and appeared in many film festivals, including HOTDOCS-Toronto, the Leeds International Film Festival, the Cork Film Festival, and Inside Out Film and Video Festival. Summary David is the youngest of ten siblings in a close-knit Moroccan-Israeli family. While the other nine have all extended the family tree by marrying and having children, David, at twenty-nine, still hasn't brought home a girlfriend, which inspires his family's constant nagging. The confessional film follows David as he takes small steps, gathering courage, and hoping to receive acceptance from his family. Throughout the film the importance of marriage is made clear. In one scene David's mother is shown lighting candles as she prays for her children in a hushed tone: \\"save them from bombing accidents; let them all marry and have children.\\" Set in Tel Aviv, Say Amen explores the varying ideologies regarding homosexuality that are present in Israel today. Many religions interpret that the book of Leviticus from the Bible as describing homosexuality as an \\"abomination\\" that is punishable by death, although this has been debated for quite some time. Today there is a growing sympathy within Judaism towards homosexuals, spurred by some people's beliefs that homosexuality is not a chosen act of sin. Despite these progressive attitudes, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct and views it with condescension and disgust. David is brave enough to share his struggles, but, for the most part, he's still too shy to step out from behind the camera. His family is irritated by his constant filming, but it works to the documentary's advantage. By turning the lens away from himself, David completely avoids self-indulgent emotionality, maintaining a sense of objectivity. This technique also allows the viewer to see the world through his eyes. The frustrated looks, the sad sighs, and the lectures are all addressed to the camera, making it easy for the viewer to imagine how David must feel. Say Amen impresses the importance of family. In between their serious conversations, the documentary captures ordinary moments the Deri family spends together. The entire Dari extended family gathers to celebrate a grandchild's birthday, David dances with his mother in the kitchen, and little kids climb all over the couch where their mother is sitting and yawning. The comfort is apparent, making David's isolating secret all the more painful.

John Browning's 1911 .45 ACP has been used for many cartridges over the past century. In every instance the cartridge used a bullet with a diameter that was the same or smaller than the original .451\\". Both the Desert Eagle and the LAR Grizzly have been offered in cartridges of .50 caliber. Both are large cartridges requiring a large, heavy pistol. The Model No. 1 is basically an M1911 with external dimensions the same as a standard 1911, however it fires a .50 GI round. Although the Model No. 1 is the same size externally, the slide will not fit on a standard 1911 frame as other modifications have been made to accept the .50 GI barrel and slide. However, it is possible to convert the Model No. 1 to .45 ACP, as a .45 ACP conversion unit is available for the .50 GI frame. The .50 GI is not in the magnum class and works at the same pressures as the .45 ACP. The cartridge uses the same rim size as the .45 ACP and a .45 shell holder can be used for reloading. This new brass is made by Starline Brass and is slightly shorter than a standard .45 ACP. The magazine well in the grip frame has thinner walls than a standard M1911 to accommodate the .50 GI's wider magazine, and the flame feed ramp is contoured with a more open radius for the larger-diameter .50-caliber bullet. Both are machined from heat-treated forgings, and the Model No. 1's hammer and sear are machined from tool steel. Model No. 2 In 2006, Guncrafter Industries introduced its 1911 Model No. 2, which sports a full length light rail/dust cover and is chambered for the .50 GI cartridge. Both the M1 and the M2 can be fitted with Guncrafter Industries' .45 ACP conversion unit, the .45 ACP magazines hold 8+1 rounds. Model No. 3 Guncrafter Industries introduced a smaller version of Model No. 1 in 2010. The Model No. 3 is a Colt Commander-sized 1911 also chambered for .50 GI, with a shorter barrel but with a full-length grip. The M3 can also be fitted with a model-specific version of the company's .45 ACP conversion unit. Like its bigger siblings, the M3 magazines hold 7+1 rounds of .50 GI and 8+1 rounds of .45 ACP.

Corporation is a diversified financial services corporation based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the holding company for its largest subsidiary, First National Bank. As of July 17, 2020, FNB has total assets of nearly $38 billion. FNB's market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Washington, D.C.; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina with approximately 350 offices. The company has nearly 4,300 employees. History First National Bank was founded in Mercer County, Pennsylvania in 1864 under the name The First National Bank of West Greenville and operated out of the house of then Bank President, Samuel P. Johnston, in Greenville, Pennsylvania. The bank remained a fixture in Mercer County through World War I, the Great Depression and World War II. In 1946, bank assets totaled approximately $2 million and the bank was still housed in one office. FNB Corporation branches, April 2015 Across the next three decades, the bank continued to grow, and in 1974, F.N.B. Corporation was established as a financial services holding company for a growing family of business entities which included the bank, under the name The First National Bank of Mercer County and with an asset size of $120 million, and Regency Finance Company. Along with completing the acquisition of ten branch offices from First National Bank of Pennsylvania in July 1992, First National Bank of Mercer County acquired the name and formally changed its name to the current First National Bank of Pennsylvania. Around this time, the First National Bank of Western Pennsylvania in nearby New Castle changed its name to First Western Bank to avoid confusion; that bank is now part of Huntington Bancshares after several other mergers. As of 2003, the company had grown to assets of $4.6 billion with more than 125 banking offices and began trading common shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúFNB.‚Äù Today, it is included in Standard & Poor‚Äôs MidCap 400 Index with the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Regional Banks Sub-Industry Index.

Hogan made his first appearance for the team during the 2004 championship and has become a regular player over the last few seasons. During that time he has won seven All-Ireland winners' medals, eight Leinster winners' medals, six National League winners' medals and two All-Star award. In 2011 Hogan captained the team to the All-Ireland title. At club level Hogan is a double Leinster medalist with O'Loughlin Gaels. In addition to this he has also won three county championship winners' medals. Playing career=Club Hogan plays his club hurling with the O'Loughlin Gaels club in Kilkenny city and has enjoyed much success. In 2001 Hogan won his first county championship winners' medal following a 1‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì6 defeat of Graigue-Ballycallan. Not only was it Hogan's first club championship but it was O'Loughlin Gaels' first ever. Two years later in 2003 Hogan won a second county championship winners' medal following a defeat of Young Irelands after a draw and a replay. He later collected a first Leinster club winners' medal following a 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of double All-Ireland champions Birr. After a hiatus of seven years and a defeat in the 2006 championship decider, O'Loughlin Gaels reached the top of the pile once again in 2010 following a 0‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì11 defeat of Carrickshock. It was Hogan's third county championship winners' medal. O'Loughlin Gaels later secured a second Leinster club title following a 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì8 defeat of Oulart-the-Ballagh. Hogan's side subsequently qualified for an All-Ireland final showdown with Clarinbridge. A dominant second-half display gave Clarinbridge a 2‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì12 victory. Inter-county Hogan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene when he joined the Kilkenny senior team in 2004. He made his championship debut at left wing-back in a Leinster semi- final defeat by Wexford. That defeat ended Hogan's involvement as a member of the starting fifteen for the rest of the season, and Kilkenny subsequently failed to capture a third All-Ireland title. The next two seasons saw Hogan remain with the Kilkenny senior team, albeit as a fringe player. He came on as a substitute in the All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Galway in 2005 and at the same stage against Clare in 2006, but played no part in Kilkenny's subsequent All-Ireland final defeat of Cork. In 2007 Hogan replaced John Tennyson to become Kilkenny's first-choice centre-back. He won his first Leinster winners' medal on the field of play following a 2‚Äì24 to 1‚Äì12 demolition of Wexford. He subsequently lined out in his first All-Ireland final, with Limerick providing the opposition. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin combining to score two goals within the first ten minutes, eventually culminating in a 2‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì15 victory. It was Hogan's first All- Ireland winners' medal on the field of play. Hogan retained his place at centre-back in 2008, as Kilkenny launched an all-out attack in an attempt to capture a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. He collected a second Leinster winners' medal after a 5‚Äì21 to 0‚Äì17 defeat of Wexford in the provincial final, before later lining out in his second All-Ireland decider. Waterford provided the opposition, however, Kilkenny recorded an enormous 3‚Äì30 to 1‚Äì13 victory. It was a second All-Ireland winners' medal for Hogan. In 2009 Hogan won his third National Hurling League winners' medal following a thrilling 4‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì26 defeat of Tipperary. The game was not without incident as Hogan was forced to leave the field with a suspected collarbone injury. As a result of this he missed the provincial campaign, however, he returned in time for Kilkenny's All-Ireland semi-final defeat of Waterford. The subsequent All- Ireland final was a repeat of the National League final with Kilkenny taking on Tipperary. For much of the match it looked as if Tipp would pull off a shock and deny 'the Cats' a record-equaling four-in-a-row. Two quick goals in the space of a minute, one from a penalty by Henry Shefflin, sealed a 2‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì23 victory. It was the fourth time in-a-row that the famed Liam MacCarthy Cup was presented to a Kilkenny team while Hogan collected his third All- Ireland winners' medal. Hogan added a third Leinster winners' medal to his collection in 2010 following a 1‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì12 defeat of new provincial rivals Galway. In the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final defeat of Cork, Hogan sustained an injury that ruled him out of the All-Ireland final showdown with Tipperary. Kilkenny faced a number of other injuries going into that game and failed in their 'drive for five' as Tipp won by 4‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì18. In 2011 Hogan was appointed captain of the Kilkenny senior hurling team for the year. 'The Cats' continued their provincial dominance with Hogan winning a fourth Leinster winners' medal following a defeat of Dublin. Kilkenny later qualified for a sixth consecutive All-Ireland final. For the third year in succession Hogan's side faced Tipperary, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì16 victory. It was Hogan's fourth All-Ireland winners' medal while he also had the honour of collecting the MacCarthy Cup as captain. 2012 saw Hogan begin the year by picking up another National League medal following 3‚Äì21 to 0‚Äì16 trouncing of Cork. After losing the Leinster final to GAlway, both sides subsequently met in the All-Ireland decider and Galway nearly pulled off a victory courtesy of goals from Joe Canning and Niall Burke. A 2‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì19 draw was the result, a first drawn All-Ireland final in over half a century. The replay saw Kilkenny claim a 3‚Äì22 to 3‚Äì11 victory, with Hogan picking up a fifth All-Ireland winners' medal. 2013 saw the end of an era with Kilkenny not reaching the All-Ireland Semi- final for the first time since 1996. Kilkenny lost to Cork in the quarter- final. In 2014 Hogan was in and out of the starting line-up for much of the year. His good performances when he came in got him into the starting line-up for the drawn All-Ireland Final. He was a cause of controversy in the 70th minute when he gave away a suspect free about 97-metre out from the Tipperary goal. Many people thought if anything Hogan should have been awarded the free. However, John 'Bubbles' O' Dwyer's free was wide after Hawk-Eye was called in to make the decision. The miss forced a replay for the 3rd consecutive year. Hogan was not picked to start the replayed game when Kieran Joyce came in and won the man-of-the-match award. Kilkenny won the game and Hogan claimed his seventh All-Ireland medal. Hogan announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 26 November 2014. Inter-provincial Hogan also had the honour of lining out for Leinster in the Interprovincial Championship. He secured a winners' medal in this competition in 2012 following a 2‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì15 defeat of Connacht.

J.\\" Ryan (born 15 June 1977) is an Irish hurler who played as a goalkeeper for the Kilkenny senior team. Born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, Ryan first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Thurles CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior panel during the 1999 championship. Ryan later became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won three All- Ireland medals, four Leinster medals and two National League medals on the field of play. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Ryan won two Railway Cup medals. At club level Ryan continues to play with Fenians. Ryan's father, also P. J. Ryan, won three All-Ireland medals as reserve goalkeeper to Noel Skehan between 1974 and 1979. Throughout his career Ryan made 18 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 18 January 2012. Playing career=Club Ryan plays his club hurling with the Fenians club in Johnstown and enjoyed much success during his underage career. In 1995 he won a championship medal in the minor \\"B\\" grade following a narrow 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì13 defeat of John Locke's. Two years later in 1997 Ryan was a key member of the club's under-21 team. He won a championship medal in the \\"B\\" grade once again, following a 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì2 trouncing of Piltown. Minor and under-21 Ryan first played for Kilkenny in 1995 when he joined the minor side. He won his first Leinster medal that year following a 4‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against old rivals Cork, with Ryan lining out in goal. The game turned into a rout as Cork won easily by 2‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì2. In 1998 Ryan was a key member of the Kilkenny under-21 team. A 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of Dublin in the provincial decider gave him his sole Leinster medal in that grade. SeniorBeginnings= In 1999 Ryan first linked up with the Kilkenny senior team. In the week leading up to the All-Ireland final with Cork, reserve goalkeeper Martin Carey broke his finger and had to withdraw. Ryan was quickly drafted onto the panel, however, he remained on the bench for Cork's narrow 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12 victory. =Reserve goalkeeper= Ryan was off and on the panel over the next few years and remained as third-choice goalkeeper, before taking over as second to James McGarry in 2002. That year he was an unused substitute as Kilkenny made a clean sweep by claiming the National League, Leinster and All-Ireland titles. In 2003 Ryan won his first league medal on the field of play as Kilkenny came back from eight points down to secure a stunning 5‚Äì14 to 5‚Äì13 extra-time defeat of Tipperary. On 7 June 2003 Ryan made his senior championship debut in a 3‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì10 Leinster semi-final defeat of Dublin. He was dropped to the substitutes' bench for all subsequent games, as Kilkenny went on to retain the Leinster and All-Ireland crowns. Ryan remained as an unused substitute over the next three years, but collected another two league medals, two Leinster medals and an All-Ireland medal. =First-choice goalkeeper= In 2007 Ryan took over as Kilkenny's first- choice goalkeeper. That year he won his first Leinster medal on the field of play as Kilkenny asserted their provincial dominance and defeated Wexford by 2‚Äì24 to 1‚Äì12. On 2 September 2007 Kilkenny faced defeated Munster finalists and surprise All-Ireland semi-final winners Limerick in the championship decider. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes to set the tone. Limerick launched a second-half comeback, however, \\"the Cats\\" were too powerful and cruised to a 2‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì15 victory. It was Ryan's first All- Ireland medal on the field of play. Kilkenny secured the Leinster crown again in 2008, with Ryan collecting a second successive winners' medal following a 5‚Äì21 to 0‚Äì17 drubbing of Wexford. On 8 September 2008 Kilkenny faced Waterford in the All-Ireland decider for the first time in forty-five years. In a disappointingly one-sided final, Kilkenny produced a near perfect seventy minutes as Waterford endured a nightmare afternoon. A 23-point winning margin, 3‚Äì24 from play, only two wides in the entire match and eight scorers in all with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin leading the way in a 3‚Äì30 to 1‚Äì13 victory. It was Ryan's second All-Ireland medal. Ryan collected a second league medal on the field in 2009, as Kilkenny beat Tipperary by 2‚Äì26 to 4‚Äì17 with a thrilling extra-time victory. He later won a third successive Leinster medal as new challengers Dublin were bested by 2‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì18. On 6 September Kilkenny were poised to become the second team ever in the history of hurling to win four successive All-Ireland championships when they faced Tipperary in the decider. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford, together with a series of magnificent saves from Ryan, finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì23 victory. Ryan had collected his third All-Ireland medal while he was also named man of the match. He later collected an All-Star. =Decline= In 2010 Kilkenny defeated Galway in an eagerly-anticipated but ultimately disappointing provincial decider. A 1‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì12 victory gave Ryan a fourth consecutive Leinster medal. The drive for a fifth successive All- Ireland crown reached a head on 5 September 2010, when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. \\"The Cats\\" lost talisman Henry Shefflin due to injury, while Tipperary's Lar Corbett ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals as Ryan's side fell to a 4‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì18 defeat. Ryan was dropped from the starting fifteen in 2011, however, he collected further Leinster and All- Ireland medals as a non-playing substitute as Kilkenny dominated the championship once again. Inter-provincial In 2006 Walsh was goalkeeper on the Leinster team that faced Munster in the inter-provincial final. Richie Power top-scored with nine points as Leinster secured a 1‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì12 victory. It was Ryan's first Railway Cup medal. Leinster made it two-in-a-row in 2009, with Ryan collecting his second winner's medal as Leinster defeated Connacht by 3‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì17.

History The 17th Operational Weather Squadron was activated as the 17th Weather Squadron on September 18, 1942, at McClellan Field, California. The squadron shortly thereafter relocated to Auckland, New Zealand, where it was assigned to U.S. Army Forces in the South Pacific Area. In January 1943 the 17th relocated to Noumea, New Caledonia. It was reassigned to Thirteenth Air Force on July 1, 1943, but returned to the control of U.S. Army Forces in the South Pacific Area on December 20, 1943. The squadron was assigned to Army Air Forces, Pacific Ocean Area on August 1, 1944, but reassigned to the 1st Provisional Weather Group on September 4. In November 1944, the 17th moved to Hickam Field, Hawaii, where it was disbanded on February 10, 1945. The 17th was again activated on January 15, 1970, at Travis Air Force Base, California, as part of the 7th Weather Wing. It was inactivated on June 30, 1972. The squadron was activated once again on April 1, 1980, at Travis. It was inactivated on September 30, 1991, as part of the divestiture of Air Weather Service. The 17th was redesignated the 17th Operational Weather Squadron on October 12, 2000, and activated on October 27, 2000, at Hickam, where it was assigned to the 502nd Air Operations Group. The 17th began operating alongside the Navy (Joint Typhoon Warning Center Detachment) in March 2010. Awards > Service Streamers. World War II Asiatic-Pacific Theater.

With the arrival of the Austrougars in the Tuzla area, the opportunity for expanding industrial capacities is being used, and this extraordinary facility is being built and which has been operating in the same place since 1884 when it was founded and it is among the 3 oldest breweries in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Over the years of its existence, it has changed its owners several times, but the tradition and the recipe for beer production has remained the same. The brewery has a respectable brand, and one of the longest in brewing, named Tuzlanski pilsner. With this tradition of beer production and natural Stupar water obtained from the Konjuh mountain, and water supply system built in the same period, Tuzla beer has retained the same quality from the very beginning. alt=Pivara Tuzla Throughout history, many types of beer were produced in Tuzla Brewery: Black, Torg, Winter, Yellow, Rudarski dukat and Tuzlanski pilsner, and today is one of the few breweries outside the Czech Republic that produces beer according to the traditional Czech recipe of pilsener. Tuzla Brewery also owns a line of supplementary product programs installed at the end of the nineties, which is used for the production of soft drinks and mineral water in PET bottles and cans. All products are produced under a strict quality control regime, using new technologies for the prevention of harmful effects on the environment, as well as quality assurance measures for their products that guarantee the application of applicable standards, legal requirements and basic principles of the HACCP system and environmental management requirements. Tuzla Brewery ;Brands Today, Pivara Tuzla d.d. in its assortment offers the following products: \\\\- Tuzlanski pilsner (natural premium beer according to Czech technology) \\\\- Erster beer (natural beer according to German technology) \\\\- Crno Premium beer (natural dark beer) \\\\- Radler Premium beer (radler beer with lemon flavor) \\\\- Tuzlanski kiseljak (natural mineral water rich in magnesium) \\\\- Panonska Ledena (soft carbonated juices: Cola, Orange, Lemon) \\\\- Laganese (apple juice) \\\\- Fenix (energy drink) TUZLANSKI PILSNER Tuzlanski pilsner is the oldest brand of Tuzla Brewery, produced in a very demanding and old recipe, in a completely natural way. This characteristic must be especially emphasized as many present breweries, especially those owned by large corporations, produce beer that is not nearly as close to traditional and natural. Pilsener is a type of beer that requires higher amounts of raw materials and longer aging. Also, in the brew world, there is a claim that all lager beer are actually only a pale copy of the pilsener, and it says everything about pilsener as a kind of beer. Tuzlanski pilsner is a lightly laid beer made from high quality raw materials according to the traditional low-boiling process, which gives it the full taste of \\"lager\\" beer, pleasant bitterness, stable foam, pleasant smell and light yellow color. The beer is recognizable by its driedness, with a CO‚ÇÇ content up to 5.2 g / l, with an ideal content of the extract of 11.2 ¬∞ B, and alcohol 4.7%. ERSTER BEER The exceptional type of light beer is made from quality raw materials, low boiling technology with extract content of 10.2 ¬∞ B. With alcohol content up to 4.3%. Erster beer is recognized by its taste and drinkable content with CO¬≤ content up to 4.3gr / l. and was obtained using the traditional German beer production technology and it contains an appropriate nutritional value, as well as the presence of vitamins. Erster beer is a typical German \\"golden lager\\", with characteristic of golden yellow color. It has a well-balanced fullness of taste with a more pronounced malleable accent. It is a German variant of the Czech Pils characteristic of Bavaria and Munich and in contrast with Pils, has a fuller taste, more pronounced malnutrition and bitterness. PREMIUM CRNO PIVO The Dark Beer Recipe is very demanding and requires its production to use fully natural and carefully selected hop raw materials and with even three types of malt barley that give it a distinctive natural color and taste. This beer is a real refreshment for the quality drinks connoisseur, and the prefix Premium is added with reason. Dark beer is known for being consumed by true beer lovers who need the daily consumption of the best that can be obtained. Premium Crno pivo (beer) is part of a special lager beer, and it is characterized by a unique sweet taste and strong bitterness with an alcohol content of 4.7%. PREMIUM RADLER LEMON Premium Radler was begun to produce according to special market demands, with great and good cooperation with eminent distributors from Germany who hold 70% of the radler market. This beer was made with excellent Stupar water from Konjuh mountain which makes our top quality beer. The entire production is regularly controlled in the modern equipped laboratories of the Tuzla Brewery. All of these characteristics have been identified by consumers themselves, which can be seen by sale results. TUZLANSKI KISELJAK Tuzlanski kiseljak is a natural mineral water rich in magnesium and other minerals (zinc, calcium, potassium) and microelements (copper, zinc, strontium, molybdenum, vanadium, selenium). Even if we have those artificial compensation in tablets, the most favorable way of magnesium use is the daily consumption of mineral water rich in hydrocarbons. How important is the magnesium composition in our mineral water, the moderate amount of sodium (Na) and the absence of sulphate or \\"bitter salt\\" known as a strong purgative is very important, which gives the Tuzlanski kiseljak good drip. This feature also contributes to the fact that mixing Tuzlanski kiseljak with wine is not so good as mixing with fruit juices. It is necessary to emphasize that Tuzlanski kiseljak is a mineral water that is located on the world top according to its content of natural magnesium (www.mineralwaters.org), and it is also unique in the world because of its hydrocarbon form. PANONSKA LEDENA Refreshing non-alcoholic drinks from natural extracts and fruit bases, Panonska Ledena (Orange, Lemon and Cola) are the ideal solution for refreshment at any time. Each of the three flavors of the Panonska Ledena are result of the long-standing experience of the Tuzla Brewery in the production of carbonated soft drinks. All juices are prepared according to the original recipe and without additional sweetener, which makes them accessible consuming for children, and the entire production takes place under the strict control regime of modern Tuzla brewery laboratories. LAGANESE Laganese is a drink that will give your body an inevitable sense of pleasure and freshness. This is a light carbonated juice with apple flavor. This kind of drinks are traditionally produced and used throughout Germany and other countries of Europe and are known as Apfelschorle. With high quality content with 10% of fruit, gives a unique and sophisticated taste for complete refreshment with a pleasant touch of traditional and natural. FENIX ENERGY DRINK Fenix energy drink, refreshment that offers an extra dose of energy and inspiration for everyday ambitions and challenges. Considering that it is an energy drink of top quality, produced by demanding licensed recipes and which with its smooth flavor captures everything. We believe that everyone who tries this will recognize its excellence and specialty.

Produced by Famous Studios, the cartoon was originally released to theaters by Paramount Pictures on March 26, 1943.  Plot  Deep in the African jungle, a tribe of aboriginal warriors are having a celebration. Their leader is a tall man in a white cloak. Secretly, he's a Nazi commander, and the tribe's sacred temple is actually an underground Nazi outpost. The Nazis eagerly await the arrival of an American convoy with information about an Allied attack. When a military plane flies overhead, the Nazis shoot it down. The commander sends the warriors to search for survivors. At the wreck site, the mortally wounded Lieutenant hands his secret documents to the crew's only survivor, Lois Lane. He tells her to destroy the documents. Then he dies. Lois is caught by the natives and tied up, but frees herself, runs into the jungle and avoids capture long enough to hide the documents under a rock. She is then captured and brought back to the temple for interrogation where she is tied to a chair. When she refuses to talk, the commander orders the warriors to burn her at the stake. Meanwhile, Clark Kent and another pilot are flying out to meet with Lois' convoy. They spot the wrecked plane not far from the aboriginal village. Clark parachutes down to investigate. Once on the ground, he changes into Superman. He flies to the village. Lois is already being burned at the stake with the commander watching her. Just then, one of the warriors approaches the commander and gives him a set of papers. It's the documents Lois hid in the woods. Overjoyed with success, the commander has his men radio headquarters and send the Nazi U-boats to attack the Allied fleet. Superman arrives and saves Lois from burning to death. When the warriors see a man who can walk through fire, they run in terror. The Nazi soldiers futilely fight back against Superman. Meanwhile, Lois takes a spare white cloak and sneaks in to use the radio. The commander catches her but before he can do anything to stop her, Superman comes to her rescue. She sends a message to the American headquarters, warning them about the Nazi subs. Out at sea, the Nazi subs prepare to decimate the Allied fleet. Before they can attack, they are bombed by a squadron of Allied B-26 bombers sent in response to Lois' warnings. The subs are destroyed, and the Allied fleet is saved. Meanwhile, in Berlin during a thunderstorm, Adolf Hitler listens to a newsflash about the defeat of his U-boat force. Angered, he flips a switch on the radio and hangs his head in frustration as the tune Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition is heard.

Parkhe was known to have a good study of Vedic literature. He was known to be a strong follower of Param Sadguru Shree Gajanan Maharaj of Shivpuri, Akkalkot and believer in his teachings of Agnihotra. He was involved in the worldwide propagation of the Agnihotra way of life. Parkhe delivered lectures and wrote several books on the subject. Family and education Parkhe was born into Deshastha Brahmin family. Parkhe's father, Sadashivrao Parkhe, held the position of Chief Justice in the Indian Princely States during the British Raj. He died when Parkhe was a teenager. Parkhe attended Sir Parshurambhau College in Pune, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1935, Parkhe was married to Kamalabai Parkhe (Kashi Rajimwale), younger sister of Paramsadguru Shree Gajanan Maharaj of Akkalkot of Swami Samarth parampara. Industrialist Parkhe Group began in 1930 with the Bharat Envelopes Company, a cottage industry operating from Pune under the guidance of his mother Maisaheb and with the assistance of his younger brother Gopalrao. The business prepared envelopes and other paper products by hand and sold them in nearby markets. The enterprise grew rapidly, becoming known as one of the most pioneering groups in India in the field of paper and pulp. Parkhe's first large venture was Paper & Pulp Conversions Pvt Ltd (PAPCO), a board mill started in Lower Parel, Bombay in 1942. By 1947, it became a public limited company with M. S. Parkhe & Co as the managing agents, in accordance with the prevalent company laws. In 1951, PAPCO started its second unit in Khopoli, Maharashtra, which made paper, and, eventually paperboards; it was the flagship company of the group. The first paper manufacturing machine installed at Khopoli was procured from Japan. PAPCO issued dividends without interruption for over next 40 years.Parkhe Udyog Samuha - The Envelope Story Year 1987 In 1960, PAPCO was the chief promoter of a novel idea conceived by some small and medium paper mills: a \\"mother pulp mill\\" manufacturing market-grade pulp, the raw material for paper-making. The Central Pulp Mills (CPM) was incorporated on 4 July 1960 and commenced full operations in 1966. Many pioneering efforts like the PAPCO machinery division, Parkhe Consultants (a full-service paper industry consultancy), and Parkhe Research Institute (provided research and development support to the paper and pulp Industry) followed suit in the following three decades. Eurocote, a paper and paperboard coating unit based in Vapi, Gujarat was integrated into the group in 1976. The total turnover of the Group reached over Rupees 100 crores in the mid-1980s.Parkhe Group Companies ‚Äì Balance Sheets Year 1984 Felicitation by the President of India, Gaini Zail Singh, 12 March 1987. The Parkhe Group suffered major losses towards the end of the 1980s. The changing situation in the wake of government policy decisions such as Rupee devaluation, Import duty reductions on pulp and free imports, continued labour problems were some of the major factors contributing to these losses. Analysts also attribute that the floods of the Patalganga river at Khopoli on Pune- Bombay highway where the PAPCO project was located since 1953, was the fatal blow for the business. This ultimately resulted in a financial crunch which engulfed the entire group. This was the state of many industries in Maharashtra during that time, such as similar cases in the textile mills closure crisis if Mumbai. Although some of the old ventures of the Parkhe Group, like PAPCO, could not be revived from the crises, the largest unit, Central Pulp Mills, was transferred to Delhi-based JK Singhania Group in 1992 and is now flourishing under a new identity of JK Paper. Social institutions Parkhe's memoirs and writings talk about the spirit of \\"Social Indebtedness\\"; with this belief, the Parkhe Group established social and charitable trusts. The trusts focus on assisting poor and needy people in society. Propagation of Agnihotra and Vedic culture Agnihotra is an ancient Vedic fire ritual that was resuscitated by Param Sadguru Shree Gajanan Maharaj of Akkalkot and prescribed for the well-being of entire humankind and nature. Parkhe was an ardent follower of Shree, and has written books and papers, delivered lectures, and traveled worldwide propagating Agnihotra and research on remnants of ancient fire worship in different civilisations. He was closely associated with the trusts and initiatives in Akkalkot and Shivpuri Ashram. At Shree's instruction, he built Lord Parshuram and Agni Mandir‚Äôs in his industrial complexes in Khopoli and Songadh. He presided the Mahasomayag Committee, and made a pivotal contribution during the Ekamevadvitiya Mahasomayag of Shivpuri, Akkalkot in 1969. This was considered to be a landmark event: after many years, a Mahasomayag was conducted exactly as prescribed by the Vedas, without any animal sacrifice‚Äînot even symbolic oblations‚Äîin a totally non-violent and pious manner. Books and writings Parkhe was an avid reader, writer, and orator. He wrote several books and papers on diverse subjects including industry, social and religious issues, Vedic literature, etc. Listed below are some of his writings: *Ramayashogatha Marathi/Hindi '‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§∂‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ‡§•‡§æ' (Marathi ‚Äì 1975), (Hindi: Translated ‚Äì 2005) ‚Äì Epic-Book on the life of Vishnu Avatar, Lord Parashuram. 21 years of research was undertaken to complete this book *Rajrajeshwar Parshuram (Marathi) ‚Äì Book on Vishnu Avatar, Lord Parashuram. *The Universal Faith (English) ‚Äì Importance of Fire Worship in all the world religions and civilisations.

Initially, it provided coverage to employees injured only on navigable waters of the United States. Today, it provides coverages to certain maritime workers, including most dock workers and maritime workers not otherwise covered by the Jones Act. In addition, Congress has extended the LHWCA to cover non-appropriated fund employees (i.e. certain MWR and AAFES employees),https://www.dol.gov./owcp/dlhwc/nfia.htm Outer Continental Shelf workers,https://www.dol.gov/owcp/ocsla.htm and U.S. government contractors working in foreign countries under the Defense Base Act https://www.dol.gov./owcp/dlhwc/lsdba.htm The LHWCA is administered by the Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation, a division of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of the United States Department of Labor. Generally speaking, a worker covered by the LHWCA is entitled to temporary compensation benefits of two-thirds of his average weekly wage while undergoing medical treatment, and then either to a scheduled award for injury to body parts enumerated in or two-thirds of the workers' loss of wages, or wage earning capacity. More specifically, the LHWCA entitles a worker to reasonable and necessary medical benefits and indemnity benefits. There are four categories of disability benefits: temporary total, temporary partial, permanent total, and permanent partial. The difference between the types of benefits depends on whether the injured worker has achieved medical permanency, and whether the injured worker can return to his pre-injury employment, or return to some form of suitable alternative employment. In certain situations, permanent partial disability benefits are available for retirees. Once an injured worker has reached a state of permanency, the worker may request vocational rehabilitation services from the United States Department of Labor's Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation. In 1972, the Longshore Act was amended to provide additional protections to employers against claims by shipowners, to diminish remedies owed by shipowners to injured workers, and to extend coverage landward for maritime workers. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Longshore Act did not supplant state workers‚Äô compensation laws, but supplemented them. (Sun Ship v. Pennsylvania, 447 U.S. 715 (1980)). In 1984, Congress amended the Longshore Act, but did not invalidate Sun Ship, so concurrent jurisdiction was preserved. There are numerous hazards that may result in severe injuries to an employee. A catastrophic injury that has resulted from a forklift accident, unloading and loading cargo, oilfield accident, crane accident, gas explosion, fire, or a fall that occurred due to a negligent third party, may warrant compensation under the LHWCA.

The series was Carlton's attempt to rival Thames Television's The Bill, after the producer unexpectedly retained the series despite a major take-over by Carlton. A total of three series were broadcast between 1 February 1995 and 18 December 1997, with a total of twenty-five episodes broadcast. Each episode features a stand- alone case, with the exception of a small number of two-part episodes. However, the personal lives of each of the officers in the team provide the backdrop for a continuing story arc throughout all three series. Reception for the third and final series was mixed, and a major shake-up in the main cast was cited as the main reason for declining viewing figures.

Although promoted independently, it was supported by the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and was seen as part of a trunk line connecting Glasgow with a ferry port for the north of Ireland. Its route remains open at the present day, carrying a moderate passenger train service between Ayr and Girvan, with some trains running from Glasgow to Stranraer. History System map of the Maybole and Girvan RailwayPortpatrick had long been a port for shipping between Scotland and Donaghadee in the north of Ireland, since at least 1620. When railways were being developed in the south-west of Scotland it was considered essential to connect Portpatrick with the main line system, but the difficult and sparsely populated terrain made that a difficult proposition. A line was completed in 1840 between Glasgow and Ayr, by the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, and the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway connected Carlisle and Dumfries in 1848. Those two companies merged in 1850 to form the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;), which became the dominant railway company in the south west of Scotland. However Ayr and Dumfries were a considerable distance from Portpatrick. In 1845 a scheme named the Glasgow and Belfast Union Railway (G&BUR;) was formed, and obtained Parliamentary authority to build a line; this had been promoted during a period of frenzy for railway projects, but in the following year the financial bubble burst, and it became impossible to get money. The G&BUR; allowed its powers to lapse without any construction taking place. The Portpatrick Railway was the first line to connect Portpatrick: it did so in 1861, but its line led towards Carlisle (over other companies' lines) and Portpatrick was still only accessible from Glasgow by a roundabout route. The G&SWR;, by now firmly entrenched in the area but fearful of an incursion by the rival Caledonian Railway, encouraged local promoters to propose schemes, and the G&SWR; supported them financially in most cases. The Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway opened in 1856, so that Maybole was now connected to Glasgow directly.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, The Maybole and Girvan Railway authorised During the construction of the Ayr and Maybole Junction line, a \\"Committee of Noblemen and Gentlemen\\" led by Sir James Fergusson of Kilkerran decided to form a company for the purpose of building a railway from Maybole to Girvan, and improving the jetty and harbour there. The cost of the scheme was estimated at ¬£62,000. The G&SWR; was supportive, and a working arrangement was finalised whereby the G&SWR; would work the line for 42¬Ω% of gross receipts. The G&SWR; agreed to subscribe ¬£12,000 and when the cost estimate rose of ¬£70,000 later in the year, the G&SWR; contribution rose to ¬£20,000. The G&SWR; shareholders were not unanimously in favour of this kind of cash support, and the Chairman had to declare that, \\"It must be apparent to the shareholders that in going to Girvan the directors were pointing Lochryan\\". It got its authorising Act of Parliament without difficulty on 14 July 1856; the capital was ¬£68,000 and the line was to be 12¬Ω miles (20 km) in length.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 Construction, and opening The construction process was very slow, and extra cash to the extent of ¬£34,000 was needed by the company; the G&SWR; provided ¬£11,000. The cost of land acquisition had been ¬£8,000 above the estimated cost, and ¬£7,000 was expended on bridges where level crossings had originally been planned. The extra money needed was created by persuading the main contractor, William Aiton, to take 200 shares in payment, and by raising ¬£34,000 in preference shares. The main line finally opened for traffic on 24 May 1860,Stephenson Locomotive Society, The Glasgow and South Western Railway, 1850 - 1923, London, 1950Campbell Highet, The Glasgow & South-Western Railway, Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965David L Smith, The Little Railways of South West Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, although the harbour branch, an extension beyond the passenger terminus, a second bridge over the Water of Girvan, and the jetty were not ready at this stage.Carter says that the line was partly opened in August 1859 and fully open on 21 May 1860. Notwithstanding the apparent desire to reach Portpatrick, the station was not laid out to enable onward running southwards. Poor financial performance On 8 March 1861 the shareholders heard the first half-yearly report. The surplus on trading for the half year had been a disappointing ¬£1,176; this was only enough to pay a dividend on the preference shares; in fact the company never paid a dividend to ordinary shareholders. By 1862 it was evident that this sluggish performance was to be the norm. Indeed, the company had run out of cash with work still to be done to complete the line. The G&SWR; was asked to finance the work, which it did, deducting the advance from the surplus on operations. Local interest had been created in Girvan in sponsoring a line onward towards Portpatrick, but the obvious plight of the Maybole and Girvan suppressed any actual action in that direction. Absorbed by the G&SWR; An underperforming local line worked by a larger sponsoring company could only end with absorption, and by the terms of a G&SWR; Amalgamation Act of 5 July 1865, the Maybole and Girvan Railway was absorbed by the larger company. the 4% preference shareholders got 4% preference shares in the G&SWR;, but the ordinary shareholders only got ¬£35 per cent. The absorption took effect on 1 August 1865. The Maybole to Girvan line was now simply a part of the G&SWR;, but the aspiration to extend the line to Stranraer‚ÄîPortpatrick was now no longer the prime destination for Ireland‚Äîremained, but the G&SWR; did not have the resources to build the line itself. The Girvan and Portpatrick Junction Railway got an authorising Act on 5 July 1865 to build from Girvan to Challoch Junction on the Portpatrick Railway, some distance east of Stranraer. Funding the difficult construction through wild territory was difficult, and it was not until 19 September 1877 that the line opened. Because of the configuration of Girvan station, the new line started from a junction a short distance north of the terminal, and a new through station off Vicarton Street was built. The finances of the new company were shaky and relations with existing railways were difficult, but in time matters settled down. A consistent through passenger service between Glasgow and Stranraer was operated. For some time both passenger stations at Girvan were used for passenger traffic, but the original Girvan station ceased handling passengers in 1892 and became a goods depot. Modern operation DMUs started operating over the line between Glasgow and Stranraer in 1959. The current class 156 sprinters commencing in October 1988. Topography The line runs in a general south-westerly direction from Maybole through farmed countryside to Girvan, a fishing port on the Irish Sea. It passes a former coal mine at Bargany. The line consists of a single track with a passing loop at Kilkerran. The line was double tracked between 1893 and 1973. The line opened on 24 May 1860. The intermediate stations closed on 6 September 1965 except where noted; Maybole remains open on the present-day line; the original M&GR; Girvan station is closed.

Prime Minister of Somali Democratic Republic On 24 January 1991, and after two years under house arrest, he was appointed by then-President of Somali Democratic Republic Siad Barre as the last Prime Minister. However, before any transfer of power could take place, the United Somali Congress rapid advance forced Barre to flee Mogadishu. After Barre's ouster, the next president, Ali Mahdi Muhammad, reappointed Ghalib as prime minister, a position Ghalib would hold until May 1993. Imprisonment, trial, and fall of government  Ghalib was dismissed from his position in 1982 after disagreeing with Barre's increasingly overt policy of supporting the ethnic Somali insurrection in Ethiopia's Somali Region region. Ghalib was subsequently arrested, and in 1989, after spending seven years in prison without charges, he was tried for treason and sentenced to death. Following protests from various foreign governments, Siad Barre commuted Ghalib's sentence but kept him under house arrest. In late January 1991, as his regime was collapsing, Siad Barre asked Ghalib to form a new government that would negotiate with the rebels, but the USC military successes forced Siad Barre's flight from the capital before any transfer of power could be completed.

They are usually intended for recreation and embody the spirit and activities often found at outdoor camps and educational facilities, without the facilitated educational component. \\"Recreational-oriented\\" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.  History  Treetop adventure park in Bali Asramam Adventure Park, Kollam, Kerala It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military. In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States. In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented adventure parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe & Asian countries.  Related outdoor activities  As already mentioned, a ropes course is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section. A canopy tour is a specific type of ziplining where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.  Facts and figures  The category adventure parks can be broken down into a number of specific types. They differ according to a number of criteria: * Type of parks: stationary / mobile * Structural System: trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure * Target visitors: all / kids from 4 years old / disabled * Height of the lifeline: \\"mid-height\\", \\"out of reach\\" * Belay system: self / permanent / continuous * Locations: touristic / urban Adventure parks can be found in different places. Examples of trends: * Close to large tourist destinations * In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries) * In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc. * Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France) * Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc. * Small (kids') parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc. Large adventure parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements). The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or ‚Äúgreen trail‚Äù and progresses to a very challenging level or ‚Äúblack trail‚Äù. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20‚Äì30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled. Most kids love adventure parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks to the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play. The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and zip-lines increases the diversity and interest of parks ‚Äì people love zip-lines. There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak. There are two schools concerning the height of the lifeline: * The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at is well adapted for carabiners. * The lifeline out of reach, at , possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages: (1) Higher throughput by peaks - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines). (2) More impressive and challenging elements (No \\"mid-heigh\\" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues). (3) Higher convenience for the park visitors (Platforms are free of any \\"mid-heigh\\" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun & thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms). (4) Much lower risk of injury (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter) Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

Starting tower.jpgRope park in the Leningrad region, Russia. Starting tower File:Park visitor on stage.jpgthumbPark visitor on stage. Leningrad region, Russia  Safety systems  Self belay with carabiners Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from four years old The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails ‚Äì relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used. There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems: * Self belay with carabiners * Permanent belay with carabiners * Continuous belay on rail * Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley) The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries. The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a \\"communicating system‚Äù which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found. The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application ‚Äì it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe). With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail ‚Äì in term of safety, no specific further action is required. For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be ‚Äúout of reach‚Äù which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)  Adventure parks operation  Round platform Recreational-oriented adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations). The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level & risk management, needs of training & supervision and flexible operation. In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems). The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

He plays hurling with his local club Croom and has been a member of the Limerick senior inter-county team since 2002. Playing career=Club Lawlor plays his club hurling with his local club in Croom and has enjoyed some success. As an under-age player he captured played in the minor county final in 1998, however, Croom were defeated by Adare. Lawlor later moved onto the club's under-21 team where he won a county title in this grade in 2001. Croom's dominance at minor and under-21 levels bore fruit at senior level in 2007 when the club qualified for the final of the senior county championship Unfortunately, Croom were completely trounced by Adare on a score line of 0-14 to 0-5. Under-21 Lawlor first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick under-21 team in the early years of the new century. In 2001 Lawlor joined the team and he quickly picked up his first Munster title. Limerick later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Wexford were the opponents. In spite of leaving in two goals Limerick emerged victorious by 0-17 to 2-10. It was Lawlor's first All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal. 2002 saw Lawlor being appointed captain of the under-21 team with Limerick reaching the provincial decider once again. After an exciting contest with Tipperary, which included extra-time, saw Limerick win by 1-20 to 2-14.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 48 It was his second consecutive Munster under-21 winners' medal. For the third year in-a-row Limerick lined out in the All-Ireland final with Galway providing the opposition once again. Limerick kept a clean sheet once again as Limerick powered to a 3-17 to 0-8 victory.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 42 It was Lawlor's second consecutive All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal while he also had the honour of receiving the cup. Senior By this stage Lawlor had already made his debut with the Limerick senior hurling team. His first few years with the senior team proved difficult for both Lalwor and for Limerick. In spite of coming close to creating some hurling upsets, defeat seemed to be Limerick's lot. In 2005 Peter was awarded the man of the match award in the All Ireland Hurling Quarter Final although playing on the Limerick side beaten by Kilkenny. He was also nominated for an All Star in 2005. In 2006 Limerick remained unbeaten throughout the entire National Hurling League campaign and qualified for the final against Kilkenny. It was an unhappy day for Limerick as 'the Cats' won the game by 3-11 0-14. In spite of some success in the league, Limerick's championship form was still below par. All this changed in 2007 when Limerick had one of their best seasons. That year Limerick faced near neighbours Tipperary in the semi-final of the Munster championship. That game ended in a draw with both sides scoring 1-19. The replay saw Limerick in arrears by ten points at half-time, however, Limerick rallied to level the game at the end of normal time. A period of extra time had to be played and Andrew O'Shaughnessy turned out to be the hero as he scored the equalising point which meant that the sides had to play for a third time. Once again, Limerick looked vulnerable at times during the game, however, they grinded out a victory with a score line of 0-22 to 2-13. It was Limerick's first win in the Munster championship since 2001. Lawlor later lined out against Waterford in the Munster final, however, they were defeated on a score line of 3-17 to 1-14. These two sides later met again in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, manager Richie Bennis had done his homework and masterminded a surprise 5-11 to 2-15 victory over the Munster champions. This victory allowed Lawlor's side to play Kilkenny in the championship decider. Unfortunately, Limerick got off to a bad start with goalkeeper Brian Murray letting in two goals by Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin in the first ten minutes. Limerick fought back, however, 'the Cats', however, went on to win the game by six points.

Retrieved 20 December 2019 History The event started as a small gathering organised by the Hells Angels motorcycle club for bikers. Since 1987, the event has grown to one of the largest motorcycle festivals in Europe, with a record 50,000 people reported to have attended in 2007. It is believed that the popularity of the event is due to the organisers' philosophy of hosting a festival that meets all the criteria of their own 'perfect party', organised by bikers, for bikers. The festival has been hosted at the Shakespeare County Raceway in the village of Long Marston, Warwickshire, England since 1987, and always takes place in mid-August. Since its inception, it has followed largely the same format (though expanded for larger crowds and more recently included bigger name bands): providing entertainment aimed at the motorcycle riding fraternity, including live rock music, beer tents, motorcycle racing, drag racing and stunt riding demonstrations. Adult entertainment traditionally features high on the bill, including a wet T-shirt contest, erotic dance shows and a topless bike wash. The event runs over four days, with gates opening on Thursday, running through until Sunday. In April 2013 it was announced that the 2013 event had been cancelled. The event returned in 2014 and for 2015. Comparable events in the USA, on a much larger scale, are Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and Daytona Beach Bike Week. Security and crime Despite the general public's association of violence and crime with the Hells Angels, the Bulldog Bash has a consistent record of causing the Warwickshire Police little trouble, compared to other events of this scale. There are no police patrolling the site, though they have a small base just off-site, and no personal searches conducted by police. The Hells Angels maintain security inside the festival grounds themselves. Inspector Dave Patterson from the Warwickshire Police is quoted to have said about the 2006 event: \\"There was just four crimes reported on site and only three arrests during the four-day event. Although traffic to and from the Long Marston site was greater than normal, the traffic plan worked well.\\"Houlder, Di.\\"Bulldog Bash - Police Overview\\" The Police Media Portal The four crimes recorded on the Police Media Portal were all related to theft.

ExaGrid uses compression and data deduplication (sometimes called Capacity optimization) to minimize the amount of data stored. This works by using standard data compression for the most recent backups, along with saving only byte-level changes from backup to backup for all previous backups. This approach can reduce the disk space required for disk-based backup storage by 20 to 1. A second system can be installed at another location to supplement or eliminate offsite tapes, providing disk-based recovery in the event of a disaster. The data deduplication technology only moves changes over the Wide area network, reducing WAN bandwidth requirements. ExaGrid derives its name in part from the internal Grid computing architecture used.

Born in Ballingarry, County Limerick, O'Grady first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Limerick under-21 team. He made his senior debut in the 2004 championship. O'Grady has since gone on to play a key part for Limerick, and has won one Munster medal and one National League (Division 2) medal. O'Grady has been an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. O'Grady has been a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions and has won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he won one intermediate championship medal with Granagh-Ballingarry. He attended St Munchin's College, Limerick and graduated from there in 1998. College :L.I.T Playing career=Granagh-Ballingarry O'Grady plays his club hurling with the Granagh-Ballingarry club and has enjoyed some success. In 2005 the club enjoyed its greatest success, with O'Grady playing a key role. After losing at the quarter-final or semi-final stage for six years in a row, the club finally reached the final of the county intermediate championship. A 4-10 to 3-10 defeat of Glenroe gave O'Grady a championship medal. Limerick O'Grady first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick under-21 team in 2001. He started in Limerick's opening game against Cork but was substituted after half-an-hour and failed to regain his place on the team., In spite of this he claimed Munster and All-Ireland medals as a non-playing substitute. In 2004 O'Grady made his senior debut when he came on as a blood sub in Limerick's 1-18 to 2-12 defeat by Cork in the Munster semi- final. He was the first man from the Granagh-Ballingarry club to play senior hurling for Limerick. After becoming a regular member of the starting fifteen the following year, O'Grady lined out in his first Munster final in 2007. Waterford provided the opposition, however, a 3-17 to 1-14 defeat was Limerick's lot on that occasion. Limerick later gained their revenge on Waterford in the All-Ireland semi-final, thus gaining qualification to a first All-Ireland decider in eleven years for the Treaty men. Kilkenny provided the opposition and got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin combining to score two goals within the first ten minutes. Limerick were eventually defeated on a 2‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì15 score line. Limerick failed to build on their reasonably successful 2007 season and went into decline once again. In late 2009 and early 2010 Limerick hurling hit an all-time low when many of the senior hurling team withdrew their services in protest at the continuation of Justin McCarthy as manager. As a result of this O'Grady played no part in the 2010 championship. O'Grady returned to the panel in 2011 and a new management team took over. Limerick defeated Clare by 4-12 to 2-13 in the National League Division 2 final that year, giving O'Grady his first success in the senior grade. In 2013 O'Grady was appointed captain of the Limerick senior hurling team. It was a successful year as he won a Munster medal after guiding the team to a 0-24 to 0-15 victory over Cork in the final. Munster O'Grady has also lined out with Munster in a number of inter-provincial campaigns and has enjoyed some success. In 2007 he was at midfield in his debut year when Munster defeated Connacht by 2-22 to 2-19 to take the Railway Cup title. Further appearances for the province in 2008, 2009 and 2012 ended in defeat. O'Grady won a second inter-provincial medal in 2013 following Munster's 1-22 to 0-15 defeat of Connacht.

It opened in 1877 between Girvan and Challoch Junction, where it joined the Portpatrick Railway, which had already reached Stranraer from Castle Douglas. Portpatrick had been an important ferry terminal for traffic to and from the north of Ireland, but its significance was waning and Stranraer assumed greater importance. The new line formed part of a route between Glasgow, Ayr and Stranraer. Running through difficult and sparsely populated terrain, the G&PJR; was never financially successful, and on two occasions it had to suspend operations to due unpaid debts to adjacent railway companies. In 1887 the Company sold its concern at a huge loss to the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Railway Company (A&WR;), formed specially for the purpose. The A&WR; hardly performed better, and in turn it sold its business to the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) in 1892. The line remains in operation at the present day, forming part of the Glasgow to Stranraer route. History=The short sea route to the north of Ireland The little harbour at Portpatrick was the starting point for the short sea route from Scotland to the north of Ireland as early as 1620, connecting with Donaghadee in County Down, on the east side of Belfast Lough. Cattle and horses were an important traffic, raised in Ireland and brought into Scotland for butchery, and later Post Office mails became significant: by 1838 8,000 to 10,000 letters passed through the port daily, brought by road coach from Dumfries, and from Glasgow. A barracks was erected in the town to facilitate troop movements between Britain and Ireland. However the limitations of the little harbour became serious disadvantages as other more efficient rail-connected routes, via Liverpool, and later Holyhead became dominant.R R Cunningham, Portpatrick Through the Ages, Wigtown Free Press, Stranraer, 1977 Railways towards the Port While English destinations via Dumfries and Carlisle were dominant, Glasgow and Central Scotland were obviously significant, and when the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;) reached Ayr in 1840 it was natural to consider whether an extension to Portpatrick, 60 miles (96 km) away, was feasible. In 1843 a Glasgow and Belfast Union Railway was proposed to achieve the connection, but the plan foundered. By 1853 the GPK&AR; had amalgamated with others to form the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;), which encouraged the promotion of the Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway which got its authorising Act of Parliament on 10 July 1854 and opened on 13 October 1856. The line was worked by the G&SWR.; The next extension was the Maybole and Girvan Railway which was authorised on 14 July 1856 and opened on 24 May 1860. It too was worked by the G&SWR;, and absorbed by it in 1865. (The Ayr and Maybole line remained independent until 1912.) Now the Portpatrick Railway was opened between Castle Douglas and Stranraer on 11 March 1861. At Castle Douglas it made connection with other railways giving access to Dumfries and Carlisle, and therefore points in England, as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh by a roundabout route. The Portpatrick Railway, true to its name, had definite intentions to extend from Stranraer to Portpatrick, and did so the following year.David L Smith, The Little Railways of South West Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, Closing the gap from Girvan to Stranraer System map of the Glasgow and Portpatrick Junction RailwayThese developments encouraged serious consideration of a railway to Portpatrick, although the challenging terrain was a deterrent. However, on 13 November 1862 a prospectus was issued for the Girvan Stranraer & North of Ireland Junction Railway, which was to leave the Maybole and Girvan line 1¬Ω miles (2 km) north of Girvan and join the Portpatrick Railway at Challoch, 10¬Ω miles (17 km) east of Stranraer, taking an inland course between. This scheme did not progress further, but the Girvan & Portpatrick Junction Railway (G&PJR;) obtained an authorising Act on 5 July 1865 to follow the same course as the earlier proposed line, except leaving the Maybole and Girvan line immediately north of Girvan station. Capital was to be ¬£250,000. At this time money became scarce and subscriptions to the proposed railway were inadequate; nothing could be done for some years until in 1870 matters eased somewhat, and a contractor, Abraham Pilling of Bolton, undertook to build the line, accepting payment in shares. The civil engineering works were severe, with several significant viaducts and a tunnel being required on the route. Seemingly as an afterthought, the G&PJR; applied for running powers between the proposed junction at Challoch and Stranraer; these were ratified by Act of Parliament of 6 August 1872. This required the G&PJR; to shoulder their share of the costs of the jointly used section of railway, and of harbour facilities at Stranraer and at first the Portpatrick Railway, struggling to make ends meet, considered this to be a welcome arrangement. Pilling too was struggling financially to continue his works due to a trade boom which made wages and materials prices escalate. The G&PJR; treated this sympathetically and raised some additional cash to assist him. The struggle took a disastrous turn during stormy conditions on the night of 26 September 1875, when the Stinchar viaduct was completely swept away and several other viaducts and works were substantially damaged. Once again the Company rescued Pilling financially, and the construction work continued. Working the line Now that completion of the construction phase was in sight, the Board gave consideration to the working of the line. The G&SWR; were approached and agreed to do so for 75% of gross receipts; this figure was thought excessive and talks were opened with Thomas Wheatley, who was successfully working the Wigtownshire Railway. Wheatley advised them to procure rolling stock and work the line themselves, but the Directors did not feel confident in that arrangement, so they approached the Caledonian Railway (CR), which was working the Portpatrick Railway. The CR was losing money on the Portpatrick Railway work and politely declined, assuming that the G&PJR; would turn back to Wheatley. However this course was not developed and the G&PJR; concluded an agreement with the G&SWR; to work their line. The CR were alarmed at this: Wheatley, as a small-time independent was not a threat: the G&SWR; were a deadly rival. In 1877 the CR, in effective possession of the Portpatrick Railway, put every possible obstruction in the way of completion of the G&PJR;, which needed the junction at Challoch, extensions and improvements at Stranraer, and signalling improvements between those places. Nonetheless the G&PJR; line was ready and on 1 October 1877 a trial run was undertaken. At Challoch the special train was prevented from proceeding towards Stranraer, and distinguished guests there expecting to join the train had to be brought to it by road. A second attempt was made in the afternoon and this time the special got through‚Äîa banquet awaited them at Stranraer. Public opening The Board of Trade Inspecting Officer had approved the line during his inspection on 24 July 1877, and the G&PJR; had started a sporadic goods service between Girvan and New Luce. From 19 September a passenger service‚Äîtwo trains daily‚Äîstarted between New Luce and Girvan. Because the original Maybole and Girvan Railway station at Girvan had been by-passed by the new line, a crude platform was erected on the G&PJR; line; it was called Girvan New and the terminus was Girvan Old. This was much less convenient to the town, and was the subject of criticism locally. On 5 October 1877 a normal public train service started, between Girvan and Stranraer. Four trains ran over the line daily: the fragmented ownership of the route did not need to be respected by the G&SWR;, working the whole line. The first southbound and last northbound were expresses, calling only at Ayr, Girvan New, Pinwherry (southbound only) and Dunragit stations, and running to and from the East Pier at Stranraer (described as Stranraer Harbour). Some of the stopping trains may have called at both Girvan Old and New stations; they had to reverse between Girvan Old station and the point of junction of the lines, calling also at Girvan New. It may be that the trains ran only between Girvan New and Stranraer, with road connection between the two stations there. Financial difficulties The G&PJR; was responsible for rental payments to the Portpatrick Railway, calculated on the interest on the original capital cost of construction of their part of that line that they used. The G&PJR; was in desperate financial straits: at the shareholders' meeting on 30 April 1878 it was reported that the working arrangement with the G&SWR; took over 90% of gross receipts. In 1880 receipts were ¬£16,031 while working expenses were ¬£24,013.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, , page 108 The G&PJR; failed to pay the PPR, and the Portpatrick Company, in difficult circumstances itself, went to arbitration in 1880; the arbitrator was Sir Thomas Bouch, engineer of the first Tay Bridge, which had collapsed on 28 December 1879, an event known as the Tay Bridge disaster, in which 59 persons perished. Bouch had no difficulty in finding in favour of the Portpatrick Railway's case; the G&PJR; lacking the cash to comply, held out. Since 3 July 1879 the Company's affairs had been in the hands of a judicial factor, James Haldane, appointed by the Court of Session. On 31 January 1881 he gave notice to the G&SWR; to terminate the working agreement, considered to be the greatest source of the G&PJR;'s financial problems. However no-one offered a better arrangement, and Haldane was obliged to request the G&SWR; to continue the working from month to month on the same basis as before. In any case this was all too late: the Portpatrick Railway took the matter to the Court of Session, which also found in their favour on 1 February 1881. The matter had dragged on that far. From 7 February 1882 G&PJR; trains were not allowed on to the Portpatrick Railway. The G&PJR; now ran only as far as New Luce, and conveyed passengers and goods to and from Stranraer by road. 2-4-0 locomotive no. 59 operated the service, running tender first half of the time. The service used Girvan Old station, and the New station was temporarily closed. Struggling on, the G&PJR; obtained authorisation to borrow more money, and the G&SWR; was persuaded to mitigate its working charges somewhat; the new arrangement provided a hierarchy of destinations for available income, of which the lowest was \\"distribution to G&PJR; shareholders\\". A fresh Act was passed on 18 August 1882 authorising the raising another ¬£30,000 of capital. ¬£20,000 of this was subscribed by the G&SWR.; By September 1883 the G&PJR; had paid nearly all of the outstanding debt (¬£12,283), and were permitted to resume running to Stranraer. This actually started on 1 August 1883; the trains used the Old station only at Girvan, except the boat trains which used the New station only. The Company's fortunes revived with this arrangement, and at a shareholders' meeting on 31 October 1884 a 1% dividend to Class A Debenture Stock holders was announced. Still more difficulties overcome In 1885 the G&SWR; was negotiating to become a part owner of the Portpatrick Railway, giving them their own access to Stranraer. Feeling that the G&PJR; was weaker, the G&SWR; gave six months notice of termination of the working agreement, and the withdrawal of the ¬£20,00 subscribed under the 1882 Act. That Act gave the lending companies the power to sell the G&PJR; in the event of a default. In self-defence the G&PJR; presented a Parliamentary Bill to repeal that power and to borrow further capital; it also sought running powers over the G&SWR; north of Girvan in the hope of connecting with the rival Caledonian Railway. The Bill became an Act on 13 April 1886 but without the running powers. On 12 April 1886 the G&SWR; ceased to operate the line, and for a second time it was unable to operate a train service. By now W T Wheatley, son of Thomas Wheatley, was General Manager of the line, and it fell to him to make working arrangements. He immediately ordered two 0-6-0 locomotives to be built new, and to cover while they were constructed, he acquired three second hand 4-4-0 engines and passenger and goods vehicles from the North London Railway (NLR). ¬£3,600 was paid, with additional money for repairs to the stock carried out by the NLR. By this means Wheatley resumed a train service on 14 June 1886, running everything except the boat train expresses. The NLR engines arrived with condensing apparatus fitted, from their former use in London, and did not have a continuous brake. Smith illustrates the disparity of the equipment's origin: > [Driver] Bob Scott ran the Paddy [the boat train express for the Irish > ferry] with his old North London tank and its train of chain-braked coaches. > I wonder who in Bow Works ever imagined that their prosaic suburban tank > engine would one day run a boat express over a Scottish moor?David L Smith, > Tales of the Glasgow and South Western Railway, Ian Allan Limited, London, > undated, page 30 The G&SWR; would not allow G&PJR; passenger trains to use Girvan (Old) station at first, so the trains terminated at the New station and passengers transferred between the two. From 2 September 1886 this policy was reversed, and the trains used the Old station, reversing to and from the junction, and the New station fell into disuse, except by occasional excursion trains. In November 1886 the two 0-6- locomotives were delivered from the Neilson and Company factory, and the overstretched locomotive fleet was relieved. Suddenly a takeover If the G&PJR; was surviving operationally, its financial situation was plainly desperate, and in financial circles it was clear that a change of ownership was imminent. In the event the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Railway Company was the successful bidder; the Company was formed specially for the purpose by Act of Parliament of 23 May 1887. The actual takeover took place on 1 August 1887. The G&PJR; was authorised to borrow ¬£10,000 for repair works on Pinmore Tunnel and the Stinchar Viaduct and for other expenses prior to the transfer. The sale price was ¬£166,500; the G&PJR; had cost ¬£532,000 to build. In May 1887 two new 0-6-0 tender engines were delivered, emblazoned with the A&WR; lettering, having been obtained new from the Clyde Locomotive Company. The new locomotives enabled a morning and evening Stranraer express to be put on in each direction, from 1 June 1887. Nonetheless the financial performance of the little company was poor; internal traffic was very limited and steamship competition, and the attitude of the G&SWR;, affected external business. The A&WR; paid some limited dividends, but it was a struggle, and the rolling stock fleet, and particularly the track, was showing signs of wear, and it became public knowledge that the A&WR; proprietors would consider selling their concern. The G&SWR; takes over In 1892 the G&SWR; took an interest in acquiring the company, possibly motivated by fears of the Caledonian Railway taking an interest. The G&SWR; took over the working on 2 February 1892 and acquisition of the A&WR; was ratified by Act of 20 June 1892. The G&SWR; paid ¬£270,000. Corridor stock was introduced on the boat trains in 1899.C E J Fryer, The Girvan and Portpatrick Junction Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1994, After 1923 In G&SWR; days the Manson tablet exchange apparatus had been installed on the line, enabling faster transits through crossing stations. In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" and the line formed part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The LMS discontinued the use of the Manson apparatus, \\"as so many locomotives would now need the exchange device to be fitted\\". The LMS restored the \\"Daylight Service\\" between Larne and Stranraer, and in 1925 LNW 42-ton dining cars were added to the connecting trains, 12.25 p.m. from Stranraer and 3.55 p.m. from Glasgow.David L Smith, Legends of the Glasgow and South Western Railway in LMS Days, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1980, , page 16 The first Sunday excursion from Glasgow to Portpatrick was run in June 1927.Smith, Legends, page 31 As train loads increased substantially in this period, the short length of the crossing points on the line became a severe limitation: 8 vehicle trains could be crossed at Barrhill, and 9 at Pinwherry and New Luce. A second platform was constructed at Glenwhilly, enabling 12 vehicle trains to be crossed there. During World War II other loops were extended to cope with the heavy traffic. Locomotive power was also an issue. The turntable at Stranraer was 50 feet (15 m) which had long restricted engine types on this difficult route. The Hughes 2-6-0s had been brought in and found advantageous, but Smith records: \\"At the end of March 1939 there came momentous news‚Äîofficial sanction for a 60 ft [18 m]; 4-6-0s to work to Stranraer.\\" \\"On 23 March 1939 a trial run was made with a 4-6-0, with the locomotive and tender separated at Stranraer to turn them. There was no prospect of the 60 ft turntable being ready before late summer, so they laid longer rails, projecting at each end, on the existing 50 ft turntable. This allowed them to turn a Class 5 4-6-0. The class 5s began to work from Glasgow to Stranraer on 16 April 1939.\\" It was about October that the new 60 ft turntable was ready at Stranraer. Class 5X 4-6-0s were drafted in, and were the mainstay of the Stranraer road throughout the war.Smith, Legends, pages 93, 94, 99 and 100 Diesel multiple units were introduced on passenger trains from November 1959, but they reverted to locomotive haulage in the period 1984 to 1987. From October 1988, Super Sprinter diesel units were in use. Topography The line suspended train working from 7 February to 16 February 1882, and from 12 April to 13 June 1886. Locations on the line were: * (Girvan Junction: with Maybole and Girvan Railway); * Girvan New; after the 7 February 1882 suspension the station reopened on 1 August 1883; and after 14 June 1886 it reopened on 14 July 1890; it was renamed Girvan on 1 April 1893; *New Luce in 1970Pinmore; closed 6 September 1965; * Pinwherry; closed 6 September 1965; * Barrhill; * Glenwhilly; closed 6 September 1965; * New Luce; closed 6 September 1965; demolished 1971 * (Challoch‚Äîcrossing loop); * (Challoch Junction: with Portpatrick Railway).Butt Girvan Old ‚Äî the Maybole and Girvan Railway station‚Äîclosed on 1 April 1893. Gradients on the line were severe; from Girvan Junction the line climbed at a ruling gradient of 1 in 54 to Pinmore, altitude 394 feet (120 m), and then fell at 1 in 69 to Pinwherry. There followed an eight-mile climb at 1 in 67 to a summit at 690 feet (210 m); then there was a long descent at up to 1 in 56 all the way to Challoch Junction. Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Railway (to be written) Current operations Glenwhilly station in August 1980 The line remains open throughout, as part of the Glasgow South Western Line between Glasgow and Stranraer, although all the intermediate stations apart from Barrhill were closed in 1965. Regular freight services to and from the depot at Stranraer Town operated over the line until the early 1990s, but these ceased following the withdrawal of the Railfreight Distribution wagon load service by BR in 1993. The passenger service was irregular (with large gaps between trains) up until 2015 as it operated mainly in conjunction with the Belfast ferry sailings and is constrained to some degree by the single track nature of the line (there are only three passing loops on the line south of Girvan, at Barrhill, Glenwhilly and Dunragit). The line is currently a key part of the Carrick & Wigtownshire Community Rail Partnership SAYLSA which comprises local Community Councils, representation from South Ayrshire Council, First ScotRail as well as private individuals. A recently completed rail study Ayr-Stranraer Rail Study Accessed 2008-10-16 commissioned by the SPT, Passenger Focus and SWESTRANS has recommended that the timetable be recast where possible to encourage new passenger business (mainly by providing a more evenly spaced service) and also to seek to develop new freight flows such as timber from Barrhill, grain from Girvan and intermodal traffic between Northern Ireland and Scotland (and beyond). A timetable recast by current franchise holders Abellio in December 2015 increased the service frequency on the line by 50% (from six trains each way up to nine on weekdays, running every two hours) but removed the direct link to Glasgow via Kilwinning; all services now operate to/from on weekdays & Saturdays (a limited number are extended from there to or from Glasgow) and terminate/start from Ayr on Sundays.

The village is situated on Elwick Bay, which was used as an anchorage by Haakon IV of Norway before sailing south to eventual defeat at the Battle of Largs in 1263. Today, the village still possesses a harbour, with mock defensive walls constructed at the same time as the castle. David Balfour even added a stone marked with the date 1725, taken from Noltland Castle on the island of Westray, to his defences. A car ferry to Kirkwall, operated by Orkney Ferries, sails from a pier at the harbour. This became a roll-on/roll-off service in 1990. History Originally known as Shoreside, Balfour was built in the 1780s by Thomas Balfour, a former tenant farmer who acquired a private income by marrying the sister of an Earl. With his new-found wealth, Balfour purchased the estate of Sound, whose estate house had been burned down in revenge for the then owner's support of the Jacobite rising of 1745. In 1782, to make way for a new residence, Balfour cleared cottars from the south-west of the island, and appropriated part of the common, building the village of Shoreside to house those evicted. To help finance his building work, Thomas Balfour borrowed money from his brother John, who made his fortune serving with the British East India Company. castle In 1846 his grandson, David Balfour, inherited the estate, which now encompassed the whole of the island. The following year, he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. At the same time, many changes were made to the village, which was renamed Balfour. While some of the village was demolished in order to improve the view from the castle, many improvements were made. Balfour added an imposing gatehouse, now the village pub and home to the local football team; a water mill and a gas works which remained operational until the 1920s. In order to supply the water mill, a river was dammed, creating the wetland known as Mill Dam, which is now a significant bird habitat, owned and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The reserve is home to many species of birds, including water rails, pintails, waders and black-headed gulls. Whooper swans have also been known to breed here. In 1960 the castle was purchased by Tadeusz Zawadzki, a Polish Cavalry officer and now operates as a hotel. Electricity was introduced via undersea cable in the 1970s. The main street of the village.

He did not like the ending which had Mordru the magician revealed as the final villain behind all the different factions attacking Earth. He left the title and was replaced by Joe Staton. Sherman's run as the regular penciller on Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes ran from issue #225 (March 1977) to #242 (Aug. 1978). In 1980, Sherman joined Upstart Associates, a shared studio space on West 29th Street in New York City.

The membership of the studio changed over time, and eventually Sherman took the space over for his own use. At Marvel Comics, Sherman worked on various titles including The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #3 (1981) which featured a guest appearance by the Man-Wolf. Sherman was the artist on Elaine Lee's 1991 noir space opera The Transmutation of Ike Garuda. He has done fill-in work from time-to time on a number of titles, but primarily works in commercial art.

The congregation is better known by its former name, the Congregation of the Mother Coredemptrix ( or simply '; , CMC), which uses an unofficial title applied to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Rev. Dominic Maria Tr·∫ßn ƒê√¨nh Th·ªß, CMC, is the congregation's founder and superior. The congregation's motherhouse is located in the Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c District of Ho Chi Minh City. The United States Assumption Province maintains a monastery in Carthage, Missouri, where it hosts an annual Marian Days pilgrimage, the largest annual Roman Catholic festival in the United States. Before 1975, the congregation was relatively small in Vietnam, overshadowed by the Dominican, Franciscan, Jesuit, and Redemptorist institutes, among others. However, in the United States, virtually all Vietnamese Roman Catholics are aware of the congregation. History Congregation Of The Mother Coredemptrix in Carthage, MissouriOn April 4, 1941, Rev. Dominic Maria Tr·∫ßn ƒê√¨nh Th·ªß, an instructor at the Qu·∫ßn Ph∆∞∆°ng seminary, was given permission to establish the Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix in Li√™n Th·ªßy hamlet, Xu√¢n Ng·ªçc commune, Xu√¢n Tr∆∞·ªùng district, Nam ƒê·ªãnh province, Vietnam, in the Diocese of B√πi Chu. The congregation was officially established on February 2, 1953, with Fr. Dominic Maria as the superior. In August 1954, during the Partition of Vietnam, the congregation moved to various locations in South Vietnam, eventually settling in Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c. After the Fall of Saigon, Fr. Dominic Maria was imprisoned by the Communist authorities from June 12, 1975, to April 29, 1977, on accusations of spying for the CIA. Fifty-two companions were also imprisoned for shorter terms. Fr. Dominic Maria was again arrested from May 16, 1987, on charges of state subversion. His sentence was reduced from life imprisonment to 20 years' imprisonment, but he was released early for unclear reasons on May 18, 1993. The congregation's assets were seized, except for a small dormitory for seminarians in Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c. , the congregation has 700 members worldwide, including 360 priests, 170 brothers, and 10 novices in Vietnam. , the U.S. province includes 23 priests, 54 brothers, five novices, seven postulants, and 25 high school students. CRM priests serve parishes in eight states. , the congregation has 500 seminarians in Ho Chi Minh City and sponsors 150 in the United States. On April 7, 2017, the congregation was renamed to the Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer upon the recommendation of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, due to the \\"theological ambiguity\\" of the title Co-Redemptrix. United States Assumption Province Shrine of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Carthage, Missouri) International Pilgrim Statue in the Shrine of the Immaculate Heart On April 30, 1975, 185 clergy ‚Äì about half of the Congregation ‚Äì left Vietnam as boat people just before the Fall of Saigon. They arrived in the United States at Fort Chaffee and other Operation New Arrivals refugee camps. Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, then Bishop of Springfield‚ÄìCape Girardeau, sponsored the priests and brothers, inviting them to purchase a vacant Oblates of Mary Immaculate seminary, Our Lady of the Ozarks College, for a nominal price of $1, to use as their U.S. monastery. Between June 30 and September 3, 1975, nine priests, 154 brothers, and four novices arrived in Carthage, a predominantly Protestant town. The Overseas Congregation of the Mother Coredemptrix received formal recognition from the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on September 16, 1975, and the congregation's Assumption Province () was established on October 25, 1980, with Rev. Barnabus Maria Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ª©c Ki√™n as the provincial. The Holy See gave the province a mission to minister to the Vietnamese American community. In 1978, the Congregation organized the inaugural Marian Days at the Carthage shrine. Around 1,500 Vietnamese Catholics from the surrounding area participated. In 1984, a statue of Our Lady of Fatima, also known as the International Pilgrim Statue, was enshrined in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Shrine at the Carthage monastery. The statue is removed once a year during the Marian Days celebration for a procession around Carthage. Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c died at the monastery in 1984.

The portion in the state of Montana is in length, passing through fourteen counties in central and southern Montana. Due to the large size of Montana, it is the largest segment of Interstate 90 within a single state.  Route description = Mineral County  Interstate 90 enters Montana and Mineral County from Shoshone County, Idaho over the high Lookout Pass, which traverses the Coeur d'Al√®ne Mountains of the Bitterroot Range, and immediately has its first interchange, a partial cloverleaf serving extreme northwest Mineral County and access to Lookout Pass Ski and Recreation Area. The highway continues southeasterly through woodlands, paralleling the St. Regis River, before meeting the Dena Mora (Lookout Pass) rest area east of the Idaho‚ÄìMontana border. About a from the rest stop is a diamond interchange, serving a small minor road into the St. Joe National Forest in Idaho. The highway continues, winding through the woodlands until another diamond interchange, serving the small unincorporated community of Saltese. Continuing east for about , each direction diverges for a small distance before returning side to side for a diamond interchange serving the unincorporated community of Haugan. Two miles (3 km) after Haugan, I-90 intersects the census-designated place (CDP) of De Borgia, continuing southeasterly, intersecting several minor roads, before reaching the CDP of St. Regis and Montana Highway 135 (MT 135). The highway stops paralleling the St. Regis River, and begins to parallel, and cross over several times, the Clark Fork River. Superior, the county seat, is intersected before the highway turns south through the Quartz Flats rest area, located from the Idaho border. After leaving the rest area, the highway straightens out, heading easterly. The highway continues east before exiting the county, just south of Alberton.  Missoula, Granite and Powell counties  I-90 in Granite County, facing east Entering Missoula County, the highway intersects Alberton, before continuing easterly through Huson and MT 263\\\\. The highway continues southeast before intersecting the concurrent highways U.S. Route 93 (US 93) and MT 200, which join I-90 from the west. The three highways continue into the county seat of Missoula, where at the first exit, US 93 leaves on the western border of Missoula and travels through Orchard Homes. The next two exits travel into downtown Missoula, while the last exit serves East Missoula. US 12 joins I-90 and MT 200 exits to the north of the highway outside of Missoula, paralleling the Blackfoot River as I-90 continues east, following and then intersecting Montana Secondary Highway 210 (S-210) in Clinton. The Bearmouth rest area, from the Idaho border, is intersected before crossing the Missoula‚ÄìGranite County border. After entering Granite County, I-90 has an interchange with an access road to the Garnet Back Country Byway, providing access to the Garnet Range on the west slope of the Rocky Mountains. The highway passes north of the Lolo National Forest while headed easterly. The highway continues through northern Granite county, intersecting MT 1 before exiting the county entering Powell County. Thirteen miles (29.92 km) after entering the county, I-90 intersects MT 272, which clips the eastern segment of the Lolo National Forest, before the seasonal Gold Creek rest area is intersected. Garrison is northeast of the highway as US 12 ends its concurrency, traveling north from I-90 towards the state capital of Helena. I-90 turns south, paralleling former Northern Pacific Railway trackage, before intersecting S-275 and the county seat, Deer Lodge. Continuing south, I-90 exits Powell County at Race Track, Montana.  Deer Lodge, Silver Bow and Jefferson counties  Interstate 90 bisects the northern tip of Deer Lodge County, in a southwesterly direction. Galen and S-273 are intersected, before the highway passes west of the Warm Springs State Wildlife Management Area. After passing the wildlife management area, the highway passes by Warm Springs and MT 48\\\\. Just northwest of the Deer Lodge‚ÄìSilver Bow County border, I-90 intersects MT 1. Fairmont Hot Springs, accessible via S-441 is the first exit in Silver Bow County on I-90, as the highway starts to turn back towards the east. Ramsay is located in the southwest corner of the interchange where I-15 becomes concurrent with I-90 through Butte. On the western edge of Butte, I-115 continues east into town, as I-15/90 turns southeast, bypassing most of downtown Butte. An interchange with MT 2 serves the Bert Mooney Airport before I-15/90 split just east of Butte, with I-15 continuing north over the Continental Divide over the high Elk Park Pass, which straddles the Silver Bow‚ÄìJefferson County border. I-90 heads south then east, also entering Jefferson County, passing over the divide at Homestake Pass which is high. After traveling the pass, an emergency escape ramp can be found on the highway's eastbound lanes. Jefferson County has interchanges with S-399 east of Pipestone, Montana and S-359 east of Cardwell before meeting the Jefferson‚ÄìBroadwater County border.  Broadwater, Gallatin and Park counties  I-90 through Bozeman Pass There is only one exit along I-90 in Broadwater County, linking MT 2 in the south and US 287 north of the highway before crossing the Broadwater‚ÄìGallatin County border at the Missouri River. I-90 parallels S-205, bypassing the towns of Trident, Logan, Manhattan and Belgrade on the north of the highway. A new interchange was constructed just east of Belgrade (Exit #299)that services Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport to the north and the western area of the city of Bozeman. MT 85 travels south from I-90 in Belgrade, providing access to Bozeman Hot Springs. The highway then enters the city of Bozeman, the county seat, and intersects and becomes concurrent with US 191\\\\. I-90 exits the county at the Gallatin‚ÄìPark County border at high Bozeman Pass. US 89 intersects I-90 in the county seat of Livingston, and passing over the Yellowstone River. The highway continues northeasterly, paralleling the river, intersecting S-295 before crossing the Park‚ÄìSweet Grass County border.  Sweet Grass and Stillwater counties  Park City facing west Still paralleling the Yellowstone River, I-90 travels northwest intersecting S-298 and US 191 in the county seat of Big Timber. The highway turns back southeast, passing south of Greycliff and the Greycliff rest area, located from the Idaho border. The highway passes through the Sweet Grass‚ÄìStillwater County border just west of Reed Point. After passing into Stillwater County, I-90 crosses over the river, and enters the county seat of Columbus, intersecting MT 78 south of the highway and S-306 on the north side of the highway. The highway is titled the Robert E. Ewing Jr. Memorial Highway between mileposts 410 and 424. I-90 intersects the Columbus rest area, from the Idaho border, followed by Park City before exiting Stillwater County.  Yellowstone and Big Horn counties  US 212 becomes concurrent with I-90 just east of Laurel before entering the county seat of Billings. I-90 Bus. passes into town as the main freeway travels south of Billings and bisects Billings Heights and Lockwood intersecting MT 3 and US 87, which joins the I-90/US 212 concurrency. On the extreme eastern end of Billings, the three highways intersect the western terminus of I-94, which heads northeast towards North Dakota, while I-90 turns southeast into Big Horn County. Immediately after entering Big Horn County the three highways pass the seasonal Hardin rest area. Entering Hardin, the county seat, the three highways intersect S-313 and MT 47\\\\. S-313 provides access to Yellowtail Dam, while MT 47 connects back to I-94. After exiting Hardin, I-90 turns south, entering the Crow Indian Reservation and intersects S-384, before reaching Crow Agency. Crow Agency is home to the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument and Reno‚ÄìBenteen Battlefield Memorial, which are passed after US 212 departs to the east. Continuing south, I-90/US 87 parallels S-451 and the Little Bighorn River, passing by Garryowen, Benteen, Lodge Grass and Wyola before exiting the state of Montana and entering Sheridan County, Wyoming.  Expansion of the Billings area corridor  The 2012 Billings area I-90 corridor planning study recommends many improvements to the corridor from Laurel through Lockwood, including construction of new east and westbound bridges over the Yellowstone River, with each bridge having three to four traffic lanes. Also recommended are construction of additional eastbound and westbound traffic lanes from Shiloh to Johnson Lane and reconstruction and widening of many of the bridges, interchanges and on-off ramps along the corridor at an estimated cost of $114 million.  History  Interstate 90 replaced US 10 between Livingston and the Idaho border, and before that, the Yellowstone Trail. The section over Homestake Pass cost $18.5 million to construct and was completed on October 30, 1966. The final two-lane section of the highway, near Springdale, was expanded to four lanes in May 1987. Until 1995 in Montana near the Idaho border, I-90 was not a divided highway for a few stretches, having only a narrow paved median. From 1995 until 1999, the daytime maximum speed limit in Montana was \\"reasonable and prudent.\\" As of October 1, 2015 the daytime and nighttime speed limits on Interstate Highways are for cars and light trucks and for heavy trucks, except within urban areas, where the maximum speed limit is 65 mph for all vehicles, day or night. According to an article in the Missoulian, dated September 28, 2015, \\"drivers headed east from Idaho on I-90 will be restricted to 75 mph for the first 34 miles, from Lookout Pass to just east of St. Regis. After St. Regis, there‚Äôll be an 80 mph limit for the next 60 miles past Superior, Alberton and Frenchtown. The 20-mile zone around Missoula starts a couple of miles west of the Wye, where it drops to 75. That decreases to 65 mph within the Missoula urban area, then it becomes 75 again near the eastbound East Missoula on-ramp. The 80 mph stretch resumes roughly seven miles later at Turah and remains in place to Butte, where the speed limit remains at 65 mph.\\" On I-90, at Exit 0 (right on the MT/ID border) is the Lookout Pass Ski Area, and one exit east of there is the Hiawatha Trail (rails-to-trails). In 1996, a section of I-90 was closed for nineteen days due to a train derailment and chlorine spill near Alberton, Montana.

While many games, such as bridge or poker require the use of deductive reasoning to some degree, deduction board games feature deductive reasoning as their central mechanic. Deduction board games typically fall into two broad categories; abstract and investigation games. Abstract Abstract deduction games have no theme and focus on pure abstract reasoning. Though abstract, some introduce random elements. For example, in the game Code 777, the question cards used to gather information are drawn at random. Notable members of this category include Black Box and Master Mind. Investigation games Investigation games are board games in which the players generally play as police, detectives or other investigators. The best known game of this type is Cluedo. In fact, many of games in this category utilize a mechanic known as \\"The Missing Card,\\" which was developed by Anthony E. Pratt for Cluedo (Clue in the United States). \\"The Missing Card\\" takes a known set of cards (or other token) and removes one or more of them. By gathering information and using deduction and logic, the players can determine which cards were removed to win the game. Other mechanics used in investigation games include the \\"one against all\\" mechanic, as seen in Scotland Yard, The Fury of Dracula and similar games. In these games, one player attempts to stay hidden as the others attempt to discover his location. There are some games, such as Lie Detector, published by Mattel in 1960, that use unique mechanics. This game used punch cards and plastic lie-detector machine that players could use to determine if statements were true or false. While popular, this game did not produce imitators akin to those from Cluedo or Scotland Yard.

Yaroslav was defeated by the Polish duke. It was part of the war of succession following the death of Vladimir the Great in 1015. Boleslaw supported his son-in-law, Sviatopolk (known as Sviatopolk the Damned for his murder of his half-brothers Boris and Gleb), who was eventually defeated by Yaroslav. Both armies met on opposite banks of the river Bug.Wyprawa Kijowska Chrobrego... p.8 Yaroslav's forces took up positions with archers covering the crossing points; Boles≈Çaw took his time, allowing his army to rest, and started work on several makeshift bridges. The main battle occurred on 23 July.Wyprawa Kijowska Chrobrego... p.9 According to Polish chronicler Gall Anonim, the battle occurred by accident: Boles≈Çaw decided to throw a feast to boost morale of his army; Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to stir up trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river - but they only succeeded in annoying them so much that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased Yaroslav's much-surprised advance troops away. Boles≈Çaw learned about this quicker than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river and attack the surprised Kievan prince, who didn't manage to muster his army in time; the Kievan army quickly broke rank and fled. However a Russian chronicle, Tale of Bygone Years gives a slightly different version of these events, one version which both armies were combat-ready and facing each other across the river, and Boles≈Çaw, enraged by insults hurled by the Rus' army, charged across the army with at the head of his army, surprising Yaroslav and shattering the Kievan army. Most modern historians support Gall Anonim's version, and all agree that after a short battle the Polish Duke was victorious, scoring a major victory. Yaroslav retreated to Novogrod, not Kiev - likely suspecting that he has not enough strength left to defend Kiev, besieged by the Pechengs, and with a significant pro-Sviatopolk (Boleslaw's son-in-law) faction inside the city. While Yaroslav lost the battle, he was able to raise troops among the Novgorodians and eventually defeat his half- brother Sviatopolk and consolidate his position in Kiev, where he ruled over the golden age of Kievan Rus' until his death in 1054.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia 980-1054 (Cambrdige: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 22-23. Thus, in spite of this defeat at the hands of the Polish duke, Yaroslav became the greatest of the Kievan rulers.

Jewett in 1872. Jewett moved here from the U.S.A. and had five sawmills on the lower reaches of the rivers (this would become his largest mill yard.) The mill employed close to 100 men in its heyday and many of them lived in mill houses on the property. Disaster ended the mill's operations on May 17, 1901. Three men were killed when the mill's main chimney fell. Two men, William Price and George McCluskey were over 100 feet high on the inside the chimney repairing the masonry and Charles Wilson was inside the base of the chimney when it fell. The Mill never reopened and it burnt to the ground less than ten years later. Lt. Cdr. G.G.K. (Don) Holder (WWII) purchased the Jewett Mill property from Jewett's heirs and started another shipyard following his service in the Second World War building sail yachts and small craft as the \\"Blue Peter Boat Works.\\" The times weren't right and the business failed. Don Holder's father and mother Lt. Col. G.G.K. (Gordon) Holder (World War I and World War II) and Edith (Kee) Holder bought the land from their son and lived there happily for half a century while \\"the Colonel\\" operated a haulout and storage yard for pleasure craft until a disastrous fire destroyed many boats and the storage buildings. The property was later purchased by G.A.(Sandy) Robertson, a Millidgeville resident for half a century who developed the subdivision there now. Other businesses in Millidgeville through the years were a number of small stores including John Tobin's General Store in the late 19th century, Walter Vincent Sr.'s store at the NW end of Millidge Avenue and W. Roy Giggey's Grocery store on the NE end of Millidge Avenue in the early-to-mid 20th century. The McCoskery family had a farm on Manners Sutton Road in the early 19th century and the Turner family had a farm on what is now the Kenneth Irving property on Kennebecasis Drive. The Ring family's boat service business started in the early 20th century by Grenville Ring and carried on after Grenville's death by his son Bob and now his grandson Jodie. Some families have lived in Millidgeville for several generations. There are still members of families who were living in Millidgeville prior to 1950 when development of the area started after the Millidgeville Airport shut down. There are members of the Seely, White, Giggey, Cobham, Holder, Craft, and Ringfamilies still living in Millidgeville today. Millidgeville had fewer than 100 year round residents until the early 1950s. Millidgeville was largely a summer cottage area for Saint John residents who wanted to get out of the fog. Development started in the 1950s on the former airport property and spread from there. New streets including Kennebecasis Drive, Daniel Avenue, Bedell Avenue, Woodward Avenue and University Avenue were constructed. With numerous side streets built off the main roads Millidgeville is now a bedroom community of Saint John. Today, Millidgeville is home to the University of New Brunswick (UNBSJ) Saint John campus in Tucker Park, as well as the Saint John Regional Hospital, the city's largest employer and the province's largest hospital. Amenities include the RKYC, Rockwood Park, Canada's second largest urban park with a public golf course, the Charles Gorman Arena, tennis courts and several sports fields.

The station is an affiliate of Radio Mindanao Network in the Philippines. Its studio and transmitter is located at Primax compound, Upper Dominican Hill, Baguio, Philippines. The station's radio format consists of Classic hits, OPM and Adult contemporary. Memories FM 107.1, formerly known as Smooth Jazz 107.1 and Smooth FM 107.1, was a very popular radio station in Baguio during the years 2000‚Äì2003 with young professionals, college and high school students. Little was known about the pioneering D.J.'s like Danny V., Dr. Soul, and Johnny Handsome when the station was transitioned from Mellow Touch (which ran a love song format) to Smooth Jazz 107.1 in 1997. Contrary to its name, Smooth Jazz structured its playlist on American Top 40 hits during a time when the Baguio radio scene was dominated by the novelty (or masa) sound. It was also the only radio station at that time that intentionally did not play music by Boy Bands. D.J.'s like Nicki, K.C. Jones, and J. Webber played a big part in the station's rise to fame. The Smooth Jazz 107.1 format was a mix of Alternative, Nu-Metal, Hip-Hop, R&B;, love songs and pop Jazz. Smooth Jazz: 1997 - 2002 During its transition from Mellow Touch 107.1 in 1997, Smooth Jazz's radio format was strictly jazz. With the rising popularity of Hip Hop and R&B; in the late 90s, Smooth Jazz 107.1 slowly started incorporating hit songs from these genres into its playlist and was the only radio station in Baguio doing so at that time. The growing number of listeners requesting for more R&B; and Hip Hop songs led to the birth of Smooth Jazz's first flagship program, the Beatbox. The Beatbox Established by DJ John McKnight, the Beatbox was the first radio program in Baguio solely dedicated to R&B; (McKnight would later move to rival station Jesse @ 102.3 to establish a similar program called \\"The Groove\\"). Fil-Canadian KC Jones took over after McKnight and soon the program started to gain momentum. Jones added a weekly countdown and partnered with radio personality Private Ryan. KC Jones left Smooth Jazz in 2000 to go back to Canada. The Beatbox was then taken over by Fil-American J. Webber who started incorporating more Hip Hop and Rap to the program. This coincided with increased popularity of those genres in the early 2000s. The KBP-RRC radio survey of that year had Smooth Jazz 107.1 capturing the number 1 spot for the time slot of the Beatbox. Webby (as he was called by his listeners), also used the Beatbox to promote local rap groups such as the 2600 Kings (formerly Six Sign) and the Renegades of Funk. Webber allowed these groups to perform on air which led to some of them being signed by Philippine hip hop legend Boom Dayupay. J. Webber left in 2002 and the Beatbox was then managed by John Blaze (later known as DJ Blaze of K-Lite) until the station reformatted. The Breakfast Club DJ's Nicki and Sebastian Kidd hosted the morning show called \\"The Breakfast Club\\". Another innovative radio program in Baguio that closely followed the format of Manila personalities like Chico and Delamar, The Breakfast Club would evolve around random topics which would let listeners interact with the DJs and give their opinion. Nicki and Kidd's thoughtful and witty comments drew even more listeners to Smooth Jazz 107.1 every morning. Smooth FM: 2002 - 2017 In the 2nd half of 2002, Smooth Jazz lost 3 of its popular personalities who played major roles in the station's success. Jersey and J. Webber moved to ABS-CBN's MOR 103.1, while Nicki pursued another career outside radio. The tagline is now \\"Your Stress-Free Radio\\" replacing the erstwhile popular catchphrase \\"Take it Easy.\\" Smooth FM used to be an affiliate of Raven Broadcasting Corporation in Manila. It was known as City Lite 107.1. City Lite was dropped from the name when Raven Broadcasting Corporation changed hands sometime in 2000 and 107.1 ceased to be an affiliate. MemoRieS FM: 2017 - present In March 2017, Smooth FM 107.1 was reformatted and rebranded as MemoRies FM 107.1, It plays classic hits from the 70s, 80s & 90s, with occasional 60s.

Early life Taniguchi Sumiteru was born in Fukuora, Japan in 1929. His mother passed away when he was a year and a half. After this, his father decided to relocate elsewhere for work and ended up being a locomotive operator in Manchuria. Taniguchi and his two brothers went to live with his mother's family in Nagasaki where he was raised by his aunt. In early 1943, Taniguchi began working as a carrier for the Nishiura-Kami post office in Nagasaki. He continued this into 1945 when the nuclear explosion took place.  Atomic bombing of Nagasaki  On the morning of 9 August 1945, the 16-year-old Taniguchi was approximately north from the hypocenter, delivering mail on his bicycle without a shirt on due to the warm summer weather, when \\"Fat Man\\" exploded in the sky over Urakami. The bomb's heat flash heavily injured Taniguchi with near instant burns resulting, but the blast that arrived afterward did not cause any severe injuries to him, as he clung to the ground while buildings were blown down around him. Heavy burns melted skin from his back and left arm, but Taniguchi states that he did not bleed or feel any pain due to the nerve endings being burned away. Tired and disoriented, he walked over to the tunnel of Mitsubishi Sumiyoshi Tunnel Arms Factory located about 200 meters away from where he was at the time of the blast,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/peoplescentury/episodes/fallout/taniguchitranscript.html where a female survivor assisted in cutting off loose portions of skin and rubbed machine oil on his damaged arm..  Recovery  Photograph of Taniguchi taken by USMC photographer Joe O'Donnell in January 1946, it has been featured in multiple exhibitions and is currently held by the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum. Taniguchi's business card featured this photograph with the caption, \\"I want you to understand, if only a little, the horror of nuclear weapons.\\" Come nightfall Taniguchi was carried to a hill to rest, where he was surrounded by confused and thirsty survivors. The next morning everyone but Taniguchi was dead. During the next two days rescue teams passed by without noticing him, as he was too weak to muster a call for help. Taniguchi was finally rescued on 11 August and taken to a country clinic about 29 km (18 miles) away from Nagasaki. By mid-September he was moved to a primary school clinic in Nagasaki to receive the first course of medical treatment from a University Hospital team. The clinic was unsanitary and initial treatments proved inadequate as his wounds became infected and worsened. In November Taniguchi was transferred to Omura Navy Hospital, where he spent the next 21 months lying on his stomach due to the severe third degree burns on his back. During this time Taniguchi developed severe bedsores on his chest. As he recalls, \\"holes opened between my ribs and the movement of my heart and other organs became visible through the skin.\\" In October 1945, U.S. Marine photographer Joe O'Donnell snapped a picture of Taniguchi's back while recording the aftermath of the bombing in 50 Japanese cities; this photograph is now exhibited in museums as a graphic depiction of the injuries suffered by survivors of the bombings. The color photograph(s) of Sumiteru Taniguchi's red back are from motion picture film taken by (attributed to) Lieutenant Herbert Sussan. Sergeant Joe O'Donnell took an earlier black and white photograph and this is included in his book, Japan 1945: A U.S. Marine's Photographs from Ground Zero. By May 1947, Taniguchi could finally sit up, and on 20 March 1949, he was discharged from the Omura hospital. He returned to work back at the post office in Nagasaki shortly upon discharge despite needing to receive medical treatment and doctors advising him that he would not be able to. His wounds were not treated properly until 1960, however, and continued to cause him great physical discomfort until his death. The improper burn healing and to some degree the delayed stochastic effects of radiation exposure during and after the bombings manifested in the growth of numerous burn keloid tumors. From 2007 until his death, Taniguchi had undergone ten surgeries to remove benign growths. Taniguchi also had multiple skin grafting surgeries on his back and left arm.  Activism  Taniguchi devoted his life to informing people of the consequences of the 1945 atomic bombing and campaigning against nuclear proliferation. He made frequent public appearances to speak to student groups and participate in demonstrations calling for nuclear disarmament. Taniguchi gave numerous interviews recounting his experiences and was featured in Steven Okazaki's 2007 documentary White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

It is the only museum outside Australia dedicated solely to Indigenous Australian art. The museum houses many important breakthrough paintings of the Papunya movement and Arnhem Land artists. The collection comprises more than 2000 objects in a variety of media, including bark and acrylic paintings, sculpture, photography, prints and artifacts. The director of the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection is anthropologist Dr. Margo Smith AM. The museum is located at Pantops Farm, a university-owned property once owned by Thomas Jefferson in the Pantops neighborhood of Charlottesville, Virginia.  History = History of the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection  The Kluge-Ruhe Collection receives its namesake from the two American men who collected the majority of the artwork, media mogul John W. Kluge and English Professor Edward L. Ruhe. Kluge experienced a powerful visual attraction to Aboriginal art in 1988 when he attended the exhibition, Dreamings: The Art of Aboriginal Australia, at the Asia Society Galleries in New York City. Beginning in 1989, he visited Australia on several occasions, hired curatorial advisers and commissioned or collected more than 600 artworks. In 1993, Kluge seized the opportunity to acquire the collection of the late Edward L. Ruhe (1923-1989). Ruhe was a Professor of English at the University of Kansas who began collecting Aboriginal art in 1965 while in Australia as a Fulbright Visiting Professor. Ruhe was the first person to exhibit a privately owned collection of Aboriginal art in the United States, which toured more than twenty venues between 1966 and 1977. After acquiring Ruhe‚Äôs collection, Kluge continued to collect and commission Aboriginal art, and ultimately decided his world-class collection would be best used at a university where it would be available for scholarly research and study. He donated his collection to the University of Virginia in 1997 and the museum opened in its current location in 1999.  History of the Building  The Kluge-Ruhe Collection's building rests on the land of the Monacan Indian Nation, who lived on and cared for the land and waters of the region. In 1746 Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas Jefferson, purchased land east of Charlottesville that included this location. Thomas Jefferson inherited the land upon his father‚Äôs death and named it Pantops, meaning ‚Äúall-seeing,‚Äù and sold the property in 1815. In 1938, James Cheek of Nashville bought the property and hired master architect Benjamin Charles Baker to build the current colonial revival style house. It changed ownership several times until Eugene and Ann Worrell gave the building back to the University in 1998 to support its academic mission.  Mission  The Kluge- Ruhe Collection aims to expand knowledge and understanding of Indigenous Australian art and culture to cultivate greater appreciation of human diversity and creativity. One of its core institutional priorities is to build and sustain collaborative relationships to deepen their impact and extend their reach with the Indigenous people of Australia. This includes hosting more than 20 Indigenous knowledge holders each year. Because the museum is located across the world from the people whose art they showcase, the museum values the role of Indigenous artist and leaders as authorities on their art and culture. Past visiting artists include Judy Watson, Reko Rennie, Nici Cumpston, Djambawa Marawili, Vernon Ah Kee, David Bosun, Ricardo Idagi, Janet Fieldhouse, Yhonnie Scarce, Jason Wing, Ricky Maynard, James Tylor, Jenni Kemarre Martiniello, Carol McGregor, Kent Morris, Raymond Bulambula, Mrs Gorriyindi, and many others.

In the older chemical literature as well as contemporary materials science textbooks, a \\"metal hydride\\" is assumed to be nonmolecular, i.e. three-dimensional lattices of atomic ions. In such systems, hydrides are often interstitial and nonstoichiometric, and the bonding between the metal and hydrogen atoms is significantly ionic. In contrast, complex metal hydrides typically contain more than one type of metal or metalloid and may be soluble but invariably react with water. They exhibit ionic bonding between a positive metal ion with molecular anions containing the hydride. In such materials the hydrogen is bonded with significant covalent character to the second metal or metalloid atoms.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . Examples In general, complex metal hydrides have the formula MxM'yHn, where M is an alkali metal cation or cation complex and M' is a metal or metalloid. Well known examples feature group 13 elements, especially boron and aluminium including sodium aluminium hydride, NaAlH4 (also known as sodium alanate), lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH4, and lithium borohydride, (LiBH4).

The locally recruited Syrian, ‚ÄòAlawi, Lebanese, Circassian, Kurdish and Druze units of this force were designated as the Special Troops of the Levant (Troupes Speciales du Levant). Origins Henri Gouraud on horseback inspecting French colonial troops at Maysalun. In September 1919, Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau entered an agreement to replace the British troops occupying Cilicia by a French force. The first elements of this new army came from the former 156th Infantry Division () of the Allied Army of the Orient, under general Julien Dufieux command. This division de Cilicie included a metropolitan regiment, the 412th Infantry Regiment (), a colonial r√©giment, the 17th Senegalese Trailleurs Regiment (), a French Armenian Legion regiment and the 18th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment (). In 1920 this division became the first of four Divisions of the Levant. In 1920, the French were given a mandate over Syria and Lebanon by the League of Nations. During this period Syria was known as the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon was known as the French Mandate of Lebanon. From 19 April to 26 April 1920 the San Remo Conference was held in Sanremo, Italy. After this conference was concluded, the short-lived monarchy of King Faisal's was defeated at the Battle of Maysalun by French troops under the command of General Mariano Goybet, during the Franco-Syrian War. The French army under General Henri Gouraud then occupied the Mandate of Syria and the Mandate of Lebanon. A force called the Syrian Legion was raised by the French authorities shortly after the establishment of the two mandates. This comprised both cavalry and infantry units and was drawn mainly from minority groups within Syria itself. Inter- war period Following the Druze revolt of 1925-1927, the Syrian Legion was reorganized into the \\"Special Troops of the Levant\\" () augmented by North African infantry (tirailleurs) and cavalry (spahis), French Foreign Legion (), and Colonial Infantry/Artillery units (both French and Senegalese). The whole force constituted the Army of the Levant and was responsible for keeping order in both French mandates during the interwar period. Circassian cavalry of the Army of the Levant with their commander Colonel Philibert Collet.Time Magazine, Mixed Show Army The French Mandate Administration followed a principle of divide and rule in organising the Troupes Speciales. To a large extent the Sunni Muslim Arabs, who made up about 65% of the population of Syria, were excluded from service with the Troupes Speciales, who were drawn mainly from the Druze, Christian, Circassian and ‚ÄòAlawi minorities. During the period from 1926 to 1939, the Army of the Levant included between 10,000 and 12,000 locally engaged troops organized into: ten battalions of infantry (mostly ‚ÄòAlawis), four squadrons of cavalry (Druze, Circassian and mixed Syrian), three companies of camel corps (m√©haristes), engineer, armoured car, and support units. In addition, there were 9 companies of Lebanese light infantry (chasseurs libanais) and 22 squadrons of Druze, Circassian, and Kurdish mounted infantry forming the auxiliary troops (Troupes Supplementaires). This latter force provided a form of military police (gendarmerie) for internal security purposes and were primarily deployed in the areas of their recruitment. Some of the Lebanese units were trained as ski troops for mountain service and wore the berets of the French elite mountain infantry (Chasseurs Alpins). The Circassian cavalry (Groupement d' Escadrons Tcherkess) originated with Muslim refugees from the northern Caucasus region, who fled Tsarist Russian expansion during the nineteenth century. An estimated 850,000 sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire, of whom 30,000 were settled in Syria where they were employed in frontier regions as mounted tribal irregulars. From this role they passed into French service after 1920.Didier Philippi, pages 20-22 \\"Militaria Mai 2017\\", Histoire & Collections By 1938, the Troupes Speciales numbered 10,000, with 306 officers of whom only 88 were French. A military academy (√âcole Militaire) was established at Homs to train Syrian and Lebanese officers and specialist non-commissioned officers (NCOs). French policy continued to favour the recruitment of specific ethnic and religious minority groups. General Huntziger, the military commander in Syria, stated in 1935: \\"we mustn't forget that the Alawis and Druzes are the only warlike races in our mandate and make first-rate soldiers among whom we recruit our best Troupes Speciales\\".Christopher M. Andrew, page 236 \\"France Overseas. The Great War and the Climax of French Imperial Expansion\\", 1981 Thames and Hudson Ltd, London Auxiliaries As noted above locally recruited auxiliary troops (Troupes Supplementaires) were deployed for domestic security purposes in specific regions (Grand Liban, Aleppo and Damascus). These included units of gendarmerie, mobile guards and rural guards. Naval When Admiral Henri du Cou√´dic de Ker√©rant took command in June 1924, the Naval Division of the Levant (DNL) was mainly composed of the command ship, the armored cruiser Waldeck-Rousseau, three armed warships, Bethune, Baccarat and Mondement and two gunboats Agile and Dedaigneuse. The Waldeck-Rousseau was to be recalled in France at the end of the year to be disarmed, due to budgetary restrictions. It will not be replaced, but a number of other ships, including the \\"Jeanne d'Arc\\" will compensate for this decrease in the French presence in the Levant. The Levant naval division's area of operation included the eastern Mediterranean, the Marmara Sea and the Straits, as well as the Black Sea, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden (aviso Diana.) A Naval Commander heads land services in Beirut; reporting, in peacetime, to the Admiral commanding the Naval division of the Levant and, in wartime, to the High Commissioner Uniforms and insignia Uniforms of the Troupes Speciales varied according to arm of service but showed a mixture of French and Levantine influences. Indigenous personnel wore either the keffiyeh headdress (red for Druze and white for other units), fezzes or turbans. The Circassian mounted troops wore a black full dress that closely resembled that of the Caucasian Cossacks, complete with astrakhan hats (see photograph above). A common feature across the Troupes Speciales was the use of \\"violette\\" (purple- red) as a facing colour on tunic collar patches, belts and kepis. Squadron or branch insignia often included regional landmarks such as the cedars of Lebanon or the main mosque of Damascus. Army of the Levant during World War II On 22 June, after the Fall of France, the forces in the Levant sided with the Vichy Government of Marshal Philippe P√©tain. In 1941, British Commonwealth, Free French and other Allied forces launched \\"Operation Exporter,\\" the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. They attacked the Army of the Levant from the British Mandate of Palestine and from the Kingdom of Iraq, recently occupied during the Anglo-Iraqi War. On 8 June 1941 at 2 am, British, Australian, and Free French forces crossed into Syria and Lebanon. French command During \\"Operation Exporter,\\" the Army of the Levant was commanded by General Henri Dentz. Dentz was also the High Commissioner of the Levant. Lieutenant-General Joseph-Antoine-Sylvain-Raoul de Verdillac was second in command at the time of the British invasion. French Army In 1941 the Army of the Levant was still divided into troops from Metropolitan France, colonial troops, and the \\"Special Troops of the Levant\\" ().Andrew Mollo, p.144 The regular French troops consisted of four battalions of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e REI (according to Dentz, these were the best troops available to the Vichy French command) and three battalions of the 24th Colonial Infantry Regiment (French regulars enlisted for overseas service). The latter were brought up to strength by amalgamating them with two garrison battalions of Senegalese troops to form the \\"Mixed Colonial Regiment\\" (Regiment Mixte Coloniale). The Troupes Speciales were formed by 11 battalions of infantry: three Lebanese Light Infantry Battalions () and eight Syrian battalions (bataillons de Levant). In addition, there were two artillery groups and supporting units. The \\"special troops\\" included at least 5,000 cavalry organized in squadrons of around 100 men each. Included in the cavalry force were 15 squadrons of Circassian cavalry of which three were motorized. The Troupes Speciales were led by indigenous officers and non-commissioned officers with a small cadre of French officers. The African troops comprised six Algerian, three Tunisian, three Senegalese, and one Moroccan rifle (tirailleur) battalions. The contingent of North African cavalry consisted of the 4th Tunisian, the 1st Moroccan, and the 8th Algerian Spahis and amounted to about 7,000 Arab and Berber troopers with mostly French officers. Most were on horseback or in light trucks, while a few were equipped with armored cars. There was also a mechanized cavalry element provided by the 6th and 7th \\"African Light Horse\\" (Chasseurs d' Afrique) which totalled 90 tanks (mostly Renault R-35 with a few Renault FTs) and a similar number of armored cars.Andrew Mollo, p.145 The artillery available to the Vichy French consisted of 120 field and medium guns and numbered about 6,700 men. French Air Forces The Vichy French Air Force () of the French Air Force in the Levant was relatively strong at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939. But, in 1940, many of the aircraft stationed in Syria and Lebanon were sent back to Metropolitan France. This left the Vichy French in the Levant with only a number of obsolete models. However, alarmed by the growing threat of British invasion, a fighter group was dispatched from Algeria before the invasion. Once the fighting started, three additional groups were flown from France and from North Africa. This brought the strength of the Vichy French air force in Lebanon and Syria up to 289 aircraft, including about 35 state-of-the-art Dewoitine D.520 fighters and some new, US-built Glenn Martin 167 light bombers. This initially gave the Vichy French an edge over the Allied air units. But the loss of Vichy French aircraft was very high: 179 aircraft were lost during the campaign, most having been destroyed on the ground.Andrew Mollo, p.146 French Naval Forces Two destroyers and three submarines of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) were available to support the Vichy forces in the Levant. Polish Brigade On 12 April 1940, after the invasion and fall of Poland, the Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade was formed from Polish exiles in the Levant. While not part of the Army of the Levant, the brigade specialized in mountain warfare and was to be the Polish addition to Allied plans for landings in the Balkans. On 30 June, the brigade was transported to Palestine. End of French rule Following the Vichy defeat in 1941, the French and African components of the Army of the Levant were for the most part repatriated to their territories of origin. A minority (including some Lebanese and Syrians) took the opportunity to join the Free French Forces. Free French General Georges Catroux took control of Syria after the defeat of the Vichy French. On 26 November 1941, shortly after taking up this post, Catroux recognised the independence of Lebanon and Syria in the name of Free France. Even so, a period of military occupation followed. On 8 November 1943, after elections, Lebanon became an independent state. On 27 February 1945, Lebanon declared war on Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan. On 1 January 1944, Syria followed Lebanon and also became an independent state. On 26 February 1945, Syria declared war on Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan. The Troupes Sp√©ciales had remained in existence during the military occupation, still under French authority until August 1945. Most then transferred to the new Syrian Army. The founders of the post-independence Lebanese Army also trained as officers in the Troupes Sp√©ciales.John Keegan \\"World Armies\\" See also * Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Lebanon) * 1936 Syrian general strike * League of Nations * Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire * Syria-Lebanon Campaign * Levant Crisis * Vichy French Air Force * Army of Africa (France) * French Colonial Forces * History of the Arm√©e de l'Air (1909‚Äì1942) * History of the Arm√©e de l'Air (colonial presence 1939‚Äì1962) * French colonial flags * French Colonial Empire * List of French possessions and colonies References  FootnotesExternal links * * Category:Middle East theatre of World War II Category:Mediterranean theatre of World War II Category:Military history of Lebanon Category:Military history of Syria Category:Military history of France during World War II Category:Military units and formations of France in World War II Category:Military of Vichy France Category:French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon ","title":"Army of the Levant"},{"id":"12754013","text":"Lyness is a village on the east coast of the island of Hoy, Orkney, Scotland.

Background On June 18, 2003, Nireah Johnson, 17, and her friend Brandie Coleman, 18, were riding around with another friend. The trio saw Paul Moore riding in a car driven by Curtis Ward, and asked them to pull into a gas station parking lot. Johnson and Moore got out of their vehicles, talked briefly and exchanged numbers. Moore reportedly said he was attracted to Johnson, and believed Johnson was a female. Moore later told police that Johnson kissed him on the cheek when they parted, and they agreed to meet later. He denied meeting Johnson at a later date. Murder According to court documents, at 12:51 a.m. on July 23, Coleman called Moore's home to speak with Ward. Coleman and Johnson then drove to Moore's apartment. The four talked outside and then went into the apartment. Ward and Coleman went into Ward's room, while Moore and Johnson went into Moore's room. Moore later entered Ward's room with a Ruger P90 handgun and asked to speak with Ward. The two men went into the kitchen, where Moore asked if Ward knew whether Johnson was male or female. The two men went into the living room, where Moore asked Johnson and Coleman whether Johnson was male or female. When Johnson went to use the bathroom, after forty minutes of discussion, Moore followed and discovered Johnson was a trans woman. Moore became upset, and then asked Ward to get some wire. They used the wire to bind Coleman's and Johnson's hands behind their backs. Moore put Johnson and Coleman in the back seat of their vehicle, and told Ward to follow him. Moore drove to a wooded area in Fall Creek Corridor Park in Indianapolis. Ward made a U-turn after which Moore entered Ward's vehicle and shot Johnson and Coleman to death. Moore then dismantled the handgun and threw the pieces out of the window. The men then returned to Moore's home. That afternoon, Moore called Ward to suggest they set fire to the vehicle they had left Johnson and Coleman in. Ward spoke to Moore's half-brother, Clarence McGee, who had seen Johnson's and Coleman's bodies in the vehicle. McGee and Ward returned to the park that night with a can of gasoline and burned the vehicle containing Johnson's and Coleman's bodies. Discovery Johnson's and Coleman's bodies were found later, on the night of July 23, when firefighters were alerted to a burning vehicle. They were found lying on the back seat of the Jeep. Their bodies were burned beyond recognition, and investigators were unable to determine the race or sex of either victim. Police treated the deaths as homicides, though they had not yet determined whether the victims had been murdered. On July 24, the Marion County, Indiana coroner's office released Johnson's and Coleman's names as homicide victims. The coroner's report said that each had been shot in the forehead before the fire started. Investigators determined that gasoline had been poured into the back seat and ignited. Authorities were alerted when Coleman's mother, Mary Coleman recognized the vehicle in news reports, from the FedEx plate on the front. Mary Coleman, who worked at FedEx, called a television station, and the station then contacted the police. Aftermath=Arrests Paul Moore was arrested on Thursday, July 31, 2003, after Adrian Beverly identified him as the passenger she had seen in Ward's car on July 18, with Johnson and Coleman. Police were also led to Moore when ballistics tests revealed that the .45 caliber bullets removed from the victims matched a gun taken from Moore during a disturbance in 2002. Moore was charged with murder, confinement, and arson. Ward was arrested, and charged with confinement, arson, and assisting a criminal. Clarence McGee was arrested as well. Trial Moore and McGee went to trial in April 2004. Ward testified against Moore and McGee in exchange for lesser charges. The jury found both men guilty. Moore was convicted on two counts of murder, criminal confinement, and arson. McGee was convicted of arson, assisting a criminal, and obstruction of justice. On May 5, 2004 judge Robert Altice gave Moore combined sentences of 120 years for the murders of Johnson and Coleman. Moore received consecutive 55 year sentences for the murder of Johnson and Coleman, and concurrent ten-year sentences for each count of confinement and arson. McGee was sentenced to 10 years in prison for being an accomplice. Moore's conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal in May 2005.

The land the company operated on is designated as a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund cleanup site. Operated from the 1960s until 1989, chemicals were brought to the company in rail tank cars. The contents were off-loaded into 55-gallon drums which were stored on the lot until the chemicals were transferred into smaller containers for re-sale. An investigation by the Oakland Fire Department, Alameda County and the U.S. Coast Guard found over 100 full and empty 5- and 55-gallon drums, some of which were leaking. Subsequent to AMCO ceasing operations in 1989, the lot was used by DC Metals for scrap storage until 1998, and by Cable Moore, Inc. for cable storage until the present time. In June 1995, a construction crew digging a trench noted a strong chemical odor in the dirt. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), DC Metals, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted an investigation which uncovered chlorinated solvents and other contaminants, including vinyl chloride, and soil gas. Due to the presence of groundwater found during the investigation, emergency remediation processes were initiated but later ceased before completion. The EPA had collected enough data to determine the nature and extent of contamination in the groundwater and soil beneath the former facility. Around 90 chemicals in the groundwater and 40 chemicals in soil beneath the former AMCO facility exceeded screening levels. The EPA also collected soil and produce samples in the yards of residences next to the former AMCO facility fence line (on Center and Third streets). The samples were tested for VOCs, metals and pesticides. Lead was detected at high concentrations in a limited number of soil samples. The levels in the shallow and deep soil samples range from 26.2 to 53,000 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg). Some of these levels are well above levels that would be considered safe for residential exposure, particularly for children. Urban soils typically have lead levels of about 500 mg/kg. In Oakland, naturally occurring lead level for native soil is 14 mg/kg. The site was listed on the National Priority List (Superfund) on September 29, 2003. The detailed remediation investigation concluded in 2006. Remediation activities= Initial remediation (1997-1998)  Remediation efforts began with the construction of a ground water and soil vapor extraction (SVE) treatment system. Between January 1997 through July 1998, approximately 7,000 pounds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), approximately 40 pounds of which were vinyl chloride, were extracted from the soil and groundwater. The SVE ceased operation in July 1998 due to concerns from nearby residents over exposure to fumes from the exhaust of the system. During the remediation process, additional contamination from methylene chloride, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), and trichloroethene (TCE) were discovered. Detailed assessments taken during the emergency remediation effort revealed that the danger to the surrounding residences was not imminent but the site would pose long-term dangers.  Second decontamination (2015-2018)  A second round of soil vapor extraction from the contaminated site occurred in 2017 after years of planning and setup. A SVE system was used to extract toxic vapor from soil on the site in a $10 million dollar operation. By 2018 all equipment had been removed by the EPA.

One of only two steel arch bridges within Colorado, Red Cliff Bridge has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985 and is the state's only cantilevered steel arch bridge. The bridge was designed by King Burghardt, an engineer at the Colorado Department of Highways, and built by contractor P.M. Kenney in 1940, using steel components fabricated by the Minnesota-Moline Power Implement Company. Construction was difficult, with workers hanging over a drop while working in temperatures that sometimes dipped below . Burghardt wrote in his journal, \\"In the morning, each gang was lifted to its scaffold on a platform hung from the high line. They took their lunches with them and spent the entire day in the air with the winter wind continually blowing up the canyon.\\" After more than 60 years since its construction, the bridge had deteriorated to the point that major restoration work was required. The work was completed between March and November 2004 at a cost of $3.6 million, with $1.6 million coming from the Federal Highway Administration. The bridge deck was replaced and widened and much of the steel was repainted. However, because of the bridge's historic status, care was taken to maintain the visual aesthetic.

He got into skiing at age 6, which was the same time his older brothers Michael and Mark began skiing. Over the following years, various family vacations to Vermont for spring break got the family hooked on freestyle skiing. Eventually the whole family, including youngest sister Jennifer,New School Freestylers share the spotlight were participating in mogul and other competitions throughout Canada on a regular basis over the course of the whole winter. By age 13, and after years of keeping up with them, David surpassed his older brothers in skiing ability. As a freestyle mogul competitor, David won the 1999 Canadian Junior National Championships. He was only 15 years old at the time, which meant he had defeated many competitors as old as 19 years old to take that title. Also during that season David was a finalist in a Nor-Am moguls competition, as well as a bronze medalist in moguls at the 1999 Canada Winter Games in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador.http://cms.nortia.org/Org/Org38/Content/Games/SearchGameResults.asp It was no surprise that at the end of the 1999 winter David was called up to the Canadian National Development Ski Team for moguls. As a 15-year-old, he was one of the youngest ever to join the team. Although David enjoyed competitive moguls very much, the sport of freestyle skiing was rapidly changing, and his true passion was with newschool skiing, including terrain park, halfpipe skiing and urban rails. In 2001 David won the World Skiing Invitational (WSI) slopestyle event at Whistler-Blackcomb, and placed third in the WSI big air event.EXPN.com: - EXPN.com - DAVE CRICHTON Athlete Bio In 2002, David placed third in both the halfpipe and big air events at the US Freeskiing Open at Vail Ski Resort, and won the best hit event at the 2002 WSI.

He was the 74th Associate Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court. Previously he was a circuit court judge for Clackamas County, Oregon. His great uncle was United States Senator Rufus C. Holman. Early life A fourth generation Oregonian, Ralph Holman was born on June 7, 1914 in Portland, Oregon, but grew up in Molalla, Oregon, southeast of Portland. There he attended elementary school and graduated in 1932 from Molalla High School (from which eight Holmans have graduated).Cargill, Linda. Molalla High grads create scholarships to say thanks. The Oregonian, June 16, 2005. During the Great Depression, he worked as a clerk during the daytime, posting relief checks. At night, he attended the Northwestern College of Law (now Lewis & Clark Law School) in Portland, Oregon.

Holman began practicing law in Oregon City, Oregon, with the firm Butler, Jack, Beckett and Holman, before joining the United States Navy during World War II. He served from 1942 to 1946, when he was discharged as a Chief Petty Officer. During this time, he lost his lower left leg in a forklift accident. Judicial career After World War II, Holman returned to Oregon, where he was appointed to the Clackamas County Circuit Court by Governor Douglas McKay in 1950. He served as a circuit court judge for 15 years, until 1965. While on the bench in that court, he served on the Committee on the Administration of Justice created by the Oregon Legislature, and was chairman of the subcommittee on Juvenile Law. Through his efforts on this committee, the legislature passed a law which allowed for abusive parents to lose their parental rights, thereby enabling abused children to become adopted. Holman's 1960 decision in Dickman v. School District No. 62C, a case that allowed the use of public funds for purchasing textbooks for parochial schools, spurred an appeals process that ultimately led to the United States Supreme Court. His decision was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court, which argued the \\"child benefit\\" theory could not be used to justify public expenditures for private causes. The United States Supreme Court left this decision intact when they denied certiorari.Dickman v. School Dist. No. 62C, Oregon City, Clackamas County, 232 Or. 238, 366 P.2d 533 (1961) In 1964, Holman was elected to the Oregon Supreme Court, the state's highest court, filling the position of George Rossman whose term had expired.Oregon Blue Book: Earliest Authorities in Oregon - Supreme Court Justices of Oregon.

History  The monastery was founded in 1149 by William de Glastonia on the site since known as Little Bindon near Bindon Hill on the coast near Lulworth Cove as a daughter house of Forde Abbey, but the terrain proved too demanding to sustain the community. In 1172 the monastery moved to a site near Wool, the gift of Roger de Newburgh and his wife, Matilda de Glastonia (the granddaughter of the original founder), who also endowed it with further estates in the county. The monastery retained the name of its original location. The abbey had the support of the Plantagenet kings, and Henry III granted several letters of protection.The Victoria History of the County of Dorset, Vol. 2, pp. 82 ‚Äì 86. From the 14th century the abbey suffered from a number of internal and economic difficulties which seriously reduced its income and wealth. In the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 its annual income was valued at ¬£147. It was scheduled for dissolution in 1536, but John Norman, the then abbot, paid the Crown the enormous sum of ¬£300 to save it. The abbey was nevertheless suppressed in 1539. The site was granted to Thomas Poynings, Baron Poynings, from whom it passed to Thomas Howard, Viscount Howard of Bindon. It was bought in 1641 by the Weld family, later prominent as Roman Catholics, the present landowners. In 1559 Thomas Howard built a country house on the site of the monastery, but this was burnt down during the English Civil War, although the outline of Howard's gardens, with their moated water features, can still be seen.Timothy Mowl, Historic Gardens of Dorset, Tempus, 2003, pp. 15‚Äì24. The Welds reused the stone for the construction of the nearby Lulworth Castle.  Buildings and site  The foundations of the monastery and the surviving walls show that it followed the standard Cistercian layout of a cruciform church with a nave and two side aisles and a straight east end, with two chapels off each arm of the transept; the conventual buildings lay to the south of the church. Most of the construction seems to have taken place around the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries; although later records refer to royal gifts of timber for rebuilding works, these are no longer in evidence. In the chapter- house in the east range the recessed shafts of the columns that supported the ceiling vaulting are still to be seen. Little remains of the south range with the kitchen and refectory. Access to the ruins is by permission of the current tenants. Bindon Abbey House, late 18th century Between 1794 and 1798 a small \\"Gothick\\" house, Bindon Abbey House, was built on part of the former abbey grounds. This and a contemporaneous gatehouse are still in existence. Bindon Abbey House is currently used by Bindon Abbey Wellness Retreat to provide a range of treatments and retreat days. The mill on the River Frome ‚Äì Bindon Mill ‚Äì to the north of the ruins would originally have been part of the monastery. It was converted into a residence between 2006 and 2009.Bindon Mill, Country Life, 11 November 2009 Burials *Roger de Newburgh Literary references The abbey ruins, and especially the former grave of one of the abbots, which may still be seen, feature in Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles.

Division Nr. 32) was a unit of the Saxon Army, a component of the Imperial German Army.From 1867, the Saxon Army was integrated into the Prussian Army's organizational structure (hence the dual numbering) in what was effectively the German Army. During the period of German unification (1866-1871), Saxony, along with the other states of the German Empire, entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous.

Her brother was the bohemian surrealist Charles Henri Ford. Their parents owned or managed hotels in the American South, and the family regularly moved. Life and career Born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, Ford was the daughter of Charles and Gertrude Cato Ford, who owned hotels in four towns in the South. She was a graduate of the University of Mississippi. As a model, Ford posed for photographers Cecil Beaton, Man Ray, and Carl Van Vechten, among others. She married actor Peter Van Eyck in 1940, but the marriage was unsuccessful. Van Eyck was the father of her daughter, Shelley, who was born in 1941. Before Ford's trip to Hollywood, she was a member of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre, and appeared in his film Too Much Johnson (1938), which was considered lost until the rediscovery of footage in 2013. Welles' assistance helped her to land contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. studios. Ford's Broadway debut was in The Shoemaker's Holiday (1938). Among her other Broadway performances, she starred in Poor Murderer (1976). Ford married film star Zachary Scott, and they remained together until Scott's death in 1965. Scott adopted Shelley, who took the name Shelley Scott. Zachary Scott reportedly died penniless except for a $100,000 insurance policy he left for his widow. Later, in the 1970s, she was involved in a relationship with a much younger man, the writer Dotson Rader. Ford died in New York City. Posthumous In May 2010 it was reported, originally in The Wall Street Journal, that Ford's estate had been worth $8.4 million, almost all of it in the value of two apartments she owned in the apartment building The Dakota in Manhattan, where she died at the age of 98 in 2009. One of the apartments had belonged to her brother Charles, who predeceased her. She bequeathed the apartments to her cook/butler, Indra Tamang, a Nepalese-American whom Charles Henri Ford had brought to New York. Ford's daughter and grandchildren reportedly were disinherited.

The community once had a population of 200 people in 1940 and has since declined to 1 resident. It previously held the status of a village until it was dissolved as an unincorporated community on January 1, 1952. The community is located between Robsart and Consul on highway 21 & highway 13 known as the Red Coat Trail. Very little remains of the former village, only one home that is also used as a post office still stands as of 2008. There are many cement foundations and sidewalks still found scattered around the town site, including the remnants of the old bank vault to the former Municipality Office that was moved to Consul.  History  C.P.R. station In 1910 construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway line came through Vidora. Many of the CPR's engineers and surveyors were housed at a local farm house during construction of the rail line. Living at the same house where two girls named \\"Vivian\\" and \\"Dorothy\\", the engineers and surveyors decided to use their names to name the new area, because of their great hospitality, thus giving the town its name \\"Vidora\\". After the land was named, settlers as well as bootleggers began to settle the area starting the community of Vidora. By 1917, the community was incorporated as a village, and now had its very own town Council, and mayor. After becoming a village, Vidora began to grow quite fast and prosperous. By 1920, the village business districts consist of more than twenty businesses, including businesses such as a post office, cafe, pool hall, main hall, banks, lumber yards, general stores, a hotel and a spectacular row of 5 grain elevators. Vidora even had its very own electrical power plant, powering the whole town. Prior to January 1, 1952, Vidora was incorporated as a village, and was restructured as an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Reno on that date.  Prohibition  Like most towns throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan, Vidora began as a small parcel of land owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Like many towns of southwest Alberta and Saskatchewan such as Govenlock, Senate and Whiskey Gap, Alberta Vidora had a fair amount of bootleggers, that came into the area to smuggle rum, alcohol, and whisky across the border during Prohibition in the United States. = The Great Depression = Fire of 1924 wiping out many crucial businesses. Vidora's future looked promising but due to the Great Depression years, with accompanying droughts, falling grain prices and poor crop yields, Vidora's population slowly began to decline. Beginning in 1924 a devastating fire destroyed many important businesses including Vidora's first store, post office, cafe, pool hall and main hall. Then in 1926 and 1928 more vital businesses would also be wiped out by fire. In 1936 the C.P.R. station closed and afterwards moved to Frontier. In 1961 the Vidora General Store was moved to Robsart, then in 1969 the rural municipal office was also moved to Consul as did the Vidora Community Hall in 1976. To mark the end of its long prosperous life, Vidora's five grain elevators closed and were torn down sometime in the 1970s or 1980s.

Its purpose is to bring teams from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to play games against either another NBA team or a foreign club. The games themselves are played under NBA rules, which differ slightly from the FIBA rules which the foreign teams normally play under. Court markings and dimensions also differ slightly. History The first official overseas game featuring an NBA team was an exhibition matchup between the Washington Bullets and Maccabi Tel Aviv on 7 September 1978. The then-defending champions lost 98‚Äì97 at the Yad Eliyahu Sports Arena in Tel Aviv, Israel. The Bullets would play three more exhibition games the following year in Beijing and Shanghai in China, and in Quezon City in the Philippines. In 1984, a series of exhibition matches pitting the New Jersey Nets, Phoenix Suns and Seattle SuperSonics against local European clubs were held in Israel, Italy, West Germany and Switzerland. Then in 1988, the Atlanta Hawks played against the Soviet Union national basketball team in a three-game series in Tbilisi, Vilnius and Moscow, becoming the first NBA team to play in the Soviet Union. In 1987, the McDonald's Championship was introduced. While the first edition was held in Milwaukee, the following editions of the event were held in Europe, with the NBA teams emerging victorious against their European counterparts in each staging. The McDonald's Championship was discontinued in 1999. The first regular season NBA games outside North America were held in Tokyo, Japan in 1990, with the Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz splitting the two-game series. Since then four other editions of the NBA Japan Games were held, with the last games being played in Saitama in 2003. In 1991, the Miami Heat and the Washington Bullets played a preseason game in Nassau, Bahamas, marking the first NBA preseason game in the Caribbean. The following year, the Houston Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks played a preseason game in Mexico City, in the first NBA game held in Latin America. Several other preseason matches would follow in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico (under the name NBA Challenge), but it was not until 1997 that the NBA decided to hold its first regular season game in Latin America, featuring the Mavericks and the Rockets in Mexico City. While the NBA has had a history of sending teams to Europe to play against the local clubs, it was not until 1993 that the league decided to send two of its teams to Europe to play a pair of preseason matches against each other. An exhibition series between the Orlando Magic and the Atlanta Hawks was held in London, United Kingdom, a precursor of what would later be called the NBA Europe Live Tour. Further games were held in Italy, France, Germany, Russia, Spain and Turkey. It was not until 2011, however, that a regular season matchup was first played in Europe. The first regular season games in London pitted the New Jersey Nets against the Toronto Raptors, with the Nets sweeping the two-game series. In 2004, the NBA held a pair of preseason games in Shanghai and Beijing, as part of the NBA China Games. The two-game series between the Sacramento Kings and the Houston Rockets also marked the homecoming of sorts for Yao Ming, who as the top overall pick of the 2002 NBA draft and a perennial all-star, helped popularize the NBA in China. The China Games eventually became a regular in the NBA's preseason schedule. In 2013, the NBA decided to unify its overseas tours under one banner: the \\"NBA Global Games\\". The newly renamed event witnessed the first NBA preseason game held in Southeast Asia, with the Indiana Pacers and the Houston Rockets facing each other in the Philippines. In addition, a preseason game between the Washington Wizards and the Chicago Bulls in Brazil marked the first NBA preseason match in South America. The league was scheduled to hold a pair of regular season matches in Mexico and United Kingdom, but the game in Mexico City between the San Antonio Spurs and the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 4 never started due to a generator malfunction inside the Mexico City Arena, and was postponed to 8 April 2014 at the Target Centre in Minneapolis. The 2014 NBA Global Games began in October with two San Antonio Spurs friendlies versus EuroLeague teams Alba Berlin and Fenerbah√ße √úlker at Berlin and Istanbul respectively. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat played a preseason game at the HSBC Arena in Rio de Janeiro. Then the Brooklyn Nets and Sacramento Kings played two matches at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai and the MasterCard Center in Beijing. Like the previous season, two regular season Global Games were scheduled in Mexico City and London; the Mexico City game between the Timberwolves and the Rockets on 12 November was played without incident. For the 2015‚Äì16 season, the NBA scheduled two regular season games to be played outside the United States. The first game, between the Boston Celtics and the Sacramento Kings, was scheduled to be played on 3 December 2015 at the Mexico City Arena; the Celtics defeated the Kings 114‚Äì97. It marked the NBA's third regular-season game in Mexico City. The second game, between the Orlando Magic and the Toronto Raptors, was played on 14 January 2016, at The O2 Arena in London. It marked the NBA's sixth regular-season game in London.

She served in the dangerous Pacific Ocean, delivering food and household items to ships and bases. Early career Yamhill ‚Äî a steel-hulled, single-screw freighter built in 1919 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Shipbuilding Co. under a United States Shipping Board contract ‚Äî was acquired by the navy from the Shipping Board on 4 November 1921 for use as a store ship. Renamed Arctic (AF-7) on 2 November 1921, she was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 7 November 1921, Lieutenant Commander Charles H. Bullock in command. Assigned to the Base Force, Pacific Fleet, Arctic arrived at San Diego, California on 24 July 1922. For almost 20 years, she served chiefly in the Pacific, operating with the fleet's train. During the second of her two voyages to Hawaiian waters in 1925, she accompanied the fleet on its Australasian cruise to New Zealand and Samoa. Assigned to Train Squadron 2 (TrainRon 2), her yearly operations varied little, with the ship issuing provisions to the Battle Fleet wherever it was operating. Her cruises along the western seaboard of the United States took her to San Diego, San Pedro and San Francisco, California, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. During the winter of 1936/1937, Arctic found herself busier than ever. A maritime strike, which paralyzed American flag merchant shipping during this period, meant a revision in the storeship's operating schedule. As Commander, Base Force, reported after the end of the fiscal year, the shipping strike emphasized the limitations of the train, since Arctic had to be withdrawn from servicing the fleet to provision the far-flung naval stations at Pearl Harbor and Samoa. Since the fleet operated in Hawaiian waters with increasing frequency, starting with the Hawaiian Detachment in the fall of 1939 and continuing through the assignment of the Fleet there in the spring of 1940, Arctics schedule was altered to include five or six round trips a year between San Francisco and Pearl Harbor. The outbreak of hostilities with Japan on 7 December 1941 found Arctic one day out of Hawaiian waters, en route to San Francisco. World War II For the first five months of 1942, a time punctuated with yard periods at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Arctic operated between Pearl Harbor and San Francisco. She then deployed briefly to Alaskan waters, to supply the ships of Task Force 8 (TF 8) and shore facilities at Kodiak from 3‚Äì13 July. Returning thence to the west coast, she arrived at San Francisco on 24 July and soon thereafter sailed for the South Pacific. After touching en route at Pearl Harbor and at Tongatapu, Arctic commenced a routine of supplying ships and shore stations at New Caledonia and in the New Hebrides. Before 1942 was over, the storeship visited Noumea twice and Espiritu Santo once. During the following year, 1943, she voyaged twice to Noum√©a, thrice to Espiritu Santo, and once to Efate, usually stopping at Samoa en route from the Hawaiian Islands. An overhaul at Alameda, California and at Oakland from 4 July-27 September broke this period of operations. Following her third call at Espiritu Santo from 23 October-5 November, Arctic returned again to the U.S. West Coast for engine repairs, reaching San Francisco on 29 November and remaining there into the following year. Departing the west coast on 29 January 1944, the storeship arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 February. Assigned thence to Service Squadron 8 (ServRon 8) over the next six months, Arctic made five round-trip voyages to the Marshall Islands, provisioning ships at Majuro, Kwajalein, and Eniwetok. Shifting to Seeadler Harbor ‚Äî at Manus ‚Äî on 20 September, the auxiliary ship spent the next month issuing supplies to various units afloat before she proceeded to Ulithi on 24 October. Remaining at Ulithi, temporarily attached to ServRon 10, until a week before Christmas, 1944, Arctic provided working parties for various merchant ships and took on board supplies for issue to the fleet until she commenced a series of round-trip voyages from Ulithi to the Palau Islands; she conducted four such voyages from 18 December 1944 ‚Äì 1 April 1945 to provision ships and shore installations at Kossol Roads, Peleliu, and Angaur. Touching at Saipan on 5 April, Arctic proceeded to Iwo Jima, where ‚Äî from 9‚Äì12 April ‚Äî she provisioned island forces, various units of the Pacific Fleet, and small craft. Returning to Guam on 15 April, the \\"beef boat\\" then sailed for the United States. A severe tropical storm enlivened her passage home before she arrived at San Francisco on 12 May. Sailing for the west again on 2 July, Arctic arrived at Ulithi on the 26th before she proceeded, in convoy UOK-43, for Okinawa, where ‚Äî from 5‚Äì21 August ‚Äî she issued fresh, frozen and dry provisions to fleet units. After Japan capitulated, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 11 September for repairs and reloading, before sailing for Japanese waters on 24 October. While en route to Tokyo, she sank a mine with gunfire on 12 November. From 21 November-13 December, Arctic provisioned fleet units off Yokosuka before she returned to Hawaiian waters ‚Äî again sinking a mine en route ‚Äî on 20 December. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1946 and arrived at San Diego on the 16th, where she remained for a little over a month. She left the west coast of the United States for the last time on 18 February, bound for the Gulf of Mexico. Material defects having rendered continued operation of the venerable Arctic \\"impracticable,\\" the veteran \\"beef boat\\" was on her last voyage. Transiting the Panama Canal on 7 March, Arctic arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana on the 15th. There, at Pendleton Shipyards, she was decommissioned on 3 April. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May. Transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposition on 3 July, the ship was then sold on 19 August 1947 to the Southern Shipwrecking Corp. and met her end under the scrapper's torch.

Allen was unable to locate them, reported back to the editorial staff with no story and the assignment was crossed off. However Allen's investigation did appear to have stirred up William Nelson Cromwell's PR staff who approached Caleb Van Hamm (the managing editor) and \\"demanded ... what the World meant by getting after his boss without giving him a look-in.\\" It appears that this series of events ended with the libel suit against Joseph Pulitzer, Caleb Van Hamm and Robert Hunt Lyman of the New York World as well as the New York World itself, and the Press Publishing Company for libel against William Nelson Cromwell, J.

Originally lying within Braydon Forest, the \\"stoke\\" means \\"settlement\\". Largely consisting of a long and narrow main street, the village has a church, one chapel (it used to have two chapels but the Methodist Chapel has been converted into a dwelling), a village hall and a pub. The Post Office closed in 2008.  History  Bradenstoke is the oldest community in the present-day parish, with 42 households recorded at Stoche in Domesday Book. In 1866, the ecclesiastical parish of Bradenstoke-cum-Clack was created for the newly built church. The name Bradenstoke was revived in the mid-twentieth century and is now used exclusively. A medieval limestone village cross stands at the side of the road near the church, having been moved from the middle of the road in the 20th century. Now headless, its base serves as a war memorial. An independent congregation built a chapel in the village in 1777, in brick with stone quoins and window dressings, which was later named Providence Chapel and used by Particular Baptists. In 2018 the chapel continues in use. The church of St Mary the Virgin was built in 1866 at the expense of Gabriel Goldney to designs of C.F. Hansom, as a chapelry of the parish church at Lyneham. In the same year an ecclesiastical parish called Bradenstoke-cum-Clack was created for the new church, from parts of the parishes of Lyneham and Christian Malford. Since 1954 the parish has been Lyneham with Bradenstoke. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council called Lyneham and Bradenstoke Parish Council. The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Priory The former Bradenstoke Priory was founded in 1142 by Walter D‚ÄôEvereaux, sheriff of Wiltshire, for the Augustinians. Having fallen into disrepair after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was dismantled in 1930 to provide building material for the renovation of St Donat's Castle in Wales, which had been bought by William Randolph Hearst. Most of the priory, including the roof, was unused and its whereabouts is now unknown. Undercroft of the abbey A 15th-century timber-framed building in Bradenstoke village is reputedly a guesthouse for the priory; it was converted to a house in the 16th century and divided into three cottages in the 18th, and is now Grade II* listed. Bradenstoke Abbey Farmhouse carries a date of 1780 and has some reused stonework from the priory. Clack Mount Close to the priory are earthworks known as Clack Mount (\\"clack\\" meaning \\"hill\\"). The site may pre-date the priory, and has ditches and ponds which were probably fishponds for the priory. A mound ‚Äì 19m in diameter and 1.5m high ‚Äì has been described as a motte-and-bailey castle although its early history is uncertain.

It was demolished in 1939. Built in 1868, it was managed by Augustin Daly in the mid-1870s. In 1877, it became the first air-conditioned theatre in the world. In 1879, it presented the world premiere of The Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan and the New York premiere of H.M.S. Pinafore, followed by other Gilbert and Sullivan operas throughout the 1880s. The theatre continued to present both plays and musicals through the end of the century. At the beginning of the 20th century, the theatre presented English classics and then vaudeville, and later films, as well as plays and musicals. History The theatre was built in 1868 and was originally named Gilsey's Apollo Hall, in 1870 renamed the St. James Theatre. Its capacity was approximately 1,530 seats.Fifth Avenue Theatre at the IBDB databasePraefcke, Andreas. \\"New York, NY: Fifth Avenue Theatre (1891)\\", Carthalia: Theatres on Postcards, accessed March 22, 2009 In its early years, it offered lectures in the upstairs hall and musical entertainment in the main auditorium. When Augustin Daly's former Fifth Avenue Theatre (on 24th Street) burned down in 1873, Daly moved his company to the St. James, remodeled it and renamed it the New Fifth Avenue Theatre, where he continued as proprietor until 1877.Henderson and Schoenfeld, pp. 132‚Äì33 The 1873 financial panic hurt business at the theatre in Daly's early years, but his 1875 production of The Big Bonanza was a big success, as was his production of Lemons.\\"Amusements; Daly's Theatre\\", The New York Times, March 8, 1885, p. 7 Mary Anderson and Helena Modjeska made their New York debuts at the theatre.American Theatre Guide: Fifth Avenue Theatre at Answers.com, accessed March 22, 2009 Eleonora Duse also made her American debut at the theatre in 1893 in The Lady of the Camellias.

Ford managed the theatre for some years thereafter, naming it the Fifth Avenue Theatre. The theatre was destroyed by fire in 1891 and rebuilt by architect Francis Hatch Kimball in highly ornate neoclassical style, opening in May 1892.\\"Gladstone at the Play\\", The New York Times, 22 May 1892, p. 13. The ornate entrance of the new structure faced Broadway for a time, but later the Fifth Avenue entrance was used as the main entrance. Henry Miner managed the theatre in the 1890s, and F. F. Proctor took control in 1900. He presented mainly vaudeville there and, by 1915, was showing motion pictures. The theatre presented burlesque in the 1930s and, in its declining years, films. It was demolished in 1939.Krefft, Bryan. \\"Fifth Avenue Theatre\\", Fifth Avenue Theatre, accessed March 21, 2009 Productions Among the theatre's early successes was Jezebel, a play by Dion Boucicault in 1871. One of Daly's first productions at the theatre was another Boucicault play, The Heart of Mid- Lothian,\\"Fifth Avenue Theatre\\", The New York Times, November 29, 1874, p. 6 and another was the New York premiere of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost in 1874, which was a flop. His production of W. S. Gilbert's play Charity the same year, however, was a success, although the playwright objected to Daly's changes.Stedman, Jane W. W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian & His Theatre, pp. 117-18, Oxford University Press (1996) The next year, Daly's own play The Big Bonanza was a sensation, introducing John Drew in his New York d√©but. Also in 1875 came the New York premiere of the hit London play Our Boys by H. J. Byron, in which Georgiana Drew first appeared in New York. The first night of Richard Sheridan's The School for Scandal on December 5, 1876, with Charles Coghlan, was overshadowed by the disastrous Brooklyn Theater Fire. In 1877, another huge London hit, The Chimes of Normandy, had its New York premiere at the theatre. Daly was losing money at the theatre and left by 1878 to take over another New York theatre, which had been Banvard's Museum, naming it Daly's Theatre. The theatre in 1899 The Fifth Avenue Theatre was soon leased to John T. Ford, who presented, in cooperation with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the first official U.S. productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, beginning with H.M.S. Pinafore and the world premiere of The Pirates of Penzance in 1879,A staged reading of the piece was held earlier that day at Paignton, England, to secure British copyright. See Ainger, pp. 180‚Äì81 and several other Savoy operas continuing through the 1880s. In 1887, the theatre presented The Begum by Reginald De Koven. The theatre was rebuilt after a fire in 1891, and in 1894, it presented European plays, Hannele by Gerhart Hauptmann and Gismonda by Victorien Sardou. In 1896, productions included Pamela Nubile by Carlo Goldoni, The Speculator by George Broadhurst, and a musical, Lost, Strayed or Stolen, by J. Cheever Goodwin and Woolson Morse. Among the plays presented in 1897 were A Superfluous Husband by Clyde Fitch and Leo Ditrichstein, Dr. Claudius by F. Marion Crawford, Harry St. Maur, a revival of Sardou's Divor√ßons, A Southern Romance by Leo Ditrichstein, B. B. Valentine, The Devil's Disciple by George Bernard Shaw, Alexandra by Richard Voss and The Royal Box by Charles Francis Coghlan. Notable works presented in 1898 included Henrik Ibsen's drama Hedda Gabler and the hit London musical A Runaway Girl, with music by Ivan Caryll and Lionel Monckton. 1899 saw a John Philip Sousa musical, The Charlatan, and the comic play Becky Sharp by Langdon Mitchell. The theatre began the new century with three Shakespeare plays, Macbeth, Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing. Other productions in 1900 were Mary Stuart by Friedrich Schiller and Oliver Goldsmith by Augustus Thomas. After this, the theatre presented mostly vaudeville, but it still produced a few plays and musicals. In 1903, for example, the theatre presented Who Is Brown? by Frank Wyatt. 1905 productions included Zorah by Edwin Arden and a version of Oliver Twist by J. Comyns Carr. Another hit London musical, King of Cadonia, with music by Sidney Jones, played at the theatre in 1910. The theatre began to show films during World War I. In later years, few plays were produced at the theatre. They included The Wisecrackers by Gilbert Seldes (1925) and Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl by Charles Foster (1935).

So what do you do when you're fifteen, supposedly king of one of the most powerful kingdoms in the world, but all you have on your side are wit, will, and maybe a few skills? And what if the people you like best are your enemies, and your relatives want to see you dead? Sherwood Bibliography Plot summary Senrid is King of Marloven Hess, but in name only because his uncle Tdanerand holds the power. When the Marlovens try to attack the nearby kingdom of Vasande Leror they are defeated by the combined efforts of Vasande Leror's King Leander, his small army, a little bit of magic and a shapeshifting girl named Faline. Senrid's first mission is to get revenge on Leander (and his whining sister Kitty) and Faline. This gets more complicated as many allies of Leander and Faline get involved to try to rescue them. Eventually as magic combines and nearly destroys them in a battle they are thrown off world.

Much like the 1980‚Äì1981 season and the 1985‚Äì1986 season, NBC worried over SNL's decline in quality (and in the ratings) and initially decided that now would be the best time to pull the plug on the show once and for all. According to the prime time special Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation, Lorne Michaels credits this season as the closest he's ever been to being fired. In the end, the cast member firings and crew turnover resulting from this season represented the biggest involvement into the show's affairs by NBC executives since the 1980‚Äì1981 season and the biggest cast overhaul since the 1985‚Äì1986 season. This season saw the deaths of two SNL alumni: season 11 cast member Danitra Vance (who died of breast cancer) and \\"Not Ready for Primetime\\"-era writer and occasional performer Michael O'Donoghue (who died of a brain hemorrhage after years of suffering from migraine headaches). The Sarah Jessica Parker-hosted episode featured a special appearance by Bill Murray, who introduced a clip from season3, \\"The Soiled Kimono\\", aired in O'Donoghue's memory. This was the final season for Kevin Nealon, Mike Myers, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Jay Mohr, Michael McKean, Ellen Cleghorne, and Al Franken and the only season for Janeane Garofalo, Chris Elliott, Morwenna Banks, and Laura Kightlinger, as they all left the show at the end of the season. Myers, Garofalo, and Franken all left the show mid-season, and Nealon, Cleghorne, McKean, Elliott, and Kightlinger all left the show at season's end on their own terms. Farley, Sandler, Mohr, and Banks were let go from the show at the end of the season as none of them indicated any particular interest in staying for another season. For the following season, only Norm Macdonald and David Spade would remain from the start of the season, though Spade remained specifically to integrate the new cast, appearing only as himself. Tim Meadows was initially fired but he was rehired, and would remain for several more years. Midseason replacements Mark McKinney and Molly Shannon were also retained. Cast Preceding the season 20 premiere, Phil Hartman, Melanie Hutsell, Rob Schneider, Sarah Silverman and Julia Sweeney had all left the show. In their places, the show hired Chris Elliott, Janeane Garofalo and Laura Kightlinger to the cast. Elliott and Garofalo were made repertory players, while Kightlinger was made a featured player. Jay Mohr remained a featured player and Norm Macdonald was promoted to repertory status and made Weekend Update's latest anchor. (Though Kevin Nealon was no longer a Weekend Update anchor, he still remained on the show.) As the season progressed, Morwenna Banks, Mark McKinney and Molly Shannon were added to the cast. (McKinney was hired from the then-recently ended sketch show The Kids in the Hall, which was produced by Michaels.) Several cast members quit the show mid-season. Mike Myers left after the January 21, 1995 episode (exactly six years after his first episode on January 21, 1989), largely due to his increasing fame as a film star (notably with his role in 1992's Wayne's World). Janeane Garofalo quit the show following the February 25 episode, citing her unhappiness with the work environment and writing material. She would later call Saturday Night Live \\"...an unfair boys' club\\" and call many of the sketches \\"juvenile and homophobic.\\" Al Franken's final appearance as a featured player was on May6 following the box office failure of the SNL spin- off film Stuart Saves His Family. Following the May 13, 1995 season finale, nine more cast members either quit or were fired from Saturday Night Live, including Banks, Cleghorne, Elliott, Farley, Kightlinger, McKean, Mohr, Nealon and Sandler. In his book, Gasping for Airtime, Mohr wrote that following the season, he demanded a promotion to repertory status, among other things; the network procrastinated his wishes throughout the summer of 1995, and he chose to quit the show. Mohr's account of his voluntary departure from SNL has been widely discounted, however. He was under a cloud of suspicion due to his admitted plagiarizing of jokes during the season, and his multi-year contract with NBC did not allow him to unilaterally quit. This was also the final season for director Dave Wilson and bandleader G.E. Smith, who had been with the program since its first and eleventh seasons, respectively.

Cast members Robin Duke, Al Franken and Julia Sweeney appear in the film. The film received modest reviews from critics but was a box office bomb. During the season, Franken performed a Stuart Smalley sketch that parodied the film's poor box office returns. Stuart was depressed and bitter throughout the entire segment, eating cookies and lambasting the audience for choosing other movies (such as Dumb and Dumber and anything Pauly Shore had out at the time) over his.

Titan Clydebank is a cantilever crane at Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. It was designed to be used in the lifting of heavy equipment, such as engines and boilers, during the fitting-out of battleships and ocean liners at the John Brown & Company shipyard. It was also the world's first electrically powered cantilever crane, and the largest crane of its type at the time of its completion. Situated at the end of a U-shaped fitting out basin, the crane was used to construct some of the largest ships of the 20th century, including the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth 2. The Category A Listed historical structure was refurbished in 2007 as a tourist attraction and shipbuilding museum. It is featured on the current Clydesdale Bank ¬£5 note. History The shipyard at Clydebank was created in 1871 after the company James & George Thomson moved from the Graving Docks in Govan. John Brown & Company purchased the yard in 1899, and in 1905, a ¬£24,600 order for the crane was placed with Dalmarnock based engineering company Sir William Arrol & Co. Titan was completed two years later in 1907. It was constructed by the Scottish engineer Adam Hunter (1869‚Äì1933), who was working as Chief Engineer for Arrol & Co., having served his apprenticeship on the construction of the Forth Bridge. Stothert & Pitt of Bath, England, fabricated and installed most of the machinery for the Titan, including electric motors built by Lancashire Dynamo and Motor Co. The dock was used for fitting out new vessels, and the crane lifted engines and boilers into ships. The lifting capacity of the Titan, and the location of the yard at the confluence of the River Clyde and River Cart, contributed to the success of the yard as it could build extremely large ships. When tested on 24 April 1907, Titan was the largest cantilever crane ever built with a capacity of at a radius of . The original lift capacity was uprated to in 1938, when it became apparent that the original specification would be insufficient to install the new long range gun's turrets into ships such as the Duke of York. On the nights of 13 and 14 March 1941, the Clydebank Blitz virtually destroyed the town. 528 civilians were killed, over 617 people were seriously injured, and 48,000 civilians lost their homes. Only seven properties in Clydebank were undamaged, in one of the worst bombing raids in Britain. The raids, involving 260 Luftwaffe bombers on the first night and 200 on the second, targeted the industry of Clydeside, but the Titan crane was undamaged. In 1968, the yard was amalgamated into Upper Clyde Shipbuilders along with four others, in an attempt to increase competitiveness. The general elections in 1970 saw a change of government, and funding for the yard was withheld, resulting in the closure of John Brown's. It was bought from the receivers by the Houston, Texas-based Marathon Manufacturing Company for oil rig construction. In 1980 Marathon sold the yard to the French company Union Industrielle et d‚ÄôEntreprise (UiE). UIE's owners, Bouygues Offshore closed the yard in 2001 and the site was earmarked for redevelopment. Ships constructed by the crane include HMS Hood, the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth 2, and the Royal Yacht Britannia. Refurbishment The ticket office (also known as the Pursers Office) and information centre at the Titan Crane, featuring a silhouette of the RMS Queen Mary. The crane fell into disuse in 1980s, and in the intervening period of neglect, the crane suffered vandalism to the wheelhouse and corrosion to the structure. In 1988 the crane was recognised as a Category A Listed historical structure. The urban regeneration company Clydebank Re-Built started a ¬£3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane opened to the public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night. Design The Titan Crane's jib has been converted into a public viewing platform. The Titan used a fixed counterweight and electrically operated hoists all mounted on a rotated beam, making it faster and more responsive than its steam powered predecessors. For lifting smaller assemblies that did not require the full lifting capacity of , a auxiliary hoist was used, as large loads were comparatively rare. Titan is high, weighs about and sits on four concrete piles sunk to a depth of deep. The arms of the cantilever are and long. The tower is square, and its centre sits just from the edge of the quay. Following the removal of the Beardmore Crane in the 1970s and the Fairfield Titan in 2007, there are now four giant cantilever cranes on the River Clyde. The others are at Stobcross (Finnieston Crane), Scotstoun (Barclay Curle Crane) and Greenock (James Watt Dock Crane). Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide, six of them on the Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is believed only eleven remained, four of those on the Clyde. Awards The crane was awarded the 2012 Engineering Heritage Award by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and described as \\"a magnificent example of mechanical engineering, which forms an integral part of the local landscape\\". Titan was designated as an International Historic Civil and Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2013, the fifth such award given to a Scottish structure. For the restoration of the structure, recognition was accorded by Chicago Athenaeum Award for Architecture in 2008 and by the Civic Trust in 2009.

The novel is about a frustrated writer of Indian descent who rises from an impoverished background to become a successful politician on the back of his dubious talent as a 'mystic' masseur ‚Äî a masseur who can cure illnesses. Plot summary The Mystic Masseur follows the life of Ganesh Ramsumair, a Trinidadian of Indian heritage. As a young man, Ganesh attends a training college for teachers, and after graduation, he begins working as a primary school teacher in the Port of Spain, Trinidad‚Äôs capital. However, he quickly loses interest in this profession and returns to his hometown of Fourways, where he learns that his father has just died. Ganesh plans to be either a writer or a professional masseur, and he befriends a local shop owner named Ramlogan. Ramlogan has a 16-year-old daughter named Leela, and Leela and Ganesh soon marry. After the wedding, Ganesh demands a large dowry payment from Ramlogan, which angers the latter. Ganesh and Leela go to live in the small rural village of Fuente Grove, and he befriends a shop owner there named Beharry. Beharry encourages Ganesh to read and become a writer, and Ganesh orders several hundred books by mail to comprise his personal library. He reads the books and makes notes, but Leela becomes frustrated by the lack of progress Ganesh makes with actually writing. She leaves Ganesh and returns to Fourways to live with her father again. Ganesh spends the next five weeks writing an educational text about Hinduism, and when he finishes it, he has hires a print shop to make copies of his book. He brings the book to Leela and Ramlogan, and they are ecstatic that he has written a book. However, Ramlogan becomes furious when he sees that the book is dedicated to Beharry rather than Leela or himself. Leela returns to Ganesh, but Ganesh‚Äôs book does not sell well. Ganesh decides to become a mystic and a religious healer. His first client is a mother who says that a malevolent black cloud has been following her son. Ganesh performs a ritual over the boy, who then says that the black cloud is gone. Ganesh becomes a very successful mystic, but he soon discovers that the five local taxis are overcharging passengers to come to his home. He also discovers that the taxis are all owned by Ramlogan. He goes to Ramlogan and says that he wishes to buy the taxis from him and that if Ramlogan refuses, Ganesh will simply buy his own taxis and have them charge reasonable rates. Ramlogan, furious but defeated, agrees to sell the taxis to Ganesh. Ganesh, having gained considerable personal wealth, invests his money in Fuente Grove‚Äôs businesses and infrastructure, and the village begins to prosper. One day, Hindu organizers approach Ganesh and inform him that C.S. Narayan, the president of the Trinidad Hindu Association, has been embezzling funds from the organization. Ganesh and the organizers publicize Narayan‚Äôs malfeasance by publishing their own newspaper. Soon, Narayan is voted out of his position in the organization, and Ganesh is voted in as the new president. Ganesh then decides to campaign for a position in the Legislative Council of Trinidad, and he wins easily, having gained widespread fame and popularity by this point. However, while he intends to fight for the wellbeing of Trinidad‚Äôs downtrodden, he is soon stymied by the politics of the Legislative Council and must instead follow the lead of the other Council members. Publication and critical reception The publisher Andr√© Deutsch encouraged Naipaul to write a novel after seeing the manuscript of his collection of short stories, Miguel Street. The Mystic Masseur won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1958. Film The novel was the first by Naipaul to be filmed. The 2001 film adaptation, The Mystic Masseur, is a Merchant Ivory production.

Hari has written for publications including The Independent and The Huffington Post and has written books on the topics of depression, the war on drugs, and the monarchy. He has also given TED talks on the topics of addiction, and depression and anxiety. In 2011 Hari was suspended and then resigned as a columnist at The Independent after being accused of plagiarism, and of making pejorative edits to the Wikipedia pages of journalists who had criticised his conduct. Early life Hari was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to a Scottish mother and Swiss father, before his family relocated to London when he was an infant. Hari was physically abused in his childhood while his father was away and his mother was ill. According to Hari, he attended the John Lyon School, an independent school affiliated with Harrow School, and then Woodhouse College, a state sixth-form in Finchley. Hari graduated from King's College, Cambridge in 2001 with a double first in social and political sciences. Hari is gay. Early career In 2000 he was joint winner of The Times Student News Journalist of the Year award for his work on the Cambridge student newspaper Varsity. After university he joined the New Statesman, where he worked between 2001 and 2003, and then wrote two columns a week for The Independent. At the 2003 Press Gazette Awards, he won Young Journalist of the Year. A play by Hari, Going Down in History, was performed at the Garage Theatre in Edinburgh, and his book God Save the Queen? was published by Icon Books in 2002. In addition to being a columnist for The Independent, Hari's work also appeared in The Huffington Post, New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The New Republic, The Nation, Le Monde, El Pais, The Sydney Morning Herald and Ha'aretz, and he reported from locations around the world such as Congo and Venezuela. He appeared regularly as an arts critic on the BBC Two programme The Review Show, and was a book critic for Slate. In 2009 he was named by The Daily Telegraph as one of the most influential people on the left in Britain. Plagiarism and Wikipedia edits In 2011, accusations of plagiarism were made by bloggers at Deterritorial Support Group and by Brian Whelan, editor of Yahoo! Ireland, who asserted that some of Hari's interviews contained material published in previous interviews and written works by his interview subjects. For example, a 2009 interview with Afghan women's rights activist Malalai Joya included quotations from her book Raising my Voice in a manner that made them appear as if spoken directly to Hari. Hari initially denied wrongdoing, stating that the unattributed quotes were for clarification and did not involve passing off someone else's thoughts as his own, but would later say that his behaviour has been \\"completely wrong\\" and that \\"when I interviewed people I often presented things that had been said to other journalists or had been written in books as if they had been said to me, which was not truthful.\\" As a consequence, Hari was suspended for two months from The Independent, and shortly afterwards resigned from this role. The Media Standards Trust instructed the Council of the Orwell Prize, who had given their 2008 prize to Hari, to examine the allegations, which resulted in Hari returning the prize, though he did not initially return the prize money of ¬£2000. He later offered to repay the sum, but Political Quarterly, who had been responsible for paying the prize money, instead invited him to make a donation to English PEN, of which George Orwell had been a member. Hari arranged with English PEN to make a donation equal to the value of the prize, to be paid in installments once he returned to work at The Independent. However, he did not return to work there. In July 2011, Nick Cohen raised concerns in The Spectator after he was attacked on Wikipedia by an editor named \\"David Rose\\" following a dispute with Hari, and it was discovered that the same editor had made similar changes to the Wikipedia pages of Telegraph columnist Cristina Odone and Times leader writer Oliver Kamm after they had been critical of Hari. Cohen also wrote that Hari's own Wikipedia entry had been edited by Rose \\"to make him seem one of the essential writers of our times\\". \\"David Rose\\" was later shown to be a pseudonym of Hari. In September 2011 Hari made a public apology for both his writing practices and his Wikipedia edits.Hari, Johann (14 September 2011). \\"A personal apology\\". The Independent. Later career In January 2012, after leaving The Independent, Hari announced that he was writing a book on the war on drugs, which was subsequently published as Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs. His 2015 T.E.D. talk entitled \\"Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong\\" has been viewed over 15 million times (as of 22 February 2020), and lays out the idea that most addictions are functional responses to experiences and a lack of healthy supportive relationships, rather than a simple biological need for a particular substance. In January 2018, Hari's book Lost Connections on depression and anxiety was published, with Hari citing his childhood issues, career crisis, and experiences with antidepressants and psychotherapy as fuelling his curiosity in the subject. Kirkus Reviews praised the book. Material from the book was criticised by neuroscientist and Guardian writer Dean Burnett, who pointed out that Hari appeared to be reporting as his own discoveries material ‚Äî such as the biopsychosocial model ‚Äì that has been common knowledge for decades, and for misrepresenting the medical, psychiatric and scientific establishments as \\"some shadowy monolithic organisation, in thrall to the drug industry\\". He delivered a T.E.D. talk in July 2019 entitled \\"This could be why you're depressed or anxious\\" discussing the themes in the book Lost Connections.

Mission  Upwardly Global's mission is to eliminate employment barriers for skilled immigrants and refugees, and integrate this population into the professional U.S. workforce. A growing share of new arrivals to the U.S are highly skilled. Almost half of immigrants entering the U.S. between 2011 and 2015 had at least a bachelor's degree. However, nearly two million immigrants with college degrees‚Äîor one out of every four‚Äîare unemployed or working well below their skill level. The Migration Policy Institute call this loss of talent \\"brain waste\\" and it results in skilled immigrants missing out on more than $39 billion in wages annually, and governments losing out on $10 billion in tax payments. Upwardly Global helps immigrant, refugee, and asylee professionals find jobs in their career fields. To date, over 5,000 immigrants from more than 100 countries have secured professional jobs To qualify for Upwardly Global's program, candidates must have: *A university-level education *Permanent, legal U.S. work authorization (not employer sponsored) *Proficient English skills *Some professional work experience outside the U.S. They cannot be or have been: *Already working in their career field here in the US *In the US for over five years  History = Beginnings  Upwardly Global was started by Jane Leu in 1999 in San Francisco. After having worked extensively with immigrants, asylees, and refugees, Jane perceived a need for programs targeting educated, experienced immigrants in particular. Newspapers have described cases of underemployed immigrant professionals‚Äîlawyers working as gas station attendants, doctors as doormen‚Äîas the \\"American classic.\\" Multiple organizations exist to assist immigrant job-seekers, but few have the resources required to assist those with professional-level backgrounds. Upwardly Global is unique in the United States as an organization that specializes in matching qualified immigrants with high-skill positions. Jane began working with such immigrants part-time, unpaid, from her own kitchen. In 2000, the organization received its first official grant from the Three Guineas Fund. In the next few years, the list of donors expanded to include the Levi Strauss Foundation, the Draper Richards Foundation, and various private donors. Nikki Cicerani served as the organization's President and CEO from 2009-2018, leading the organization's expansion from two metropolitan areas to four, and launching online, virtual services. She currently serves on the organization's Board of Directors.  Present day  The organization currently has physical offices located in San Francisco's Financial District, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The organization has received numerous awards, including the 2004 Manhattan Institute Award for Social Entrepreneurship and the 2006 John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award, the 2010 E Pluribus Unum Award. The organization continues to receive funding from private donors, as well as from the Achelis Foundation, Ashoka: Innovators for the Public, the Alan Slifka Foundation, Cisco Systems, Community Technology, Foundation for California, the Draper Richards Foundation, the Gimbel Foundation, the Johnson Foundation, JP Morgan Chase, the Leitner Family Foundation, New Profit, Inc., the New York Times Foundation, the Robin Hood Foundation, the San Francisco Foundation, the Third Millennium Foundation, Three Guineas Fund, Wells Fargo.  Strategy and outreach = Jobseekers  Upwardly Global clients Jobseekers that fit requirements have free access to Upwardly Global programs and in-person and digital services. Activities and programs include: *Resume and cover letter assistance *Workshops **Networking skills **Interviewing skills **Socializing in the American workplace *Mock interviews *Mentoring and advising by volunteers *Submission of resumes to relevant employer partners An Upwardly Global workshop Upwardly Global COO, Camille Ramani, speaks to jobseekers at a workshop on interviewing These programs and activities address what Upwardly Global considers a four-fold challenge for immigrant professionals:  Employer network  Upwardly Global has partnerships with such companies as Accenture, Google, Wells Fargo, S&P; Global, Standard Chartered, TD Bank. Upwardly Global's strategy for interaction with employer partners follows a basic three-level process: 1\\\\. Education Through training, Upwardly Global works with HR professionals to expand cross-cultural hiring practices. 2\\\\. Engagement Employees of partner companies are invited to volunteer for Upwardly Global, individually or in groups. This important step increases awareness about immigrant professional potential and creates \\"internal advocates for global diversity.\\" 3\\\\. Employment The final component is the intersection of needs and goals between the jobseekers and companies. Upwardly Global functions similarly to a recruiter by steering qualified and interested candidates towards open positions in employer partner companies.

It was completed in 1929. The church was built following an appeal led by The Ypres League and its President Field Marshal Sir John French, Earl of Ypres, for a British memorial church to be built. Land was given by the town, and the foundation stone was laid by Field Marshal Lord Plumer on 24 July 1927. The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Fulham on 24 March 1929. The architect was Sir Reginald Blomfield. The church is part of the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England and is also a Belgian national monument. The church is open every day from 9:30 am until dusk (4 pm in winter). The church has many plaques and memorials to regiments, associations and individuals. The Bells In 2016, as part of the First World War centenary commemorations, a project to install a ring of bells was launched. The church was originally planned to include a ring, but there was insufficient funding available. By September 2017, the church was able to pay for a new ring of change-ringing bells, cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. They are the first of their kind in Belgium. In January 2018, the bell-ringing guild of the Belgian town of Ypres was looking for people to perform on the 8 new bells. On the 10th of January 2018, a team of eight bell- ringers from the UK managed to score a peal of 5088 Ypres Surprise Major, in two hours and forty two minutes. It was the first full peal ever rung on church bells in continental Europe, and was also the first full peal on the bells.https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=1206725 Image:Ieper - Saint George's Memorial Church 2.jpg Image:Ieper_- _Saint_George's_Memorial_Church_1.jpg Image:St. George's Church Ypres 01.JPG Image:St. George's Church Ypres 02.JPG Image:St. George's Church Ypres 03.JPG Image:St. George's Church Ypres 04.JPG Image:Ieper - Saint George's Memorial Church - Stained glass.jpg Location: ReferencesExternal links *St. George's website *http://www.greatwar.co.uk/ypres-salient/town-ieper-st- georges-church.htm Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1929 Category:Reginald Blomfield buildings Category:World War I memorials in Belgium Category:Anglican church buildings in Belgium Category:Churches in West Flanders Category:Buildings and structures in Ypres Category:Ypres Salient George Ypres ","title":"Saint George's Memorial Church, Ypres"},{"id":"12755082","text":"The eighteenth season of Saturday Night Live, an American sketch comedy series, originally aired in the United States on NBC between September 26, 1992, and May 15, 1993.

According to modern scholars' consensual view, he was a member of the royal √Årp√°d dynasty. Kopp√°ny was the lord of the southern region of Transdanubia during the reign of G√©za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, who ruled between the early 970s and 997. After the death of G√©za, Kopp√°ny laid claim to the throne against G√©za's devout Christian son, Stephen. His claim was mainly supported by pagan Hungarians, but the royal army routed his army near Veszpr√©m in 997 or 998. Kopp√°ny was killed either in the battle or in his duchy, to which he had fled from the battlefield. His corpse was cut in four pieces to be displayed on the walls of four major strongholds of Hungary, Gy≈ër, Veszpr√©m, Esztergom and Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (now Alba Iulia, Romania). Family He was the son of Zerind the Bald, according to the 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle. Although no primary source mentions that Kopp√°ny was descended from √Ålmos or √Årp√°d, the first grand princes of the Hungarians, his attempt to seize the throne shows that he was a member of the √Årp√°d dynasty. Historians debate which of the four or five sons of √Årp√°d was Kopp√°ny's ancestor. Historians Gyula Krist√≥, L√°szl√≥ Szegf≈± and Gy√∂rgy Szabados say that Kopp√°ny was probably descended from √Årp√°d's oldest son, Tarkatzus, but Korn√©l Bakay (who identified Zerind the Bald with Ladislas the Bald) writes that √Årp√°d's youngest son, Zolt√°n, was Kopp√°ny's forefather. The exact date of Kopp√°ny's birth cannot be determined. He was allegedly born between around 950 and 965, because his claim to the throne in 997 shows that he was the oldest member of the √Årp√°d dynasty at that time. Duke of Somogy The 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle recorded that \\"Duke Cupan ... held sway over a duchy\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 39.64), p. 105. (ducatum tenebat, in Latin) during the reign of G√©za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. G√©za, who ascended the throne around 972, was described as a cruel monarch in late 11th- century legends. His fame, along with the fact that only a few late-10th- century members of the royal family are known, suggests that G√©za murdered most of his kinsmen, according to historian P√°l Engel. Even if G√©za carried out a purge among his relatives, Kopp√°ny survived it. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, he was \\"Duke of Symigium\\" (or Somogy). Two later sourcesthe 15th-century Osv√°t Laskai and an unknown 16th-century Carthusian monkmentioned that Kopp√°ny had also been the lord of Zala. Based on the sources, modern historians agree that Kopp√°ny administered the southwestern region of Transdanubia, most likely between Lake Balaton and the river Dr√°va. Szabados says that Kopp√°ny's father had already dominated Somogy and Zala; in contrast, L√°szl√≥ Kontler writes that Kopp√°ny received his duchy from G√©za as a compensation after G√©za made his own son, Stephen, his heir. Rebellion and death Portrayal of Stephen, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, whom Kopp√°ny unsuccessfully tried to dethrone, on the Hungarian coronation pall from 1031 G√©za died in 997. Either in the same or the next year, Kopp√°ny revolted against G√©za's successor, Stephen, claiming the throne and G√©za's widow, Sarolt, for himself. His claim to the throne shows that he considered himself the lawful heir to G√©za in accordance with the traditional principle of seniority, but in contrast with the Christian law of primogeniture which supported Stephen's right to succeed his father. Kopp√°ny's effort to marry G√©za's widow was also in line with the pagan custom of levirate marriage, but Christians regarded it as an incestuous attempt. Both of Kopp√°ny's claims suggest that he was pagan, or he inclined to paganism even if he had been baptised. In the nearly contemporaneous deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey, Stephen mentioned that \\"a certain county named Somogy\\" attempted to dethrone him after his father's death. The late 11th-century Lesser Legend of King St Stephen declared that \\"certain noblemen whose hearts were inclined to idle banquets\\" turned against Stephen after his ascension to the throne. Both sources suggest that it was not Stephen who started the war, but that Kopp√°ny rebelled against him. Kopp√°ny started to \\"destroy the castles of Stephen, plunder his properties [and] murder his servants\\", according to the Lesser Legend. The same source also wrote that Kopp√°ny laid siege to Veszpr√©m, but Stephen collected his army, marched to the fortress and annihilated Kopp√°ny's troops. The German knights who had settled in Hungary after Stephen married Gisela of Bavaria in 996, played a preeminent role in the victory of the royal army. The commander of the royal army, Vecelin, was one of the German immigrants. The deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma monastery even referred to the civil war as a fight between \\"the Germans and the Hungarians\\". Kopp√°ny was killed by Vecelin in the battle near Veszpr√©m, according to Chapter 64 of the Illuminated Chronicle. On the other hand, Chapter 40 of the same source says that Vecelin killed Kopp√°ny in Somogy. If the latter report is valid, Kopp√°ny fled from the battlefield after his defeat at Veszpr√©m, but the royal army chased and murdered him in his duchy. On Stephen's order, Kopp√°ny's body was quartered and its parts were hung over the walls of Esztergom, Veszpr√©m, Gy≈ër and Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (present-day Alba Iulia in Romania).

Biography The son of missionaries, Mannoia grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Roberts Wesleyan College and his Masters of Divinity from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.Roberts Wesleyan College alumni relations He obtained a Ph.D. from the University of North Texas. His pastoral experience began as a church planter, then as a pastor in Dallas Texas. He served as a superintendent for the Free Methodist Church in Texas and then in Southern California. He was subsequently elected as Bishop of the Free Methodist Church overseeing the western U.S. and Asia. He served as a guest faculty member at Holy Light Theological Seminary in Kaohsiung, Taiwan; the Asian Theological Association; and the Asia Graduate School of Theology in Bangalore, India. In addition, he served on the Board of Trustees for Roberts Wesleyan College and Northeastern Seminary in Rochester, N.Y., and Seattle Pacific University. He served as dean of the School of Theology at Azusa Pacific University, coming from his role as President of the National Association of Evangelicals. He currently serves many local churches and parishes in a consulting role and assists as a board member to various Christian organizations. Dr. Mannoia is also founder and chair of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium which was founded in 2004 first as a Study Project in the Holiness tradition and then becoming a relational network of churches and organizations committed to relevant holiness in the 21st Century. The Wesleyan Holiness Consortium includes Regional Networks of ecclesiastical leaders in metropolitan areas of the U.S. and the world; Affinity Groups composed of leaders with a common focus. These include the WHC Presidents Network, the WHC Chief Academic Officers Network, The WH Women Clergy, the WHC Freedom Network. In addition, Aldersgate Press is the publishing arm of the WHC. Beyond his principal role as Professor and Chaplain at Azusa Pacific University, Mannoia serves as President of the International Council for Higher Education (ICHE) which is an international Swiss organization with operational offices in Bangalore, India. ICHE serves institutions of higher education in restricted parts of the world principally through resourcing and accreditation with a focus on integrated learning with a Christian worldview. Mannoia's life has come to represent a mix of Kingdom priorities that are traceable to his roots in the Holiness tradition. These are further informed by his work in shaping evangelicalism especially in North America. Though primarily a churchman, he often is found in academic spheres where he brings the practical emphasis of leadership and ecclesiology into integration with the theoretical conversation. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Dr. Mannoia's teaching and writing became more focused on the threefold priorities of leadership development, Church mission, and Church unity. These priorities find application and expression in the variety of engagements and roles he plays. Though his primary role is as Chaplain at Azusa Pacific University, his influence is extended broadly as Chair and Founder of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium and as President of the International Council for Higher Education. He also serves local churches and parishes as a board member or advisor. These include The Rock Church San Diego, a Catholic parish in Alta Loma, CA, Upland Christian Academy, the Salvation Army's School for Officers Training at Crestmont, and America's Christian Credit Union. He also serves as a member of the Board of Trustees of his undergraduate Alma Mater Roberts Wesleyan College and Northeastern Seminary.

Tissue distribution PPARG is mainly present in adipose tissue, colon and macrophages. Two isoforms of PPARG are detected in the human and in the mouse: PPAR-Œ≥1 (found in nearly all tissues except muscle) and PPAR-Œ≥2 (mostly found in adipose tissue and the intestine).  Gene expression  This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subfamily of nuclear receptors. PPARs form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and these heterodimers regulate transcription of various genes. Three subtypes of PPARs are known: PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta, and PPAR-gamma. The protein encoded by this gene is PPAR-gamma and is a regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been described. The activity PPARG can be regulated via phosphorylation through the MEK/ERK pathway. This modification decreases transcriptional activity of PPARG and leads to diabetic gene modifications, and results in insulin insensitivity. For example, the phosphorylation of serine 112 will inhibit PPARG function, and enhance adipogenic potential of fibroblasts.  Function  PPARG regulates fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. The genes activated by PPARG stimulate lipid uptake and adipogenesis by fat cells. PPARG knockout mice are devoid of adipose tissue, establishing PPARG as a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation. PPARG increases insulin sensitivity by enhancing storage of fatty acids in fat cells (reducing lipotoxicity), by enhancing adiponectin release from fat cells, by inducing FGF21, and by enhancing nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate production through upregulation of the CD38 enzyme. PPARG promotes anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage activation in mice. Adiponectin induces ABCA1-mediated reverse cholesterol transport by activation of PPAR-Œ≥ and LXRŒ±/Œ≤. Many naturally occurring agents directly bind with and activate PPAR gamma. These agents include various polyunsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid and arachidonic acid metabolites such as certain members of the 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoicacid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid family, e.g. 5-oxo-15(S)-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE or 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid family including 15(S)-HETE, 15(R)-HETE, and 15(S)-HpETE. The phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), its metabolite THC-COOH, and its synthetic analog ajulemic acid (AJA). The activation of PPAR gamma by these and other ligands may be responsible for inhibiting the growth of cultured human breast, gastric, lung, prostate and other cancer cell lines. During embryogenesis, PPARG first substantially expresses in interscapular brown fat pad. The depletion of PPARG will result in embryonic lethality at E10.5, due to the vascular anomalies in placenta, with no permeation of fetal blood vessels and dilation and rupture of maternal blood sinuses. The expression PPARG can be detected in placenta as early as E8.5 and through the remainder of gestation, mainly located in the primary trophoblast cell in the human placenta. PPARG is required for epithelial differentiation of trophoblast tissue, which is critical for proper placenta vascularization. PPARG agonists inhibit extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion. PPARG is also required for the accumulation of lipid droplets by the placenta.  Interactions  Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma has been shown to interact with: * CD36 * EDF1 * EP300 * HDAC3 * MED1 * NCOA3 * NCOA4 * NCOA2 * NR0B2 * PPARGC1A * RB1. Clinical relevance PPAR-gamma has been implicated in the pathology of numerous diseases including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. PPAR-gamma agonists have been used in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycemia. PPAR-gamma decreases the inflammatory response of many cardiovascular cells, particularly endothelial cells. PPAR-gamma activates the PON1 gene, increasing synthesis and release of paraoxonase 1 from the liver, reducing atherosclerosis. Low PPAR-gamma reduces the capacity of adipose tissue to store fat, resulting in increased storage of fat in nonadipose tissue (lipotoxicity). A soy protein diet increases adipose tissue PPAR-gamma, thereby reducing lipotoxicity. Many insulin sensitizing drugs (namely, the thiazolidinediones) used in the treatment of diabetes activate PPARG as a means to lower serum glucose without increasing pancreatic insulin secretion. Activation of PPARG is more effective for skeletal muscle insulin resistance than for insulin resistance of the liver. Different classes of compounds which activate PPARG weaker than thiazolidinediones (the so-called \\"partial agonists of PPARgamma\\") are currently studied with the hope that such compounds would be still effective hypoglycemic agents but with fewer side effects. The medium-chain triglyceride decanoic acid has been shown to be a partially- activating PPAR-gamma ligand that does not increase adipogenesis. Activation of PPAR-gamma by decanoic acid has been shown to increase mitochondrial number, increase the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase, increase complex I activity in mitochondria, and increase activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase. A fusion protein of PPAR-Œ≥1 and the thyroid transcription factor PAX8 is present in approximately one-third of follicular thyroid carcinomas, to be specific those cancers with a chromosomal translocation of t(2;3)(q13;p25), which permits juxtaposition of portions of both genes. The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to activate PPAR gamma in in vitro and in vivo models. The cannabinoid carboxylic acids THCA, CBDA and CBGA activate PAARy more efficient than their decarboxylated products; however, THCA was the acid found with highest activity. As a synthetic analog of THC‚ÄêCOOH, the major non‚Äêpsychotropic metabolite of THC, ajulemic acid also is a potent PPARŒ≥ agonist. The carboxylic acid group is critical for a stronger and a long activation time.

Pre-Islamic times Shiraz lies in Pars Province, a central area for Persian civilisation. The earliest reference to Shiraz is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BC, found in June 1970 during digging for the construction of a brick kiln in the southwest corner of the city. The tablets, written in ancient Elamite, name a city called Tirazi≈°.Cameron, George G. Persepolis Treasury Tablets, University of Chicago Press, 1948, pp. 115. Phonetically, this is interpreted as /tiraƒçis/ or /ƒáiraƒçis/. This name became Old Persian /≈°irƒÅji≈°/; through regular sound change comes the modern Persian name ShirƒÅz. The name Shiraz also appears on clay sealings found at Qasr-i Abu Nasr, a Sassanid ruin, east of the city, (2nd century AD). As early as the 11th century several hundred thousand people inhabited Shiraz. Its size has decreased through the ages. Cuneiform records from Persepolis show that Shiraz was a significant township in Achaemenid times.\\"F√°rs and Sh√≠r√°z\\" There is mention of a city at Shiraz during the Sassanid era, (2nd to 6th century AD) in the 10th century geographical treatise Hudud ul-'alam min al-mashriq ila al-maghrib, which reports the existence of two fire temples and a fortress called \\"Shahmobad\\". In the 14th century the Nozhat ol-Qolub of Hamdollah Mostowfi confirmed the existence of pre-Islamic settlements in Shiraz. Islamic period The city became a provincial capital in 693, after the Arab invaders conquered Istakhr, the nearby Sassanian capital. As Istakhr fell into decline, Shiraz grew in importance under the Arabs and several local dynasties. The Buwayhid dynasty (945 ‚Äî 1055) made it their capital, building mosques, palaces, a library and an extended city wall. The city was spared destruction by the invading Mongols when its local ruler offered tributes and submission to Genghis Khan. Shiraz was again spared by Tamerlane when in 1382 the local monarch, Shah Shoja agreed to submit to the invader. In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, thanks to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists. For this reason the city was named by classical geographers Dar al-Elm, the House of Knowledge.(pdf file) Among the important Iranian poets, mystics and philosophers born in Shiraz were the poets Sa'di and Hafiz the mystic Roozbehan and the philosopher Mulla Sadra. Bazar of Shiraz as seen by Jane Dieulafoy in 1881 As early as the 11th century, several hundred thousand people inhabited Shiraz.\\"Shiraz, Iran\\" In the 14th century Shiraz had sixty thousand inhabitants.(Google book search) During the 16th century it had a population of 200,000 people, which by the mid-18th century had decreased to only 50,000. In 1504 Shiraz was captured by the forces of Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Throughout the Safavid empire (1501-1722) Shiraz remained a provincial capital and Emam Qoli Khan, the governor of Fars under Shah Abbas I, constructed many palaces and ornate buildings in the same style as those built in the same period in Isfahan, the capital of the Empire. After the fall of the Safavids, Shiraz suffered a period of decline, worsened by the raids of the Afghans and the rebellion of its governor against Nader Shah; the latter sent troops to suppress the revolt. The city was besieged for many months and eventually sacked. At the time of Nader Shah's murder in 1747 most of the historical buildings of the city were damaged or ruined, and its population fell to 50,000, a quarter of that of the 16th century. Shiraz soon returned to prosperity under the enlightened rule of Karim Khan Zand who made it his capital in 1762. Employing more than 12,000 workers he constructed a royal district with a fortress, many administrative buildings, a mosque and one of the finest covered bazaars in Iran. He had a moat built around the city, constructed an irrigation and drainage system, and rebuilt the city walls. However, Karim Khan's heirs failed to secure his gains. When Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, eventually came to power, he wreaked his revenge on Shiraz by destroying the city fortification and moving the national capital to Sari. Although lowered to the rank of provincial capital, Shiraz maintained a level of prosperity as a result of the continuing importance of the trade route to the Persian Gulf and its governorship was a royal prerogative throughout the Qajar dynasty. many of the famous gardens, buildings and residences built during the nineteenth century, contribute to the actual outlook of the city. Eram Garden Shiraz is the birthplace of the founder of the short-lived Babi movement, the B√°b (Sayyid \`Ali-Muhammad Shirazi, 1819-1850). In this city, on the evening of 22 May 1844, he began discussions that led to his claiming to be an interpreter of the Qur'an, the first of several progressive claims between then and 1849. Since Shirazi is considered a 'forerunner' of the Baha'i religion, Shiraz is a holy city for Bah√°‚Äô√≠s, where the Bab's House (demolished in 1979 by the Islamic regime) was a putative pilgrimage site. In 1910 a pogrom of the Jewish quarter started after false rumours that the Jews had ritually killed a Muslim girl. In the course of the pogrom, 12 Jews were killed and about 50 were injured,Littman (1979), p. 14 and 6,000 Jews of Shiraz were robbed of all their possessions.Littman (1979), p. 12 The city's role in trade greatly diminished with the opening of the trans-Iranian railway in the 1930s, as trade routes shifted to the ports in Khuzestan. Much of the architectural inheritance of Shiraz, and especially the royal district of the Zands, was either neglected or destroyed as a result of irresponsible town planning under the Pahlavi dynasty. Lacking any great industrial, religious or strategic importance, Shiraz became an administrative centre, although its population has grown considerably since the 1979 revolution.Shiraz History - Shiraz Travel Guide - Lonely Planet Recent history Recently many historical sites in the city were renovated. But in 1979, the Islamic regime demolished the beautifully restored house that had belonged to Sayyid 'Ali Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab, and built a mosque on the site. The Shiraz International Airport is expanded. Agriculture has always been a major part of the economy in and around Shiraz. This is partially due to a relative abundance of water compared to the surrounding deserts. The Gardens of Shiraz and \\"Evenings of Shiraz\\" are famous throughout Iran and the middle east. The moderate climate and the beauty of the city has made it a major tourist attraction. Shiraz is also home to many Iranian Jews, although most have immigrated to the United States and Israel in the last half of the twentieth century, particularly after the Islamic Revolution. Along with Tehran and Esfahan Shiraz is one of the handful of Iranian cities with sizable Jewish populations and more than one active synagogue. The municipality of Shiraz and the related cultural institutions have promoted and carried out many important restoration and reconstruction projects through the city. Among the most recent ones are the complete restoration of the Arg of Karim Khan and of the Vakil Bath as well as a comprehensive plan for the preservation of the old city quarters. Other noteworthy initiatives of the municipality include the total renovation of the Qur'an Gate and the mausoleum of the poet Khwaju Kermani, both located in the Allahu Akbar Gorge, as well as the grand project of expansion of the mausoleum of the world-famous poet Hafiz.

It was basically an update to their first product, the Ensoniq ESQ-1. Compared to the ESQ-1, the SQ-80 includes 43 additional waveforms (including five drumkits), an enhanced sequencer, and a floppy disk drive for storing patches and sequences. Synthesis-wise, the SQ-80 introduced the so-called 2nd Release, a low-cost solution to simulate reverb-like effects. In contrast to the ESQ-1, the SQ-80 not only offers MIDI in and out, but also MIDI thru jacks. The SQ-80 was the first Ensoniq product to feature their patented Polypressure Keyboard technology. Unlike the ESQ-1 and Mirage, the SQ-80's keyboard offers channel pressure and polyphonic pressure (aftertouch) as well as programmable hardness (velocity). Since the keyboard does not use mechanical sensors for detecting velocity and pressure, it is immune to contact problems (which ESQ-1 and Mirage suffered from) and pressure sensor wear-out (like conventional keyboards). Because of the hardware similarities, the SQ-80's operating system was later back-ported to the ESQ-1 to become the latest ESQ-1 OS Version 3.5, which is almost identical to SQ-80 OS 1.8 apart from the hardware-specific features (additional waveforms, floppy routines, and keyboard control). This machine also features the same interface as its predecessor (ESQ-1) at a time when other synthesizers were getting harder and harder to program due to their frustrating obscure menu navigation systems. On the SQ-80 and ESQ-1, a large fluorescent display consisting of two rows of 40 alpha-numeric characters shows many parameters at once for a given section, and buttons placed over and under it give instant access to each one.

Another common definition is the following: Share of wallet is the percentage (\\"share\\") of a customer's expenses (\\"of wallet\\") for a product that goes to the firm selling the product. Different firms fight over the share they have of a customer's wallet, all trying to get as much as possible. Typically, these different firms don't sell the same but rather ancillary or complementary product. Share of wallet is commonly used in the finance and banking sectors to describe share-of-customer. Increasing share-of-customer is a key consideration increasing customer lifetime value.Fripp, G (2014) Increasing Customer Revenues The reason is that retaining and growing customers is cheaper than acquiring new customers. Forte Consultancy says: \\"The percentage of a customer's spend that is with a given company over a given amount of time. For a gas retailer, for example, it's the number of times a given customer fills up their car's gas tank one month at their own pumps divided by the total number of times the same customer fills up their car's gas tank that entire month.

The number of households from the period 1831 to 1961 fluctuates with little pattern. The data has no huge anomalies except for one but yet no clear relationship. For example, the one large anomaly in the data is the period from 1831 to 1851. In 1831 there were 64 occupied households yet in 1841 there were 108 before declining again to 66 households occupied in 1851. The 20th century map of Brandeston from Vision of Britain shows Brandeston and the surrounding villages, including Cretingham, Hoo and Kettleburgh.  Churches  The medieval parish church (the Church of All Saints) is a Gothic building, with a square tower. There is an Independent chapel, built in 1838, capable of accommodating 400 persons. In 1602, the chancel of All Saints was described as ruinous, and from 1861 to 1863 restoration of the church began. The Vicar of Brandeston between 1596-1645 was John Lowes. Lowes was accused of witchcraft by the self-styled 'Witchfinder General' Matthew Hopkins, and was tried at the 1645 Bury St Edmunds witch trial where he was hanged. Lowes story was dramatised as part of Ronald Bassett's 1966 novel Witchfinder General which was released as a film two years later. Lowes' figure now features on the village sign, hanging from the gallows.  Demographic  Population series for Brandeston According to the 2011 Census, there were 144 males and 152 females living in Brandeston. The median age of residents in Brandeston is 48 and 49.3% of all usual residents are in the age range of 45‚Äì74, according to the Office of National Statistics. Occupations have been grouped by status from 1831 data. It shows that there were 15 people categorised as Employers & Professionals, 31 as Middling Sorts, 70 as Labourers & Servants and 22 as Others. The graph titled 'Occupational structure for Brandeston in 1881' shows the dominance of men working during this time. The main occupational sector for men was by far agriculture, the second most popular sector was persons working with houses, furniture and decorations, and thirdly those working with animals. The women's occupational structure is very different with unknown occupations, persons without specified occupations and domestic offices or services all being the main sectors that they worked in. Occupation definitions are different from those in 1831. In 2011 out of 134, 42 work in Professional occupations, 27 work in Associate Professional and Technical Occupations, 21 as Managers, Directors and Senior Officials, 14 in Administrative and Secretarial Occupations, 14 in Skilled Trades Occupations, 7 in Caring and Leisure Occupations, 6 in Sales and Customer Service Occupations, 2 in Elementary Occupations and 1 in Process, Plant and Machine Operatives.

Content  \\"I wanted 28 tracks\\", John Lydon told Select, \\"but you have to be reasonable, I suppose. Virgin only wanted eight ‚Äì 'Ooh, that's all we can get on one album' ‚Äì and I thought, 'Hold on, I've been on your label twelve years and you only want eight songs? Fuck off!' I refused to deal with them until they came round to my way of thinking. I relished the chance to see what things like 'Warrior' would sound like next to 'Death Disco' and 'Memories', to see if there was any vein running through them. And I was very pleased: there is. They sound like a solid piece of work. They could all have been done at the same time. All musically different, but the attitude is predominant.

Early life Farrington was born on 6 April 1908, in Dunmurry, Northern Ireland. He qualified as a marine radio operator in 1929 and joined the Merchant Navy where he served for the next 6 years. First visits to Polar regions After serving on P & O liners and cargo ships he began his Antarctic career as part of the Discovery Committee, voyaging south to the coasts of Enderby Land, Kemp Land and Mac. Robertson Land. Between 1937 and 1938, he served with future Operation Tabarin leader James Marr aboard HMS William Scoresby. In addition to his radio duties Farrington took charge of producing the ship's journal Pelagic News. As a ship-based member Farringdon received the Bronze Polar Medal, a distinction which always rankled with him.It has, however, since been awarded to him after his death: Telegraph Obituary (ibid) Wartime Service After the outbreak of war, Farrington became an Air Ministry inspector based at Metropolitan-Vickers in Manchester, until he was summoned to London for secondment to Operation Tabarin,a predecessor of the British Antarctic Survey, launched to safeguard British interests south of the Falkland Islands, where both the Argentine and Chilean governments asserted claims to sovereignty War II-60.htm Further explanation under the overall command of Lt-Cdr James Marr. Based on Deception Island, in the South Shetlands, Farrington had expected to spend the winter of 1945‚Äì46 at Hope Bay, but his sense of duty made him exchange places with a less experienced radio operator. Thus, technically, he never wintered on the Antarctic mainland, with the result that he was not awarded the Silver Polar MedalExplanation of ruling Post war On his return from the Antarctic in 1946, Farrington became a scientific officer with the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern, moving two years later to the new electronics division at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell. He retired in 1975 and returned to Northern Ireland in 1989, where he died on 4 October 2002, survived by his wife and son.

Monty Lapica was not originally cast for acting in the film, according to the subsequent documentary, The Making of Self-Medicated (2007), the first-time writer and director was also slated to play the starring role in his own life story after casting-calls failed to produce a suitable candidate. Plot On the edges of Las Vegas, 17-year-old Andrew's life is spiraling out of control. Unable to cope with the loss of his father, Andrew's descent into drugs and violence is gaining momentum, and the once promising young man is now headed for self- destruction (in what Variety calls ‚Äúan especially blistering performance by Monty Lapica‚Äù). Andrew's mother (Golden Globe nominee Diane Venora), helpless to control her son and fighting an addiction of her own, refuses to watch idly as her only child destroys himself. As a last resort, she hires a private company to forcibly kidnap and confine him in a locked-down and corrupt psychiatric hospital. As Andrew is subjected to the secret physical and emotional abuses of the program something inside him is re-awakened. He must somehow get free to save what's left of his life, but to do that, he knows he must first face his own demons head-on.  Cast  * Monty Lapica as Andrew Eriksen * Diane Venora as Louise Eriksen * Michael Bowen as Dan Jones * Greg Germann as Keith McCauley Reception Reviews have been generally favorable. The Hollywood Reporter said there was \\"a raw, unmannered intensity in Lapica's performance sets the requisite tone for the entire production. Self- Medicated is just what the doctor ordered.\\", and Variety magazine said the film was \\"a searing portrait of an out-of-control youth . . . strong acting from all quarters and an especially blistering performance from Lapica. Packs a startling punch!\\" After complimenting the musical score by Anthony Marinelli and cinematography by Denis Maloney, Jeannette Catsoulis writes for The New York Times, \\"When the institutional 'abuses' promised in the press notes fail to materialize (unless you count enforced standing and essay writing), the story becomes a monotonous loop of escape and recapture.\\"  Release  The film was theatrically released on August 31, 2007 in 15 markets, including New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Boston, San Diego, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Portland, Seattle, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Austin, and Las Vegas.

It has become the most popular of all the Weatherby cartridges. Background Roy Weatherby already had experience with other custom cartridges such as his own .270 Weatherby Magnum when he created the .300 Weatherby. Like most of his other magnum cartridges, this is based on a blown-out .300 H&H; Magnum case, using the signature Weatherby double-radius shoulder. The Weatherby was first introduced in 1944, and the .300 Winchester Magnum was introduced in 1963. In recent years, Remington, Winchester and Ruger have produced rifles in this caliber, and most major ammunition manufacturers now supply factory loads. Performance Historically, Weatherby claimed that this is the most powerful .30 caliber magnum rifle commercially available, but the recently introduced .300 RUM and Weatherby's own .30-378 Weatherby Magnum are now more powerful. Of course there are quite a few very large .30 caliber wildcat cartridges. One must note, however, when comparing the .300 RUM and the .300 Weatherby Magnum, the difference in factory loadings. Performance data is often listed on the side of the ammunition box for those who wish to do an in-store comparison. On average, Weatherby factory ammo is loaded to higher chamber pressures than Remington or Winchester magnum rounds. The Remington round can be handloaded to equal pressures, and as a consequence, surpass the .300 Weatherby in power. The .300 Wby is in common use by big-game hunters all over the world..300 Weatherby by Chuck Hawks (subscription required) See also * List of rifle cartridges * 7 mm caliber other cartridges in the same caliber range * Table of handgun and rifle cartridges References * .300 Weatherby Magnum at Accurate Powder Cartridge dimensions.

He employed many pseudonyms, including Neil Moret, Jules Lemare, L'Albert, Paul Bertrand, Julian Strauss, and Sidney Carter. His creative work is generally credited as \\"Moret\\" while his business dealings and ASCAP membership were under the name Daniels. Biography Daniels was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, and brought up in Saint Joseph and Kansas City, Missouri. At 18 he won a prize for his composition \\"Margery\\", which was performed by John Philip Sousa's band. By 1899, Daniels was such a celebrity that when Carl Hoffman published the sheet music for Scott Joplin's \\"Original Rags,\\" he made a point to credit Daniels as the arranger. It's not known if Daniels actually arranged the piece or merely transcribed it. In 1904 he started the Daniels and Russel publishing firm in Saint Louis, later forming his own firm and working as an executive with Jerome H. Remick & Co. In 1928 he wrote the music for the song \\"She's Funny That Way\\", to words that Richard A. Whiting‚Äî normally a composer himself‚Äî wrote as a gift to his wife. This was recorded by a number of singers, including Margaret Whiting, Richard's daughter. He also composed \\"Chloe (Song of the Swamp)\\" (1927; words by Gus Kahn), \\"Moonlight and Roses Bring Mem'ries of You\\" (1925; words and music Moret and Ben Black, but based upon an organ composition by Edwin H. Lemare), and did both words and music for \\"Song of the Wanderer\\" (1926). Under his real name Daniels published \\"You Tell Me Your Dream, I'll Tell You Mine\\" with A. H. Brown and Seymour Rice in 1899. A version of the song with lyrics by Gus Kahn was copyrighted by Villa Moret Music Publishers (another of Daniels' publishing enterprises) in 1928. The song been recorded hundreds of times, notable recordings including the Mills Brothers in 1931, the Eureka Brass Band in 1951, Connie Francis in 1961, as well as versions by Bing Crosby and the Ink Spots.

He contributed regularly to the magazine The Cricketer as well as writing numerous books on the subject. Life and career After completing his schooling at Eton College in 1887, he became a journalist and writer and subsequently a publisher, at one time being the sole proprietor of Williams & Norgate Ltd. In addition to his own books, he contributed to annuals for county cricket clubs and also wrote for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.Haigh, p. 66. He was known on cricket grounds all over the country, recognisable by the red carnation that he always wore. His memories of cricket went back as far as 1878, when as a small boy he was taken to the Gentlemen of England v. the Australians match at Prince's Cricket Ground. He first went to Lord's in 1880, when he met W. G. Grace. Later that season he watched the first Test match to be played in England, at The Oval. He attended no fewer than seventy of the annual Oxford v. Cambridge games. He watched every Test match at Lord's from the first one in 1884 to the one in 1956, shortly before he died. He was an enthusiastic statistician but a somewhat inaccurate one, a fact noted by Plum Warner in Sir Home's obituary in The Cricketer. He was friends with such great figures of the game as K. S. Ranjitsinhji, with whom he drove in a silver coach to the Delhi Durbar, Lord Hawke and Lord Harris. He collaborated with the latter two in editing the Marylebone Cricket Club's (MCC) Memorial Biography of W. G. Grace. He was the inaugural President of the London Club Cricket Conference from 1915 to 1919,\\"Sir Home Gordon\\", The Cricketer, Annual 1956-57, pp. 532‚Äì33. chairman of the Sports Conference in 1919, and held practically every honorary position for Sussex, being their President in 1948. When young he played for MCC amateur sides, but never played first-class cricket. However, for his services to Sussex, he was given a county cap, an old one belonging to A. E. R. Gilligan. Outside cricket, he held a post at the Air Ministry in 1918 and was a member of the Committee of National Alliance of Employers and Employed from 1918 to 1919.\\"Prominent British Gordons of Today\\" He succeeded to the Baronetcy when his father died in 1906.

Named after Madera County, California, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-905 by the Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 19 November 1944; launched on 30 November 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Paul Gulling; and commissioned on 20 January 1945. Service history=World War II, 1945‚Äì1946 After commissioning, the ship was fitted out at New Orleans and then underwent brief training exercises along the gulf coast. In February 1945 she departed for the Pacific, arriving the next month at Pearl Harbor. Following further training, she departed Hawaii on 16 April for the Marianas. By mid-May she was at Guam where she joined a convoy then gathering to get underway for Okinawa. She arrived at Okinawa Gunto on 8 June, remaining until the 28th. She continued to operate in the western Pacific, shuttling cargo and passengers among the island groups until returning to the United States in 1946. On 11 September 1946 she was deactivated and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. While still inactive the LST was given the name USS Madera County (LST-905) on 1 July 1955. 1963‚Äì1965 On 30 March 1963 Madera County recommissioned, retaining her reserve status. With a crew of volunteers from the Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force, she underwent shakedown training at San Diego and then began preparations for a voyage to a new home port at the Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Virginia. Arriving there on 19 June, she came under the control of the Commander, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Her mission as part of this Fleet was to be able to support, on short notice, any military operation in the Atlantic-Caribbean area. The next year and a half was spent on extensive amphibious training exercises and shipyard periods to insure this ability. On 22 March 1965 she proceeded to Cape Kennedy, Florida to stand by during the recovery phase of the first manned Project Gemini shot. On 27 April the ship again departed Little Creek for southern waters, this time transporting equipment to Puerto Rico. The next day the Dominican Republic crisis arose, and upon delivery of her cargo at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico she headed for San Juan where she went on four-hour standby duty. In May she made one trip to Little Creek, returning to the Caribbean within two weeks with Army units aboard. On 8 June, she debarked these units at Puerta de Andres, Dominican Republic and loaded other Army units for a voyage back to the east coast. She returned to Little Creek on 15 June, but before the end of the year completed three more Caribbean deployments; 13 August to 15 September 25 October to 10 November, and 18 November to 8 December. On 11 December the LST was assigned active status and then underwent overhaul in preparation for extended sea duty. Vietnam War, 1966‚Äì1969 Ordered to the western Pacific, Madera County steamed out of Hampton Roads on 11 February 1966 en route to the Philippines. She entered Subic Bay on 1 May and the next week commenced logistic support of Vietnamese operations. During the ensuing months she transported ammunition and construction materials to the Republic of Vietnam, off-loading at ports such as Qui Nhon, Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Nha Trang. She also called at ports in the Philippines, on Taiwan and in Japan. Upkeep and maintenance periods were held at Sasebo during July and December 1966. Following her December overhaul, Madera County returned to Subic Bay and support of combat operations in South Vietnam, continuing this role through 1969. Madera County was attached to Landing Ship Squadron 2 (LANSHIPRON 2) and classified as an \\"in-country\\" activity, her crew made up of sailors who volunteered for service in Vietnam. She operated under orders from Naval Support Activity, Vietnam (NAVSUPPACT), and the Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS). During 1967‚Äì1969 she operated primarily in the Mekong Delta providing personnel/equipment transport and logistical support to the Patrol Boat River (PBR) Base at Binh Thuy and Mobile Riverine Force (MRF) bases up and down the river. In 1967‚Äì68 a typical run started from Saigon (Newport LST piers) then to V≈©ng T√†u and across V≈©ng T√†u Bay to the mouth of the Mekong River near M·ªπ Tho. From the M·ªπ Tho area the trip continued up river to a turn through point near Vƒ©nh Long into the Bassac River. The run continued down the Bassac to the PBR base LST ramp at Binh Thuy. After off-loading cargo the ship proceeded on the Bassac River to the V≈©ng T√†u anchorage and then back to Saigon for another load. During the same period the ship made several trips up the coast of South Vietnam, beaching at Nha Trang and Da Nang. From Da Nang the ship loaded with trucks and transported Marines and supplies to C·ª≠a Vi·ªát Base near the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone. During the Tet Offensive Madera County was ordered to proceed into Saigon on 2 February 1968 to see if the port was still viable for merchant ships that were backing up at the Vung Tau anchorage. The ship arrived after going through the \\"abandoned\\" heart of Saigon and had to anchor at the Newport Beach LST slip because Army personnel were not present to assist with docking. The ship's LCVPs were lowered, a line handling party put on the pier and the ship was docked by her own crew. That afternoon a party of officers went into Saigon and returned about dusk with a USO tour of NFL players who were stranded at the Capitol Hotel. The players included (among others): Jack Kemp, Bobby Bell, Andy Russell, Bill Brown and John David Crow. A most unusual day. In June 1968 Madera County began logistical support operations with the Mobile Riverine Force. That assignment continued until she was turned over to the Philippine Navy in 1969. The motto of Madera County was: \\"Any Beach in the World\\" and included a few places that weren't beaches at all! Decommissioning and transfer Decommissioned (date unknown), the tank landing ship was transferred (leased) to the Philippine Navy on 29 November 1969 and renamed RPS Ilcos Norte (LT-87). Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1979, she was sold to the Philippines on 1 March 1980. The ship was struck from the Philippine Navy in 1992; her final fate is unknown. Awards LST-905 earned one battle star for World War II service, and as Madera County ten campaign stars for Vietnam War service.

Tuzo Wilson Knolls and Tuzo Wilson Knolls, are two young active submarine volcanoes off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, located northwest of Vancouver Island and south of the Haida Gwaii archipelago (briefly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands.) The two seamounts are members of the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain, rising to above the mean level of the northeastern Pacific Ocean and is a seismically active site southwest of the southern end of the Queen Charlotte Fault. They are named after Canadian geologist John Tuzo Wilson. Geology The two submarine volcanoes are capped by hawaiite and are surrounded by numerous smaller vents, with a total edifice volume of about 12 km3. The lava emitted in eruptions at the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown extrusive volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic) that is usually fine-grained due to rapid cooling of lava. Glassy pillow lava is found at the seamounts, a type of rock typically formed when basaltic lava emerges from a submarine volcanic vent. The viscous lava gains a solid crust on contact with the water, and this crust cracks and oozes additional large blobs or \\"pillows\\" as more lava emerges from the advancing flow. The origin of the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts is not without controversy. Some geologists theorize that the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts are linked with a hotspot because lava at the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts are fresh, glassy pillow basalts of recent age, as expected if these seamounts are located above or close to a hotspot south of the Haida Gwaii archipelago.J. Tuzo Wilson Knolls: Canadian hotspot Retrieved on 2007-08-13Origin of Igneous Rocks: The Isotopic Evidence Retrieved on 2008-03-08 Others prefer rifting as the cause of volcanism because the seamounts are close to the Explorer spreading center. No theory is close to airtight. Part of the controversy is due to the uncertain origin of the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain. There is a long gap between recently (Late Pleistocene to Holocene) active Bowie and Tuzo Wilson Seamounts, both of which have erupted alkaline basalts of similar composition. If a mantle plume was responsible for activity at both seamounts, then it is likely that there would be evidence for alkaline volcanic activity in the area between these two seamounts.A near-ridge origin for seamounts at the southern terminus of the Pratt-Welker Seamount Chain, northeast Pacific Ocean Retrieved on 2008-03-07 See also *Geology of the Pacific Northwest *List of volcanoes in Canada *Volcanology of Canada *Volcanology of Western Canada References Category:Submarine volcanoes Category:Seamounts of the Pacific Ocean Category:Volcanoes of British Columbia Category:Hotspot volcanoes Category:Ridge volcanoes Category:Central Coast of British Columbia Category:Active volcanoes ","title":"Tuzo Wilson Seamounts"},{"id":"12755802","text":"Ole R√∏mer Aagaard Sandberg (21 July 1900 ‚Äì 26 August 1985) was a Norwegian farmer and politician for the Centre Party.

The Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method for the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations bears his name. Maruyama was born in 1916 and graduated from Tohoku University, where he studied Fourier analysis and physics. He began his mathematical work with a paper on Fourier analysis in 1939. He became interested in probability theory through the study of Norbert Wiener's work. He was appointed Assistant professor at the Kyushu University in 1941. When Kiyosi It√¥ published his papers on stochastic differential equations in 1942, Maruyama immediately recognized the importance of this work and soon published a series of papers on stochastic differential equations and Markov processes. Maruyama is known in particular for his 1955 study of the convergence properties of the finite-difference approximations for the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations, now known as the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method. In harmonic analysis, he studied the ergodicity and mixing properties of stationary stochastic processes in terms of their spectral properties. Maruyama also studied quasi-invariance properties of the Wiener measure, extending previous work by Cameron and Martin to diffusion processes. ReferencesExternal links * Gisiro Maruyama / Eugene B.

Andrew Rebholz became chief executive officer (CEO) in 2018. In November 2017, Barry Richards was appointed president and chief operating officer, and William Myers was named executive vice president (EVP), chief financial officer (CFO), and treasurer. History A Travel Center in Maybrook, New York, 2009 TravelCenters of America was established by Phil Saunders in 1972 as Truckstops of America. The company was among the first truck stop chains in the nation, and was purchased by Ryder later that year. Standard Oil of Ohio acquired the chain in 1984. After Standard Oil was purchased by BP, the multinational oil and gas company sold TA to Clipper Group in 1993. The chain merged with National Auto/Truckstops in 1997, resulting in the new name TravelCenters of America Inc. (TA). In the late 1990s, TA purchased seventeen Burns Bros. Travel Stops, then merged with over a dozen units of Travel Ports of America. By 2000, the company had 160 locations in 40 U.S. states, 12,500 employees, and annual sales of $1.5 billion. TA was acquired by Oak Hill Capital Partners in 2000. TA ranked #94 and #60 on Forbes list of the largest private companies in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In 2006, Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT) agreed to acquire the company for approximately $1.9 billion. The acquisition was completed in January 2007, and TA shares started being traded on the American Stock Exchange on February 1. TA continued operating as a fully owned subsidiary of HPT, which continued to be TA's largest shareholder, as of mid 2015. In May 2007, TA acquired the operating businesses of the El Paso-based Petro Stopping Centers, and leased 40 Petro locations from HPT. RDG Capital Management encouraged TA to implement a $100 million share repurchase plan in 2015 to increase its stock price, in addition to leasing and selling more company- owned properties. TA elected to sign an approximately $400 million sale leaseback deal with HPT. In mid 2016, the company's board of directors rejected a buyout submitted by the private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in December 2015. The offer was for $14 per share, valuing TA at $540 million. TA filed a lawsuit against Comdata in November in response to the payment processor provider's allegations that TA breached agreements. The Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Comdata to abide by contract terms and reimburse TA for excess fees charged since February 2017, plus interest and attorney's fees. The court's final ruling is pending, as of March 2018. Hillsboro Travel Center, 2018 During 2015‚Äì2017, TA remodeled 56 Minit Mart and 24 Petro or TA locations. The company has also focused on providing truckers with electronic logging device solutions, following a mandate issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in 2015. TA ranked number 17 in CSP magazine's late 2017 list of the largest U.S. convenience store chains. The company was also recognized by the Women's Forum of New York for having a board with 40 percent female representation. In November 2017, president and CEO Thomas O'Brien announced his resignation effective December 31. The board promoted Barry Richards, then serving as EVP, to the president and chief operating officer role, and named William Myers, who held the senior vice president and chief accounting officer position, to EVP, CFO and treasurer. Adam Portnoy replaced O'Brien as the board's managing director. Andrew Rebholz became CEO in early 2018, having previously served as EVP, CFO, and treasurer. TA partnered with the payment solutions provider Wex in February 2018 to provide fuel card services to approximately 500 TA locations throughout the U.S. The company also confirmed sponsorship of the \\"truck service challenge\\" competition for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and NASCAR Xfinity Series. TA expanded its Westlake headquarters in March 2017 by purchasing a nearby building. TA fundraises for the St. Christopher Truckers Development and Relief Fund, which helps truck drivers who struggle financially as the result of health issues, annually since 2010. The company is the fund's largest contributor. The company has been included on the Fortune 500 list for ten years, and ranks #470, as of 2018.

It is the most widely used valuation multiple based on enterprise value and is often used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, the P/E ratio (Price/Earnings ratio) to determine the fair market value of a company. Use An advantage of this multiple is that it is capital structure-neutral, and, therefore, this multiple can be used to directly compare companies with different levels of debt.Pharmaceutical Valuation Methodology & Case Studies The EV/EBITDA multiple requires prudent use for companies with low profit margins (i.e., for an EBITDA estimate to be reasonably accurate, the company under evaluation must have legitimate profitability). Often, an industry average EV/EBITDA multiple is calculated on a sample of listed companies to use for comparison to the company of interest (i.e., as a benchmark). An example of such an index is one that provides an average EV/EBITDA multiple on a wide sample of transactions on private companies in the Eurozone. The reciprocate multiple EBITDA/EV is used as a measure of cash return on investment.

The film focuses on Monica Sevianu, Lusztig's grandmother, and the only female involved in the heist. The documentary gets its name from a propaganda film that was made by the Romanian government three years after the robbery was committed. The original Reconstruction was a strange blend of documentary and fiction, where the criminals played themselves in a crime-film whose plot was driven by clues that self-congratulatory detectives pieced together. The propaganda film was only screened to journalists and high-ranking Communist officials before being buried beneath government files. Lusztig managed to find a copy and incorporates clips into her documentary. Summary Exploring her dark family secret, Lusztig blends Romania's history with her personal history. Modern footage of Bucharest, news clips from the postwar era, and personal family interviews are compiled in order to make sense of her grandmother's criminal behavior. But, unlike a typical crime-thriller, the real-life criminal is complicated and can't be fully understood from a few pieces of evidence and an extorted confession. By 1959 it was clear that the utopia communism had promised Romania was not going to be a reality. Antisemitism, which had been boiling since before the war, continued to pose a threat, and the suspicion and distrust of the communist age affected the entire nation. Monica and her husband Gugu (Igor), who also participated in the robbery, had been communist supporters who were abandoned and abused by the government as soon as it came to power. Lusztig's documentary speculates that government's oppression and antisemitism encouraged their criminal behavior. Having given up on their hopes for a government they believed in, Monica and her husband turned to adventure and pleasure seeking. With the money she stole, before her arrest, Monica bought a pleated gray skirt and an orange angora sweater. Material pleasures offered happiness and certainty that the government had taken from her. With a tone of uncertainty Lusztig tries to sort through the rumors that surround the crime in hopes of discovering what really happened. Were the criminals going to give the money to poor Jews in their community? Were they going to fly away and escape to Israel? Or, perhaps, was the crime staged by the communist government to encourage antisemitism? Surprises and twists unfold in the process to unveil the truth. Production *Lusztig was eleven or twelve years old when her mother told her about her grandmother's dark past. Before then, it had remained a well-kept secret. Lusztig did not know her grandmother. She only met her twice. She says her inspiration for constructing a film around an absent female protagonist came from German writer Heinrich B√∂ll's novel Group Portrait with Lady. *Lusztig's editing and filming draws from Du≈°an Makavejev and the belief that a filmmaker should trust his or her intuition and can make connections between seemingly unconnected images. Film festivals and awards Reconstruction was screened at a number of film festivals including: * Vancouver International Film Festival * Docaviv Documentary Film Festival * It's All True S√£o Paulo Documentary Film Festival * Singapore International Film Festival * Cleveland International Film Festival * Documentary Fortnight, Museum of Modern Art, NY * Boston International Women's Film Festival * Atlanta Film Festival * Palic International Film Festival Serbia * Alpe Adria Cinema Film Festival Italy * New York Jewish Women Film Festival Reconstruction received the following awards: * FIPRESCI Jury Nomination- from IDFA Amsterdam International Documentary Festival * Certificate of Merit- from San Francisco International Film Festival * \\"Rediscoveries/Discoveries\\" Award- from the Boston Society of Film Critics * Best Documentary- at the New England Film Festival Reception Reconstruction received praise from the Boston Phoenix, Variety, and film scholars at Harvard and Berkeley.

The Elamite lands were finally ravaged beyond repair in 639 BC. Background Clashes between the Elamites and the Assyrians had been ongoing for many years prior to 721 BC, the first recorded conflict between Elamites and Assyrians. For many centuries before that, the Elamites had made it a habit of intervening in Babylonian politics. Naturally this would have placed them in conflict with the Assyrians, who saw Babylon as within their sphere of influence. In 721 BC, the Babylonians rebelled against Assyria and Elamite forces attempted to aid Babylon in her revolt. Following this event, the Assyrians and Elamites clashed on numerous occasions; at the Tigris in 717 BC, along the Elamite coast as part of an amphibious invasion in 694 BC, at the province of Der and again at the River Diyala in 693 BC (this may have been the same battle). For the most part, these battles were bloody and inconclusive. However, the Assyrians were able to obtain the upper hand for the most part, demonstrated by the failure of the Elamites to extend their power beyond the boundaries of Mesopotamia. After a failed attack on Babylon in 655 BC, Elamite power soon began to collapse. At the Battle of Ulai in the plain of Susa, an Assyrian army assaulted strong Elamite defensive positions. The Elamites were soundly beaten and Teumman, the Elamite king, was beheaded during the battle. Although another Babylonian revolt saved Elam from immediate invasion, it would remain one of the most important objectives in the mind of Assurbanipal. Campaign against Elam In 648 BC, the Elamite city of Susa was razed to the ground; it was to be a terrible portent of events to come. In 639 BC the Assyrians moved their entire army from the west to destroy their enemies; it would be their last and most glorious act of retribution and conquest that the Assyrians had mastered like none before. Collapse of Elam The defeats inflicted by Assyria on Elamite offensives were one of many problems facing the Elamites; civil war had erupted in the land, whilst her northern borders were being overrun by the Persians. In 639 BC, Assurbanipal moved into Elam and proudly documented the vengeance against Elamite incursions: With Elam destroyed, the Assyrians returned to find their Empire falling apart; years of war had destroyed their ability to wage it. Within 34 years of Elam's destruction, Assyria fell as an independent political entity in the Middle East forever. Relief of the Battle of Ulai, British Museum.

During the period of German unification (1866-1871), Saxony, along with the other states of the German Empire, entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous.

Originally signing on in January 1995 with a pop alternative format and a line up of student DJs, WWKX veterans including Kickin Al Snape, a young Robby Bridges and others as \\"WELH: Taking Music to New Heights\\". In 1996 the station moved to a modern rock format programmed by student DJs as \\"Extreme 88\\", and later jazz and oldies, eventually offering programming from various groups (including Brown University, Rhode Island College, the Wheeler School itself, and community groups). Since October 8, 2011, WELH has broadcast programming from Rhode Island Public Radio. Its main studio is located on school grounds, at 216 Hope St. in Providence; however, as a repeater station of The Public's Radio, virtually all programming originates at the network's studios at Union Station in downtown Providence. On Sunday nights, Wheeler Student programming can be heard on WELH. Former programming=Brown Student & Community Radio Brown Student and Community Radio (BSR) is a freeform, student- and community-radio station in Providence, Rhode Island which had broadcast on WELH and streaming on http://www.bsrlive.com. It grew out of \\"WBRU-AM\\" (a carrier current station on the Brown University campus) in 1997 as a noncommercial and educational alternative to WBRU's primary commercially operated station for students at Brown University, and in 2003 it became a joint student-community radio station. In 2008, mtvU nominated BSR as one of the top radio stations in the country. BSR's involvement with WELH was discontinued on July 31, 2011 as part of its transition to being the flagship of Rhode Island Public Radio; its programming continues as an Internet radio station. In conjunction with other community organizations, BSR acquired a low-power FM license in 2018 and now operates on WBRU-LP 101.1 FM in Providence. Rhode Island College Radio Rhode Island College Radio, \\"WXIN\\" was an original partner of WELH, formerly sending a signal from the college's studios to WELH on weekday nights and weekends. Much of WELH's broadcast studio was purchased by \\"WXIN\\" as part of a mutual broadcast agreement. Only veteran \\"WXIN\\" DJs were permitted to have a show on WELH. The agreement began shortly after WELH beat \\"WXIN\\" in the acquisition of a broadcast license (both had applied for the license from the FCC to broadcast on 88.1 in the late 1980s). In the late 1990s, \\"WXIN\\" members shared airtime with WELH on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sundays, and by the early 2000s \\"WXIN\\" only broadcast on the weekends (and occasionally weekdays during the summer). Over time, Brown University's student radio bought out WXIN's airtime, limiting Rhode Island College's use of the station to Sundays. By 2007, Brown bought the remainder of the airtime, effectively removing WXIN's involvement from WELH. This air time was later filled by a Latino block until Noon and an Italian block from Noon-9 p.m. Latino Public Radio WELH was the original home for Latino Public Radio, a Spanish-language public radio service, airing its programming from 3 a.m.‚Äì3 p.m. on weekdays and from 3 a.m.‚Äìnoon on weekends. When the station became the flagship station of Rhode Island Public Radio, LPR's programming moved to a 24-hour clearance on WRNI (1290 AM), RIPR's original Providence station; this move allowed LPR to qualify for Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding. WELH lost its flagship status when RIPR bought WUMD in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth and moved it to WLNE-TV's former tower in Tiverton as WNPN. However, WELH is still used to improve WNPN's coverage in the few areas in and around Providence without a clear signal from WNPN. Power increase In early 2009, WLNE-TV (channel 6) permanently moved to UHF channel 49 for digital broadcasts. The move has removed a roadblock for increasing the power of WELH on the 88.1 frequency. According to the FCC database, WELH has applied for and received a construction permit to upgrade their transmitting facilities from 150 watts to 4,000 watts. The upgraded power and antenna will double the current coverage area and improve reception in metropolitan Providence.

Geological investigations took place but plans for the facility were abandoned in 1987. The RAF station was used from October 1944 until the end of the war by two Lancaster squadrons, one of which was 189 Squadron. Fulbeck Hall Fulbeck Hall Fulbeck Hall, the home of the Fane family since 1632, has been much altered. It is now mostly built in the classically inspired style of the 18th century, however there is a Tudor wing at the back of the hall and large Tudor cellars. The hall was purchased, in 1622, by Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland, 8th Baron le Despenser and de jure 8th and 6th Baron Bergavenny, of Apethorpe Hall, Northamtonshire, from Sir George Manners, who remained in residence until he became the 7th Earl of Rutland in 1632. The hall then went to the Earl of Westmorland's son, Sir Francis Fane, a courtier, Royalist and commander of the King's forces at Doncaster and Lincoln. Under the Commonwealth, the estate was confiscated, however, Sir Francis Fane was allowed to buy it back, and before the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, he and his wife Elizabeth Darcy, daughter of Sir Edward Darcy MP, grandson of the executed traitor Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy, occupied much of their time in rebuilding the Hall in Restoration style. It was burned down 30 December 1731, and was rebuilt 1732‚Äì1733, with only the back wings and cellars surviving from the early 17th century. The Fane (Neville inspired) crest in Fulbeck's church. His son, also Sir Francis, married Hannah Rushworth daughter of John Rushworth MP and private secretary to Oliver Cromwell . Rushworth was a republican and historian who is credited with drafting the Bill that abolished the monarchy, House of Lords and established England as a Republic, and many of his works and words were used by Thomas Jefferson when he drafted the American Declaration of Independence. In 1767 Fulbeck Hall was left to Henry Fane of Brympton owner of Brympton d'Evercy who was a grandson of Sir Francis Fane, the second of Fulbeck and Hannah Rushworth. Henry Fane of Brymton made a fortune as a successful Bristol privateer and he left his Wormesley estates in Oxfordshire to his younger son Henry and his estates in Somerset, Dorset, and Lincolnshire were left to his eldest son Thomas Fane, 8th Earl of Westmorland Thomas, 8th earl inherited the estates of his father and his cousin the 7th Earl making him one of the richest landowners in England. He left Fulbeck Hall to his younger son the Hon Henry Fane MP in 1783. He was a clerk in the Treasury before in 1772 he became Keeper of the King's Private Roads, Gates and Bridges. Elizabethan gateway near Fulbeck Hall the Hon. Henry Fane MP followed a long list of Fanes as Members of Parliament for Lyme Regis the families pocket borough inherited from an uncle, John Scrope MP, Secretary to the Treasury and grandson of the executed regicide Colonel Adrian Scrope. The constituency at times provided the Fanes with two members of parliament at the same time and between 1753 and 1832 twelve separate members of the family represented Lyme Regis in the Tory interest. Throughout this period the Fane family also represented Constituencies in Somerset, Lincolnshire, Kent, Hampshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire. In 1777 Henry Fane married Anne Buckley Batson, heiress of the Avon Tyrrell estate in Hampshire, by whom he had 14 children. In 1784 they occupied Fulbeck and enlarged and refurnished it, adding a new north wing. During the 19th century the house was home to General Sir Henry Fane MP for Lyme Regis who was Commander-in-Chief, India as well as his brother General Mildmay Fane. Sir Henry bequeathed a life interest in the estate to his eldest son Col. Henry Fane(d.1836).Lincolnshire Archives 1 FANE 5/37/2, will of Col. Henry Fane His nephew General Walter Fane who raised Fane's Horse a regiment of volunteers to fight in China during the Second Opium War succeeded him at Fulbeck Hall. This regiment still exists as part of Pakistan's armed forces. General Walter Fane is not to be confused with his brother Colonel Francis Fane of Fulbeck Manor, who raised the Peshawar Light Horse in 1857 as an irregular cavalry unit to fight against the mutineers during the Indian Mutiny. This regiment was disbanded in 1903. In the early 20th century the house was home to Colonel William Vere Reeve King-Fane. During the Second World War 1939-1945 the house was requisitioned by the British Armed Forces and it was the location of the 1st Airborne Division before they left the United Kingdom for the Battle of Arnhem. There is still an Arnhem Museum at the house commemorating the soldiers based in the house during the war. All of the contents of Fulbeck Hall were sold by Sotheby's in October 2002. Included in the sale were letters and mementos given by the Duke of Wellington to two members of the Fane family - Harriet Fane, (better known as the early 19th- century diarist Mrs Arbuthnot) and her cousin Lady Georgiana Fane.

History Murray Hogarth graduated from Queen's University and worked at Gulf Canada Limited learning the petroleum business.\\"Introduction.\\" Pioneer Press 1 (Nov. 1985): n. pag. Print. After three years Hogarth quit his job and founded his own private brand service station business in 1956. The first of the Pioneer Petroleums stations was opened on November 29, 1956 and is located at 859 Upper James St. in Hamilton, Ontario. In 2011, Pioneer Petroleums changed their brand name to Pioneer Energy LP. It has modernized its operations with a number of different services. Snack Express is Pioneer's main convenience store brand and it offers standard convenience store items along with healthier snack options. As of 2012, Pioneer expanded its convenience store brands to include Verve, a new concept store that handles a more refined product offering. Many of its newer stations now offer Clean Express Car Washes with a variety of different washes. In 2013, Pioneer Fuels was established as an Esso branded commercial and home heating reseller in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. It services approximately 21,000 households and has since been expanding across Atlantic Canada. In 2014 Parkland Fuel Corp, agreed to buy Pioneer Energy (part-owned by Suncor Energy) for $378 million. 393 gas stations (148 with the Pioneer brand name) in Ontario and Manitoba were part of the initial deal. This merger was challenged by the Competition Bureau in 2015 with a modified acquisition being accepted in 2016. Loyalty Pioneer offered a Full-Service Pledge, promising to wash customer's windshields and check under their hoods with every fuel purchase of 10 litres or more. Failure to do so resulted in customers receiving a free fill-up. Its customer rewards/loyalty program began with collector stamps in the late 1950s. This was followed by the introduction of Pioneer Money in the 1960s. By the 1980s, the program evolved with the introduction of Pioneer paper Bonus Bucks. In the mid-2000s Pioneer began the Electronic Bonus Bucks card program. Bonus Bucks cardholders also benefit from exclusive discounts from Pioneer partner companies and organizations. Philanthropy Pioneer has contributed to many Ontario based charities. Its ‚ÄúGive What You Can‚Äù campaign has donated over $1 million to Ontario's five designated children's hospitals and continues to do so. In part due to these efforts, the McMaster Children's Hospital was able to build the ‚ÄúHogarth Family & Pioneer Energy Ophthalmology Centre‚Äù. As of 2012, Pioneer has also been involved in Operation Yellow Ribbon, which is an initiative across Canada to aid and support Canadian soldiers and their families. Pioneer became a donation partner of CHML/Y108 Christmas Tree of Hope. The donations go to the CHML/Y108 Children's Fund, which helps support McMaster Children's Hospital, the Salvation Army, and Hamilton Children's Aid.

Irwin was a finalist on the second season of America's Got Talent. Biography Prior to her America's Got Talent debut, Irwin has stated she has never performed publicly or received any vocal lessons. According to her bio on the NBC website, Irwin attended Harford Christian School where she was a cheerleader and became the class president. She is also said to want to sing the national anthem at Camden Yards, the home of the Baltimore Orioles. Irwin is a very devoted country music fan. In her own words, on her public website, she states: > I live for country music. If it didn't exist, a huge piece of my life would > be missing. It wakes me up in the morning and puts me to sleep at night, and > it's on my mind 24 hours a day. She also values her education: > School is such an integral part of my life. I really think it has molded me > into who I am today. In September 2007, she began her freshman year at Harford Christian School in Darlington. 2007: America's Got Talent As in the previous year, the show consisted of a nationwide search, through thousands of applicants all competing for the top one million dollar prize. Irwin first auditioned in New York, with an a cappella rendition of \\"How Do I Live\\" (LeAnn Rimes) by Diane Warren. The judges unanimously praised her raw talent and invited her to the Las Vegas callbacks. In subsequent shows, Irwin performed individual songs and passed through to the next round as follows: * Las Vegas Callbacks: \\"At Last\\" (Etta James) by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren. (Only shown briefly in a montage.) * Semifinals: \\"Bless the Broken Road\\" (Rascal Flatts) by Bobby Boyd, Jeff Hanna and Marcus Hummon. * Top Ten: \\"Til I Can Make It On My Own\\", by Tammy Wynette, George Richey and Billy Sherill. * The Final Eight: \\"Crazy\\" (Patsy Cline) by Willie Nelson. She became one of the top four finalists, and on August 14, performed \\"What Hurts the Most\\" (Rascal Flatts) by Jeffrey Steele and Steve Robson, as the judges' pick for her, and \\"Over The Rainbow\\" by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, as her choice. After the song, judge Piers Morgan said: > .Julienne, I still don't think you've done enough to win, but I've gotta > say, that was a brilliant performance. And I think if America gives votes > for people that make me look stupid, you're going to get lots of votes. The \\"Season Finale\\" was about entertainment, performance reviews and announcement of results. Irwin performed \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" with the famous country singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. After the song, Swift was asked, based on her experience as a teenage Country Music singer, what advice she would offer to Irwin. In reply, Swift commented: > ... She [Irwin] has such an adorable personality, and that's so much of the > battle right there. You know, being so endearing and so so humble. I think > she should just stay who she is. I think she's got it. Afterward, a prerecorded message was played from four-time CMA and three-time ACM Female Vocalist of the Year winner, Martina McBride. In it she said: > I just want to take this chance to let you know that I'm really impressed > with your [Irwin's] singing. You have a great voice. It's wonderful to watch > you. As a matter of fact, watching you brings back a lot of memories of > myself singing when I was your age... It was later announced that Irwin was the first contestant eliminated of the final four. Career On September 9, 2007, Julienne Irwin got to live her dream of singing the national anthem at Camden Yards, as reported in the September 10, 2007 issue of the Baltimore Sun. In the words of Sun reporter, John-John Williams IV: > Before she performed, the Bel Air resident showed signs of a typical awe- > struck teenager. Her jaw dropped after a brief conversation with Orioles > starter Melvin Mora. \\"Oh my gosh!\\" she mouthed to her father, Felix \\"Phil\\" > Irwin. When it was time to perform, Julienne displayed the poise and > maturity that captured fans this summer. The words of the anthem flowed with > the clarity and strength of a professional. Julienne later said she was a > bundle of nerves inside. The story goes on to say that Julienne is settling into life as a student. She began her freshman year at Harford Christian School in Darlington earlier that week. On September 23, 2007, Julienne Irwin's singing once again brought her to the national stage. She was invited to sing the national anthem to a crowd of 140,000 spectators at the Dodge Dealers 400, at Dover International Speedway, as televised on ABC to a nationwide audience. Irwin announced on her MySpace that she was going to tour with Kenny Rogers in December 2007. She finished the tour on December 23, 2007 and has written on her MySpace that she is extremely grateful to Kenny Rogers for giving her that opportunity.

His preferred position is full-back. Born in South Africa, he has the Dutch nationality, through his parents. Abendanon burst onto the scene during the 2006‚Äì07 season, scoring 10 tries in 24 first-team appearances for Bath. His form that season earned him a first England cap in South Africa ‚Äì the country of his birth ‚Äì in June 2007. He was capped again against France in August 2007, but narrowly missed out on a place in England's 30-man squad. However, he did eventually travel to France as cover for the final after a Josh Lewsey injury. A strong tackler, balanced runner and dangerous counter- attacker, he firmly established himself as Bath's first-choice full-back in the post-Matt Perry era. Some fine performances during the 2008‚Äì09 season were rewarded with a call-up for the England Saxons squad for the 2009 Churchill Cup in the United States. Retaining his place in the squad, Abendanon was part of the England Saxons victory of the 2010 Churchill Cup and his impressive performances resulted in him being named Player of the Tournament. Entering the 2010‚Äì11 season Abendanon continued his good form. Although he lost his place for a month to Jack Cuthbert due to a niggling injury which limited him to impact appearances of the bench, Abendanon was promoted to the England Elite squad as replacement for the banned Delon Armitage. This promotion put him in contention to feature during the 2011 Six Nations which some pundits believed he deserved for his improvement over the previous year. After eight years with Bath, as of 3 February 2014, Abendanon has signed for French giants Clermont Auvergne that play in the Top 14 from the 2014-15 season.

It has also been used to study the effects of microgravity on cell cultures, animal embryos and spider webs. Description A single axis :) (or horizontal) clinostat consists of a disc attached to a motor. They were originally clockwork but nowadays an electric motor is used. The disc is held vertically and the motor rotates it slowly at rates in the order of one revolution per minute. A plant is attached to the disc so that it is held horizontally. The slow rotation means that the plant experiences a gravitational pull that is averaged over 360 degrees, thus approximating a weightless environment. Clinostats have also been used to cancel out effects of sunlight and other stimuli besides gravity. This type of clinostat must be exactly horizontal to simulate absence of gravity. If the clinostat is at an angle from horizontal, a net gravity vector is perceived, the magnitude of which depends on the angle. This can be used to simulate lunar gravity (ca. 1/6 g) which requires an angle from the horizontal of ca. 10 deg., i.e. sin‚àí1(1/6). A plant only reacts to gravity if the gravistimulation is maintained for longer than a critical amount of time, called the minimal presentation time (MPT). For many plant organs the MPT lies somewhere between 10 and 200 seconds, and therefore a clinostat should rotate on a comparable timescale in order to avoid a gravitropic response. However, presentation time is cumulative, and if a clinostat's rotation is repeatedly stopped at a single position, even for periods as short as 0.5 s, a gravitropic response can result.B.G. Pickard (1973) Geotropic response patterns of the Avena coleoptile. I. Dependence on angle and duration of stimulation. Can. J. Bot. 51: 1003-1021 The presentation time for animals is one or two orders of magnitude faster than this, thus precluding the use of the slow rotation clinostat for most animal studies. However the fast rotation clinostat can be, and is, used for the study of animal cell cultures and embryos. Types and application *The usual type of clinostat turns slowly to avoid centrifugal effects and this is called the \\"slow rotation clinostat\\". There has been debate as to the most suitable speed of rotation: if it is too slow the plant has time to begin physiological responses to gravity; if it is too fast, centrifugal forces and mechanical strains introduce artifacts. The optimal rotational speed has been investigated by comparison to 'true' responses to microgravity as seen in space-grown plants,C.J. Lyon (1970) Choice of rotation rate for the horizontal clinostat, Plant Physiol. 46, pp. 355‚Äì358 and determined to be between 0.3 and 3 rpm for most plant systems. *The fast rotating clinostat (generally turning at between 30 and 150 rpm) can only be used for small samples (cell cultures in vials a few mm in diameter) typically in liquid media. Under these conditions excessive centrifugal effects, which precludes its use on larger samples, are avoided. *A single-axis clinostat only produces the effect of weightlessness along its axis of rotation. A 3D or two-axis clinostat (generally called a random positioning machine or RPM), can average gravitational pull over all directions. These machines often consist of two frames, one positioned inside the other, each rotating independently. *An alternative to the clinostat for simulating microgravity is the free fall machine (FFM). Small samples (such as cell suspensions) are allowed to free fall under gravity for about a metre, with the period of free fall lasting just under a second. They are then pushed back to the top of the apparatus by a briefly applied large force (c. 20 g for 20 ms - the \\"bounce\\"), and allowed to fall again, and so on. The principle of the machine is that most of the time is spent in zero g free fall. The periods spent under high g are assumed to be too short to be detected by the physiological mechanism of the biological samples, which consequently only perceive the time spent in free fall. Problems associated with the use of the horizontal clinostat A number of problems have been pointed out in the use of clinostats to simulate microgravity: *gravitational effects still occur, they just have no net direction. Therefore rather than simulating microgravity they are best thought of as inducing omnilateral gravistimulationA. Brown, A.O. Dahl and D.K. Chapman (1976) Limitation on the use of the horizontal clinostat as a gravity compensator, Plant Physiol. 58, pp. 127‚Äì130. *leaves of large plants flop about as they rotate; this may cause an increase in ethylene production, which may in turn cause some of the phenomena otherwise attributed to agravitropism.G R Leather, L E Forrence (1972) Increased Ethylene Production during Clinostat Experiments May Cause Leaf Epinasty. Plant Physiol. 49 (2):183-186 Other researchers have questioned this interpretation,Raymond M Wheeler, Frank B. Salisbury (1981) Interpreting Plant Responses to Clinostating: I. Mechanical Stresses and Ethylene. Plant Physiol. 67 (4):677-685 and it has been suggested that ethylene may have a role in the gravitropic responseRaymond M Wheeler, Frank B Salisbury (1981) Gravitropism in Higher Plant Shoots: I. A Role for Ethylene. Plant Physiol. 67 (4):686-690 *vibration from the motor and other motion effects may lead to artifacts.

However a similar concept had been pioneered as early as 1703 by Denis Dodart. The first electric-powered clinostat (1897) was made by Newcombe.F.C.

N. L. B.) (12 December 1893 - 16 December 1971) was a geographer associated with Jesus College, Oxford for nearly sixty years. Born in Liverpool, Baker studied at Liverpool College from 1911 to 1913 before entering Jesus College as an exhibitioner in 1913, where he read Modern History. His undergraduate career was interrupted by the First World War, during which he was wounded on the Somme. He married Phyllis Hancock in 1917 whilst convalescing. He then spent two years in the Indian Army (1918-19). He returned to Oxford and completed his history degree in 1920 before switching to geography (an interest in which had been prompted by his service in India). He obtained the diploma in geography (with distinction) in 1921 and a B.Litt. in 1922. From 1922 to 1923 he was a lecturer at Bedford College, London before being appointed as a member of staff of the Oxford University School of Geography. He was initially assistant to the Reader and librarian, before becoming a lecturer in 1927 and reader in 1933. He was influential in the arrangements for the creation of the geography undergraduate degree at Oxford, which started in 1932, and was disappointed not to be appointed professor (the post going to Kenneth Mason). Baker's particular interest was the history of geography and exploration; he was appointed Reader in Historical Geography in 1935. His book, A History of Geographical Discovery and Exploration became the standard work in its field. He was a council member of the Royal Geographical Society, winning the society's Victoria Medal in 1964 for his \\"contributions to the history of geography.\\" He was also a founder member (and later president) of the Institute of British Geographers, which broke away from the RGS in 1933. He was also a member of the Hakluyt Society from 1924 onwards, serving as President between 1955 and 1960. He was also involved with Section E (Geography) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and was Section President in 1955. Baker was appointed as a college Lecturer in Geography by Jesus College in 1932 and, in 1939, was appointed Senior Bursar and Fellow. He worked in intelligence matters during the Second World War. Thereafter he increasingly spent time on his college duties, resigning his readership in 1947 (though he continued to lecture). He remained as bursar until 1962, when he retired. He wrote about the history of Jesus College for the Victoria County History volume on the history of the University of Oxford. He also wrote Jesus College 1571-1971 to mark the college's quatercentenary. Baker is commemorated at Jesus College through an annual prize for geography students and in the name of the college geography society. Baker was also an active member in the civic affairs of Oxford, drawing on his abilities as a bursar for matters of city finance and on his geographical knowledge for matters of town planning. He was first elected a university member of the City Council in 1945. He became an alderman in 1963 and, in 1964-65, he was Lord Mayor of Oxford, the first university member to hold this post. His elder daughter Janet Young (later Baroness Young) was a City Councillor alongside Baker. She became Leader of the council in 1967, the year that Baker's time on the council ended.

During the rule of Jungjong (1506‚Äì1544), this contract was enforced by the local level officials; specific details were circulated in text and operated as an informal common law. The hyangyak became the core of Korea's social law and the vehicle of a degree of local autonomy for its villages. This was a stepping stone for the Joseon Dynasty in implementing government at the local level. Local yangban, or Korean scholar- officials were lifted in importance because of the role they played. The implementation of the hyangyak opened the way for schools and shrines and tied the yangban to the community as instrumental in strengthening the government at all levels. References * Key P.

Like many of her class, she was not named and is properly referred to by her hull designation. She was later named after Mahnomen County, Minnesota, and was the only US Navy vessel to bear the name. Construction LST-912 was laid down on 5 February 1944, at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard; launched on 22 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Hazel B. Leppe; and commissioned on 21 May 1944, with Lieutenant Lloyd R. White in command. Service history=World War II Assigned to the 7th Amphibious Fleet, LST-912 sailed in convoy on 25 June, for the Admiralty Islands, via Bora Bora, Societies, and Noum√©a, New Caledonia, arriving Seeadler Harbor, Manus on 23 August, to unload her cargo of one LCT and sections of another. She sailed for New Guinea on 8 September, arriving Humboldt Bay, Hollandia two days later for exercises until 22 September, when she departed for Morotai Island. Following her arrival 27 September, LST-912s guns helped drive off an enemy bomber which raided the harbor area. On 29 September, LST-912 proceeded to Soemoe Island to embark men and equipment of the 113th Naval Construction Battalion for transfer to Hollandia. Despite harassment of her task unit by three enemy aircraft the next day, she reached Hollandia on 5 October. Five days later she moved on to \\"Pie Beach\\" to take on Army troops and equipment for the invasion of the Philippines. The landing ship joined a task group off Hollandia on 16 October, and, entering Leyte Gulf on 22 October, ran through the surf to land her soldiers at \\"White Beach.\\" LST-912 then served as an emergency evacuation hospital, receiving six Army casualties 23 October, before retiring to Hollandia six days later. On 3 November, the tank landing ship sailed to Wakde Airfield on Wakde Island off the coast of New Guinea to embark troops of the 303rd Airdrome Squadron for passage to Leyte. Just as she finished debarking her troops at \\"Yellow Beach,\\" a Japanese A6M Zero roared in and began strafing the shore. Her guns quickly brought the plane down and LST-912 headed for New Guinea, arriving Hollandia six days later. After loading equipment and personnel of the 79th Army Engineer Construction Battalion on 23 December, LST-912 sortied with a task group for Lingayen Gulf 26 December, via Sansapor, New Guinea. On the evening of 7 January 1945, a Japanese destroyer closing the formation in the Surigao Straits was intercepted and sunk. At 02:55 Japanese planes attacked the task group and three hours later a \\"Val\\" careened into the LST killing four men, the vessel's only wartime casualties. Arriving off Lingayen Gulf on 9 January, LST-912 discharged her cargo and men on \\"White Beach\\" the next day. The next two days were spent under constant enemy fire until she steamed back to Leyte Gulf, arriving 17 January, to repeat the cycle. Back in Leyte Gulf on 5 February, LST-912 took on units of the 13th Air Force on 17 February; landed the group at Mindoro Island, Philippines, 22 February; embarked parts of an Army Engineer Battalion of the 30th Quartermaster Company for the invasion of Palawan Island on 28 February; and departed Mindoro 26 February. The ship received four Army casualties at Puerto Princesa, Palawan for passage on 2 March, to Mindoro. She continued transport trips between Mindoro and Palawan until 12 March, when she departed for Manila with the 866th Engineer Aviation Battalion on board, arriving the following day. Her next amphibious operation was Legaspi, Philippines, when she took LCM-468 in tow on 28 March, at Subic Bay, and arrived off Lemery, Luzon 30 March, to embark the 158th Regimental Combat Team for the invasion of Legaspi on 1 April, the last amphibious operation in the Philippines. LST-912 moved troop units in Legaspi through 8 April; then steamed for Mindoro, arriving Marguin Bay on 11 April. After the landing ship debarked equipment at Zamboanga on 19 April, she departed for Pollac Harbor on 21 April, to disembark supply troops seven days later for the continuing effort to liberate the Philippines. On 29 April, LST-912 moved on to the next naval objective, the Borneo landings. Following her arrival at Biak Island on 7 May, units of an RAAF airfield construction squadron came on board for an assault at Brunei Bay, Borneo on 10 June. While remaining off the beaches receiving casualties, she received orders on 18 July, to transport Australian service personnel to the Kuala Belait area. She returned to Leyte Gulf on 26 July, and was there when the Japanese surrender was declared on 15 August. The LST was involved in occupation duties until December, visiting Morotai and Luzon, Philippines; Sendai and Yokosuka, Japan; and Guam before arriving at Iwo Jima on 20 December, to load Army supplies for the United States. Post-war activities LST-912 reached San Diego on 21 January 1946. Reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet, she sailed via the Panama Canal for the Gulf of Mexico on 30 January, arriving New Orleans on 20 February, to continue in commission with the 16th Reserve Fleet. On 30 October 1946, she was returned to active status and departed the Washington Navy Yard for two years of duty with the Amphibious Force at Little Creek, Virginia. Assigned to the 6th Fleet in July 1948, LST-912 departed Morehead City, North Carolina on 5 September for Europe, arriving Tangiers 23 July. She cruised the Mediterranean into 1949, visiting Sicily; Tripoli, Libya; Bizerte, Tunisia; Malta; and Marseille, France, before returning to Morehead City on 6 February 1949. From 8 to 16 March, the landing ship participated in the annual Caribbean amphibious exercises of \\"Operation Springboard.\\" LST-912 continued to conduct amphibious training out of Little Creek with occasional trips to the West Indies until 1955. From 28 July to 13 August 1952, she was anchored off Thule, Greenland resupplying an American airfield as part of \\"Operation Bluejay.\\" LST-912 was placed in reserve in January 1955. On 1 July, she was renamed Mahnomen County. On 25 August, she decommissioned and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida. Vietnam War Mahnomen County recommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 27 March 1963, with Lieutenant (j.g.) John H. Withers in command. Assigned to Reserve LST Squadron 2, she served for the next three years in the 5th Naval District, operating along the Atlantic coast from New York to the Bahamas. On 21 December 1965, Mahnomen County was again placed in the active fleet; and on 27 January 1966, departed Little Creek for Charleston, South Carolina, arriving 29 December, to embark Army supplies. The next day she sailed for Southeast Asia with the and , stopping at Pearl Harbor from 4 March to 21 April, before continuing on to Vietnam via Okinawa, arriving Vung Tau on 27 May. She operated as a military transport and supply ship between Sasebo, Japan; Subic Bay, Philippine Islands; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Phan Rang, Vietnam through the next seven months, supporting the effort to curb Communist aggression in South Vietnam. On 3 December Mahnomen County departed Kaohsiung for Vietnam, docking at Chu Lai on the 18th. On 30 December she was driven ashore by the 18-foot surf and high wind of a typhoon. Attempts to refloat the wrecked LST during January 1967 were unsuccessful. Mahnomen County was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1967, and, stripped of any salvageable materials, her hull was demolished by the Navy Support Detachment at Chu Lai. Awards Mahnomen County earned four battle stars for World War II service and two campaign stars for Vietnam War service.

Reports=Flagship ReportsTowards our Common Digital Future (2019)Flagship report 2019, ‚ÄûTowards our Common Digital Future‚Äú= Without creative political action, digital change will further accelerate resource and energy consumption, and exacerbate damage to the environment and the climate. It is therefore an urgent political task to create the conditions needed to place digitalization at the service of sustainable development; this is one of the key messages of the report \\"Towards our Common Digital Future\\" [LINK]. In the short term, the aim is to harmonize digitalization with the global sustainability goals agreed in 2015 (SDGs, Agenda 2030) and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. New technologies should be used specifically and comprehensively to give people access to basic services such as healthcare, education, energy and (environmental) information and to prevent environmental degradation. Examples include promoting the energy-system transformation using intelligent energy networks, reducing vehicular traffic in cities by means of shared mobility (which makes owning a car superfluous), and using digital technologies to promote a circular economy. In addition, precautions must already be taken today to deal with the profound societal upheavals that will accompany digitalization in the medium term. Examples include the foreseeable radical structural change on the labour markets, the replacement of real-world experiences in virtual spaces, the manifold impacts of artificial intelligence on education, science and democracy, and the challenge of democratically restricting the surveillance potential of new technologies. According to the WBGU's new report, all digital changes should be geared towards the common good and improving people's quality of life. Finally, another issue is preparing for possible long-term upheavals. For example, in human-machine interaction, risks to human integrity are already recognizable today. This concerns, for example, sensitive neuro-data or neuro-prostheses, whose ethical aspects have been insufficiently taken into account up to now. In the age of digitalization, it is necessary to redefine our understanding of 'human development‚Äò. =Humanity on the move: The transformative power of cities (2016)Flagship report 2016, ‚ÄûHumanity on the move: The transformative power of cities‚Äú= The momentum of urbanization and its impacts are so massive that we must face up to this trend. In view of the existing cognitive, technical, economic and institutional path dependencies, a policy of business as usual ‚Äì i.e. an unstructured, quasi-automatic urbanization ‚Äì would lead to a non- sustainable ‚Äòworld cities society‚Äô. Only if cities and urban societies are sufficiently empowered can they make use of the opportunities for sustainability and successfully follow the urban transformation pathways. The success or failure of the Great Transformation will be decided in the cities. The WBGU discusses the relevant conditions for the success of this transformation in this report. =World in Transition ‚Äì Governing the Marine Heritage (2013)Flagship report 2013, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Governing the Marine Heritage.‚Äú= Despite numerous international treaties and voluntary commitments, the seas are still being massively overfished, polluted and increasingly exploited as the Earth's last resort. In view of the oceans‚Äô poor condition, the WBGU developed a long-term vision of the conservation and sustainable use of the blue continent: All marine zones with the exception of territorial waters should be declared as common heritage of mankind. In order to move closer to this ultimate goal for ocean governance, the WBGU also gives recommendations for action that link up with ongoing political processes, especially for two focal themes: food (sustainable fisheries and aquaculture) and energy from the sea. The report shows that sustainable stewardship of the oceans is urgently necessary, that the seas can be incorporated into a transformation towards a low-carbon, sustainable society, and that such a transformation can achieve substantial benefits worldwide both for a sustainable energy supply and for food security. =World in Transition ‚Äì A Social Contract for Sustainability (2011)Flagship report 2011, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability.‚Äú= In this report, the WBGU explains the reasons for the desperate need for a post-fossil economic strategy, yet it also concludes that the transition to sustainability is achievable, and presents ten concrete packages of measures to accelerate the imperative restructuring. If the transformation really is to succeed, we have to enter into a social contract for innovation, in the form of a new kind of discourse between governments and citizens, both within and beyond the boundaries of the nation state. =World in Transition ‚Äì Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use (2008)Flagship report 2008, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use.‚Äú= In view of the major opportunities and risks associated with it, and the complexity of the subject, bioenergy policy has in a short time become a challenging political task for regulators and planners ‚Äì a task which can only be accomplished through worldwide cooperation and the creation of an international framework. WBGU's central message is that use should be made of the sustainable potential of bioenergy which can be tapped all over the world, provided that risks to sustainability are excluded. In particular, the use of bioenergy must not endanger food security or the goals of nature conservation and climate change mitigation. =World in Transition ‚Äì Climate Change as a Security Risk (2007)Flagship report 2007 , ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Climate Change as a Security Risk.‚Äú= Without resolute counteraction, climate change will overstretch many societies‚Äô adaptive capacities within the coming decades. This could result in destabilization and violence, jeopardizing national and international security to a new degree. However, climate change could also unite the international community, provided that it recognizes climate change as a threat to humankind and soon sets the course for the avoidance of dangerous anthropogenic climate change by adopting a dynamic and globally coordinated climate policy. If it fails to do so, climate change will draw ever-deeper lines of division and conflict in international relations, triggering numerous conflicts between and within countries over the distribution of resources, especially water and land, over the management of migration, or over compensation payments between the countries mainly responsible for climate change and those countries most affected by its destructive effects. That is the backdrop against which WBGU, in this flagship report, summarizes the state-of-the-art of science on the subject of ‚ÄúClimate Change as a Security Risk‚Äù. It is based on the findings of research into environmental conflicts, the causes of war, and of climate impact research. It appraises past experience but also ventures to cast a glance far into the future in order to assess the likely impacts of climate change on societies, nation-states, regions and the international system. =World in Transition ‚Äì Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy (2004)Flagship report 2004, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy.‚Äú= At the start of the 21st century, fighting poverty and protecting the environment are two of the most urgent challenges facing the international community. Narrowing the massive disparities in the satisfaction of basic needs and distribution of prosperity must be a primary objective. Extreme poverty, such as that prevailing above all in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, is the most obvious manifestation of the untenable imbalance in the world's social system. The recommendations for action set out in this report are based on an analysis of the systemic links between poverty (income poverty, disease, malnutrition, and lack of education, social stability and social capital) and environmental changes (climate change, lack of water resources, water pollution, soil degradation, loss of biological diversity and resources, and air pollution). The manifestations of and interactions between poverty and environmental problems are investigated in their various forms. This type of integrated analysis is nothing new; what is new, however, is the consistent linking of a holistic approach with the following key questions: which institutional arrangements offer ways of coping with these problems, and where must gaps be closed? To this end, WBGU has evaluated major international political processes and developed recommendations on policy coherence. It also presents various recommendations on further research to identify the strategic gaps in theoretical and practical knowledge. =World in Transition ‚Äì Towards Sustainable Energy Systems (2003)Flagship report 2003, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems.‚Äú= The report underscores the urgent need to transform global energy systems so that the world's population has access to energy based on renewable sources. This is necessary in order to protect the global climate and to liberate 2.4 billion people in developing countries from energy poverty. Such an approach would also yield a peace dividend by reducing dependence upon regionally concentrated oil reserves. The scientists stress that such a reconfiguration of energy systems is feasible and fundable if rapid and resolute action is taken in the coming two decades. To this end, they propose a roadmap with specific milestones. =World in Transition ‚Äì New Structures for Global Environmental Policy (2000)Flagship report 2000, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: New Structures for Global Environmental Policy.‚Äú= Today, more than 900 bi- and multilateral environmental treaties are in force. Nonetheless, the most pressing problems of global change remain unresolved, some are even intensifying. The international institutional and organisational architecture has proven too weak to provide effective and efficient responses to these challenges. In this situation, the WBGU has developed a vision for reforming the United Nations in the environmental arena. It terms this the ‚ÄòEarth Alliance‚Äô, comprising three interlocking realms. First, to provide authority in the assessment of environmental problems, the WBGU proposes establishing an independent body whose task is to provide timely warning of particularly risk-laden developments in the sphere of global change ‚Äì Earth Assessment. Second, the report gives recommendations for redesigning the organisational core of global environmental policy ‚Äì Earth Organisation. This revolves around the step-wise establishment of an International Environmental Organisation, building on the existing United Nations Environment Programme as its initial nucleus. Third, the WBGU highlights new avenues for financing global environmental policy ‚Äì Earth Funding. =World in Transition ‚Äì Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere (1999)Flagship report 1999, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere.‚Äú= Biodiversity - the planet's natural capital - is undergoing a dramatic collapse: its 'Sixth Extinction'. The losses, which are due to human activities and overexploitation of the biosphere, are irreversible. They are undermining the basis of future wellbeing and prosperity - including genetic resources and food production, climate stability, and coastal and soil protection. This volume presents an authoritative and alarming analysis of the state of the biosphere. The WBGU shows that the time remaining for remedial action is disappearing fast and sets out a range of initiatives to be undertaken at different levels. The main recommendations are: \\\\- protecting 10-20 per cent of the global land area \\\\- an 'Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity' to provide scientific advice \\\\- conservation of the diversity of cultivated as well as wild plant species \\\\- extending bioregional management and nature sponsorship \\\\- greater multilateral co-operation and implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity. =World in Transition ‚Äì Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks (1998)Flagship report 1998, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks.‚Äú= Global risk potentials and their interplay with economic, social and ecological processes of change have emerged as a challenge to the international community. Never before has human intervention in nature assumed global dimensions. This has been driven on the one hand by a growing global population, particularly in developing countries, and on the other hand by rising human demands in conjunction with specific patterns of production and consumption, above all in industrialised countries. By presenting this report, the WBGU hopes to contribute constructively to an effective, efficient and objective management of the risks of global change. The approach taken by the WBGU is first to classify globally relevant risks and then to assign to these classes of risk both established and innovative risk assessment strategies and risk management tools. On this basis, management priorities can be set. However, the WBGU notes that it is impossible to safeguard against all global risks, particularly as exploiting opportunities will always entail taking risks. =World in Transition ‚Äì Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources (1997)Flagship report 1997, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources.‚Äú= The global water crisis is expected to become more severe in the near future. The WBGU presents an analysis of specific regions that are presently most affected by water shortages, and regions that will be particularly threatened by future water crises. In line with its past reports on global change, the WBGU examines three major \\"syndromes of global change\\" that are strongly linked to the worldwide water crisis. Based on this analysis, explicit recommendations for future research and for political action are presented. =World in Transition ‚Äì The Research Challenge (1996)Flagship report 1996, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: The Research Challenge.‚Äú= Development and environment problems have reached such alarming dimensions that the very survival of humanity is now subject to critical and unprecedented threats. So far, the scientific community has failed to deliver strategic responses adequate to this situation. Analyses produced by the separate disciplines are similarly inadequate due to the complexity of the problems involved and the intricate interlinkages between them. In this report, the WBGU criticizes Germany's global change research community for its lack of international orientation, its bias towards individual disciplines and for its weaknesses in translating scientific results into a form readily accessible to policymakers. The WBGU identifies alternatives for restructuring the research landscape, focusing primarily on a new \\"Syndrome Approach\\" for global change research. By applying this tool, scientists can systematically describe and analyze the \\"diseases\\" afflicting the Earth System, and thus elaborate response options. The 16 most important syndromes, or \\"clinical profiles\\" of Planet Earth were identified. =World in Transition ‚Äì Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions (1995)Flagship report 1995, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions.‚Äú= In many areas of global change solutions are not at sight. However, dedicated and immediate action could, in principle, avert irreversible or disastrous damage to the global environment. Whether these steps will actually be taken will have to be seen, since substantial efforts and significant reorientations at the local, national and global level are necessary. Two aspects have to be considered: on the one hand, at the societal level, the prerequisites for solving global environmental problems have to be improved. These measures present a challenge to nations and societies as a whole, where nongovernmental organisations could also play an important role. On the other hand, at the governmental level, international agreements must be formulated or intensified and enforced by suitable measures. =World in Transition ‚Äì The Threat to Soils (1994)Flagship report 1994, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: The Threat to Soils.‚Äú= Soils form an essential basis for humanity, but have received too little attention to date. In differing respects, human activities in many parts of the world lead to various levels of soil degradation, from declining fertility to irreversible destruction. Many local processes culminate to form a global environmental trend that must be counteracted by political action as a matter of urgency. The fact that the slow destruction of soils is a process barely perceptible to human senses has meant in turn that this topic is dealt with in the environmental debate as a somewhat marginal issue. Therefore, the threat to soils must be accorded much greater significance on the environmental agenda - improved legal frameworks must be created, both nationally and internationally, for soils as an environmental asset. The report is divided into two sections. The first section (standard section) presents and comments on new developments in various fields of Global Change. The second section of the report (focus section) deals with the global threat to soils. The WBGU emphasises that, in view of the seriousness of the soil problems outlined in this report, a new efficient institutional framework should now be established. For this reason the German Federal Government should decide in principle whether a differentiated \\"Soil Declaration\\" suffices or whether a global \\"Soil Convention\\" has to be striven for. This report provides the relevant arguments for both instruments. Global soil protection must obtain a similar attention on the international agenda as has been achieved for climate policy. =World in Transition ‚Äì Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions (1993)Flagship report 1993, ‚ÄûWorld in Transition: Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions.‚Äú= In this report, the WBGU endeavours to provide a holistic analysis of the Earth System, whereby the central focus is directed at the principal interactions between nature and society. The aim here is to demonstrate the complexity of environmental problems, on the one hand, and to create, on the other, the analytical basis for assessing the impact of current trends on the system as a whole. The most serious global problems and major global trends in the estimation of the WBGU are: * Growth of the world's population * Long-term changes in the composition of the atmosphere * Loss of biodiversity * Degradation and loss of soils Concluding its report, the WBGU lays particular emphasis on three general recommendations: \\\\- German development aid should be increased to 1% of the GNP, whereby the term 'developing countries' should be redefined to include the states of Eastern Europe. \\\\- With respect to the instruments discussed in Rio de Janeiro, the WBGU recommends that negotiations concerning a certificate scheme for reducing CO2 emissions should be started, with the aim of achieving its international implementation. Parallel to the reduction of CO2 emissions that would then occur, efforts should be made to increase the financial transfers for the protection of the tropical forests. \\\\- Programmes should be developed aiming at sensitising citizens to global environmental problems and promoting environmentally friendly behaviour. Special ReportsDevelopment and justice through transformation: The Four Big ‚ÄòI‚Äôs (2016)Special report 2016, ‚ÄûDevelopment and justice through transformation: The Four Big ‚ÄòI‚Äôs ‚Äú= 2015 saw a historic double success for sustainability and climate policy. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement on climate protection establish a system of ambitious policy goals for the world. The group of twenty major industrialized and emerging economies (G20) now needs to resolutely advance implementation of both agreements, seizing the opportunity of this ‚ÄòGreat Transformation‚Äô to sustainability as a unique modernization project that could offer substantial economic development opportunities. Complete decarbonization of the world economy, which is necessary to avoid the gravest climate risks, can only be achieved by profoundly transforming energy systems and other high-emissions infrastructures. This transformation could inspire Innovation and channel Investment into sustainability and climate protection, and into the kinds of sustainable Infrastructures that need to be established and expanded. At the same time, the transformation could combat inequality and promote Inclusion within societies and globally, thus becoming an equity project. =Climate Protection as a World Citizen Movement (2014)Special report 2014, ‚ÄûClimate Protection as a World Citizen Movement‚Äú= The 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it unmistakably clear: unacceptable climatic consequences, which are likely to escalate beyond the 2 ¬∞C guard rail, can only be avoided if further increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations are halted as soon as possible. The WBGU therefore recommends reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to zero by 2070 at the latest. This policy goal is both ambitious and incisive, because 'the zero target must be reached' by every country, every municipality, every company and every citizen if the world as a whole is to become climate-neutral. However, the 2 ¬∞C line can only be held if a large proportion of stakeholders ‚Äì especially the OECD countries ‚Äì start reducing their emissions much earlier. Global society as a whole has only a very limited carbon budget at its disposal; emissions should therefore peak by 2020 if possible, or in the third decade at the latest. In this report the WBGU outlines a two-pronged strategy for global climate protection based on interaction between multilateralism and civil society. To achieve this, on the one hand the Paris Climate Agreement targeted for late 2015 should exhibit certain characteristics set out by the WBGU. In particular, a process should be agreed to ensure compliance with the 2 ¬∞C guard rail. On the other hand, all social actors should make their specific contributions towards decarbonization. In this way, an intricate responsibility architecture for the future of our planet can emerge in which vertical delegating and horizontal engagement are not contradictions, but complementary factors that reinforce each other. =Solving the climate dilemma: The budget approach (2009)Special report 2009, ‚ÄûSolving the climate dilemma: The budget approach.‚Äú= At their meeting in the Italian city of L‚ÄôAquila in July 2009, the heads of state and governments of the G8 countries and the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), whose members include India, Brazil and China, acknowledged the importance that global warming must not exceed the 2 ¬∞C guard rail if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. WBGU views this as an extremely important step towards the adoption of a binding international agreement which establishes a well-founded target for global climate protection. The task now is to build on this consensus and reach agreement, at Copenhagen, on a follow- up treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, which is due to expire in 2012. This new international agreement should translate the relevant scientific knowledge into a fair and practicable global strategy to combat global warming. So far, however, the lack of unanimity between the countries involved in the negotiating process has meant that there is no clear leitmotif pointing the way towards such an agreement. =The Future Oceans: Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour (2006)Special report 2006, ‚ÄûThe Future Oceans ‚Äì Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour.‚Äú= Latest research findings show that failure to check mankind's emissions of carbon dioxide will have severe consequences for the world's oceans. The marine environment is doubly affected: continuing warming and ongoing acidification both pose threats. In combination with over- fishing, these two threats are further jeopardizing already weakened fish stocks. Sea-level rise is exposing coastal regions to mounting flood and hurricane risks. To keep the adverse effects on human society and ecosystems within manageable limits, it will be essential to adopt new coastal protection approaches, designate marine protected areas and agree on ways to deal with refugees from endangered coastal areas. All such measures, however, can only succeed if global warming and ocean acidification are combated vigorously. Ambitious climate protection is therefore a key precondition to successful marine conservation and coastal protection. =Climate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond (2003)Special report 2003, ‚ÄûClimate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond.‚Äú= With this special report, the WBGU provides recommendations for future negotiations within the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), particularly relating to the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention. The report centres on three questions: *What is ‚Äòdangerous climate change‚Äô within the meaning of Article 2 of the UNFCCC? *Which socio- economically and technologically viable pathways are available to prevent such dangerous climate change? *How can all countries be integrated equitably within a system of emissions reduction commitments? The report concentrates on the potentials to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, this being the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The analysis focuses, on the one hand, on the economic and technological potentials to reduce energy and industry related emissions and, on the other hand, on the relevance of biological sinks of carbon dioxide and the options to preserve them. Finally, based on this analysis, the report contains specific recommendations on ways to shape political and economic instruments in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. =Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)Special report 2002, ‚ÄûCharging the Use of Global Commons.‚Äú= Global common resources like international airspace and the high seas are in danger of overexploitation because the users need not bear the full social costs of their actions. The CO2-emissions of international aviation and of shipping are not subject to the quantitative reduction obligations of the Kyoto Protocol. Imposing user charges can close this regulatory gap and induce environment-related incentive effects to reduce environmental damage. Moreover, additional financial resources are generated, which should be earmarked for the protection and conservation of global common goods. In this special report, the WBGU makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application: * Charges on the use of airspace by aviation, * Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping, * Payments for non utilisation obligations. =Environment and Ethics (1999)Special report 1999, ‚ÄûEnvironment and Ethics.‚Äú= Should people be allowed to do everything they want? Should humankind be allowed to use nature and the environment completely for its own ends? More and more people are questioning the limits of human intervention in nature. What is ethically allowed and what should be prohibited? The WBGU offers some answers to these difficult questions. At the same time it has drawn up a number of principles, which should not be violated, even where there are big economical gains. In addition, in a democratic and culturally diverse society it is the task of ethics to lay down generally binding criteria for balancing between nature- related and, for example, economic matters. With these tools of ethical and economic criteria the Federal Government of Germany could support the interests of environmental protection at the international level. =The Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection? (1998)Special report 1998, ‚ÄûThe Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection?.‚Äú= The WBGU assesses the Kyoto Protocol with respect to the accounting of biological sources and sinks. In principle, the WBGU supports the idea of linking climate protection and the conservation of sinks. However, the WBGU considers the form in which biological sources and sinks are accounted in the Kyoto Protocol to be inadequate and in need of improvement if the objectives of climate protection and biodiversity conservation are both to be served. The present accounting approach can lead to incentives with negative impacts upon climate protection, biodiversity conservation and soil protection. In addition, many uncertainties and imponderables attach to the reduction in net emissions that is achievable by means of terrestrial sinks. Even slight climate changes can lead to sinks becoming sources. Over the long run, fossil fuel emissions can not be compensated for by the terrestrial biosphere. The WBGU analyses the provisions of the Kyoto-Protocol and presents the state of knowledge on the source and sink potentials of terrestrial ecosystems and on the existing uncertainties and unresolved issues. This forms the basis for an assessment of the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol as well as for recommendations for the interpretation and concrete application of these provisions. =Targets for Climate Protection 1997Special report 1997, ‚ÄûTargets for Climate Protection.‚Äú= This statement was issued on the occasion of the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Climate Convention, FCCC), and contains recommendations on the commitments to be agreed upon in a protocol to the Convention. According to the \\"Berlin Mandate\\" adopted at the first Conference of the Parties, the commitments of the industrialized countries listed in Annex I of the Climate Convention are to be strengthened by setting quantified limitation and reduction objectives within specified time frames for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These measures are aimed at achieving the ultimate objective of the FCCC, namely a \\"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\\". =Scenario for the derivation of global CO2-reduction targets and implementation strategies (1995)Special report 1995, ‚ÄûScenario for the derivation of global CO2-reduction targets and implementation strategies.‚Äú= The WBGU derives a global CO2 reduction target by using an \\"inverse scenario\\" based on simplified models for climate dynamics and the carbon cycle. By first analysing the maximum stress levels caused by climate change that one can assume to be ecologically and economically bearable, a \\"tolerance window\\" for the future climatic development is deduced. In a further step, the set of admissible emission profiles is determined, i.e., those global CO2 emission functions which keep the climate system within the demarcated window. Among the so- defined family of emission options a specific strategy is finally singled out by feasibility criteria. The WBGU believes that such an integrated assessment of the climate change problem in the \\"backwards mode\\" has several advantages in comparison with the straightforward approach. It has to be emphasised, however, that the analysis employs a number of assumptions and approximations and therefore has the character of a \\"Gedankenexperiment\\". Policy PapersA European Way to our Common Digital FuturePolicy Paper 11, 2019, ‚ÄûA European Way to our Common Digital Future‚Äú= Particularly during its presidency of the Council of the EU in 2020, Germany should build upon the Green Deal announced by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and work towards a close integration of digital change and sustainability. The new EU Parliament and the new European Commission should also pursue this goal. To this end the WBGU presents 7 cornerstones of a European way to a common digital future: # Integrate the opportunities and risks of digitalization into EU sustainability policy: The EU needs an implementation strategy for the SDGs that also places digital technologies at the service of sustainability and addresses its risks. In the same way, digitalization should be embedded in the 8th Environmental Action Programme from 2021 onwards. # Actively shape digital policy in line with sustainability goals: Ecological and social aimsthat can be reached through digitalization shouldbe pursued with equal emphasis, e.g. via the European Digital Agenda, the European Commission‚Äôs Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), or measures within the framework of the Digital Europe programme. Negative (side) effects should be identified and minimized at an early stage. # Involve the private sector more in the provision of data: Up to now, EU data policy has concentrated on the protection of personal data and the use of data from public authorities. This does not go far enough: accessibility to, and the re-use of (non-personal) private-sector data should also be improved in order to create data that can be used for the common good and digitalized (knowledge) assets. # Develop and apply artificial intelligence in a sustainable way: The EU should be consistent in following its value-based approach in the application and development of AI systems: fundamental rights, human dignity, environmental and sustainability principles are the normative foundation of the EU and non-negotiable. There is an urgent need for (framework) legislation on the development and handling of AI, since ethical guidelines and debates alone are not enough to ensure a corresponding development and application. In addition, research on explainable and secure, i.e. reliably verified and validated, AI should be promoted and used to ensure trustworthy, fair and accountable procedures. # Ensure access to digital commons and basic services through public-service information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures: Individual inclusion, personal development, environmental protection, fair competition and a functioning digital public sphere require access to data and services such as cloud services, mobility platforms or a search index. Their almost exclusively private-sector provision is not always in the interests of the common good. The EU‚Äôs task should be to create or ensure public-service digital and digitalized infrastructures to make data and information accessible for the common good and to offer alternative (basic) services under public law. # Gear EU research policy and promotion of innovations consistently towards sustainability goals: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) should be applied as an overarching concept of European research and innovation policy in order to explicitly embed the orientation towards sustainability goals and to avoid unintended impacts. The high levels of protection of the environment, consumers and occupational health and safety in the EU must not be weakened by the innovation principle currently under discussion. Horizon Europe‚Äôs missions should aim to integrate digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability and strengthen transformative and transformation research. # European digitalization model as a priority in foreign policy: The EU should also promote the integration of sustainability and digitalization internationally. It should initiate a summit on ‚ÄòSustainability in the Digital Age‚Äô, e.g. for 2022, symbolically 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio, to set the course for the necessary continuation of the sustainability agenda until 2030 and beyond. =Digital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st CenturyPolicy Paper 2019, ‚ÄûDigital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century‚Äú= Global digital change should be designed to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Up to now, hopes that digitalization would make a contribution to achieving these goals has not materialized. Only if digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability are constructively interlinked can we make progress with environmental protection, climate-change mitigation and human development. The WBGU would like to introduce into the discussion four ideas directly related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First: promote a global (environmental) awareness among people worldwide by providing a stronger future-proof education. The focus should be on enabling people to actively shape digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability. Open data relating to sustainability and virtual learning environments are important elements for experiencing ecosystems. In concrete terms, an integrated programme for future-proof education should be developed, UN processes should be opened up to citizen-science projects, and an International Information Union should be founded to collect, process and publish sustainability-related data. Second, establish a digitally enhanced circular economy. The transition from linear and resource-intensive value chains to a near-complete circular economy is a key component of the Transformation towards Sustainability. Digital data acquisition and processing offer great potential for this. Environmentally harmful emissions and resource depletion should be recorded across all sectors of the economy and value chains, and greater efforts should be made to implement the 3Rs strategy (reduce, reuse, recycle) at the international level. Third, modernize sustainability policy itself by using digital solutions. Digitally enhanced governance can help improve the transparency of political actions, as well as the participation and worldwide networking of political actors. Coordination within the UN system should be intensified by establishing a 'UN Digitalization Initiative'; a 'UN Framework Convention on Digital Sustainability and Sustainable Digitalization' should be negotiated; and a globally uniform set of indicators for the SDGs should be developed to facilitate the comparability and verifiability of national reports. Fourth, further develop the global sustainability agenda beyond 2030 against the background of the opportunities and risks of the Digital Age. The UN should prepare for these future challenges in good time. The WBGU recommends convening a UN summit on 'Sustainability in the Digital Age' in 2022 ‚Äì 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro ‚Äì to set the course for continuing the sustainability agenda beyond 2030. A key outcome could be the adoption of a charter entitled 'Towards Our Common Digital Future'. =Just & In‚ÄìTime Climate Policy: Four Initiatives for Fairness (2018) Translation from German. = Limiting global warming to well below 2 ¬∞C requires the rapid decarbonization of the global economy. If this enterprise fails, we will jeopardize the life-support systems of future generations. The longer the transformation towards climate compatibility is delayed, the more severe the risks and damage will be for a growing number of people. The transformation requirements and the damage caused by climate change have an unequal temporal, geographical and social distribution ‚Äì as do the respective possibilities for dealing with them. The WBGU therefore proposes a just & in-time transformation that takes into account all people affected, empowers them, holds those responsible for climate change accountable, and creates both global and national prospects for the future. The WBGU proposes that the German Federal Government should promote four exemplary initiatives of a just & in-time climate policy targeting (1) the people affected by the structural change towards climate compatibility (e.g. in coal-mining regions), (2) the legal rights of people harmed by climate change, (3) the dignified migration of people who lose their native countries due to climate change, and (4) the creation of financing instruments for just & in-time transformation processes. =Human progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate (2014)Policy Paper 2014, ‚ÄûHuman progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate‚Äú= The year 2015 has special importance for the transformation towards sustainable development. New Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are then supposed to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The aim is to offer a new orientation for political action in the coming decades. The WBGU recommends orienting the new catalogue of goals towards the key message of the 1992 Earth Summit: that development and environmental protection must be considered together and do not contradict each other. The SDGs should not be reduced to poverty eradication, but must address all dimensions of sustainable development. In particular, global environmental change must be incorporated, otherwise even poverty eradication will become impossible. Up to now, too little attention has been paid to this link in the ongoing discourse on SDGs. Although many reports mention the concept of planetary guard rails or planetary boundaries, they do not back this up with specific targets. The WBGU presents recommendations on how guard rails for global environmental problems should be incorporated in the SDG catalogue and operationalized by means of corresponding targets. =Financing the Global Energy-System Transformation (2012)Policy Paper 2012, ‚ÄûFinancing the Global Energy System Transformation‚Äú= The world faces the challenge of a global transformation to sustainable energy systems. Substantial up-front investments are needed to improve energy efficiency and switch to renewable energies. At the same time, these investments offer great opportunities, because strategic innovations can be triggered and new markets can develop in the course of the transformation process. Savings on the cost of fossil fuels in conventional technologies could completely offset the investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency by as early as 2040. The private capital needed for the transformation is available and can be mobilised if a suitable political framework is put into place. A corresponding regulatory policy should be introduced to make such investment more attractive for the private sector. The WBGU advocates a proactive state that integrates energy, environmental and climate policy; this could reduce existing investment risks by developing a stable, long-term transformative regulatory framework. At the same time, policy makers should expand the opportunities for participation. Germany is currently leading this transformation, both in terms of technological innovations and in the creation of a suitable policy framework. Our country is able to give the world an example of how the Energiewende (energy-system transformation) can generate more, not less prosperity. =Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success (2010)Policy Paper 2010, ‚ÄûClimate policy post-Copenhagen: Action at three levels offers prospect of success.‚Äú= International climate policy post-Copenhagen is in crisis. There is currently no prospect of the comprehensive and binding UN climate treaty ‚Äì the outcome hoped for at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference ‚Äì being achieved within the foreseeable future. However, in order to keep the global mean temperature rise below 2 ¬∞C by the end of the century, a resolute course must be set in the international climate process within the next few years. The WBGU recommends that in order to revitalise the multilateral climate process, policy-makers and civil society in Europe take on a self-confident leading role in global alliances with selected ‚Äòclimate pioneer‚Äô countries and that more intensive support be provided for civil society initiatives. The aim of establishing a binding international regime to limit CO2 emissions ‚Äì based, for example, on the WBGU's own budget approach and similar approaches now also being discussed in China and India ‚Äì must remain in place. The following recommendations are directed primarily towards the German Government in light of its role in the international arena, particularly within the European Union (EU), at intergovernmental level via its bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and in the United Nations context. =New impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency (2007)Policy Paper 2007, ‚ÄûNew impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency.‚Äú= If dangerous climate change is still to be avoided, a reversal of current trends must be achieved within the next ten years, and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide must be halved by 2050 compared with a 1990 baseline. However, there is a widening gap between the action that is urgently needed and current climate policy. The WBGU is therefore convinced that a new climate policy dynamic is required worldwide and that Germany's double presidency of the European Union and P of G8 offers a dual opportunity to drive climate protection forward. The WBGU's core messages are: *Climate protection is both worthwhile and feasible: Investing in climate protection is economically efficient, as the costs of effective climate protection are far lower than the costs of inaction. *Further development of the UN climate convention: A consensus on the mitigation target must be forged and enshrined in the convention. To this end, the WBGU recommends the adoption of a global temperature guard rail limiting the rise in near-surface air temperature to a maximum of 2 ¬∞C relative to the pre-industrial value ‚Äì equivalent to stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases below 450 ppm CO2eq. *Making the most of the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm: Fresh initiatives from the heads of state and government are required to inject new life into the faltering climate process. *Reaffirming the European Union's leading role: The European Union should expand its leading role in international climate protection. =Development needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit (2005)Policy Paper 2005, ‚ÄûDevelopment needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit.‚Äú= The Millennium + 5 Summit will review progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and take stock of the United Nations' capacity to act. The Summit offers the opportunity to set a new course in international poverty reduction and initiate a reform of the UN. If the MDGs fail, international cooperation will be plunged into crisis. Yet the current poverty debate tends to overlook the environmental problems which exacerbate poverty in many developing countries. The international community should therefore remind itself of the message sent out by the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992: environmental and development policies are inextricably linked. WBGU's core recommendations are: *Linking poverty reduction with environmental policy: The MDGs cannot be achieved without environmental protection measures. Environmental policy is therefore a prerequisite for development and must be a key element in any long-term poverty reduction strategy. Conversely, the global environment cannot be protected without development policy. *Forging strategic partnerships with anchor countries: Due to their size and dynamic economies, developing countries such as China, Brazil and India play a key role both in global environmental changes and in poverty reduction. The strategic foci of development cooperation with these countries must be placed accordingly. *Reforming the development and environment policy architecture: The division of labour in international development policy should be improved and the fragmentation of the multilateral development and environment institutions overcome. In the medium term, a new Council on Global Development and Environment should replace the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). *Increasing the funding commitments: The international community should invest more intensively in poverty reduction and environmental protection: the costs of inaction would be significantly higher. As well as increasing funds committed to development cooperation, new financing instruments, such as charges for the use of global common goods, should be introduced. =Renewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables 2004Policy Paper 2004, ‚ÄûRenewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables.‚Äú= Energy is a key theme for future world development. Worldwide energy demand is mounting rapidly, particularly in the developing and newly industrialising countries, which seek to catch up with the level of economic development attained by industrialised countries. The great challenge now is to meet this energy demand in a sustainable manner. However, sustainable development will be inconceivable without a deep-seated reconfiguration of worldwide energy systems. One goal in this context must be to protect natural life-support systems and, in particular, to prevent dangerous anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system. If the present path continues and rising energy demand is met mainly from fossil sources, this would trigger intolerable global climate change with high consequential costs, and would thus also jeopardize economic development. A second necessary goal is to eradicate energy poverty in developing countries in order that these countries can make use of development opportunities. It is essential that 2.4 billion people gain access to modern forms of energy so that they can shake off the yoke of energy poverty. To attain these two goals, energy systems need to be turned towards sustainability. To that end, efficiency must be improved at all levels of the energy system, and fossil energy sources must be substituted by renewable ones. The potential of renewable energies, above all solar energy, is almost unlimited and can be harnessed sustainably. Energy system transformation towards sustainability is thus the first step into the solar age. However, without rapid and resolute international policy support, the expansion of renewable energy sources will not be able to develop the necessary dynamics in time. The International Conference for Renewable Energies (renewables 2004) held in Bonn 2004 is a milestone for this process. =Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)Policy Paper 2002, ‚ÄûCharging the Use of Global Commons.‚Äú= In this policy paper, the WBGU summarizes the key findings of its special report on user charges within the framework of global sustainability policy, and makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application: * Charges on the use of airspace by aviation, * Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping, * Payments for non utilization obligations. =The Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy (2001)Policy Paper 2001, ‚ÄûThe Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy.‚Äú= Johannesburg in South Africa is a symbolically important venue for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). No other continent has been affected worse by the impacts of global change and exhibits in such representative form the critical environmental and socioeconomic situation facing many developing countries. At the same time, the host nation epitomizes new hopes and beginnings following the radical changes it has undergone in recent years. A new beginning is necessary at the international level, too, given the further deterioration in the state of the global environment since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. New problems have arisen and the most critical remain unsolved. The WSSD to be held in September 2002 in Johannesburg provides the international community with yet another opportunity to set the future direction of international environment and development policy. In the run-up to this event, the WBGU would like to focus the attention of the Federal Government of Germany on some crucial issues where decisions in Johannesburg could help to eliminate critical shortcomings in current environment and development policy. A great deal has been achieved in the field of global environmental policymaking since 1992, in particular the international conventions and treaties dealing with a range of global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, desertification, or the impacts of persistent organic pollutants. In the view of the WBGU, the Johannesburg summit should therefore refrain from detailed negotiations on these topics. However, it must be possible to provide new ideas and inspiration, to close gaps and loopholes, and to take the various conventions a stage further  Quotes about WBGU reports  \\"The reports of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) are an indispensable reference and resource on global environmental change policies. Every scientist, decision-maker and institution concerned with the pressing issue of environment and development should have them.\\" Prof. Dr. Klaus T√∂pfer, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 1998-2006 \\"Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities, is a notable breath of fresh air at a time when shallow platitudes seem the order of the day. It is bold, meticulously crafted through argument (as opposed to assertion) and evidence, and rooted in a highly original conceptual framework that is both global in scope and differentiated. The report asserts the centrality of cultural and institutional change and does not shy away from being specific and programmatic at a moment when it seems that political discourses are increasingly disconnected from our highly fractious, unsustainable, violent and intolerant times. I recommend it as compulsory reading in the strongest possible terms.\\" Professor Edgar Pieterse, Director ‚Äì African Centre for Cities (University of Cape Town) & Chairperson of the Cities Alliance Think Tank. ‚ÄûThe new WBGU-Study ‚ÄûA Social Contract for Sustainability‚Äù appears at a time in which people around the world are increasingly committed to creating a future that is both sustainable and climate-safe. The study shows that such a future will only be possible if governments, business and civil society collectively set the right course, making the most of regional, national and global cooperation. An important call to cross-cutting integrated action, the book deserves wide recognition.‚Äú Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (2010-2016) \\"The geopolitical world is changing beyond recognition. The challenge of ensuring that in the future people can live better than today, while doing so within the Planetary Boundaries has yet to be met. Markets and the environment are increasingly globalized. Social protection and the search for equity are not, though there are interesting signs of change. There are many international institutions, but few are global. We have known for some time the necessary individual solutions required for the transition. Now, the WBGU report \`World in Transition ‚Äì A Social Contract for Sustainability¬¥ offers us extremely interesting ideas on how we can bring all this together collectively through a new social contract that is global, equitable and green, and requires a new kind of global citizenship: the first steps toward a global political project for global sustainability.\\" Janos Pasztor, Executive Secretary UN Secretary- General's High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2010-12 ‚ÄúThe \`World in Transition ‚Äì Governing the Marine Heritage¬¥ report presents a thought provoking look at crucial aspects of oceans governance. It resonates strongly with our thinking in the World Bank and among the partners of the Global Partnership for Oceans. Nation states, civil society and industry need to work together to support more sustainable and productive ocean use. This report makes a valuable contribution to global thinking on how best we might secure a sustainable future from healthy oceans.‚Äù Rachel Kyte, Vice President, Sustainable Development, The World Bank (2014-2015) \\"Biofuels have been represented by some as a silver bullet to the climate change threat, and by others as a fatal mistake set to destroy forests and increase hunger; they are neither. Sane and sensibly developed they offer a chance to reduce emissions, generate employment and diversify rural livelihoods. But widespread commercialisation without proper sustainability standards could prove a disaster, causing more environmental and human harm than good. The new WBGU report shows that a sustainable use of bioenergy is possible and outlines how opportunities can be exploited while at the same time minimizing risks. The report thus offers policy-makers valuable guidance for a sustainable bioenergy policy.\\" Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016) \\"With Climate Change as a Security Risk, WBGU has compiled a flagship report on an issue that quite rightly is rising rapidly up the international political agenda. The authors pull no punches on the likelihood of increasing tensions and conflicts in a climatically constrained world and spotlight places where possible conflicts may flare up in the 21st century unless climate change is checked. The report makes it clear that climate policy is preventative security policy.\\" Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016) ‚ÄûWith its interdisciplinary approach, providing a complex and systematic analysis of the poverty-environment nexus, WBGU's latest report breaks new ground. Indira Gandhi's old, convenient maxim was 'Poverty is the biggest polluter'. Put forward at the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, it has been sorely misused ever since to override environmental precaution and prioritize economic development strategies instead. The new WBGU report maps out a way to shape a coherent environment and development policy. This report revitalizes the Rio spirit and gives it a robust scientific base‚Äú Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker, Member of the German Bundestag 1998-2005. \\"The publication of 'World in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems' is timely indeed. The World Summit on Sustainable Development gave great attention to this challenge, but failed to agree on a quantitative, time-bound target for the introduction of renewable energy sources. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) has now produced a report with a global focus; this is essential in view of the global impacts of climatic changes. The report provides a convincing long-term analysis; this, too, is essential, for global energy policies must take a long-term perspective, over a time frame of 50 to 100 years, while providing concrete guidance for decision makers to be implemented now. There is an urgent need to identify paths by which to secure energy supply for the 2.4 billion people who still depend upon traditional biomass, while keeping clearly in view the need to combine this challenge with the prevention of perilous climatic changes. Our one world must close the gap between industrialized countries‚Äô surfeit and developing countries‚Äô poverty. Policies will need to consider both the broader environmental and specific climate exigencies. I recommend this book very warmly to everyone concerned with global energy issues.\\" Klaus T√∂pfer, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) from 1998-2006. Public Relations and Events (Selection) In May 2012, WBGU hosted a high-level international Symposium ‚ÄûTowards Low-Carbon Prosperity: National Strategies and International Partnerships‚Äú in Berlin. At this symposium a variety of important national approaches to the decarbonisation of energy systems and opportunities for innovative partnerships in the transition to low-carbon development were illuminated. The keynote was delivered by Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel. The summary video of the entire event, all speeches as videos and the text documentation are available here. The WBGU report ‚ÄûWorld in Transition ‚Äì A Social Contract for Sustainability‚Äú is available as an online seminar (http://wit.va-bne.de/ or http://www.wbgu.de/en/trafoseminar/). The E-Course ‚ÄûWorld in Transition‚Äúof the WBGU has been produced in cooperation with the Virtual Academy for Sustainability. The aim is to provide freely available e-courses on sustainability at no charge for university students. This offer is directed at students of all faculties and can be integrated in general studies programmes as well as dedicated bachelor and master courses. The E-Course is also a contribution to the Science Year 2012 of the German Federal Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF) ‚ÄûProject Earth ‚Äì Our Future‚Äú. In 2015 the WBGU produced a cartoon explaining the concept of planetary guardrails. On the occasion of the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda with its Sustainable Development Goals WBGU Co chair Dirk Messner explains in a video the importance of planetary guard rails in implementing these goals. WBGU explains the concept of planetary guard rails in an animated short film. In 2014 the flagship report ‚ÄûA Social Contract for Sustainability‚Äú was published in a comic version: ‚ÄûThe Great Transformation: Climate ‚Äì Can we beat the Heat?‚Äú http://www.cambourakis.com/spip.php?article581/ La Grande Transformation In 2015 the French version of this graphic novel has been published under the title ‚ÄûLa Grande Transformation ‚Äì Climat, inverserons-nous la courbe?‚Äú. In 2016 the comic \\"The urban planet ‚Äì How cities save our future\\"WBGU Comic 2016, ‚ÄûThe urban planet ‚Äì How cities save our future‚Äú has been published in three languages (German, English, Spanish). In 2017 WBGU hosted the international conference ‚ÄûThe transformative power of cities‚Äú. Two Panels focused on ‚ÄúDo real estate markets lead to unjust cities?‚Äú and ‚ÄûDigital cities ‚Äì Potential or Risk for Sustainable Development?‚Äú. Speakers were amongst others Stefan Bone- Winkel, Shivani Chaudhry, Leilani Fahra, Barbara Hendricks, Dirk Messner, Saskia Sassen, John Schellnhuber and Carlo Ratti. In preparation for the report \\"Our common digital future\\", the WBGU held in June 2018 a public consultation round on \\"Digitization and sustainability: What future do we want to shape?\\". The background was the paper \\"Digitization - what we need to talk about\\". In 2018 the WBGU was co-host of the 26th EEAC Annual Conference \\"Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030: Key leverages for transformation\\". The first public presentation of the report \\"Our common digital future\\" took place in April 2019 in cooperation with the KfW, a German state-owned development bank. The WBGU In July 2019, this report was presented at a side event of the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in New York at the German permanent mission, and in September, also in New York, at the SDG Summit. In December 2019, the WBGU organized the research conference \\"Shaping the Future - Digital and sustainable\\", (in German) in cooperation with the Ministry of Research ( BMBF) and the Weizenbaum-Institut.

Early life Volkman was born in Medford, Massachusetts. Having an interest in radio since childhood, Volkman and his brother built a radio station at their Boston area home. The brothers worked hard on their radio productions even though only the family was able to hear the broadcasts from their small transmitter. His interest in radio carried over into the Army where he attended radio classes, but opted to study physics at Tufts University before meteorology captured his imagination and brought him to the University of Tulsa. Career Volkman got his start as a weatherman at KOTV in Tulsa, Oklahoma in January 1950. While there, he also served as a booth announcer, model, on-air salesman, sportscaster, variety show host and switchboard operator. He also claims to have worked briefly as a custodian for the station and not having been paid for his first three months. His beginning pay was $25. A fine vocalist and a member of his church choir for many years, Volkman would often mix a little music into his weather forecasts wherever he worked. His most recent contribution to society is a book about his life as a weatherman, Whatever The Weather: My Life & Times As A TV Weatherman. Personal life Volkman was the father of three sons and a daughter. His son, Ed, formerly hosted a long-running morning radio show in Chicago titled \\"Eddie & JoBo\\" on WBBM-FM B96. Volkman's long-time work in Chicago area television was recognized in 1998 when he became a member of the local Emmys Silver Circle. During the many years Volkman spent at various Chicago-area television stations, he received local Emmys for his weather forecasting in 1961, 1964 and 1967.(PDF)(PDF)(PDF) At the time of his 2004 retirement, Volkman had spent 54 years in television.

A. Lorentz in 1909 at 4,461 m (14,635 ft), and whose highest peaks are Puncak Jaya (Mt. Carstensz) at 4,884 m (16,024 feet), Puncak Mandala (Mt. Juliana) at 4,760 m (15,610 ft) and Puncak Trikora (Mt. Wilhelmina) at 4,750 m (15,580 ft). The Highlands village in the Western New Guinea Although some valleys such as the Wahgi Valley in the Western Highlands, Papua New Guinea are heavily cultivated and support urban settlements most of the mountains have traditional tribal village communities in the grassy mountain valleys. The PNG Highland provinces are: Eastern Highlands Province, the most heavily populated area of PNG; Simbu Province (or Chimbu) whose centre is the small coffee-growing town of Kundiawa on the Wahgi River near Mount Wilhelm; the Western Highlands; the rugged Enga Province the home of the Enga people with its administration in the very small town of Wabag on the Lai River, and containing the large Porgera Gold Mine; and Southern Highlands Province, with its centre in the small town and airport of Mendi, and containing the Huli wigmen area around the town of Tari. The Highlands Highway connects many of these towns. Larger urban areas in the PNG Highlands include the Western Highlands capital and PNG's 3rd largest city Mount Hagen (near the extinct Mount Hagen (volcano)), the Eastern Highlands capital and former colonial town of Goroka, and the mining town of Tabubil. The climate is humid as you would expect of the tropical rainforested island of New Guinea, but the higher mountain slopes are of course cooler than the lowlands. The Highlands are the source of a number of important rivers including the Ramu River in the north and the Wahgi River in the south, and lakes including Lake Kutubu, near which oil has been extracted since 1992 by Chevron. Mining is also very active in the region to the detriment of indigenous groups, with frequent friction. Natural Parks List of Natural Parks in New Guinea Highlands. *Lorentz National Park *Mount Wilhelm National Park Geology This chain of mountains continues to rise (with corresponding quakes) as the Australian plate collides with the plates to the northeast, yet marking the southern boundaries of the Maoke Plate and Woodlark Plates. The width of the mountain range varies considerably, with a central thin segment near the borders of the two nations. History European adventurer in the Highlands The fertile Highlands have long been inhabited and artifacts uncovered in the Ivane Valley indicate that the Highlands were first settled about 50,000 years ago. The inhabitants were nomadic foragers but around 10,000 years ago began developing a fairly advanced agricultural society. The Highlands were not settled by the Western powers during the early colonial period and they were first visited by western zoologists and explorers, such as Mick Leahy, who opened the Wahgi Valley and Mount Hagen, and Richard Archbold in the 1930s. During World War II, the eastern highlands saw the Kokoda Track campaign in which Australian and New Zealand soldiers, along with native guides who were pressed into service, fought and ultimately stopped the Japanese from advancing south towards Port Moresby and, ultimately, northern Queensland on the Australian mainland. The culture of inter-tribal warfare and animosity between the neighboring tribes have long been present in the Highlands. Ecology The New Guinea Highlands are home to a great variety of Australasian plant and animal communities, distinct from the surrounding lowlands to the north and south of the central ranges and varying up and along the mountain ranges. The habitats of the mountains have been separated into two ecoregions, depending on their elevation, the tropical montane forests and alpine grasslands, but within these broad bands there is a variety of wildlife along the island as some of the mountains stand quite a distance from others with some species of plant or animal existing on only one or two mountains. Particular centres of plant diversity are: the Star Mountains area of western Papua New Guinea near the Indonesian border including Telefomin and Strickland Gorge; the Hunstein Range; Mount Giluwe, a major birdwatching area for birds- of-paradise; the volcanic limestone Kubor Range; the Bismarck Range/Mount Wilhelm/Schrader Range/Mount Gahavisuka, of which Mount Wilhelm is particularly rich in endemic species; and finally the Crater Mountain and Mount Michael in the Eastern Highlands. Central Range montane rain forests Mount Bosavi The montane rain forests (from 1,000 to 3,000m) can be further categorised into three broad vegetation zones on the mountains, distinguished by elevation. The lower montane forests extend from 1,000 to 1,500 metres elevation. They are dominated by broadleaf evergreen trees, including Castanopsis acuminatissima, Lithocarpus spp., elaeocarps, and laurels. Coniferous Araucarias may form thick stands. The upper montane forests, which extend from 1,500 to 2,500 metres elevation, are dominated by moss-covered Nothofagus. Finally, the high mountain forest extends from 2,500 to 3,000 metres elevation. Conifers (Podocarpus, Dacrycarpus, Dacrydium, Papuacedrus, Araucaria, and Libocedrus) and broadleaf trees of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae) form a thin canopy, with a prominent understory. The montane forests are home to a rich wildlife, a great deal of which is unique to these mountains including many plants, reptiles and over 100 birds and animals. Of the 90 mammals found on the island, 44 are endemic, a very high proportion. The birds and animals include many Australasian species such as tree-kangaroos, bowerbirds, Australasian robins, honeyeaters, and birds-of- paradise. Four of the endemic mammals are critically endangered: the Bulmer's fruit bat, with only tiny communities remaining in the Papua New Guinea end of the island, and three rodents; a large Leptomys, the eastern shrew mouse, and the lesser small-toothed rat. There are 55 bird species endemic to the mountains from a total of 348 birds found here. There are a number of endemic butterflies, particularly on the Weyland Mountains and the Wahgi Valley. Baliem Valley Apart from in the cultivated valleys the montane forests are largely intact, although the logging industry is a constant threat as more and more access to the mountains is achieved by road building. 20% of this ecoregion is contained within protected areas, mostly in the Indonesian half of the island, including the largest protected area in South East Asia, the huge Lorentz National Park in the highlands, a section of which is montane forest ecosystem. Central Range sub-alpine grasslands Above 3,000 metres elevation, the high mountain forest yields to remote sub-alpine habitats including alpine meadows, conifer forest, tree-fern (Cyathea) grasslands, bogs, and shrubby heaths of Rhododendron, Vaccinium, Coprosma, Rapanea, and Saurauia all quite different from the tropical rain forest that covers most of New Guinea. The alpine habitat above 4,000 metres consists of compact rosette and cushion herbs, such as Ranunculus, Potentilla, Gentiana, and Epilobium, grasses (Poa and Deschampsia), bryophytes, and lichens. While there are a number of endemic plants there are few animals on the higher slopes, with only nine mammals found here: four rodents, two bats, a cuscus possum, an antechinus and Doria's tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus dorianus). Four of these are endemic: the small marsupial black-tailed antechinus (Murexechinus melanurus), western shrew mouse, glacier rat and alpine woolly rat. There are nearly 100 birds of which 28 are considered endemic or nearly so, including the vulnerable long-bearded honeyeater (Melionyx princeps), ribbon-tailed astrapia (Astrapia mayeri) and Macgregor's giant honeyeater, which although endangered generally is a cultural icon of the Ketengban people of the Star Mountains and therefore protected in some areas.http://www.arkive.org/macgregors-bird-of- paradise/macgregoria-pulchra/info.html Almost half of these remote grasslands are protected in national parks and they are in good condition although in recent times more people are accessing the highlands as visitors or through involvement in mining.

He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School, where he first developed his love of polar literature, and at the Royal Geographical Society in London, where he studied surveying and navigation.  Polar career Rymill prepared himself for polar exploration with alpine experience in Europe, flying lessons at the de Havilland Aircraft Co.

In 1931 he was appointed to the British Arctic Air Route Expedition to Greenland (1930‚Äì31) as surveyor and pilot. He also joined the subsequent 1932-33 East Greenland Expedition led by Gino WatkinsEast Greenland Expedition (Pan Am) 1932 -33 and which he led after Watkins' death in Tuttilik Fjord. As a result of these Arctic experiences, Rymill determined to mount an Antarctic expedition to South Graham Land and the Weddell Sea south of Cape Horn, South America. After some difficulties securing sponsorship, he purchased an old sail training ship which he renamed Penola and with volunteer staff from Cambridge University and nine crew supplied by the Royal Navy, sailed to the South Atlantic, where their first base was South Georgia. His British Graham Land Expedition (1934‚Äì37) discovered a southern, permanently frozen channel, later named George VI Sound, extending to the Bellingshausen Sea. Honours Rymill Coast in Palmer Land and Rymill Bay in Graham Land, Antarctica, were named after him. * The British Service Polar Medal with Arctic bar (1930‚Äì31) * Antarctic (1934‚Äì37) bars * Murchison Award (1934) of the Royal Geographical Society * Founders' medal (1938) of the Royal Geographical Society * David Livingstone Centenary Medal of the American Geographical Society of New York (1939). > 'The survey work of this expedition constitutes probably the largest > contribution of accurately detailed surveys of the Antarctic Continent made > by an expedition'.

Because the lake is endorheic and quite salty there are no fish in the lake. Manitou Island in the centre of the lake is now connected to the southern shore as the water level has lowered. Description The lake is fed from Eyehill Creek on the south end, as well as many small springtime meltwater tributaries. The lake overflows to the north into the Battle River, although this has only happened once since European settlers first arrived in the area (approximately 1905). Lake levels were relatively constant until 1980, and have been declining rapidly since then, approximately one meter every six years. Less annual snowfall is blamed for most of this trend, and there is also heavier utilization of the Eyehill Creek system by urban, industrial, and agricultural users. There is very little development on the lake although on the North-West Bay near the Suffern Lake Regional Park (Manitou Section) there is a golf course, cabins and a Bible Camp. The communities of Marsden and Neilburg are nearby to the north on Highway 40.

It was sunk in Port Phillip Bay after a collision with another ship on 19 November 1865. Ship history The iron- hulled ship was built at the yard of Blackwood & Gordon in Paisley, Scotland, for the Launceston & Melbourne Steamship Company, at a cost of ¬£17,000, and launched on 4 April 1863. At and long she was built to carry passengers and cargo, and was powered by an 80 nhp steam engine as well as sails on two masts. The ship sailed from Glasgow on 6 June 1863, bound for Melbourne, arriving there on 16 September. Once at Melbourne, while undergoing an overhaul preparatory to her first commercial voyage, she was altered from a brig to a schooner rig. As the flagship of the Launceston and Melbourne Steam Navigation Company, no expense was spared in her fitting-out. On 21 October 1863 the ship made a trial voyage from Launceston to George Town, with between 450 and 500 invited passengers aboard, who were lavishly entertained with free wines and refreshments, and music provided by the Volunteer Artillery brass band. The ship left launceston at 7.30 a.m. and made the crossing in 2¬æ hours. At George Town the passengers went ashore to stroll around the town and on the beach, and were provided with sumptuous lunch before the ship set sail again at 3.30 p.m., arriving back at launceston by 6.00 p.m. For the following two years she carried passengers, mail and cargo across the Strait, without incident. Sinking At 7.20 p.m. on 19 November 1865 the City of Launceston sailed from Port Melbourne under the command of Captain William Thompson. She carried a crew of 23, and 25 passengers, and a general cargo that included mail, luggage, drapery, brandy, port, rum, cigars, tea, boots, and sheepwash. The evening was bright and cloudless, the seas calm. The City of Launceston observed the SS Penola, inbound from Adelaide, approaching head on while they were still five miles apart. According to the rules of the sea ships on converging courses were supposed to port their helm in order to pass each other safely. However, this did not happen and the two ships closed, and at around 9.00 p.m. Penola ran her bows squarely into City of Launcestons starboard side. As the Launceston began to sink all of the passengers and crew were transferred to the Penola, which despite leaving her stem lodged in the hull of the Launceston was able to make port safely. Wreck site A week or so after the collision divers recovered 56 mailboxes, one bag, one parcel, five passengers' boxes, and two cases of merchandise from the wreck. An attempt was made to refloat the ship the following year, using \\"Maquay's patented lifting device\\", where canvas bags inflated by hydrogen gas produced by the reaction of zinc and sulphuric acid were attached to the ship. It was not successful. City of Launceston was rediscovered in 1980 by members of the Maritime Archaeology Association of Victoria, and became the first wreck to be listed and protected under the Historic Shipwrecks Act of 1981. The wreck sits upright in of water and is largely intact. Since 1997 she has been the subject of archaeological studies under the direction of Heritage Victoria's Maritime Heritage Unit.

It is book one in a series known as The Kent Family Chronicles or the American Bicentennial Series. The novel mixes fictional characters with historical events or people, to tell the story of the United States of America in the time period leading up to the American Revolution. The novel was adapted into a four-hour television film in 1978, The Bastard. Plot summary  The story begins in November 1770 in Auvergne, France, near Chavaniac. Philippe Charboneau, a seventeen-year-old boy, is living with his mother, Marie, in an inn inherited from her deceased father. The young Philippe never knew his father. Having kept it a secret from him for years, she finally tells him his father was James Amberly, the 6th Duke of Kent. The Duke began an affair with Marie when she was performing on stage in Paris, but he never married her, making Philippe illegitimate. Their affair was brief and when he returned to England, Amberly married and had a legitimate son, Roger; however, he continued to support Marie and intended for Philippe to inherit half of his fortune. When Philippe and Marie received word that the Duke had taken ill they immediately made plans to travel to Kent, England and stake their claim to his inheritance Once at Kent, the Duke's wife, Lady Jane Amberly, and Roger, her son, refused to recognize Philippe as the son of the Duke. Marie insists otherwise and is determined not to leave Kent until her son inherits what she feels is rightfully his half of the Amberly's' wealth. Philippe and his mother stay months at an inn in hopes that Lady Jane would reconsider, but she never does. The situation becomes even more tense when Philippe began a sexual relationship with Roger's fianc√©e, Alicia Parkhurst. When Philippe and Marie are informed that the Duke had died they return to his home, but they are not allowed to see the body. Instead Philippe and Roger brawl, and Roger's hand is badly wounded. Philippe escapes with his life, though he remains in danger. Alicia warned him to leave Kent because Roger is bent on killing him for injuring his hand. Lacking the funds to return to France, Marie and Philippe flee to London and hope to remain hidden there until the situation cooled. Not knowing their way around the city of London, they made for St. Paul's Church, hoping to find sanctuary there. Instead, they are attacked by violent beggars who try to rob Philippe and Marie. They are saved by Esau and Hosea Sholto, the sons of Solomon Sholto, a deeply religious man who believes in charity and compassion. Philippe and Marie are allowed to stay with the Sholtos and Solomon offered to train Philippe as his apprentice, as the Sholto family owns and operates a printing company and a lending library. Convinced that his claim to Kentland will never be validated, Philippe decides to take Solomon's advice and learn the trade. When Philippe confides to Solomon his desire to emigrate to America, Solomon introduces him to Benjamin Franklin, who is currently an American trade representative to England. To convince Philippe that America was the place he should be, Franklin praised his native country for its boundless opportunities, but also warns that trouble between the British and the colonies are brewing. Marie is adamantly opposed to leaving England without settling the claim for her son, but Philippe is attacked by an agent hired by Roger, who has never given up on trying to eliminate his rival claimant. London is no longer safe for Marie and Philippe and they fled again, this time to the port city of Bristol, to find passage to America. During their transatlantic journey, Marie, heartbroken, dies of dysentery and is buried at sea, and Philippe decides to adopt an Anglicized version of his name, renaming himself Philip Kent. Philip arrives in Boston, Massachusetts penniless, becoming homeless and starving. He quickly angers a British soldier by accidentally splashing mud on him. He is saved from a beating by local merchant William Molineux. Through his connection with Molineux, Philip was introduced to Samuel Adams and Paul Revere. He is also introduced to Benjamin Edes, the editor of the Boston Gazette, who gives Philip a job at his publishing firm. It was through this job that Philip meets Abraham Ware, who often contributes to articles to the paper, and his daughter Anne, whom Philip begins courting. Philip participates in the Boston Tea Party, and then joins the Boston Grenadier Company under Henry Knox. A number of measures are enacted after the Tea Party to punish the colonists in Boston. One of these acts, the Quartering Act, particularly angers Abraham Ware, because he is required to house a British soldier in his home. George Lumden, the sergeant who is quartered in the Wares' house, falls in love with Daisy O'Brian, the Wares' cook, and decides to desert the British army. Philip, who wants Lumden's musket, encourages the sergeant to do so and even employs a local boy to assist him in taking the musket. However, the boy finds it more profitable to betray Philip and inform on Lumden to the commander of his unit, who is none other than Roger Amberly. Roger goes to the Wares' house in search of Lumden, but finds only Anne. When Philip arrives, Roger recognizes and attacks him, but Philip stabs his half-brother in the stomach with a bayonet. Thinking him dead, Philip flees the city with Lumden and goes to stay on Daisy's father's farm, near Concord, Massachusetts. Anne and Daisy join them at the farm some time later and they inform him that Roger had not died. He was taken to Philadelphia to be treated privately, and Alicia Parkhurst was with him. Anne gives Philip a letter that Alicia had written to him and he leaves Concord to see her in Philadelphia. Roger dies before Philip reached the city. Philip meets with Alicia, who tells him she wants to marry him. Philip is torn between Alicia and Anne. In a chance reunion with Benjamin Franklin, Franklin tells Philip that James Amberly is actually still alive and Philip realizes that Alicia only wants to marry him now because he is now the Duke's only heir. Philip confronts Alicia and informs her that he no longer loves her and has decided to give up any claim to his inheritance, believing that the immense wealth would corrupt him as it had corrupted the Kent family. On his return from Philadelphia to Concord to be reunited with Anne, he ran into Paul Revere again, this time with William Dawes and Samuel Prescott, on their famous \\"midnight ride\\" to warn the patriots that the British army is coming. Philip tries to see Anne, but her father will not allow him to, telling him Anne was too distraught when he left her. Then, Philip returns to O'Brian's farm to get Lumden's musket. Once there, he tells Daisy to tell Anne that he loves her. Philip participates in the Battle of Concord and afterwards, he is finally reunited with Anne. He tells her that he plans to marry her, and then he leaves to continue the fighting in the war against the British.  Historic figures the fictional Philip Kent met throughout the novel  * The Marquis de Lafayette is aided by Philippe during an attempted robbery by a local bully, Auguste, and his cousin, Bertram. The Marquis, who said his name was Gil (short for his given name, Gilbert), is grateful for the assistance and he becomes fast friends with Philippe.

The village's placename is likely derived in part from the name of the river, and thus means \\"hill by the River Brant\\". The placename is thus composed of two Old English elements: brant (meaning \\"steep\\", \\"deep\\") and d≈´n (meaning \\"hill\\"). History A notable building is Brandon Old Hall, built in the 16th century. Built of coursed dark gold bands of ironstone, light gold bands of ironstone, narrow bands of blue lias with limestone ashlar dressings. The garden is walled in the same unique style. Medieval earthworks of a toft (homestead with land), a hollow way and some boundaries have been identified around the existing village.

Before distinguishing himself as MIT‚Äôs founder and first president, Rogers was a professor of natural philosophy and chemistry. He also served as State Geologist of Virginia, which explains why geology courses have been taught at MIT for more than a century. In 1983, EAPS was formed through the merger of two MIT departments: the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, which grew out of the first geology courses, and the Department of Meteorology and Physical Oceanography, which had its roots in the meteorology courses that first emerged at MIT in 1941. Today, EAPS seeks to understand the fundamental workings of natural systems by examining physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring across a vast spectrum of time and space.

In July 2006, the CGCS became an independent Center in the School of Science. The Center‚Äôs goal is to improve the ability to accurately predict changes in the global environment. The CGCS seeks to better understand the natural mechanisms in ocean, atmosphere and land systems that together control the Earth‚Äôs climate, and to apply improved knowledge to problems of predicting climate changes. The Center utilizes theory, observations, and numerical models to investigate climate phenomena, the linkages among them, and their potential feedbacks in a changing climate. The director of the CGCS is Professor Ron Prinn from MIT. Center for Ultracold Atoms The MIT‚ÄìHarvard Center for Ultracold Atoms (CUA) is a collaborative research laboratory between MIT and Harvard University. The core research program in the CUA consists of four collaborative experimental projects whose goals are to provide new sources of ultracold atoms and quantum gases, and new types of atom-wave devices. These projects will enable new research on topics such as quantum fluids, atom/photon optics, coherence, spectroscopy, ultracold collisions, and quantum devices. In addition, the CUA has a theoretical program centered on themes of quantum optics, many-body physics, wave physics, and atomic structure and interactions. The Director of the CUA is Wolfgang Ketterle (a 2001 Nobel laureate in physics) from MIT.

Intuitively, a flat manifold is one that \\"locally looks like\\" Euclidean space in terms of distances and angles, e.g. the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180¬∞. The universal cover of a complete flat manifold is Euclidean space. This can be used to prove the theorem of that all compact flat manifolds are finitely covered by tori; the 3-dimensional case was proved earlier by . Examples The following manifolds can be endowed with a flat metric. Note that this may not be their 'standard' metric (for example, the flat metric on the 2-dimensional torus is not the metric induced by its usual embedding into \\\\mathbb{R}^3). Dimension 1 Every one-dimensional Riemannian manifold is flat. Conversely, given that every connected one-dimensional smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to either \\\\mathbb{R} or S^1, it is straightforward to see that every connected one- dimensional Riemannian manifold is isometric to one of the following (each with their standard Riemannian structure): * the real line * the open interval (0,x) for some number x>0 * the open interval (0,\\\\infty) * the circle {(x,y)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2=r^2} of radius r, for some number r>0. Only the first and last are complete. If one includes Riemannian manifolds-with- boundary, then the half-open and closed intervals must also be included. The simplicity of a complete description in this case could be ascribed to the fact that every one-dimensional Riemannian manifold has a smooth unit-length vector field, and that an isometry from one of the above model examples is provided by considering an integral curve. Dimension 2 The five possibilities, up to diffeomorphism = If (M,g) is a smooth two-dimensional connected complete flat Riemannian manifold, then M must be diffeomorphic to \\\\mathbb{R}^2, S^1\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}, S^1\\\\times S^1, the M√∂bius strip, or the Klein bottle. Note that the only compact possibilities are S^1\\\\times S^1 and the Klein bottle, while the only orientable possibilities are \\\\mathbb{R}^2, S^1\\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}, and S^1\\\\times S^1. It takes more effort to describe the distinct complete flat Riemannian metrics on these spaces. For instance, S^1\\\\times S^1 even has many different flat product metrics, since one could take the two factors to have different radii; hence this space even has different flat product metrics which are not isometric up to a scale factor. In order to talk uniformly about the five possibilities, and in particular to work concretely with the M√∂bius strip and the Klein bottle as abstract manifolds, it is useful to use the language of group actions. = The five possibilities, up to isometry = Given (x_0,y_0)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^2, let T_{(x_0,y_0)} denote the translation \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 given by (x,y)\\\\mapsto(x+x_0,y+y_0). Let R denote the reflection \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 given by (x,y)\\\\mapsto(x,-y). Given two positive numbers a,b, consider the following subgroups of \\\\operatorname{Isom}(\\\\mathbb{R}^2), the group of isometries of \\\\mathbb{R}^2 with its standard metric. * G_{e}={T_{(0,0)}} * G_{\\\\text{cyl}}(a)={T_{(an,0)}:n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}} * G_{\\\\text{tor}}(a,b)={T_{(na,mb)}:m,n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}} provided a * G_{\\\\text{Moeb}}(a)={T_{(2na,0)}:n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\cup{T_{((2n+1)a,0)}\\\\circ R:n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}} * G_{\\\\text{KB}}(b)={T_{(2na,bm)}:n,m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\cup{T_{((2n+1)a,bm)}\\\\circ R:n,m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}} These are all groups acting freely and properly discontinuously on \\\\mathbb{R}^2, and so the various coset spaces \\\\mathbb{R}^2/G all naturally have the structure of two-dimensional complete flat Riemannian manifolds. None of them are isometric to one another, and any smooth two-dimensional complete flat connected Riemannian manifold is isometric to one of them. =Orbifolds= There are 17 compact 2-dimensional orbifolds with flat metric (including the torus and Klein bottle), listed in the article on orbifolds, that correspond to the 17 wallpaper groups. = Remarks = Note that the standard 'picture' of the torus as a doughnut does not present it with a flat metric, since the points furthest from the center have positive curvature while the points closest to the center have negative curvature. According to Kuiper's formulation of the Nash embedding theorem, there is a C^1 embedding S^1\\\\times S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^3 which induces any of the flat product metrics which exist on S^1\\\\times S^1, but these are not easily visualizable. Since S^1 is presented as an embedded submanifold of \\\\mathbb{R}^2, any of the (flat) product structures on S^1\\\\times S^1 are naturally presented as submanifolds of \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^2=\\\\mathbb{R}^4. Likewise, the standard three- dimensional visualizations of the Klein bottle do not present a flat metric. The standard construction of a M√∂bius strip, by gluing ends of a strip of paper together, does indeed give it a flat metric, but it is not complete. Dimension 3 For the complete list of the 6 orientable and 4 non- orientable compact examples see Seifert fiber space. Higher dimensions *Euclidean space *Tori *Products of flat manifolds *Quotients of flat manifolds by groups acting freely. Relation to amenability Among all closed manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature, flat manifolds are characterized as precisely those with an amenable fundamental group. This is a consequence of the Adams-Ballmann theorem (1998), which establishes this characterization in the much more general setting of discrete cocompact groups of isometries of Hadamard spaces. This provides a far-reaching generalisation of Bieberbach's theorem. The discreteness assumption is essential in the Adams-Ballmann theorem: otherwise, the classification must include symmetric spaces, Bruhat-Tits buildings and Bass-Serre trees in view of the \\"indiscrete\\" Bieberbach theorem of Caprace-Monod.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 378. It is situated about halfway between Market Harborough and Desborough. It lies in a valley between two ridges one of which is surmounted by the A6 trunk road. The surrounding land in the parish is a mixture of pasture and arable. Church of All Saints All Saints church and baptist chapel The most significant building in modern Braybrooke is the Church, dedicated to All Saints. This lies on the central village cross-roads and a key feature is the magnificent elongated spire which was built in the late 14th century or early 15th century. The oldest surviving parts of the church, the moulded south doorway and the eastern bay of the nave, are thought to date from the 13th century. The church was extended considerably in the 14th century. After two centuries of neglect significant and sympathetic restoration work was done over a long period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Braybrooke Castle Braybrooke Castle is today no more than a large area of extensive earthworks on the east side of the village. The castle was actually a fortified manor house associated, in the main, with two families - Latimer and Griffin. All that is visible today is the platform on which the manor house stood and the remains of both large and small fish ponds which served the manor. First mentioned in the mid C12. c.1200 documents mention fishponds already in use. The acquisition of timber for building work is recorded in 1213, and a garden in 1292. In 1304 Thomas de Latimer was granted a licence to strengthen his manor house at Braybrooke and documentary sources indicate that the moated house was constructed at this time. In 1329-30 there is mention of a waterfilled moat. Described as a castle in 1361. The manor passed to the Griffin family in the early C15. The castle buildings were used as a farmhouse from 1549-50 until demolition prior to 1633. A mid-C17 farmhouse stood on the site until 1960. On 12 August 1605 King James I and Anne of Denmark came from Kirby Hall and visited Edward Griffin at the castle, and travelled on to Great Harrowden.John Nichols, The Progresses of James the First, vol. 1 (London, 1828), p. 526. Other Information Related To The Castle The road that spouts into Latimer Close is Griffin Road. Griffin Road was originally called Arthingworth Road and the name was changed to Griffin Road in 1867 by Helena Tafer who died after giving birth to two children (her great-grandson is the farmer that owns the fields behind 63 Appledene).

Kept at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria Francisco de Moncada (in Catalan: Francesc de Montcada i Montcada), 3rd Marquis of Aytona, (1586‚Äì1635) was a Spanish diplomat, soldier and writer of the early 17th century. He was also interim Governor of the Spanish Netherlands. Early life Moncada, Ambassador in Germany and Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, a general and commander of the Spanish-Flemish armies, and a brilliant medieval historian, was born in Valencia to Gast√≥n de Moncada, 2nd Marquis of Aitona, (1554‚Äì1626), Ambassador to Rome Viceroy of Sardinia, 1590‚Äì1595, Viceroy of Aragon, 1603‚Äì1610, and his wife Catalina de Moncada (her maiden name) baroness of Callosa. He was taught as a child of the great works of both chivalry and the troubadours, especially Joanot Martorell's Tirant lo Blanch which influenced Miguel de Cervantes so much that he praises it in Don Quixote. Literary work Moncada wrote Expedicion de Catalanes y Argoneses al Oriente about the Catalan Company. This history gives an account of the followers of Roger de Flor in their cooperation and fighting the Byzantine Empire and later their capture of the Duchy of Athens. Editions: (Barcelona, 1623; Madrid, 1777, 1805, 1883; around 97 pages, Paris, 1841, in \\"Tesoro de los historiadores espanoles\\"). Moncada also wrote Vida de Anicio Manlio Torquato Severino Boecio. This Roman politician from an illustrious imperial family of the 6th century, was known as Anicius Manlius Severinus Bo√´thius, commonly called Boethius. This work was not published until after Moncada's death, first going to press at Frankfurt, Germany in 1642.

Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, 30x24.6 cm Moncada served as the Spanish ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor for some time. The Emperor Ferdinand II was very impressed by him. He served as a counselor to Princess Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, regent of the Spanish Netherlands. While serving in Brussels he tried to convince King Philip IV of Spain to transfer the general management of affairs in his Netherlands possessions to Brussels and remove any responsibility for such matters from the government in Madrid. His proposals to give the various peoples in the Netherlands, still under Habsburg rule, more say in their governmental affairs were rejected. He was made the commander-in-chief of the Spanish navy in the Netherlands in 1630. On 12‚Äì13 March 1631, his seamen were defeated at the Battle of the Slaak, the commander being then a Catholic member of the House of Orange-Nassau, namely Count Jan VIII van Nassau-Siegen, (Dillenburg, Germany, 1583 - Count successor 1623 - Siegen, Belgium, 27 September 1623). In 1632 he was put in charge of all Spanish forces in the Netherlands. In 1634 he was made interim-governor of the Spanish Netherlands on the death of Spanish Netherlands Governess Isabella Clara Eugenia in December 1633.

During its final month on air the station simply became known as 96.7FM. BCR struggled to establish a listener base and was eventually relaunched as Belfast CityBeat in 1996. In contrast with its forerunner, Citybeat became a huge success and is now one of the most popular stations in Northern Ireland. Stuart Robinson presented the final programme on BCR on 30 September 1996. The last track played was Elton John and \\"Sacrifice\\". At midnight BCR changed to Citybeat.

Passing directly across the Black Forest, through spectacular scenery, the route is 150 km long, ascends 650 metres from lowest to highest elevation, and passes through 39 tunnels and over 2 viaducts. It is still the only true mountain railway in Germany to be built with two tracks, and is the most important railway line in the Black Forest. It was built between 1863 and 1873, utilizing plans drawn up by Robert Gerwig. This line should not be confused with the W√ºrttemberg Black Forest Railway (Schwarzwaldbahn (W√ºrttemberg)), which runs between Stuttgart and Calw in Germany.  Geographical and economic significance  By cutting straight through the Black Forest, the Black Forest Railway shortened the trip between Offenburg and Singen, which had been connected by the Baden Mainline (Badische Hauptbahn), from 240 km to 150 km. The route is currently operated by a regular service of Deutsche Bahn RegionalExpress trains, using double- decker rolling stock, which allow excellent views. The trains continue southwards from Singen on the High Rhine Railway to Konstanz and across the Swiss border to Kreuzlingen, and northwards to Karlsruhe along the Rhine Valley Railway. In addition, the line is utilized by a daily Intercity between Konstanz and Hamburg-Altona. This route was also economically significant for the small communities in the southern part of the Black Forest. For many localities, which, prior to the advent of train service, were only accessible via horse-drawn carriages, this development was key to their industrialization. From the end of the 19th century, until World War I, the manufacture of clocks in the Black Forest saw its economic heyday, and this industry marks the local economy even today. Not only the residents of towns directly on the line, such as St. Georgen, Hornberg, Villingen-Schwenningen, and Donaueschingen, were beneficiaries of train service, but even Furtwangen or Schramberg, which are not far away, profited. The line is also significant in terms of tourism.  History = Planning phase  The first plans for a railway line right across the central Black Forest had been drawn up in the 1840s. However, these initial plans did not come to fruition, mainly because the technical expertise necessary to build this complex and expensive line was not yet available. Originally, the Black Forest line was intended as a feeder line to the Swiss Gotthardbahn, across the first German-Swiss border crossing near Waldshut and Koblenz. Geological issues in the Wutach Valley prevented taking a path in a southerly direction from Donaueschingen, and trains took a lengthy detour around the Swiss Canton of Schaffhausen to reach Singen, near Lake Constance, which was the ultimate destination. After settling on Offenburg as the starting point, and Singen as the destination, three variations on the line were examined: # the Bregtallinie via Furtwangen and alongside the Breg river, # the Sommeraulinie via Hornberg and Triberg # the Schiltachlinie via Wolfach, Schiltach and Schramberg. The Bregtallinie option was eliminated first, due to its expense and complexity. From an engineering perspective, it was actually the Schiltachlinie that turned out to be easiest to execute; however, because that line would have run through Schramberg, in W√ºrttemberg, and would not have been located solely in Baden, the final decision was made to utilize the Sommeraulinie. Railway engineer Robert Gerwig was tasked with the creation of the track layout plans.  Construction  Map of the most challenging section Since the central section of the line required an extended planning phase, the Baden State Railway made the decision to initially start construction on the first section, from Offenburg to Hausach, and the last section, from Engen to Singen. The work between Offenburg to Hausach turned out to be relatively uncomplicated, since the engineers were able to utilize the Kinzig valley. The only exception was the necessity to create a new river bed for the Kinzig near Gengenbach. Between Engen and Donaueschingen construction met with considerably more difficult conditions. To deal with the watershed between the Rhine and Danube rivers, the Hattinger tunnel had to be dug through the local limestone. In addition, a 240-metre section of the Danube had to be rerouted between the communities of Pfohren and Neudingen. Two options were examined to achieve the exit of the Danube valley in the direction of Hegau. One option was to leave the valley near Geisingen, the other choice was to exit near Immendingen. Gerwig chose the latter option, as it turned out to allow for less complex track construction. He chose to artificially lengthen the route with two double slings in the Gutach valley near Triberg. Due to the many tunnels on a curved alignment, the section between Hornberg and Sankt Georgen ended up being the most complicated section of the route, and was completed last. In 1870, the Franco-Prussian War markedly delayed construction, since the German construction crews were drafted for military service, and the Italian crews were let go. Work did not resume until 1871.  1866-1919 - Operations as part of Baden State Railway  The two sections Offenburg‚ÄìHausach and Engen‚ÄìSingen were opened for service in 1866, and the other parts of the line were finished in the next several years. Due to the further delays caused by the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the Black Forest Railway was not completed in its entirety until 10 November 1873. In addition, the section Singen‚ÄìKonstanz, which had been opened in 1863 as part of the Baden Mainline, was operationally linked to the Black Forest Railway. Plans were also drawn up to connect the Elz Valley Railway from Freiburg via Elzach with Hausach, but this was never realized. Engen station around 1900 Initially, there were 5 scheduled passenger trains running from Offenburg to Konstanz, and an additional 3 trains were run in the section Villingen‚ÄìKonstanz. There was also express passenger service from Konstanz to Immendingen, with this train then taking the G√§u Railway (Stuttgart‚ÄìSingen) to Stuttgart, and one express train from Offenburg to Singen. This last service took about four hours to make that trip. The section Hausach‚ÄìVillingen was expanded into a twin-track configuration by 1888. Scheduled passenger train service continually increased through the early 1900s. Additionally, freight train service also saw growth in that same period. Starting in the summer of 1906, more and more passenger express trains utilized the line, amongst them international connections such as Amsterdam‚ÄìKonstanz, Ostende‚ÄìKonstanz and Frankfurt am Main‚ÄìChur. However, these connections were soon discontinued. After the start of World War I in 1914, service was steadily decreased for the duration of the war. In the summer of 1918, just a single passenger train frequented the line. Then, on 24 May 1918, a munitions train exploded near Triberg.  1919-1945 - Operations as part of the Deutsche Reichsbahn  The sections Offenburg‚ÄìHausach and Villingen‚ÄìSingen were expanded into twin track lines by November 1921, which was made possible by the fact that the rail beds of the entire Black Forest Railway had been laid out to accommodate two tracks. Starting in 1922, the Prussian Class P 8 steam locomotive saw service on the route. Offenburg station Singen station, the terminus of the Black Forest railway On 4 February 1923, French troops occupied the towns of Appenweier and Offenburg, which meant that the slow passenger trains (Bummelzug) were forced to start and end their runs in the community of Ortenberg, just south of Offenburg. Only one express passenger train, traveling between Hausach and Konstanz, utilized the line at the time. All the usual through traffic on the Black Forest Railway had to be rerouted in complicated fashion. Only on 11 December 1923, when Appenweier und Offenburg were liberated, did regular service to Offenburg, and limited service further north, resume. Starting in 1924, the old Hornberg viaduct across the Reichenbach valley was replaced by a new arched bridge to increase the capacity of the route. At the end of October 1925, after 17 months of construction, the new bridge was put into service. Also in 1925 (some sources quote 1931), the 31-metre-long Kaisertunnel was excavated and removed. On 22 April 1945, service had to be halted when a pillar of the viaduct suffered collateral war damage. The damage was repaired just a few weeks after the end of the war, and the Black Forest Railway was operational again on 30 June 1945.  1945-1994 - Operations as part of the Deutsche Bundesbahn  Rail buses were seen on the Black Forest Railway for the first time in the summer of 1955, and the following year marked the first service of diesel locomotives on the line. Diesel locomotives of the type DB Class V 200 replaced the last steam locomotives, particularly of the type DRG Class 39 (former Prussian P 10). At the start of the 1970s it was decided to electrify the line, in order to make the Black Forest Railway yet more flexible and economically attractive, and on 25 September 1977, the entire line was switched to full electrical operation. The work to electrify the line had been more complex than anticipated, particularly in the many tunnels, as the rail beds had to be lowered in those instances. Several unprofitable railway stations and other halts were also taken out of service at the time. It is also worth noting that, due to the many sections with steep inclines, locomotives of the type DB Class 139, with rheostatic brakes, were prominently seen in service. 1989 saw the beginning of a new chapter in rail service in the Black Forest: The Deutsche Bundesbahn celebrated the creation of a new train type, called InterRegio (IR), with the introduction of new service from Konstanz via Offenburg, Karlsruhe, Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main to Kassel. These InterRegio trains ran every other hour, alternating on the hour with a Regional-Express (RE) train from Konstanz to Offenburg. InterRegio connections to Berlin, Hamburg, L√ºbeck, and Stralsund were offered starting in the mid-1990s. 1994 until today - Operations as part of the Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) The Ortenau S-Bahn near Halbmeil The privatization of the Bundesbahn also affected the Black Forest Railway. The rail transport reform program enabled private rail transport companies to gain access to the network of the DB AG, and with it access to the Black Forest Railway. Starting on 24 May 1998, trains of the Ortenau-S-Bahn provided service between Offenburg und Hausach. This service is now available hourly from Offenburg, via Hausach, then onto the Kinzig Valley Railway to Freudenstadt. Concurrently, trains of the Swiss company Mittelthurgaubahn travelled between Engen and Konstanz, which connected via Konstanz into Switzerland. In 2001, a new halt was constructed at the Offenburg regional vocational school on behalf of the Ortenau S-Bahn. With the new schedule of 2001, and with the exception of two trains, the InterRegio service was replaced by the new Interregio-Express (IRE) trains going from Karlsruhe to Konstanz. The service provided by the RegioExpress trains was also extended to Karlsruhe. At the end of 2002, the two remaining IR trains were converted into Intercity (IC) trains, and the IR train type was discontinued. The Ringzug at its halt in Donaueschingen Mitte/Siedlung Since 2003, sections of the line between Donaueschingen and Villingen, and, since 2004, sections between the Wutach Valley Railway branching near Hintschingen, and Immendingen, are utilized by the Ringzug ('circle train') system of the districts Tuttlingen, Rottweil and Schwarzwald- Baar. For this purpose, several unused halts were reactivated, and new halts were created. Invitations to bid on providing local rail service between Karlsruhe and Konstanz were issued in 2003 across Europe by the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. In 2004, the DB Schwarzwaldbahn GmbH, a subsidiary of DB AG, which became part of DB Regio AG before ever starting service, won the contract over two other bidders. A DBAG Class 146 in Singen Starting on 10 December 2006, trains consisting of locomotives of the type DBAG Class 146, and modern double-decker passenger cars with the name \\"Schwarzwaldbahn\\" printed on them, are providing comfortable service with air conditioning and suspension seats. Passenger counts rose by 30% within a year of starting this service. The InterCity service 2370/2371, dubbed \\"Schwarzwald\\", going from Hamburg to Konstanz, and from Konstanz to Hamburg and Stralsund, still makes this trip daily in parallel with the RegioExpress trains, and replaces that service on the route between Offenburg and Konstanz. On weekends, an additional IC train with numbers 2004 and 2006/2005, dubbed \\"Bodensee\\", connects Konstanz with Dortmund, Emden, and Norddeich. Freight traffic is of only secondary significance. In the route table of the DB, the Black Forest Railway is listed under the number 720.  Route details = Geography  Between Offenburg and Hausach, the Black Forest Railway follows the river Kinzig, and runs right next to it near Gengenbach. The section between Offenburg and Gengenbach is flanked by expansive vineyards, which slowly dwindle away as the Kinzig Valley narrows. The line then runs through the Gutach valley to Hornberg. From Hornberg to Sankt Georgen, the route must negotiate numerous loops, many through tunnels, and transcends several hundred metres in altitude in the process. This section is clearly visible from a lookout point near Triberg. After passing through Sankt Georgen, the route continues alongside the river Brigach. After Villingen, the route starts to leave the Black Forest behind, and crosses the Baar lowlands. In Donaueschingen, the Black Forest Railway meets up with the H√∂llental Railway, which is second only to the Black Forest Railway in significance in terms of railways in the area. The route then parallels the Danube river, which is formed by the confluence of the Brigach and Breg rivers, until it reaches Immedingen. The entire route crosses through four districts of the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg: From Offenburg to Hausach it starts in the Ortenaukreis, and crosses the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis between Triberg and Donaueschingen. Kreis Tuttlingen is traversed between Geisingen and Immendingen, and the final part of the line ends up in Kreis Konstanz.  Technical characteristics  The Black Forest Railway was the first mountain railway to use hair-pin loops, which artificially lengthened the line, but allowed for the grade to stay under 20 per mille at any point. Without this solution, the construction of part of the line as a rack and pinion railway, like the Murg Valley Railway or the H√∂llental Railway, would have been necessary. Between Hausach and Sankt Georgen, the railway ascends a total of 564 metres. The two towns are separated by only 21 kilometres in a straight line; the railway traverses 38 kilometres to make the trip. As mentioned before, the line had to be constructed with the limitation that it could not leave the territory of the Grand Duchy of Baden. Building the line via the town of Schramberg, in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, would have made construction much less expensive and complex. However, this would have meant that Baden would have had to share control over the strategically important line with another state, and the clock-making industry in Schramberg would have gained an important advantage in their competition with the same industry in Furtwangen in Baden. The viaduct in Hornberg The route passes through numerous tunnels (37 alone in the section between Hausach and Sankt Georgen), but only travels across one large viaduct, in Hornberg. On its way from north to south, the line passes under the main European watershed twice, once via the Sommerau tunnel between Triberg and Sankt Georgen, which is 1,697 metres long, and then via the Hatting tunnel, between Engen and Immendingen, which is 900 metres in length. Also worth mentioning is the control and safety technology on display on the Black Forest Railway. Three different signal box types are in use: The mechanical type near Villingen, relay-controlled signal boxes near Triberg, and electronic examples near Immendingen.  Model railway  A part of the Black Forest Railway has been reconstructed, using pictures and actual construction plans, as a model railway in HO scale, in the town of Hausach. With 1,600 metres of track, 1.8 metres from highest to lowest elevation, and an area of 400 square metres, it is the largest model railway project in Europe that replicates an actual railway line.

In 1915, it participated in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive. In October 1915, it was transferred to the Western Front. In 1916, it fought in the Battle of the Somme. In 1917, it participated in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele. In 1918, the division fought against various Allied offensives and counteroffensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive. Allied intelligence rated the division as a mediocre division and considered it second class by 1918, mainly due to the losses it had suffered in the war's earlier battles.35\\\\.

The current design was commissioned in 1925, when a bill was passed that the flag would have the Nebraska state seal in gold and silver on a field of national blue. History The seal is the same seal as originally designed in 1867; however, there were bills introduced to change the seal. The most spoken about attempted change of the state seal was created by the architect of the Nebraska State Capitol, Bertram Goodhue, but it failed to pass the legislature. The official designation of the design as the state flag occurred in 1963; Nebraska was one of the last states to adopt an official flag.Nebraska Secretary of State, Flag The Nebraskan flag was rated in a survey by the North American Vexillological Association as the second- worst of 72 U.S. and Canadian flags. The worst-ranked flag at the time, the flag of Georgia, has since been changed. In 2002, the Nebraska Legislature's Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee discussed a bill to create a commission for suggesting new designs to the Legislature. The flag was not changed. In 2017, State Senator Burke Harr proposed a task force charged with redesigning the flag, citing the fact that the flag had flown upside down at the capitol for 10 days with no one noticing. Harr wished for the redesign to come through by the State's 150th anniversary. The State Senate committee declined to take action.

It is also celebrated in the Faroe Islands, where it is called D√Ωri bi√∞idagur, and in Greenland (). Overview Store bededag is a collection of minor Christian holy days consolidated into one day. The day was introduced in the Church of Denmark in 1686 by King Christian V as a consolidation of several minor (or local) Roman Catholic holidays that had survived the Reformation of the national church. Store bededag is a statutory holiday in Denmark. It was one of the few holidays that survived in the great holiday reform that was carried out in 1771 during the reign of Christian VII, when his Prime Minister, Count Johann Friedrich von Struensee, was in power. The day was introduced as a more efficient alternative to individually celebrating a number of holidays honoring various minor saints in the Spring. It was not, however, Struensee who had come up with the idea of this particular reform, as the church commission which had worked on it had been instituted several years before Struensee arrived at the Danish court. Bells in every church announce the eve of store bededag. There are very few traditions associated with store bededag. Formerly, citizens and students of Copenhagen strolled the city ramparts on the evening before the holiday; the students of Copenhagen University did this to honour the many students who had died defending Copenhagen during the assault on Copenhagen. In the evening before the holiday, it was customary to buy and eat varme hveder, a traditional bread, because bakers were closed on holidays and people bought bread for the following day. Today, the city ramparts are gone and instead the tradition is to walk along Langelinie on Copenhagen's waterfront or on the fortification of Kastellet, though only few follow this tradition depending on the spring weather. It is more common, also outside Copenhagen, to still buy and eat varme hveder. This and Kristi Himmelfartsdag (Ascension Thursday) are the only two days, other than Saturdays and Sundays, on which confirmations take place, for confirmation is part of regular church services. The earliest possible day is April 17 (if Easter falls on March 22), the latest possible day is May 21 (if Easter falls on April 25).

Cast Extensive changes occurred before the start of the season. Nora Dunn and Jon Lovitz were both dropped from the show. Following her boycott of the episode hosted by Andrew Dice Clay the previous season, Dunn was not in good standing with Lorne Michaels. Dunn's initial five-year contract expired at the end of the previous season, but Michaels chose not to extend it due to the boycott controversy. Before the season began, Lovitz requested time off so he could film Mom and Dad Save the World, which would cause him to miss the first several episodes of the season. Michaels refused, because he did not view this to be fair to the other cast members. Lovitz subsequently quit. However, he made several cameo appearances throughout the 16th season. With Dunn and Lovitz gone, Michaels was put in an unusual situation. Most of the cast had been on the show for five seasons. He did not want to be put in the spot of having to replace the entire cast all at once (and to avoid repeating Jean Doumanian's mistake‚Äîand his previous mistake in the case of the season 11 cast‚Äîof hiring a cast of new, inexperienced cast members with little to no comedic chemistry). Instead, he promoted writers Rob Schneider and David Spade to the cast and hired Chris Farley, Chris Rock and Julia Sweeney. He later hired Tim Meadows and Adam Sandler to the cast mid- season. Starting with this season, the cast was divided into three groups. A middle group was created, and this new category would be introduced with the word \\"with,\\" following the introduction of the repertory players. The first cast members added to the new group were Farley and Rock, with Meadows and Sweeney added mid-season. This season would also be the final season for A. Whitney Brown, Jan Hooks and Dennis Miller. Hooks left on her own terms at the end of the season, and Brown left the show mid-season to move on to other acting opportunities. Miller, who also departed at the end of the season, was at the time the longest running anchor of Weekend Update, having done the job for six full seasons, until Seth Meyers breaks the record in season 38. However, Miller still holds the record as the longest solo anchor of Weekend Update as Meyers was paired with Amy Poehler in his first three seasons on Weekend Update and Cecily Strong in his final season on the show. Phil Hartman was also planning on leaving the show, but NBC convinced Hartman to stay on for a few more seasons by promising him his own comedy show, which was later scrapped or never came to fruition.

She served in the dangerous North Atlantic Ocean, delivering animals, such as horses and steers on-the-hoof, to American Expeditionary Force troops in Europe.  Acquiring an enemy's ship  The first Rappahannock (Id. No. 1854) was launched in 1913 as SS Pommern by the Bremer-Vulcan yards, Vegesack, Germany, for the North German Lloyd Line. She was the third freighter of the Rheinland-Class built for the company's Australia freight service line via the Cape of Good Hope. SS Pommern was voluntarily interned in Honolulu after the outbreak of World War I in Europe and was seized when the United States entered the war. She was then assigned to the US Navy by the U.S. Shipping Board; converted; delivered to the Navy 7 December 1917; renamed Rappahannock; and commissioned 8 December 1917.  Horses and steers for U.S. troops in Europe  Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service as an animal transport, Rappahannock completed her fourth transatlantic run to France on 16 November 1918, 5 days after the Armistice.  Post-World War I operations  Remaining in NOTS until transferred to Train, Atlantic Fleet, on 4 February 1919, she completed one more round-trip from New York to Europe before being assigned temporary reserve status at Portsmouth in the summer of 1919. She was returned to active status in June 1922 with the designation AF-6 and, for the next 2¬Ω years, carried cargo for both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets.  Final decommissioning and World War II service  Rappahannock decommissioned 10 December 1924 and remained in reserve at Mare Island until struck from the Navy list 19 July 1933.

It has a strong, distinctive flavor and is often said to be an acquired taste, as it has a combination of sweet, sour, and salty taste. It has also been described as tart and even tangy. Originally from Guangdong Province, the name \\"li hing mui\\" means \\"traveling plum\\". \\"Li hing\\" is \\"traveling\\" and \\"mui\\" is \\"plum\\" in Cantonese.http://www.definitions.net/definition/li+hing+mui  Powder  Li hing mui powder is made of ground plum skin that has previously been pickled in a combination of licorice, red food coloring, salt, sugar, and occasionally aspartame and or saccharine. It can be used as a flavoring, usually sprinkled on candy and other fruits, notably pineapples, mangoes, guavas and apples. In the United States, Li hing mui powder can be found in Hawaii, where local children like to put it on sour gummy bears, sour gummy worms, sour watermelon candy, sour patch kids, shave ice, sour apple candy, rock candy, popcorn, fruit, and arare (also known as kakimochi and mochi crunch).http://www.marinahawaiivacations.com/blog/honolulu-dining/the-history- of-li-hing-mui.aspx  Alcoholic beverages  Recently, people have also been putting li hing powder into their alcoholic drinks‚Äîmainly tequila and cocktails. Many bars in Hawaii replace salt with this powder, since this powder is not only salty, but sweet and sour as well. Other people also feel that it gives a tart and sometimes tangy twist. Many bars in Hawaii also rim their glasses with li hing powder in addition to putting it in the drink. Besides li hing powder, the whole li hing mui (red plum seed) is added directly to a bottle of tequila, filling the bottle at least half way with the plum seeds. After a few weeks, the li hing plums will impart its reddish color and flavor to the tequila. And when you try to eat one of the plum seeds after you take them out, you'll find that its flavor has gone entirely into the tequila. Note that li hing powder is used on different plum varieties, and it comes in different colors. The \\"red\\" powder is popular on fruits and assorted red plum varieties. A \\"white\\" powder version is more commonly used on dried/dehydrated plums. In China, huamei are often found in bottles of rice wine, like olives in a martini. In the United States It was made popular in Hawaii by Yee Sheong, who in early 1900 began importing li hing mui and various other preserved fruits, such as crack seed snacks, from China to Hawaii. Yee thus started the li hing mui craze, which flourished with the company he founded, Yick Lung. Li hing mui can be found in Hawaiian and Asian markets.http://www.tastinghawaii.com/2012/12/li-hing-mui-traveling- plum.html?m=1 In the 70's, a popular gift for Hawaiian kids were the Yick Lung crack seed leis.

He later moved to Waterfoot, Rossendale in Lancashire and attended Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School from 1936. Upon leaving school in 1946, he moved to London to train as a teacher for two years. He returned to Lancashire to take up his teaching career, briefly, in Bacup. After an 18-month spell of compulsory National Service, he taught in Bury from 1950 to 1955, then returned to teach in Bacup until 1960, and subsequently moved to a post in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, until his re- location to Leicester in 1966.

He was the lead singer of the beat group, Liverpool Five. Career Laine started music playing washboard in a skiffle group the Streamliners, and was later lead singer with the Zodiacs. His first recording, as a semi professional, was with an unnamed group including Dave Sampson. On that unreleased recording Laine sang \\"Great Balls of Fire\\", Sampson sang \\"Dream Lover\\" and together they sang \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" and \\"Shakin' All Over\\". Later,in the early 1960s, Laine concentrated on playing rhythm and blues, and he formed the Steve Laine Combo and went professional. In addition to Laine usually singing lead, the band comprised Ken Cox on guitar, Dave Burgess on bass, Ron Henley on keyboards and saxophone and Jimmy May on drums. Many of their songs featured all five singing. The Steve Laine Combo played clubs such as the Flamingo in Soho and caught the eye of the owners Rik and Johnny Gunnell. On a tour of Germany arranged by the Gunnells in early 1964, the band was signed to a management contract by German impresario Karl Buchmann, who included them in a package tour of the largest venues in Germany and Austria. Following that tour, at Buchmann's suggestion, the group changed its name to The Liverpool Five, to capitalize on the international popularity of The Beatles. Prior to leaving Germany, the band recorded an album on CBS Records for European release titled Tokio International. The group then flew to Japan as the official rock and roll representatives at the 1964 Summer Olympics, playing the Korakuen Arena in Tokyo. Following their tour of the Far East (the first English R&R; band to do so) The Liverpool Five traveled to the United States in March 1965. Originally based in Spokane, Washington and later in Los Angeles, the group became resident aliens and spent the next three years touring the United States, releasing a number of singles and two albums on RCA Victor. Their stage performances were legendary but they broke up in 1968 shortly after Burgess left and was replaced for a short time by Fred Dennis, later of the Sonics. Drummer Jimmy May returned to England, but Laine and the other three remained in the United States and embarked on new careers in various professions.

The series was on SAB TV from 30 April 2007 to 17 January 2008.  Plot  The show is based on the love story of Akash and Shruti. Their egos clash and battles are fought. What begins as an innocent boy meets girl romance soon turns into a drawn-out fight for power and love. Personalities clash, egos are tested and relationships strained, all owing to this love affair. Welcome to the world of thought-provoking love and war, welcome to the lives of Akash and Shruti. It's a star-crossed violent love story in the Romeo-Juliet mode, set in contemporary Delhi. Akash is the typical brooding hero, perhaps carrying the burden of the upheaval in the lives of his parents ACP Rohit Sehgal and Ritu who are separated. From being a talented student once, he has slipped to being a backbencher and a goon. Yet his rugged charm attracts the girls, especially his cute junior in college, Shruti. They fall in love and all hell breaks loose on Akash. Shruti's uncle, a local don and politician who had once been sent to jail by Rohit and her brother Kunaal, head of a rival gang in college are always at loggerheads with Akash. The lovers elope, but Akash is hunted down and shot. As he lies fighting for his life in the hospital, the story takes off, oscillating between the present and the past, told through flashbacks. Shruti falls in love with Akash at first sight. Akash begins to take a like for her, but doesn't believe in relationships as at a young age he saw his parents relationship break. Shruti who is heart broken, takes a friend's advice and decides to make Akash jealous. Shruti starts spending time with Dev, one of Akash's best friends. The plan works and Akash gets jealous and eventually they get together. Dev too falls for Shruti, but decides to move on. Shruti and Akash want to get married, so Shruti tells her uncle about him, but he refuses. Her uncle plans to get her married to someone else, so Akash and Shruti decide to run. Kunaal tries to stop Akash and Bhatti, when Kunaal is accidentally shot and he dies. Police are trying to catch Akash and Bhatti and they are on the run. Eventually even Shruti runs away with Akash and they are together. Akash and Shruti plan to get married, but Akash is shot by the police. He is taken to hospital. Eventually Akash is caught and among the many charges comes the charge of killing Kunnal. Eventually the court proceedings prove that Kunaal's death was an accident and no one was at fault. But Akash and Bhatti are sentenced to 5 years in jail for the crimes they committed while on the run from the police. Meanwhile Shruti waits for her (now husband) Akash. She becomes pregnant with Akash's child and has a baby girl named Aarushi. Shruti is helped by Dev. Five years later Akash and Bhatti are released from jail. Misunderstandings happen between Shruti and Akash, but they solve it. At one point, Bhatti finds out everything that all of this had been planned by Dev; he shot Kunaal so he could blame the murder on Akash and send him to jail and get his love Shruti. Dev pleads Bhatti to side with him but when he refuses kills him with the same handgun used to kill Kunaal. Dev creates misunderstandings between Akash and Shruti. He gets Akash alone, then tries to kill him when Shruti and the police come there. Shruti tries to stop him, but he points the gun at her, she closes her eyes, and Dev is heartbroken seeing that Shruti thought he would shoother and also that she wouldn't ever love him. A bullet is shot. Dev shoots and kills himself. The scene ends with Akash and Dev lying on both sides of Shruti.  Cast  *Mishal Raheja ... Akash Sehgal *Payel Sarkar ...

The village consists of about 50 houses, a pub, and a small industrial estate. Origins of the name Bowden Hill was historically called 'Bowdon Hill' according to early maps.Wiltshire Community History - maps of Lacock and surrounding area There are a number of theories around why the village got its name. One reason is that the name comes from the old English words 'bow', meaning bow shaped, and 'dun' meaning hill. However, alternative theories suggest the name comes from a corruption of 'bdl' (meaning dwelling) into 'bow' meaning 'hill slope on which are dwellings'. Another theory from 'Wiltshire Collections' by Aubrey and Jackson suggests that the name means 'the winding hill'.Notes on Wiltshire names Location Bowden Hill sits on the side of a hill and rises up from the River Avon, at an elevation of 50m, to its peak at 172m above sea level. The village has views to the south and south-west of the river's flood plain and is surrounded by a mixture of woodlands and agricultural land. Bowden Hill borrows many of its facilities from the nearby village of Lacock and doesn't provide amenities such as a school or post office. The village encompasses the small hamlet of Bewley Common and enjoys a relatively sparse population density due to its designation as a conservation area.Bowden Hill conservation area Landmarks=Parish church Church of St. Anne In 1856, John Gladstone, owner of Bowden Park, had the Church of England parish church of Saint Anne built to celebrate the birth of a son in the Gladstone family. The architect was S.B. Gabriel of Bristol who designed the nave and chancel in the Early English Gothic style but gave the northeast tower Norman details and a German Romanesque roof. The parish of Lacock was split and the new parish of Bowden Hill served around 300-400 people, but the two parishes were reunited in 1958.Wiltshire Community History page about St Anne's Church Today services are held at St. Anne's on the first Sunday of each month. Conduit House Sitting in the common land in the village is a small building which was used as a supply of water for the nearby Lacock Abbey. Built in the 16th century, this small 3.7m square building still supplies water to the abbey albeit through a modern water pipe. The original conduit house was built in around 1280 when Willian Bluet of Bewley Court granted Beatrice, Abbess of Lacock, the right to operate a watercourse on his land to serve the nunnery. This original building was replaced by the owner of the abbey, William Sharington, after its dissolution. The new building is built of limestone and has a steep roof, reaching 4.64m high, constructed of interlocking stone slabs.Wiltshire and Swindon Sites and Monument Record Information Bowden Park Bowden Park, obscured by trees One of largest landmarks in Bowden Hill is the Bowden Park estate with its country house of 1796, designed by James Wyatt. The estate is shrouded by the slope of the hill as well as much of the surrounding woodland. The house was bought in 1849 and extended by Captain John Gladstone, older brother of Prime Minister William Gladstone. In the 20th century it was the seat of the former chairman of the General Electric Company, Arnold Weinstock. The house was designated as Grade I listed in 1960. Spye Park Spye Park lies on the edge of Bowden Hill to the southeast of the village. Although most of Spye Park is in Bromham parish, the gatelodge at its northwest entrance (originally a 16th-century building) stands on the edge of Bowden Hill village.
