It is based on a structural decomposition of a system into containers and components and relies on existing modelling techniques such as the Unified Modelling Language (UML) or Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD) for the more detailed decomposition of the architectural building blocks.  History  C4 model was created by the software architect Simon Brown between 2006 and 2011 on the roots of Unified Modelling Language (UML) and the 4+1 architectural view model. The launch of an official website under a creative common license and an article published in 2018 popularised the emerging technique.  Overview  C4 model documents the architecture of a software system, by showing multiple point of views that explain the decomposition of a system into containers and components, the relationship between these elements, and, where appropriate, the relation with its users. The viewpoints are organized according to their hierarchical level: * Context diagrams (level 1): they show the system in scope and its relationship with users and other systems; * Container diagrams (level 2): they decompose a system into interrelated containers. A container is an executable and deployable sub- system; * Component diagrams (level 3): they decompose containers into interrelated components, and relate the components to other containers or other systems; * Code diagrams (level 4): they provide additional details about the design of the architectural elements that can be mapped to code. C4 model relies at this level on existing notations such as Unified Modelling Language (UML), Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD) or diagrams generated by Integrated Development Environments (IDE). For level 1 to 3, the C4 model use 5 basic diagramming elements: persons, software systems, containers, components and relationships. The technique is not prescriptive for the layout, shape, colour and style of these elements. Instead, C4 model recommends to use simple diagrams based on nested boxes in order to facilitate interactive collaborative drawing. The technique also promotes good modelling practices such as providing on every diagram a title and a legend, and clear unambiguous labelling in order to facilitate the understanding by the intended audience. C4 model facilitates collaborative visual architecting and evolutionary architecture in the context of agile teams where more formal documentation methods and up-front architectural design are not desired.

Three denominations were issued: 1d, 6d and 1/-, and in 1888 the 1d value was reissued with a different watermark. In 1888, the 1d rose postage stamp was also issued with a locally produced Revenue overprint.

Obliviousness is the mental state of being oblivious, generally understood to mean \\"a state of being unmindful or unaware of something, of being ignorant or not conscious of its existence\\".Paul C. Rosenblatt, Shared Obliviousness in Family Systems (2009), p. 1. Obliviousness differs from unconsciousness in that the oblivious person is conscious, and could or should be aware of the things of which they remain unaware. A state of obliviousness may be intentionally sought by those wishing to avoid acknowledging or dealing with surrounding realities. In fiction and literature, obliviousness is often used for comedic effect. Overview Obliviousness may be described as going beyond a mere lack of some level of awareness, and becoming an act of repression of an awareness that should exist.Krzysztof Michalsk, Human Nature and the Nature of Time: A Nietzschean Metaphor and Its Consequences, in Robert S. Cohen, A.I. Tauber, Philosophies of Nature: The Human Dimension: In Celebration of Erazim Koh√°k (2013), p. 111. Although an unconscious person may similarly be unaware of things around them, obliviousness \\"implies not a cessation of all attention but only that directed outwardly\\", with the oblivious person's attention being \\"directed inwardly‚Äîto thoughts, feelings, imaginings, fantasies, worries or bodily states which have nothing or little to do with the world at hand\\".David Seamon, A Geography of the Lifeworld: Movement, Rest, and Encounter (1979), p. 104-5. Obliviousness \\"extends to activities, especially those involving drudgery or repetition\\", for which \\"[p]eople may actually encourage a state of obliviousness as they work\\". It is \\"sometimes associated with positive inner states\\", but \\"more often occurs in situations of sickness, hurry or negativity\\". It has been suggested that when individuals exhibit an absence of concern about what others think of them, this \\"could be due either to their obliviousness to social concerns or to their desire to create the image, in their own minds and for others, of being autonomous and independent individuals\\".Barry R. Schlenker and Michael F. Weigold, \\"Interpersonal Processes Involving Impression Regulation and Management\\", Annual Review of Psychology, Vol. 43 (1992), p. 157-158. In some contexts, obliviousness to problems serves as a defense mechanism against the need to engage in efforts to change those problems. For example, members of a majority group may be oblivious to discrimination and related struggles faced by members of a minority with whom they regularly interact. Remaining oblivious relieves the majority group members of a sense of responsibility for the problems of the minority group.Kecia M. Thomas, Diversity Resistance in Organizations (2008), p. 254. In popular culture In fiction, obliviousness is commonly exploited for comedic value, and the characteristic has been described as \\"tailor-made for comic plotting; no sooner does 'reality' assert itself than a recovery commences\\".Theodore B. Leinwand, Theatre, Finance and Society in Early Modern England (1999), p. 56. The characteristic is identified as one of the key traits of the \\"lovable loser\\" character archetype, typified by the behavior of such characters in describing plans or pursuing dreams that objective observers immediately realize are futile, a fact to which the loser remains oblivious.Scott Sedita, The Eight Characters of Comedy: A Guide to Sitcom Acting and Writing (2014), p. 74.

History After the development of HEMU-430X, Hyundai-Rotem and Korail signed an agreement in December 2016 for supplying high speed trains that are electric multiple units, the first of its kind in South Korea in commercial service (the HEMU-430X is also an electric multiple unit, but it is not for service and mass production). The order was for two variants: 2 eight-car EMU-320 units (with an operating speed of 320 km/h) and 19 six-car EMU-250 units, to be delivered around 2020‚Äì2021. In September 2016, Korail held a contest for the public to decide the design of the new models. In 2017, a mockup of the chosen design was exhibited to the public to promote the sister train (EMU-250) and receive feedback. Design Technology incorporated in these trains is dereived from the experimental HEMU-430X train previously tested by Korail. The EMU-320 will feature the same design as EMU-250 trains , however the formation will consists of eight cars as suppose to six cars. Unlike KTX trains, the EMU-320 uses distributed traction with driving trailers at each end and six powered intermediate cars as suppose to traction heads configuration. The train can accelerate from 0 to 300 km/h (0 to 186 mph) in 230 seconds, in contrast to 316 seconds for the KTX-Sancheon. Interior Unlike KTX trains, the seats on EMU-320 features more leg room, wider armrests, USB ports, wireless charging pads, and entertainment display similar to the inflight entertainment system found on aircraft. In addition, every seats are aligned with the window.

The ship was never officially named and is referred to by historians by the name of the city in which she was built. Wilmington was still under construction during the February 1865 Battle of Wilmington and was destroyed to prevent her capture by Union troops after their victory. Background and description Original plan of CSS Wilmington, June 1864 Wilmington was designed by the Chief Naval Constructor, John L. Porter, as a replacement for the rotten ironclad CSS North Carolina and the wrecked ironclad CSS Raleigh for the defenses of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina in 1864. Unlike those ships, Wilmington may have been designed to force engagements on the Union blockaders as her sleek lines and powerful propulsion machinery suggest something more than a defensive role.Bisbee, pp. 179‚Äì180 The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . Her depth of hold was , but no tonnage or displacement figures are available as Wilmington was destroyed before she could be launched. The ship was fitted with two small pilot houses, one each fore and aft of the casemates, that were shaped like truncated pyramids.Bisbee, p. 179 She was powered by a pair of high-pressure horizontal single-cylinder direct- acting steam engines that had a bore and a stroke. Each engine drove an propeller via and gears, using steam provided by four tubular boilers. The propellers were connected by an idler shaft which prevented them from rotating at different speeds, which would have significantly inhibited the ship's maneuverability. All of the propulsion machinery was built by the Columbus Naval Iron Works in Columbus, Georgia, but had not been delivered before Wilmington was destroyed.Bisbee, pp. 13‚Äì14, 16, 18‚Äì19, 179‚Äì180 The ship's main battery consisted of two guns of an unknown type on pivot mounts,Silverstone, p. 154 each of which was housed in a small octagonal casemate. Each casemate had seven gun ports.Canney, p. 72 The thickness of Wilmingtons wrought-iron armor is unknown. Construction and fate Porter visited Wilmington at the direction of Stephen Mallory, the Confederate States Secretary of the Navy, in late May 1864 after the first two ironclads built at Wilmington were lost or became ineffective; Raleigh was ran aground and was wrecked on the sandbar at the mouth of the Cape Fear River on 7 May and North Carolina due to the green wood of her hull rotting and attacks by shipworms.Canney, pp. 44‚Äì45 Porter produced his design for Wilmington shortly afterwards and the ship was laid down at the Berry Brothers shipyard on Eagles Island across the river from the city. Although she reportedly used armor salvaged from the two earlier ironclads, Wilmington was still on the stocks when the Union captured the city on 22 February 1865. She was burned by the retreating Confederate troops to prevent her capture.

It operated on the Teruel, Levante and Estremadura fronts.  History  The unit was created in March 1937 from the militarization of the Torres-Benedito and Iberia columns. Among the militiamen there came to be some internal reluctance to the militarization, which took effect more slowly than expected. The brigade, which was assigned to the 39th Division, came under the initial command of Rafael Trigueros S√°nchez-Rojas. Shortly after Trigueros would be replaced by Francisco Fay√≥s Casarico. In June 1937 the 81st MB was assigned as a reserve unit of the 13th Army Corps and sent to the rear, at Segorbe. A month later, it took part in the failed Battle of Albarrac√≠n, the 81st lead a rout, having to be disarmed by the 24th Division that had come to relieve it. Later it would be assigned to the 64th Division. In December 1937 the unit took part in the Battle of Teruel, participating in the first movements of the republican offensive. The 81st MB was sent to the Campillo sector, where the unit carried out some looting actions. On December 30, nationalists attacked the positions manned by the 16th Mixed Brigade, which fell back and dragged the 81st MB into its withdrawal. The 81st Brigade suffered serious casualties, including that of its commander - Commander Fay√≥s, who was taken prisoner by the nationalists. After being subjected to a reorganization by its new boss - Elisardo Mart√≠nez S√°nchez - the unit took part in the capture of Teruel. After the fighting in Teruel, the unit was incorporated into the Northern Coastal Defense Grouping. The unit remained deployed in Catalunya until May 17, 1938, when it was transported by boat to the coastal sector of Castell√≥n de la Plana ‚Äîas the republican zone had been cut in two in mid-April. The 81st MB was sent as reinforcement to this area, although it would not participate in the Levante Offensive. On July 22, the 81st MB moved to the Extremadura front, where it joined the 10th Division, and then moved on to the Z√∫jar Division in the Almorch√≥n sector. After the Battle of Merida pocket, the brigade was incorporated into the 41st Division of the 7th Army Corps. The unit remained on this front during the rest of the war, without actually taking part in relevant military operations.

There are roots in the early desert teachers, mystics and Celtic Christianity. It acknowledges the teaching of Jesus which was influenced by natural theology. Forest Church is primarily a UK expression of Christianity, although there are groups forming worldwide. There are around 40 groups currently (2020) with new groups forming.  Description  Forest Church began in 2012, based on an idea shared by Bruce Stanley and Paul Cudby, later developed with Steve Hollinghurst, David Cole and Matt Arnold. Forest Church is the name taken by loosely gathered groups of like-minded people who are not formally connected to any denomination. They are people who wish to engage with the way in which God reveals God‚Äôs self in the natural world. The meetings use open, poetic language to provide a safe and welcoming place for those of any faith or none who appreciate the spirituality of ‚ÄòThe Green‚Äô. It is described as a ‚Äúmulti-faceted eco-systemEve, A. \\"The Sacred Circle:Elements of Ritual\\" in Stanley, B. and Hollinghurst, S. \\"Earthed: Christian Perspectives on Nature Connection\\" Mystic Christ Press, 2014‚Äù that has many different expressions depending on the group. Paul Cudby describes Forest Church as for people ‚Äúdesiring a Christ-centred path and the joy of spiritual engagement in the natural world, whilst finding church to be spiritually dry, cold and/or dogmatic‚ÄùCudby, P. \\"The Shaken Path\\" Christian Alternative, 2017. Many of those who attend do so because worshipping within the stone walls of a church provides them with little or no connection with God. Forest Church recognises this and therefore meets outside to celebrate the possibilities of our understanding of panentheistic (God-in-all-things and All-things-in-God) engagement and relationship. They recognise that many of those who have left the church departed because of poor treatment by Christians or because of a severe lack of space for spiritual exploration, not because of the person of Jesus. Many of those who look to Forest Church or similar spiritual paths are seeking healing from the wounds inflicted by previous church experiences. Frequently, their spiritual choices face conflict and confusion from those with more conservative attitudes, which have led to rejection or hostility from members of their churches. One aspect of Forest Church is therefore to provide a space for re-engagement with the person of Christ amongst other spiritual seekers, trusting God that a relationship mediated through the Holy Spirit, by whatever name the Spirit is known to the individual, may be holy and transformative. Forest Church is about experiencing the presence of the Holy Spirit within the natural world, encountering the divine within every living thing and every aspect of the natural world. With traditional church, we ask, what are we doing here, inside these walls, away from all that God created for us?Marshall, S. \\"Nature is My Church\\" in Stanley, B. and Hollinghurst, S. \\"Earthed: Christian Perspectives on Nature Connection\\" Mystic Christ Press, 2014 Bruce Stanley describes it as ‚Äúlearn, worship, meditate, pray and practise with tree, beside the creek, along the shore ‚Äù.Stanley, B. \\"Forest Church\\", Mystic Christ Press, 2013 He emphasises that Forest Church is about interacting with the ‚ÄúSecond Book of God‚Äù: Creation itself. Their part in Missio Dei (‚ÄòThe Mission of God‚Äô) is relationship and respect: friendship with no ulterior motive, and an openness and willingness to journey together as valued friends who learn from each other and honour the different paths they may tread. They count themselves as spiritual explorers in the Christian tradition making creative use of liturgy that expresses this belief.  Theologies  There is not, as yet, any formal theology of Forest Church as the movement is still very young. It is rooted in panentheistic theology of a God who is both immanent and transcendent, present throughout every part of Creation. Because of this, the theology of Forest Church tends towards environmentalism whereby many in the community are engaged in conservation work such as rewilding, actively campaign with organisations such as Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion, and adopt eco-friendly lifestyles. Much of this is rooted in the Bible, in passages such as ‚Äúin his hand is the life of every creature ‚Äù (), ‚Äúthe earth is the Lord‚Äôs and everything in it ‚Äù () and ‚Äúall things have been created through him [‚Ä¶] and in him all things hold together ‚Äù (). One of the earliest areas identified in Forest Church was to develop an understanding of nature and Creation. By deepening one‚Äôs knowledge of plants, insects, local wildlife or the weather, one could engage more deeply in the awe and wonder of God‚Äôs creation around us. This remains central to many Forest Church groups: as much emphasis is placed on learning about and experiencing nature as on worship and liturgy. God is referred to as neither ‚Äòhe‚Äô nor ‚Äòshe‚Äô and described in terms of both Father and Mother God. This concept is rooted in the Bible: both male and female images of God abound. Some in the Forest Church community take this further and weave in aspects of the Divine Feminine. With regards to the Triune God, the Holy Spirit is often referred to as ‚Äòshe‚Äô, and having a feminine nature- this has come in part from Ruach, the Hebrew word for the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament.  Scripture  There are many Scriptural references to God‚Äôs creation, particularly about worshipping God- by whom and through whom all things were made - as we tend and care for the earth. tells us \\"By taking a long and thoughtful look at what God has created, people have always been able to see what their eyes as such can't see: eternal power, for instance, and the mystery of his divine being. So nobody has a good excuse.\\"Bible: The Message Translation Forest Church follows the Christian belief that God is the creator and sustainer: as God of everything that is created, protecting creation must be a fundamental part of God‚Äôs mission. If the Earth is the Lord‚Äôs, as in , then we are to care for it and Creation is the beginning and ending of everything, including the Bible. Therefore, Bookless, D. \\"To Strive to Safeguard the Integrity of Creation and Sustain and Renew Life on Earth (ii).\\" in Walls, A and C Ross. Mission in the Twenty-first Century. London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 2008. pp. 94-99., the Gospel must begin with creation . Ezekiel questions how we sustain creation, wondering if we must spoil those parts of creation which we do not use (): an important point in contemporary society with the focus on human-caused climate change. If we are to agree with Bookless' claim that ‚Äúmission is about the restoration of broken relationships between God, human beings and the natural world‚Äù, then part of mission now must be environmental and ecological action. Contemporary society has seen a huge movement towards environmentalism in recent years, and in ethical discipleship for Christians. Organisations such as Christian Climate Action and A Rocha, movements such as Extinction Rebellion, people such as Greta Thunberg, and initiatives such as EcoChurch are all recent appearances that society has embraced.  Forest Church groups  Each group has its own flavour and range of gatherings. Examples vary from meditative walks, workshops on naturalist subjects to more formalised rituals. For some groups the latter tend to draw on the shape of Pagan rituals which have evolved to inhabit the outdoor space although the language often expresses the presence of Christ within the context of the Trinity, whilst also allowing for the fullness of gender expressed within God. Story and the historical myths of the land are celebrated and valued alongside scripture, thus allowing each Forest Church to be centred in its own location. Nature connection, environmentalism, conservation, fitness and earth-based spirituality are also in the mix at some locations. *New Forest Forest Church: Led by David Cole, New Forest Forest Church has monthly gatherings in the outdoors. *Robinswood Forest Church *West Midlands Forest Church: Led by Steve Hollinghurst *Access Forest Church *Oxford Forest Church *Wild Spirit *Oakwood Forest Church Forest Church and children  Rachel Summers is pioneering the use of Forest school ideas into Forest Church.

She was the first woman in Prussia to receive a patent (for her leg prosthesis) and was also the inventor of the first practical modern hand prosthesis.  Biography  Caroline Eichler was born in 1808 or 1809, presumably in Nordhausen or Berlin, as the third daughter of painter Johann Gottlieb Eichler. In those days, young women were usually denied higher education opportunities or apprenticeships, and although no documentation has been found describing her schooling, her work demonstrates a knowledge of physics and technical mechanics. Around 1826 Eichler was working as a nanny and later worked as a nurse.  Life  While working as a nurse, Eichler was struck by the misery of amputees and \\"found myself particularly stimulated when, in the course of my business of nursing, I noticed the manifold sufferings of such unfortunate people. (...) So I pursued the idea of (...) inventing and representing a machine that was capable of making the suffered loss of the leg of the person concerned less sensitive and detrimental.\\" In 1832, Eichler designed and constructed a prosthetic leg with a knee joint, for which she received a 10-year patent on 23 November 1833, the first woman in Prussia to receive a patent. (Until Eichler, a leg prosthesis was rigid; \\"a stilted foot, an immovable piece of wood that was strapped to the stump, was common. Carpenters, blacksmiths and saddlers built it.\\") She also received patents for the Russian Empire and, on 13 January 1835, for the Kingdom of Bavaria as well. Her leg and foot patent allowed her to be the exclusive manufacturer and seller of her prosthetic for ten years: > 'The unmarried Karoline Eichler here herself is on November 23, 1833 a ten > consecutive years, (...), and valid for the entire scope of the Prussian > state: on a, in its entire composition for new and peculiarly recognized > artificial leg for Replacement of the upper and lower leg, given,' reports > the Allgemeine Preussische Staats-Zeitung of December 1, 1833. Eichler advertised her prosthetic leg and foot in a self-published text, in which she proudly announced that her design had passed inspection by Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach, head of surgery at Berlin's Charit√© Hospital, who reported on the successful use of the prosthesis for one of his patients and \\"expressly praised the design.\\" She continued her prosthesis development, creating another one for an artificial hand, for which she also received a Prussian patent on 24 November 1836. This was the first usable self-powered upper limb prosthesis on record. Eichler then built a trade in Berlin by manufacturing prostheses. On 30 October 1837, Caroline Eichler married a man seven years her junior, the mechanic Friedrich Eduard Carl Krause from Bielefeld. She later divorced him but, even after the divorce, Krause repeatedly \\"extorted money from her.\\" On the evening of 6 September 1843, Krause came to Eichler's Berlin apartment again, asking for money, when an argument ensued, during which, according to the criminal report, Krause murdered her with a pointed file. She died at age 34.  Leg prosthesis  Artificial leg developed and patented by Caroline Eichler. The leg prosthesis developed by Eichler featured several advances over competing designs from that time. For example, her leg had a mobile, independently working knee joint, which was not previously available. Earlier designs either had no knee joint or, like the artificial legs described by the surgeon Ambroise Par√© in the 16th century, had to be operated by pulling a cord. Eichler's construction consisted of a tinplate, brass (and later nickel silver sheet) shaft for the leg's stump, a hollow lower leg made of linden, willow or poplar wood glued over with canvas, and a foot with two parts, which were also made of wood, all attached to the jointed leg piece. The sheet metal for the femoral shaft could be cold-formed relatively easily, allowing the stump attachment to be adjustable. One of its important features was the weight of the prosthesis. It was much lighter in comparison to a solid wooden structure and weighed only about . Based on her experience as a nurse, Eichler gave great importance to the device's practical usability. Until then, it was common practice to fit prosthetic legs directly against the stump, which made long-term use impossible. In contrast, Eichler designed her prosthetic to fit on the stump after it was tightly wrapped with bandages and then a padded leather funnel. Then the prosthesis was pulled over the bandages and hung over the shoulder by a strap that was attached to the front and back of the funnel to avoid unnecessary pressure on the thigh stump. Her design allowed the knee joint to work without a locking device. It moved using a combination of gut strings and pressure-loaded coil springs, which, according to Eichler, were designed to correspond to human tendons and muscles. Her mechanism allowed the knee to bend while walking, and the springs brought the leg back to its extended starting position when it was lifted. The amputee did not have to help out by pulling a string. Eichler favorably compared the amputee's effort required to walk with her prosthesis to that of a toddler learning to walk or someone learning to dance. She said crutches were not necessary with her design as only a walking stick was required, and after a training period of one to two weeks, one would be able to walk on paved and unpaved floors and even climb stairs without using even a stick.  Reception  Experts from the Prussian Ministry of Medicinal Products and the Ministry of Trade and Industry subjected the prosthesis to an extensive examination before a ten- year patent was finally granted 23 November 1833. Eichler also received recommendations from numerous doctors, including those on the General Staff, Johann Wilhelm von Wiebel and Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach, who was the head of surgery at the Charit√© Hospital in Berlin. According to authors at the time, Eichler's prostheses represented a significant development in movement for amputees, especially when compared to other designs and, in German- speaking countries, it served for a long time as a model and standard for designs to follow.  Hand prosthesis  Eichler's artificial hand from 1836 is considered the first usable prosthesis of the upper extremity that could be moved without the assistance from the wearer's other, healthy hand. She built on progress made around 1812 by the Berlin dentist Peter Baliff for his design of a hand prosthesis. Baliff had adapted the \\"Iron Hand\\" of the feudal knight G√∂tz von Berlichingen (also known as \\"G√∂tz of the Iron Hand\\") and designed a new hand prosthesis, but it didn't get beyond the design phase. Its construction proved to be impractical and a prototype was never developed. One point of criticism for Baliff's hand, was that the fingers were designed to be actively opened but they relied on the force of springs to close, that is they passively closed, so the prosthesis lacked strength or could not adequately close. In addition, this prosthesis was made of heavy sheet iron and did not meet the wearers' practical anatomical or aesthetic needs. Eichler's hand prosthesis, like the Baliff's, was operated by the remaining muscles in the upper arm stump using a pulling mechanism, but her mechanism differed significantly from his. The fingers were actively closed and stretched again by means of coil springs made of nickel silver wire, one in each finger joint. Gut strings with a diameter of about 1 mm were used for power transmission. Structurally, the fingers featured three movable joints and the thumb had two joints. Digits could also be moved individually using five separate sliders on the wrist, but only passively. In contrast to the iron hands of Renaissance times, the prosthesis had an opposable thumb that enabled a forceps grip with a sixth slider. artificial hand, developed by Caroline Eichler, patented in 1836. Eichler's model also adopted design features from the Iron Hand: the wrist could bend at the wrist and a radial bearing made it possible to passively rotate the hand in relation to the forearm shaft (pronation or supination). The hand prosthesis was formed from nickel silver sheet modeled after two plaster casts (one from the stump of the arm and one from the healthy hand) and weighed only about . The phalanxes were covered with cork on the inside to improve the grip. The wearer of the prosthesis would have been able to write, sew and embroider with it, and also be able to lift loads of up to . The hand could easily be dismantled into its individual parts to simplify repairs and keep costs down, but the purchase price was quite high at 75 to 100 thalers. The nickel silver used by Eichler remained the standard material for hand prostheses into the 20th century.

Early life  Symonds was born in Liverpool on 22 August 1916, the second child of Major Roland Harrisson, who was killed in action a year later. Her mother was Hilda Grierson. Some believed her to be the illegitimate daughter of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, whom her mother met in 1915, but she was convinced otherwise. Asquith was, however, a regular presence in her early childhood. He supported her mother financially and let her stay over in London and Sutton Courtenay. ‚ÄúAnne is the greatest dear,‚Äù he wrote to Hilda in 1920. Her mother moved to Boars Hill and became an accomplished artist, a friend of Stanley and Gilbert Spencer and of Paul and John Nash, as well as Robert Bridges, John Masefield and Robert Graves ‚Äì who used to buy Anne sweets at the village shop. At the age of eight, Symonds was sent to the Farmhouse School, near Wendover, where students were required to do farm work. She made friends with Anne and Judith Stephen, nieces of Virginia Woolf. When she was fifteen, she moved to Oxford High School, and in 1934 she went up to Somerville College, Oxford, where she read PPE, and held office in the Oxford University Labour Club. Her Oxford friends included the future MPs Denis Healey and Christopher Mayhew.  Career  Symonds' first job was working as a researcher for Lord Beaverbrook.

The siege After the Jacobites had seized Inverness, some of them marched to Culloden House which was held by the Forbes family who supported the British Government and laid siege to it. They were told by the laird's wife that if they approached within gun-shot of the house that she would show them that she had both the arms and ammunition to support the right and title of George I of Great Britain. The house was besieged for seven weeks before it was relieved. Lady Forbes of Culloden and her servants managed to hold off a force of armed men. They were relieved with the assistance of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat who dispersed the force from Clan Chattan who controlled the area which in turn enabled him to gain the support of John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland and John Forbes to give him freedom from arrest for treason. The men of the Clan Chattan having given up the siege joined the main Jacobite army under John Erskine, Earl of Mar at Perth on 5th October with 700 men. According to one source, during the siege a canon shot had hit a tree and the falling timber killed one of the Jacobie rebels, with the tree subsequently being covered in a huge growth of ivy. During the siege of 1715, Culloden House was defended by Hugh Fraser whose brother, James Fraser of Foyers, laid siege to the house during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

Severance (born February 4, 1919) is a retired United States Marine Corps colonel and a centenarian. During World War II, he served as the commanding officer of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines and led his company in the battle of Iwo Jima. During the battle, Severance ordered his 3rd Platoon to scale Mount Suribachi and raise the flag at the summit.  Early life  Dave E. Severance was born on February 4, 1919, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Severance was raised in Greeley, Colorado before briefly attending a college in Seattle. When he ran out of money for school, Severance enlisted in the Marine Corps. Upon graduating from boot camp, he served on board a Navy ship at sea. He was then assigned to the 8th Marine Regiment in San Diego before attending Paramarine training in July 1941.  World War II = Paramarines  After the United States entered World War II, Sergeant Severance was sent to Officer Candidates School and commissioned as a second lieutenant. In 1943, Severance deployed to the Pacific Theater with the Paramarines, and by November, his unit was taking part in the Bougainville campaign. At Bougainville, Severance proved himself in battle by leading his cut off platoon out of a Japanese ambush with minimal casualties. In January 1944, the Paramarines withdrew from Bougainville and returned to San Diego. In February, the Paramarines were disbanded and Captain Severance was reassigned to 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division, where he was appointed as the Easy Company commander. In September 1944, Severance and the rest of the 5th Marine Division left San Diego for Camp Tarawa, Hawaii. In January 1945, the division left Camp Tarawa, stopping for a brief liberty at Pearl Harbor, before sailing west across the Pacific Ocean bound for Iwo Jima.  Battle of Iwo Jima  Mount Suribachi (pictured in 2001) is the dominant geographical feature of the island of Iwo Jima At approximately 09:55 on February 19, 1945, Severance led Easy Company ashore with the twelfth wave at Green Beach One during the battle of Iwo Jima. Easy Company landed unopposed and was in the assembly area on the beach for roughly 20 minutes before the defending Japanese finally opened fire on the invasion force. Easy Company's 2nd Platoon, led by Second Lieutenant Ed Pennell, landed off course and became separated. When Severance told Colonel Harry B. Liversedge that his company was not ready to move out off the beach because his 2nd Platoon was missing, Liversedge threatened Severance with a court martial if he did not find his missing platoon in the next five minutes. Severance located the platoon shortly after. Severance led Easy Company off the beach under heavy fire and played a role in helping to cut Mount Suribachi off from the rest of the island before the day was over. By the end of February 21, Severance's company was positioned at the base of Suribachi. On February 22, Navy planes bombed Suribachi and mistook Severance and his Marines for the Japanese. Severance was unable to have his location marked with flares as the bombs continued to fall closer to his position, and he radioed to Colonel Liversedge to stop the bombing. The planes were called off and Severance spent the rest of the day preparing for the assault up Mount Suribachi. = First flag raising = On February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, 2/28's commanding officer, ordered Severance to send one platoon up the face of Suribachi. Severance decided to send his 3rd Platoon up the mountain, along with 12 Marines from his Weapons Platoon. Severance ordered his executive officer, First Lieutenant Harold G. Schrier, to lead the platoon up Suribachi. Just before Schrier left with the platoon, Johnson handed him a 54 by 28 inch American flag and said \\"If you get to the top, put it up.\\" The flag had been taken from the USS Missoula (APA-211) by the battalion adjutant, First Lieutenant George G. Wells. Severance later admitted that he thought he was sending the platoon up Suribachi to certain death. Schrier led his platoon up Suribachi and raised the flag Johnson had given him. James Forrestal, the Secretary of the Navy, arrived at the beach just as the flag was raised. The morale among the Marines greatly increased upon seeing the flag and Forrestal said to General Holland Smith that \\"the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years.\\" Forrestal was so excited that he then decided he wanted to keep the flag as a souvenir. = Second flag raising = Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, by Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press Marine Corps photo of the two flags on Mount Suribachi When Lieutenant Colonel Johnson received word of Forrestal's wish, he angrily remarked \\"The hell with that!\\" Johnson wanted to retrieve the flag as soon as possible since he believed the flag belonged to his battalion. Johnson then sent his assistant operations officer, Second Lieutenant Ted Tuttle, down to the beach to secure a larger flag to raise over Suribachi. Johnson then ordered Severance to have his Marines lay a telephone wire up to the top of Suribachi. Severance ordered four Marines from 2nd Platoon, Sergeant Michael Strank, Corporal Harlon Block, and Private First Classes Ira Hayes and Franklin Sousley to reel a telephone wire up the mountain from the battalion command post. He then sent his runner, Private First Class Rene Gagnon, to the battalion command post to obtain radio batteries for Schrier. As the five Marines arrived at the command post, Tuttle also returned to Johnson with a 96 by 56 inch flag which he had acquired from USS LST-779. Johnson handed the flag to Gagnon and then told Strank to raise the second flag and have Schrier \\"save the small flag for me.\\" Strank then led the small group up Suribachi; where Strank, Block, Hayes, Sousley, and Private First Classes Harold SchultzUSMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers, Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016 and Harold Keller raised the second flag. The second flag raising was captured in the famous photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal. The first flag was brought back down Suribachi and returned to Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, who promptly placed it in the battalion safe. = Later actions during battle = Severance continued leading Easy Company in the battle after the flag raising, advancing over the northeast end of the island. On March 1, Severance led his company in capturing a heavily defended ridge south of Nishi Village. He then held the ridge with his Marines despite a heavy barrage of enemy fire. For his actions that day, Severance was awarded the Silver Star. Mike Strank and Harlon Block were among those killed that day from Easy Company. On March 2, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was killed by a mortar round. On March 17, Severance began receiving requests to identify the Marines in the photograph of the second flag raising. He ignored the requests as his company was still fighting the battle. One of the flag raisers, Franklin Sousley, was killed a few days later on March 21. Shortly after Sousley was killed, Severance learned that his wife had given birth to a stillborn baby. On March 26, Severance led his battered company off Iwo Jima. A total of 310 Marines and corpsmen served with Easy Company during the battle. Only 50 walked off the island, an 84 percent casualty rate. Severance was never wounded during the battle, and he was the only Easy Company officer to walk off the line once the battle concluded. After the battle, Severance returned to Camp Tarawa with the 5th Marine Division. He began training a new company in preparation of the invasion of Japan, but then the war ended. He then took part in occupation duty in Japan in late 1945 as the executive officer of 2/28.  Post-war career and life  After returning to the United States, Severance attended flight training in April 1946. During the Korean War, he flew 69 combat missions and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross along with four Air Medals. Severance also served during the Vietnam War before retiring from the Marines with the rank of colonel in May 1968. Upon retirement, Severance and his wife settled in La Jolla, California. In the 1980s, he began searching for surviving Easy Company Marines and organized multiple reunions. In the late 1990s, Severance gave a number of interviews to James Bradley while he was writing his book, Flags of Our Fathers. Bradley's father, John Bradley, served with Easy Company as a corpsman and was originally identified as one of the flag raisers. Severance had also recommended John Bradley for the Navy Cross for his actions at Iwo Jima. On February 4, 2019, Severance celebrated his 100th birthday. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Robert Neller, sent a letter to Severance on his birthday, stating \\"you played a crucial role in shaping the warrior ethos of our Corps.\\" In July 2020, a granite plaque honoring Severance and his service was added to the memorial wall at the Mount Soledad National Veterans Memorial in San Diego.  Portrayal in film  Severance is featured in the 2006 movie Flags of Our Fathers. In the movie, Severance is played by American actor Neal McDonough. American actor Harve Presnell also played Severance as an older man in the film.

Aleppo was the capital of the Hamdanid emir Sayf al- Dawla, the Byzantines' chief antagonist at the time. Background In October 944, the Hamdanid emir Sayf al-Dawla captured Aleppo and soon extended his control over northern Syria, from Homs in the south to the frontier lands with the Byzantine Empire in the northwest and parts of western Upper Mesopotamia. Under Sayf al-Dawla's patronage, Aleppo grew into the chief city of northern Syria, and was the site of major buildings, notably the great palace of Halbas outside Aleppo, endowed with splendid gardens and an aqueduct. The Hamdanid court of Aleppo also became a major centre of cultural activity; as the historian Stephen Humphreys comments, \\"in his time Aleppo could certainly have held its own with any court in Renaissance Italy\\". Due to the geographical position of his realm, the Hamdanid ruler also emerged as the champion of the Muslim world against the recent advances of the Christian Byzantines in the eastern Anatolian borderlands. From 945/6 until the end of his life, he was said to have fought against the Byzantines in over forty battles. The first decade of warfare with the Byzantines was largely in Sayf al-Dawla's favour, with the Hamdanid ruler bale to parry the Byzantine attacks and launch counter-raids of his own, resulting in the dismissal of the Byzantine Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief), Bardas Phokas, and his replacement with his son, Nikephoros Phokas. Assisted by capable lieutenants such as his brother Leo and nephew John Tzimiskes, Nikephoros began to turn the tide of the conflict. In 960, trying to take advantage of Nikephoros' absence with the bulk of his army in the reconquest of Crete, Sayf al-Dawla launched a major invasion of Byzantine Cappadocia, but was attacked and almost annihilated in an ambush by Leo Phokas. Sayf al-Dawla managed to escape, but most modern historians consider that his military power was broken. Nikephoros' 962 campaign and the sack of Aleppo Map of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine frontier zone in south-eastern Asia Minor, with the major fortresses. In 961, Nikephoros returned and led his troops to sack the town of Anazarbus in Cilicia, killing a part of its population and expelling the rest, and then demolishing its walls. Modern historians have seen this as a deliberate scorched-earth strategy that \\"created a wasteland between Syria and Cilicia that broke the lines of supply between the two regions\\", and that opened up the road to Aleppo. Indeed, when he resumed his attacks in April 962, Nikephoros ignored Cilicia, and instead proceeded to attack Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, thereby securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al- Dawla appears to have been oblivious to this threat: instead, he sent his generals, Qarghuyah and Naja al-Kasaki, to conduct counter-raids into Byzantine territory, while he tried to restore his authority in Cilicia and rebuild Anazarbus. Negotiations for a truce and a prisoner exchange may have been ongoing at the same time, lulling the Hamdanids into complacency. This illusion was broken in November, when a Byzantine force captured Manbij, the last city north of Aleppo, capturing its governor, Sayf al-Dawla's cousin Abu Firas al-Hamdani. In early December, Nikephoros then‚Äîlikely in command of a different army to that that had captured Manbij‚Äîmoved onto Aleppo itself. The Arab sources dwell extensively on the following events, but provide contradictory details, so that the exact course of the campaign is uncertain. They are unanimous, however, that the attack caught Sayf al-Dawla completely off guard, possibly due to the late season, as the Byzantines did not normally campaign in winter. As a result, the Byzantines held a considerable numerical advantage‚ÄîArab sources speak of 70,000 Byzantines against just 4,000 Hamdanid soldiers in the city‚Äîleaving Sayf al-Dawla scrambling to bolster his forces with last-minute levies. As the Byzantines advanced on the city, the Hamdanids tried to oppose them, but their reaction appears to have been uncoordinated and confused: Sayf al-Dawla moved to Azaz to confront the Byzantine army, but then retreated without doing so, while his lieutenant Naja moved first towards Antioch and then back towards Azaz, where he was defeated by Nikephoros' lieutenant, Tzimiskes. Whatever the exact course of events, the Byzantines emerged victorious from these initial skirmishes, and proceeded to attack Aleppo. Sayf al-Dawla briefly confronted the Byzantine army with the small force at his disposal before his capital, but, unable to offer any meaningful resistance, he abandoned the city. The Hamdanid ruler fled to the fortress of Balis, but, pursued by Tzimiskes, he moved on to nearby Sab'in. Naja's movements are not entirely clear, but he likewise failed to come to the support of Aleppo. The Byzantines first plundered the unprotected palace of Halbas, securing enormous plunder, including its golden roof; the rest of the building was then torn down. Left without hope of relief, the Aleppines began negotiations, but as the city collapsed into chaos, Nikephoros took advantage and ordered his men to storm it on 23/24 December. The Byzantines did not capture the citadel, which was defended by a Daylamite garrison, but plundered the city for eight or nine days, torching its buildings and tearing down its fortifications. Yahya of Antioch reports that the citadel was attacked by a nephew of Nikephoros Phokas (possibly Theodore Parsakoutenos), but he was killed by a Daylamite soldier. When his severed head was brought to Phokas, the latter reportedly beheaded 1,200 Arab prisoners. Eventually, the Byzantines departed, taking some 10,000 inhabitants, mostly young men, with them as captives; in addition, they took possession of 390,000 silver dinars, 2,000 camels and 1,400 mules. Returning to his ruined and half-deserted capital, Sayf al-Dawla repopulated it with refugees from Qinnasrin. Aftermath Ibn Hawqal visited the city after the siege, then he wrote: Some modern scholars have considered the sack of Aleppo as a mere setback for the Hamdanid ruler, but not ultimately critical for his realm, focusing rather on the conquest of Cilicia that followed in 963‚Äì965. Garrood, on the other hand, suggests that the loss of prestige suffered by Sayf al-Dawla was an irreversible blow on his power and authority. From then on, until his death, Sayf al-Dawla's rule would be plagued by revolts and disputes between his subordinates.

Created in Paris in 2018, its goal is to facilitate mutual cooperation by representing the world's major financial centers. History In 2016 the financial centres of Paris, Frankfurt and Moscow proposed the creation of a non-profit association to facilitate cooperation and promote good practice and exchange with international public authorities. Two years later the association was founded as the World Alliance of International Financial Centres in Paris and was registered on October 1st, 2018 in the city of Brussels by eleven financial centres from countries such as Germany, France, Belgium, Russia, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. According to the newspapers Luxemburger Wort and L'Echo, the alliance was created \\"in order to strengthen collaboration between the centres leading to the development of a dialogue with public authorities based on financial technologies and sustainable development\\". Arnaud de Bresson, executive director of the Paris Europlace organization, was elected president, while Jochen Biedermann and Frederic de Laminne became managing director and treasurer respectively. The initial eleven members were joined by centers from other territories such as Japan, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Qatar and the United Kingdom to form a 17-member alliance today. In view of the contingency generated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the association expressed in a publication the need to \\"reconsider economic models and give a new priority to long-term prospects and sustainable economy\\". Board member Hubertus V√§th cited the financial centers of Tokyo and Hong Kong as examples for \\"successfully dealing with similar challenges in the past,\\" referring to the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak. The text also called for concentrated efforts to develop technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to address contingency challenges. Overall focus WAIFC was created to bringing international financial centres under one organization to facilitate mutual cooperation, encourage the exchange of best practices, stimulate financial research and undertake projects that contribute to sustainable economic development. Currently the organization is in charge of conducting research projects with universities and private consulting companies, focusing on areas of action such as the development of financial technologies or fintech, data collection from financial centers and their contribution to green investment.

He stated that the backtracking got \\"tiresome\\" and the formula of the game became predictable, with mundane tasks becoming \\"repetitive fast\\" if the player attempted to optimize their efficiency, but that the game forcing beloved characters to leave was emotionally affecting. Rachel Watts of PC Gamer rated the game 85/100, saying that it is a \\"wholesome life-sim\\" that \\"deals with the topic of death and compassion with masterful balance\\". However, she criticized the \\"purposeful vagueness\\" about the nature of the afterlife and its inhabitants as \\"muddl[ing] the clarity of the characters' intentions\\". Eric Van Allen of USGamer rated the game 4/5, saying its writing is \\"warm, funny and charming\\", and the game is \\"best enjoyed in small pieces\\".

He was appointed the first Director of Education for the Northern Region and developed the first policies of secular education for the region. Upon his retirement from colonial service, he served as a member of the Advisory Committee on Education in the British tropical colonies for sixteen years.  Life  Vischer was born to a Rosalie and Adolphe Vischer, his father was a writer and humanitarian while his paternal grandfather, Wilhem Vischer, a Protestant was a professor at University of Basle and was a descendant from a lineage of silk traders. Rosalie Fischer was also from a commercial family with links to the textile trade, her family, the Sarasins, were of Huguenot heritage conducting business in Basel. Vischer had his early education in Basel and at Niesky, Germany, he traveled to England and attended Southeastern College, Ramsgate before earning his bachelor's and master's degree from Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Towards his final year in college, he had developed interest in African ethnology and had attended an Hausa language training course in Tripoli. After leaving Emmanuel College, he spent a year at Ridley Hall where he became familiar with the Church Missionary Society. In 1901, he traveled to Nigeria with some CMS missionaries visiting Hausaland. His stay in Lokoja was limited as he suffered several bouts of fever. Vischer then went back to his native home to recuperate. He returned in 1903, as a naturalised British, resigning from missionary work which he was fond of, he joined the colonial service as an Assistant Resident. His first station was in Bornu, there he heard about the caravan trade and slave route between Tripoli and Bornu. In 1906, Vischer embarked on a journey through the Sahara, from Tripoli to Kukawa to study some of the cultures that might have influenced the Kanuri people. Among the passengers in the journey were freed slaves, pilgrims from Mecca, camel drivers and guides from Niger. In 1908, Vischer was seconded to the education department to develop an industrial school in Nasarawa, Kano. He was the only one recommended for the position, partly through his knowledge of Arabic, Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri but also because he had been sympathetic to the cultures of the Kanuris. To prepare him for his new position, he was sent to Egypt and Sudan to study Kuttabs and schools in Mansoura, Bulaq and Giza and in the Sudan. By 1911, Vischer's educational policy helped found an elementary school, a training school for mallams, a school for the sons of Emirs and a technical school. The objective of the schools was not to promote European culture but to preserve the culture and social life of Northern Nigeria and to train pupils for the Native Administration and in the work of craft. The schools were the first non-Quranic schools in the Northern Protectorate. In 1913, provincial elementary schools were established in Katsina and Sokoto. In 1914, upon the amalgamation of Nigeria, Vischer was appointed Director of Education for the Northern Region. Though, he was officially the director, he spent most of his years during the Great War working for the War Office and for the Secret Intelligence Services. He resigned his position with the colonial service in 1919. in 1923, he became the honorable secretary of the Advisory Committee on Education in the British colonies in Africa and a year later was involved in the foundation of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures.

Done in oil on canvas, the paintings depict the Loue river in eastern France.  Description  An artist with naturalist and Realism proclivities, Gustav Courbet often painted the river Loue near Ornans, his hometown in eastern France. From 1863 to 1864, he painted a series of four paintings titled The Source of the Loue. The paintings depict rocky crags and grottos with the river flowing beneath them, a motif in keeping with Courbet's earlier works of Realism. All of the paintings showcase Courbet's skill in using a palette knife to apply pigment. At the time of their creation, the paintings (along with other works by Courbet) were not widely accepted in the art community as they were considered works of Realism, then a fringe artistic movement.  Paintings  Courbet's series is now split between the collection of several institutions. One painting is in the collection of the Walters Museum, one is in the collection of the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich, one is in the collection of the Kunsthalle Hamburg, and one is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

It was built between 1881 and 1898, and the dome and bell towers were completed between 1920 and 1940. History View of the church overlooking Mellieƒßa Bay, 2006 The parish of Mellieƒßa was first established in the 15th century or earlier, but in later centuries the village ceased to be a parish since the settlement was prone to attacks from the Barbary pirates and it was abandoned. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieƒßa remained an important shrine, and after the corsair threat had diminished the village began to grow once again. The parish was reestablished in 1844. Construction of the parish church began in 1881, and the first stone was blessed by parish priest Francis Maria Magri on 5 September 1883. The limestone used to build the church was obtained from a quarry at l-Aƒßrax tal-Mellieƒßa, and the local population helped in transporting the building materials to the construction site. The church was blessed by Bishop Pietro Pace on 5 September 1897 and construction lasted until 1898. Between 1920 and 1940, the church's bell towers and dome were completed, and five bells were purchased from Milan. The building was consecrated by Bishop Mauro Caruana on 18 February 1930. The interior was embellished with a number of paintings, including works by the Maltese painters Giuseppe Cal√¨ and Lazzaro Pisani. Architecture The church interior in 2013 The church has two bell towers and a dome which make it a prominent landmark in the Mellieƒßa skyline.

Founded in Moscow in 1988, the Brahms Trio has performed worldwide and has recorded much of Russian piano trio repertoire. The Brahms Trio made a significant contribution to enlarging the chamber repertoire by rediscovering unknown piano trios of Russian composers of the late-19th and early-20th century. The musicians of the Brahms Trio are professors of the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory, recipients of the awards ‚ÄòFor the Prominent Contribution to the Development of Culture‚Äô as well as the title ‚ÄòMerited Artist of Russia‚Äô. Early years The Brahms Trio was formed in 1988 as a part of the chamber music class of Konstantin Oznobishchev at the Gnessin School of Music. Since 1990, the artistic biography of the Brahms Trio has been inextricably linked to the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory. The chamber music classes of the legendary Moscow Conservatory professors Tatiana Gaidamovich and Oleksandr Bondurianskyi (The Moscow Trio) made an invaluable impact on the music formation and development of the ensemble. Furthermore, such masters as , Natalia Shakhovskaya, Valentin Berlinsky (Borodin Quartet), and Rudolf Barshai had a significant influence on the shaping of the performing style and career of the trio. In 1991, the ensemble was named after Johannes Brahms. That same year, the official debut of the Brahms Trio took place at the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. In 1993, the Brahms Trio won the 2nd prize at the XIII International Chamber Music Competition in Trapani, Italy, and in 1996, the 1st prize at the First Joseph Joachim Chamber Music Competition in Weimar, Germany. In 1995 the Brahms Trio became a resident ensemble of the Moscow Philharmonic Society. Performing activities Since the middle of the 90s, the Brahms Trio has had an active concert schedule, including regular appearances at major concert halls such as the Great Hall of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow, the Saint Petersburg Philharmonia concert halls, the Brucknerhaus in Linz, the Stadtcasino Basel, the National Philharmonic in Warsaw, Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall in Zagreb, the Cemal Re≈üit Rey Concert Hall in Istanbul, the Seoul Arts Centre, as well as at festivals in Melbourne, Hong Kong, Ljubljana, Ohrid, Copenhagen, Brussels, and Paris among others. In 2015, the Brahms Trio was invited by ICA Classics to participate in the presentation of the memorial CD edition ‚ÄôA Tribute to Rudolf Barshai‚Äô in London. The ensemble has collaborated with renowned artists such as Charles Neidich, Pavle De≈°palj, Andrei Gridchuk, , Hibla Gerzmava, Yana Ivanilova, and Carmen Balthrop among others. Since the beginning of its career, the Brahms Trio has participated in and initiated major musical events in Russia. From 1998 to 2006, concerts and master classes were held in more than one hundred cities of Ural, Russia's northern regions, and Siberia as a part of the Brahms Trio's 'Russian Chamber Music Assemblies'. In 1994, the annual Festival was established in Moscow by the Brahms Trio. The History of the Russian Piano Trio In recent years, Russian chamber music has been at the heart of the artistic activities of the Brahms Trio. The ensemble's repertoire includes all the famous Russian piano trios and many previously unknown works by Russian composers of the Silver Age and Art Nouveau, including the piano trios of Vladimir Dyck, Sergei Yuferov, Konstantin Sternberg, Nikolai Lopatnikoff and others, that were premiered by the Brahms Trio. The first anthology of the Russian piano trio, recorded by the Brahms Trio, a series of 15 CDs, titled ‚ÄôHistory of the Russian Piano Trio‚Äô, will be released by NAXOS from November 2020 onwards. Moscow Conservatory Graduates of the Moscow Conservatory, the members of the Brahms Trio are extending the traditions of the Russian school of performing arts and music education established by Anton Rubinstein in the 19th century. Natalia Rubinstein has been a Professor of chamber music at the Moscow Conservatory since 2003, and Kirill Rodin has held a position as a Professor of cello since 1990. Their students regularly become laureates of Russian and international competitions, and many of them are actively performing and teaching at universities and conservatories all over the world. On the initiative of the Brahms Trio, an annual series of chamber music concerts with young performers is being held at the Moscow Conservatory and the State Institute for Art Studies in Moscow. In 2018, a similar concert series of Russian chamber music, performed by young ensembles of the Moscow Conservatory, has been established by the Brahms Trio at the Albert Long Hall of the Bosphorus University in Istanbul. Since 2009, the Brahms Trio has annually opened the chamber music concert season at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory.

His work also included hospitals and commercial buildings, small country houses and private houses. All his known work was carried out in the South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire area except for a chapel and school built in Coventry. St Timothys‚Äò on Slinn Street at Crookes Biography Webster was born in Sheffield, his education consisted of private tutoring from the Reverend Henry Denson Jones, Vicar of Heeley in the late 1840s and early 1850s before attending Mansfield Grammar School full-time. After deciding upon a career in architecture Webster served his apprenticeship with the well known Sheffield firm of Samuel Worth who were best known for their work on Sheffield General Cemetery. He managed the Halifax office of ecclesiastical architects James Mallinson and Thomas Healey, before returning to Sheffield to set up his own architectural practice in the late 1860s at 19 St. James Street close to Sheffield Cathedral.Lookingatbuildings.org Gives biographical information. Architectural work=Churches The roundhouse at the former Royal Infirmary Webster's first church commission was Ranmoor Wesleyan Chapel on Ranmoor Road (demolished in 1963), the 1870s and 1880s were a busy time for ecclesiastical building with much funding coming from the Church Extension Society. Webster designed 15 churches in Sheffield (more than any other architect) and extended many others. His work included St Pauls‚Äô, Norton Lees (1877), Trinity Wesleyan Church, London Road (1879), St Bartholomews‚Äô, Burgoyne Road (1881), St Anns‚Äô, Netherthorpe (1882), St Clements, Newhall, Attercliffe (1886), St Matthias‚Äô, Stocksbridge (1890), St Bartholomews‚Äô, Carbrook (1890), Christ Church, Gleadless (extended 1890 and 1897), St Augustines‚Äô, Brocco Bank (1898), St Cuthberts‚Äô, Fir Vale (1902), Attercliffe Chapel (remodelled 1909), St Oswalds‚Äô, Millhouses (1910) and St Timothys‚Äô, Slinn Street, Crookes (1911). In 1894 Webster was appointed Diocesan Surveyor for the Sheffield area of the Diocese of York and this gave him continuous ecclesiastical work until his death. In 1900 he was joined in the practice by his son John Douglas Webster and this saw the practice move to a more modern design of church, as illustrated by St Timothys‚Äò, Crookes which was built in the more fashionable Gothic Perdendicular style\\"A Popular History Of Sheffield\\", J. Edward Vickers, Applebaum Ltd, , p. 216 Gives list of churches.Lookingatbuildings.org Gives some details of churches. Hospitals Hospitals and their architecture were of special interest to Webster and it is in this field that he did some of his best work. In 1876 Webster was part of the three-person committee that founded the Sheffield Children's Hospital. Webster along with the solicitor Henry Vickers and the surgeon Dr William Jackson Cleaver, issued a statement saying it was ‚Äúexpedient to found an institution for the relief of poor sick children‚Äù. The Children's Hospital opened on 15 November 1876 in Brightmore House at a rent of ¬£63 per annum.The first childrens champions Gives details of Children‚Äòs Hospital committee. Webster served on the hospital's management committee for many years overseeing its expansion, when the hospital moved to new buildings on Western Bank in 1902 he acted as architect, completing the building in red brick Tudor style with tower.\\"Pevsner Architectural Guides: Sheffield\\", Harman and Minnis, Yale University Press, , p. 248 Gives details of Children‚Äòs Hospital architecture.

Other hospital related buildings by Webster include the Medical School on Leopold Street in 1888. He oversaw extensions to the Ecclesall workhouse which included a new male ward block (1891) and infirmary (1894), the workhouse would later become Nether Edge Hospital. Webster also carried out extensions to the original Sheffield Royal Infirmary at Upperthorpe, he added the Outpatients Department in 1884, an innovative octagonal structure now known as the roundhouse, it was influenced by advocates of the circular hospital ward. He also added the Nurses Home (Centenary House) in 1897, both the infirmary buildings are now Grade II listed buildings. Other work The early days of the practice in the 1870s saw much work being done designing private houses in the developing, affluent Sheffield suburb of Ranmoor. The best two examples are West Lea (1870) and Ranfall (1871) on Ranmoor Park Road, both are built in a conservative, classical style typical of Sheffield at the time. He also designed a dignified Italianate lodge at 83 Ranmoor Road (1874).Looking at Buildings Details of private houses Storth Oaks at 229 Graham Road was built in the late 1860s as a private house in the Swiss-Italian style, it is now a treatment centre for adults with drug and alcohol problems, it is a grade II listed building.Historic England Storth Oaks Webster carried out extensions to Totley Hall in 1883 and 1894 which included a billiard room with a 4-light stained glass window. In 1905 Webster was commissioned to design the Boer War Monument to the York and Lancaster Regiment, known as the Transvaal Memorial, it was originally situated in Sheffield Cathedral and was moved to Weston Park in 1963. The simple memorial was originally set into a granite wall but is now free standing and consists of a bronze panel listing the names of the dead flanked by soldiers with bowed heads.Public Art Research Archive, Sheffield Hallam University Boar War Memorial 38‚Äì40 Fargate in Sheffield Webster has very little recorded work in the centre of Sheffield, probably due to the loss of records, however, in addition to the already mentioned Medical School on Leopold Street, examples do exist. He designed the Norfolk Street section of St Pauls Parade to the south of the Peace Gardens, built between 1898 and 1901 as an extension to the Pinstone Street section, it is finished in warm coloured brick with red sandstone dressing. It has been rebuilt behind the facade and now houses retail and offices. In 1881 he designed 38‚Äì40 Fargate for the grocer Arthur Davy, it was claimed to be the largest provision shop in the country at the time, it now houses a branch of WHSmith. The Bainbridge building on the corner of Surrey Street and Norfolk Street were designed for the local Member of parliament and businessman Emerson Bainbridge in 1894, it has a prominent corner two-storey oriel window over the entrance.

In 1922, it was reported that a large piece of land was acquired by the Emir of Zaria, Dalhatu Uthman Yero, who failed to compensate the indigenous people. The same land was later given, in 1966, to the Hausa trading settlement in the heart of Mabatado called \\"Zangon Kataf\\", by the emir Muhammad Usman (being that the Atyap were in the Zangon Katab District, which was under the Zaria Province of the Northern Region of British Nigeria, later independent Nigeria) to use as a marketplace, in which indigenous Atyap people were banned from trading pork and beer by the settlers-turned-lords. Tensions steadily increased, flaring up in February 1992 over a proposal to move the market to a new site, away from land that had been transferred to the Hausas. The proposal by the first Atyap head of the Zangon Kataf Local Government Area was favored by the Atyap who could trade beer and pork on the neutral site and opposed by the Hausa, who feared the loss of trading privileges. Over 60 people were killed in the February clashes. Further violence broke out in Zango on May 15/16, with 400 people killed and most buildings destroyed. When the news reached Kaduna, rampaging Hausa youths killed many Christians of all ethnic groups in retaliation. In February 1992, the first indigenous Local Government Chairman A.C.P. Juri Babang Ayok (rtd.), announced in January 1992 the plans of moving the same market to a neutral site where all indigenes and settlers would be free to trade, thereby reducing Hausa monopoly and also decongest the old market with its unhygienic conditions due to the smallness of its area. This move being unpopular to the Muslim northern settlers served as a fuel to rising tensions between them and their Atyap hosts who welcomed the initiative for a market move. February 1992 crisis A Hausa resident of the Zango, Alhaji Danbala A.T.K., reportedly took the issue to court in a bid to stop the move of the market to a new site without success. On the day of the commencement of trade as announced, in the new market on February 6, 1992, it was reported that Alhaji Danbala organized a Hausa/Fulani mob in the new market site which murdered an Atyap man, Shan Anwai, thereby sparking the riot in which 95 people were killed, 252 injured, 133 houses burnt or destroyed and 26 farmlands destroyed, according to official figures. A commission of enquiry headed by Justice Rahila Cudjoe was set up by the Kaduna State Government to research on the cause of the crisis. May 1992 crisis As gathered by a reporter, the Atyap village heads then threatened to take back the land forcefully taken by the emir Yero in 1922 and given to the Hausas; and then Hausas went about uprooting newly planted crops on Atyap people's farmlands; with some attacked and killed in their farmlands; and the Hausa/Fulani group, Izalaru Islamic Group, wrote a letter to the Sultan of Sokoto, Alh. Ibrahim Dasuki, asking for assistance to wage a jihad against the Atyap; and reports of the police failing to arrest and prosecute those implicated three months earlier; with the Hausa/Fulanis again alleging the Cudjoe commission of manipulating the process, which was reportedly boycotted by the Atyap. The issues of the uprooting of crops on Atyap farmlands and the killing of Atyap people on their farms began the second crisis which lasted from May 15 to 16, 1992. When the rumours of the happenings in Zangon Kataf reached Kaduna, Zaria, Ikara and other areas in the state that the Hausa were being \\"annihilated\\" by the 'Katab infidels', rampaging Hausa/Fulani youths began killing many Christians of all ethnic groups in retaliation. Kaduna, Birnin Gwari and Ikara: The Hausa of Kaduna were the first to respond to the call, and Hausa youths took to the streets, killing and burning houses belonging to the Atyap and other non-Atyap Christians in Tudun Wada, Ungwar Muazu, Kawo, Rigasa, and other areas. 250 people were killed by official figures which were higher than that of Zangon Kataf by far. Same happened in Birnin Gwari and Ikara, northwest and northeast of Kaduna, respectively. Zaria: The eruption in Zaria happened on Sunday, May 17, 1992, where the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) secretary, Rev. Bitrus Katung was hacked right inside his house by rampaging Hausa youths. An Atyap man in the next house as well as one Koro man opposite his house were also murdered in cold blood with their houses burnt in Gyellesu. In Tudun Wada, a Bajju man, Baba Maigemu was also murdered. These are just among the few mentions. New York Times reported that at least 46 corpses were brought into the Ahmadu Bello Teaching Hospital. Casualties The May 1992 tragedy was said to have claimed 471 lives lost (250 in Kaduna, 188 in Zangon Kataf and the other 33 from Zaria, Ikara and other areas), 518 persons injured, 229 houses burnt or destroyed and 218 vehicles destroyed or burnt according to official figures. Although The Zango Hausa community claimed to have lost 1,528 persons. Many Hausas reportedly fled the Zangon Kataf area afterward and some returned subsequently. Africa Watch reported on a visit to Zangon Kataf in April 1993 that a year ago, the then Head-of-state, Gen. Babangida reportedly visited Zangon Kataf a few days after the riot in May 1992 and promised to compensate those who had their houses destroyed. In the latter visit, Africa Watch reported that thus, Enquiry and trials=Enquiry Africa Watch, in a report issued March 30, 1993, described the arrest and trial of retired Maj. Gen. Zamani Lekwot and six others following the riots in Zango-Kataf and Kaduna. In the Justice Rahila Cudjoe Enquiry Commission, Attorneys representing both the Atyap and the Hausa-Fulani presented their reports before the commission. Five of the panel members were Hausa-Fulani and the reports by the commission were not immediately made public. In the wake of the riot in May 1992, hundreds of Atyap people were arrested. At least 21 were left in detention without charge or trial under Decree 2 of 1984 and the others, released. The Atyap community representatives pointed out the fact that the main people arrested by the government were the Atyap leaders, including the Local Government chairman - A.C.P. Juri B. Ayok (rtd), the District Head - Bala Ade Dauke Gora, several village heads, and Major General Zamani Lekwot (rtd.) who were arrested not for any committed criminal act but their positions of authority in the society. Lekwot's arrest was said to be as a result of a feud between him and President Babangida. The military government later on May 20, 1992, officially banned all ethno-religious and regional associations which supported political candidates, thereby promoting the already tensed situation existing between the Hausas and other smaller indigenous groups in Kaduna State, as these groups resorted to forming underground units to aid them to achieve their political ambitions. The Cudjoe Commission's authority was adjusted by the state government following the crisis in May, including the May events to the existing scope of inquiries. Due to the perception that the Cudjoe Commission was filled with bias against the Atyap community, the lawyers representing them boycotted the commission of inquiries. Two special tribunals were later bypassed the normal courts to set up by the federal military government to try persons accused of participating in crimes during the riots. This act was frowned at by lawyers of the Nigerian Bar as it was perceived as a move to manipulate the justice system in favor of a particular group. On June 2, 1992, the first tribunal was enacted, the same was chaired by Justice Benedict Okadigbo, with members of the panel including the likes of Godwin Graham- Douglas, Alhaji Aminu Malumfashi, Hajia Tani Yusuf, Otunba A. Adeleke Adedoyin, Col. Yusuf Abubakar and Mustapha Wali. Although the decree providing the authority for setting up such a tribunal, Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree No. 53 of 1987, only makes room for five members of a tribunal, as pointed out by lawyers, the government amended the decree, allowing two more persons to be added to make seven after setting up the first panel and gazetted the changes. This first panel also called the Okadigbo tribunal, consisted of four Muslims (three Hausa/Fulani and a military officer); a Muslim retired police officer; a Christian by name Godwin Alaye Graham-Douglas, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) who later withdrew from the tribunal citing the fact that in absence due to a medical condition, the other members of the panel decided without his endorsement. On October 8, 1992, the second tribunal, chaired by Emmanuel Adegbite with panel members including the likes of N. N. Onugha, B. A. Njemanze, Lt. Col. Yakubu Bako, Alhaji Sule Baba Mohammed, Chief L. O. Okoi and Issac Zakari Dimka. The President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida then declared that there would be a presumption of guilt on all those accused by the tribunal in obvious violation of the law which stipulates the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, an International Criminal law also found in the Article 7 on Human and Peoples' Rights of the African Charter. Trials The entire people sentenced to death, numbering 13 from the Zangon Kataf area, were of all of Atyap ethnic descent. On April 4, 1992, Maj. Gen. Lekwot's and that of his co-accused case began, in which they were charged with \\"unlawful assembly, rioting, rioting with arms, and disturbance of public peace\\". The chairman of the tribunal, Justice Okadigbo reportedly showed open contempt towards the Chief G. O. K. Ajayi (SAN)-led defense counsel, with another team of the counsel, Barr. Emmanuel Toro, expressing his belief on the tribunal being \\"hell-bent on convicting.\\" On February 2, 1993, six of the seven accused were sentenced by the tribunal to death. These include: # Maj. Gen. Zamani Lekwot (rtd) # Maj. James Atomic Kude (rtd) # Yunana Karau # Markus Maman # Yahaya Duniyo, and # Julius T. Sarki (the village head of Zaman Dabo i.e. Atak Nfang). These decisions of the panel were not subject to appeal, except for a final endorsement by the National Defense Security Council (NDSC) whose final decision the executions depend on. As noted by Barr. Emmanuel Toro, \\"The ruling of the tribunal is still a mystery,\\" being that the decisions of the later disbanded Okadigbo tribunal were never made public even to the attorneys of the convicted person who were held in the Kaduna Prison, Abeokuta Prison and the Port Harcourt Prison (as in the case of Maj. Gen. Lekwot). Five other accused persons as in April 1993 were still in prison after being tried twice: Convicted by the Okadigbo tribunal of unlawful assembly, and by the Adegbite tribunal. They include: * Adamu Shekari (the village head in the Zango-Kataf area) - sentenced to three years imprisonment, and * Peter T. Lekwot (brother of Maj. Gen. Zamani Lekwot) - sentenced to five years imprisonment. Despite their proves of innocence, with Peter Lekwot alongside several witnesses testifying that he was in Kaduna attending a meeting when the incidence began, and Adamu Shekari also in another city at the time, their appeals were never listened to. The other three, namely: * Zamani Kazah * Hon. Shekarau Kaah * Sani Adam Jankasa These were all acquitted by the Okadigbo tribunal probably being that they were all elderly men, with Zamani Kazah (the local deputy chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP)) who was the oldest of them all being at least 80 years old at the time. The Adegbite tribunal again put these five under trial all over again with charges bothering on culpable homicide. This tribunal later acquitted Adamu Shekari and Peter Lekwot on grounds of their absence from the crime scene at the time of the event, convicting and sentencing the other three previously acquitted by the Okadigbo tribunal to death. They were hence moved to the infirmary unit of the Federal Prison in Abeokuta because they were advanced in age. At least four others were condemned to death by the tribunals. # Iliya (Elias) Manza # Ayuba Tache # Jonathan S. Yashim, and # Insp. Gankon Dawa Kurfi (rtd) Elias Manza was sentenced to death by the Okadigbo tribunal, while the next three were sentenced to death by the Adegbite tribunal. Only three Hausa-Fulanis were tried by either of the two tribunals and as testified by Mahmood Yahaya, their attorney, were all acquitted and released. Among the seven Atyap acquitted by the tribunals although tarried in the Kaduna Prison custody under Decree 2 of 1984 (which authorized detention without trial), for a while before their later release, include: # A.C.P. Juri B. Ayok (rtd.) # John Y. Toro # Insp. Timothy Shelu Adam (rtd) # Jonah Abashe # Bala Ninyio Bawa # Ayuba Yashim, and # Tauna Yakubu. The Kaduna State governor after the outbreak of the riot immediately removed the Zangon Kataf Local Government chairman, A.C.P. Juri B. Ayok (rtd.), a member of the SDP who as at June 1993 was the only one in the Zamani Lekwot group to be acquitted of all charges. The governor who was of the opposition National Republican Convention (NRC) party replace him with a member of the NRC, Mallam Haruna Zok, and also replaced Ayok's deputy and replaced him with another opposition NRC member without holding a by-election six months after the removal of Ayok and his deputy which was against the constitution's provisions and despite the case being filed by lawyers from the Atyap community, challenging the unconstitutional removal, nothing was achieved. In February 1993, a suit was presented before a Lagos High Court by The local human rights group, the Constitutional Rights Project (CRP), seeking a delay in the Lekwot group executions pending on when their petition filed before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights earlier filed review trial was heard. Also, a Nigerian human rights lawyer, Chief Mike A. A. Ozekhome, likewise filed a lawsuit at the same period in the same court, seeking to revoke the death sentences. On May 5, 1993, Ozekhome was ruled by the court to lack the locus standing to bring his case. It, however, agreed to the CPR's suit, extending a stay of execution on the Lekwot cases to June 7, 1993. Contrary to the fears, the federal military government did not execute those sentenced to death until Gen. Babangida's tenure elapsed. Even when the Interim government headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan came in on August 26, 1993, nothing was done. Even when General Sani Abacha came into power on November 17, 1993, he didn't act on the issue but awaited the final outcome of the African Commission, which discovered gross violations of judicial processes by the tribunals and the outgone military regime and asked for the release of the convicted persons from detention. This, the Abacha regime granted and they were released in 1996. Others The others implicated in one or the other or who played one role or the other of Atyap origin, not mentioned above include: # Kato Yashim # Tonak Dabo # James Gandu # Haruna Bityong # Philip Abu # Bala Bonet # Bitrus Kwasau # Bala N.

The thirteenth named storm and third hurricane of the hyperactive 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed from a fast-moving tropical wave west of the Windward Islands and south of Jamaica on August 20\\\\. The fast motion of the wave inhibited intensification initially, but as the wave slowed down and entered a more favorable environment, the system developed into a tropical depression, which in turn rapidly intensified into a strong tropical storm. Due to strong wind shear, Marco's intensification temporarily halted; however, after entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico on August 23, Marco briefly intensified into a hurricane, only to quickly weaken later that evening, due to another increase in wind shear. Marco made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River on the evening of August 24, as a weak tropical storm and subsequently weakened to a tropical depression before becoming a remnant low early on the next morning. Marco's remnants subsequently dissipated on August 26\\\\. Heavy rains across the Yucat√°n Peninsula caused river rises and flooding throughout the region. One person was indirectly killed in Comit√°n, Mexico, due to the storm. Impacts in the United States were generally minor as the storm significantly weakened before landfall. Meteorological history At 00:00 UTC on August 16, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a westward-moving tropical wave over the Central Atlantic that had the potential for development. Dubbed Invest 97L, the disturbance quickly moved westward at a speed over , which initially limited its development as it passed through the Windward Islands and into the Caribbean Sea. The system slowed down and gradually organized south of the Greater Antilles on August 19. By 15:00 UTC on August 20, satellite imagery revealed that the wave had developed a well defined low-level center, prompting the NHC to designate it Tropical Depression Fourteen. At the time the system was located east of the Nicaragua‚ÄìHonduras border. The storm continued westward toward Honduras, before making a sharp turn northward. Despite favorable conditions, the storm initially failed to intensify, with pulsing convection around a poorly defined center. Eventually, the storm's center became better defined and a small, but persistent cluster of convection formed over it. This allowed the depression to intensify, and the NHC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Marco in the northwest Caribbean at 03:00 UTC on August 22\\\\. This was the earliest 13th named storm ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, beating Hurricane Maria (2005) by 11 days. Soon after being named, Marco continued to contradict the forecasts and followed a more northerly course. Being a small system, Marco was able to quickly strengthen, reaching its initial peak intensity of and just 12 hours after being named, with an almost closed eyewall being observed by Hurricane Hunters. Contrary to prior predictions, Marco's track was shifted eastward at the 21:00 EDT advisory on August 22, as the system moved north-northeastward instead of north-northwestward, introducing the possibility of successive landfalls around Louisiana from both Laura and Marco. An increase of southwesterly wind shear brought an abrupt end to the strengthening trend, as Marco moved through the Yucat√°n Channel, with the storm's minimum central pressure rising slightly and the eyewall mostly dissipating as the storm took on a sheared appearance. This weakening period proved to be short-lived, as the shear relaxed somewhat when Marco moved into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico on August 23\\\\. Slow, but steady strengthening resumed and data from another Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft discovered sustained winds at hurricane strength in the northeastern eyewall. Subsequently, an update from the NHC confirmed that Marco had intensified into a Category 1 hurricane at 16:30 UTC on August 23. It then reached its peak intensity at 21:00 UTC, with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of . Tropical Storm Laura on August 23alt= This strengthening proved to be short-lived, however, as upper-level wind shear increased again over the storm. This caused Marco to weaken back to a tropical storm by 03:00 UTC on August 24, and the center of circulation became displaced from the storm's convection. Relentless wind shear continued to plague the system as it turned westward near the Louisiana coastline, and Marco rapidly weakened to minimal tropical storm strength by 18:00 UTC. At 23:00 UTC on August 24, Marco made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River, with 1-minute sustained winds at and a central pressure of , although the strongest winds were displaced in convection that was over waters well northeast of the center. Afterward, Marco weakened further and fell to tropical depression intensity just offshore of Louisiana, near Grand Isle, at 03:00 UTC on August 25, before degenerating into a remnant low six hours later. The remnant low continued to spin down as it slowly moved westward along the Louisiana coastline, ahead of the approaching Hurricane Laura, before opening up into a trough at 06:00 UTC on the next day. Preparations A weakened Tropical Storm Marco making landfall in Louisiana on August 24 Honduras issued tropical storm watches along its coastline when Tropical Depression Fourteen was designated, before quickly upgrading to warnings just hours later. Tropical Storm Watches, and later Tropical Storm Warnings and Hurricane Watches, were also issued for the eastern side of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, as the storm was first predicted to move over the peninsula as a strong tropical storm. When Marco moved to the north instead of northwest, a Tropical Storm Warning was issued by the Government of Cuba for the Pinar del R√≠o Province and the Isle of Youth. Tropical Storm, Hurricane, and Storm Surge Watches were issued in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama when Marco's forecast track shifted significantly eastward on August 22\\\\. Many of these watches were upgraded to warnings as the storm continued its approach. In Mississippi, mandatory evacuation orders were in place on August 23 at the Gulfport and Biloxi marinas and the harbor in Long Beach. All boats were ordered to be moved by sundown that same day. In Gulfport, the fuel dock was closed. However, all the warnings were eventually downgraded and cancelled when the storm rapidly weakened as it approached the coast. A tornado watch was issued for Far Southeast Alabama, the Florida Panhandle, Southwest Georgia, and the Coastal Waters at 20:40 UTC on August 24. Impacts Radar image of Tropical Storm Marco by the time of landfall. The Instituto Meteorol√≥gico Nacional of Costa Rica reported that heavy rain from the indirect effects of Marco affected parts of the country for three days. In Santa Cruz, Guanacaste Province, accumulations reached ; this was more than twice the average August rainfall of . Areas in and around Santa Cruz reported flooding. Moderate to heavy rains also caused some flooding in low lying areas also some gusty winds at times in the Grand Cayman of the Cayman Islands. In Mexico, the state of Chiapas was one of the areas hit hardest by Marco. One person was killed in Comit√°n and, following a landslide in Bochil, soldiers from the VII Military Region worked for several hours to enable the passage of vehicles to the city, with the help of Civil Protection personnel. In some municipalities of Chiapas, such as Tapachula, Escuintla and Acacoyagua, there was flooding due to the growth of rivers that come from mountains nearby. While traversing the Yucat√°n Channel, Marco brought heavy rain to parts of Pinar del R√≠o Province in Cuba on August 23\\\\. The town of Isabel Rubio saw the greatest accumulations at . Minor flooding occurred in Mantua and Sandino. A few trees were downed during the storm. Due to the sheared nature of the storm as it came ashore in the United States, rain bands extended as far northeast as Virginia. A tornado warning was issued for a storm just northeast of Panama City, Florida. Another tornado warning was issued for a storm near Charleston, South Carolina. Numerous special marine warnings were also issued due to possible waterspouts. However, no tornadoes or waterspouts were confirmed. Rainfall totals were highest along the Florida Panhandle, peaking at near Apalachicola on Monday morning. Several roadways were flooded in Panama City Beach that evening as well. However, heavy rainfall extended much further inland with flash flood warnings being issued as far northeast as the North Carolina‚ÄîVirginia border. Due to Marco being much weaker than anticipated, no wind damage occurred and the peak wind gust from the storm was only , which was recorded in Petit Bois Island, Mississippi. The remnants of the storm brought heavy rainfall and flash flooding to Southeastern Oklahoma on August 26 before dissipating. Overall, Marco caused at least $35 million USD in damages throughout the impacted areas.

History=Pre-WW1 The first motorcycles produced in 1902 used Minerva engines. Models using 2.75hp and 4.5hp Automoto engines were soon added, as was a 3hp model with an engine made by Acme. From 1904 the Automoto engines were produced under license by Acme.

The company filed a number of patents, including one for a sprung frame in 1916. Post-WW1 After a break during the First World War production resumed in 1918 under managing director George Henry Hemingway. The post-war models used engines from JAP and also Acme built 350 cc side-valve single and 997 cc V-twin engines. A car was produced in limited numbers in 1919.The Times, 13 April 1996 In 1920 a 976 cc V-twin combination was introduced with 8hp JAP engine, a three-speed Sturmey Archer gearbox, Brampton Biflex forks and chain drive. The engine was produced to Acme's specification with the magneto drive on the left to allow better access to the ignition points. In 1921 a 2¬æ hp single-cylinder machine with two gears was added.

After moving to the west of the country in 1959 she came to wider prominence as the writer of a succession of radio plays, focusing initially on the science fiction genre, and subsequently broadening her scope to include crime drama. Sources may also identify her, using her long-running pseudonym, as \\"Maren Offenburg\\".  Life and works  Eva Maria Ehrhard was born in Berlin. She was not quite 18 when the war ended and she took her first job, working initially as an internee with a Berlin daily newspaper. It was here that she met Heinz Mudrich (1925‚Äì2016) whom she subsequently married. It was, according to Mudrich, a \\"lightning encounter that lasted sixty years\\". In 1950 she moved on to undertake freelance work with various radio stations, concentrating on programmes for schools, children and young people and \\"women's topics\\". By 1959 Heinz and Eva Maria Mudrich had married one another. Their son, the jazz pianist Christoph Mudrich (1960‚Äì2019), was born the next year. Meanwhile, Heinz Mudrich accepted a new job as Arts Editor with the Saarbr√ºcker Zeitung which meant quitting Berlin and settling in Saarbr√ºcken, where the media profile that Eva had built up through her radio work 700 kilometers away, in the Berlin area, counted for very little. While still in Berlin, during the 1950s, using the pseudonym \\"Maren Offenburg\\", she wrote a number of light romances which were published by Boje Verlag. Their intended audience was adolescent girls and young women, and they came with titles such as \\"Eine M√ºcke im Eden\\" (1955 - \\"A midget in Eden\\"), \\"Du bis nicht allein\\" (1956 - \\"You are not alone\\") and \\"Susanne √ºber den Wolken (1955 - \\"Susanne above the clouds\\"). By 1970, which was the year in which her son celebrated his tenth birthday, Mudrich began writing radio plays. The first of her works to be produced, \\"Das Experiment\\", formed the basis of four radio productions between 1970 and 1972 (only three of which were transmitted): a printed adaptation appeared a few years later. In 1972 the Cologne-based Westdeutscher Rundfunk (national broadcaster) organised a competition for science fiction radio plays in order, it was explained, to encourage a new generation of German writers. Mudrich was one of four prize winners with \\"Das Gl√ºck von Ferida\\" (loosely \\"The good fortune of Ferida\\") which had its first outing on 21 May 1973. This led directly to a commission to produce a further 20 radio plays. Many more science fiction radio plays followed, mostly for Horst Krautkr√§mer at the SDR radio studio in Heidelberg, along with a succession of criminal dramas, mostly produced for WDR. There were also more than 100 short radio plays, most of which were written for Deutsche Welle, and many of which were cut-down versions of her earlier works. In 1993 she won the Kurd La√üwitz science- fiction Best Radio Play prize with her \\"Sommernachtstraum\\" (loosely, \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\").  Evaluation  Eva Maria Mudrich can be seen as a pioneer of the demanding science fiction genre, both through her application of socio-political themes and on account of the metaphysical and idealistic references that she incorporates. A number of commentators have been prompted to rank the quality of her work alongside that produced by Wolfgang Jeschke, Herbert W. Franke, Hermann Ebeling and Richard Hey.

The Whig Split occurred between 1717 and 1720 when the British Whig Party divided into two factions, one in government led by James Stanhope while the other in opposition was dominated by Robert Walpole. It coincided with a dispute between George I and his son George, Prince of Wales, with the latter siding with the opposition Whigs. It is also sometimes known as the Whig Schism.Jones p.90 Background Following the Hanoverian Succession in 1714, the Tory government previously led by Robert Harley was ousted and the new King George I appointed a Whig-dominated ministry, commencing the fifty year Whig Oligarchy. This new government successfully resisted the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion which aimed to establish the exiled James on the throne. Growing tension between leading ministers in 1716 was increased during George's visit to his native Electorate of Hanover that summer. He was accompanied by his Secretary of State James Stanhope. While on the Continent, Stanhope played a major role in negotiating the Anglo-French Alliance reversing Britain's historic opposition to the French Crown. Stanhope also supported George over the Great Northern War, in which Hanover was trying to annexe both the Dutchy of Bremen and smaller Duchy of Verden. The outcome of this was a British fleet under John Norris being sent to the Baltic to support Russia against Sweden. This was much criticised for subordinating British interests to those of Hanover, something which had specifically been ruled out in the Act of Settlement. Split King George, his son George, Prince of Wales joined with the Opposition Whigs. The developing hostility also involved Walpole's brother-in-law and close political ally Lord Townshend. Townshend was removed from his role supervising Britain's foreign policy, but was transferred to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to soften the blow. However in April 1717 Townshend was dismissed from the government after voting against it in the Lords over its anti-Swedish policy. Walpole, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and his supporters promptly resigned from the government and the split became formal.Black p.11 With his ally, the Earl of Sunderland, Stanhope took over full control of the government as First Minister. To boost the ranks of their ministry he briefly appointed the playwright Joseph Addison as Secretary of State.Pearce p.83 The disharmony was increased when Prince George and his father, whose relationship had often been strained, had a dramatic falling out. This occurred when the Duke of Newcastle, a young minister, had a misunderstanding with the Prince and believed he had been challenged to a duel by him.Harris p.135 The King responded angrily and in consequence Prince George and his wife Caroline of Ansbach were banished from St James's Palace, forced to leave behind their three daughters. They took up residence at Leicester House, spending their summers at Richmond Lodge near the River Thames, and established a rival court to George. This attracted politicians hostile to the Stanhope government, particularly the opposition Whigs. Both the Jacobites and foreign powers opposed to Britain tried to take advantage of the royal rift.Paul p.28 Walpole and his followers allied with the Tories, to whom they had recently been bitterly opposed, to oppose new proposals by Stanhope's government. A significant victory for the opposition came with the government failure to impeach Harley, now Lord Oxford, for his role in the Peace of Utrecht. After two years imprisonment in the Tower of London, he was released in July 1717. Walpole strongly attacked funding the new war with Spain, fought in alliance with France. He joined with Tories to support reductions in military spending. A particularly significant victory occurred in 1719 when the Peerage Bill was defeated. This was a proposal to perpetually limit the membership of the Lords to existing members and their heirs, drawn up partly in response to Harley's controversial creation of a dozen new peers in 1711 to create a Tory majority in the Whig-dominated House of Lords. As Stanhope had recently been made an Earl by the King, Walpole mockingly suggested he was \\"now desirous to shut the door after him\\".Hill p.66 Reconciliation Although in 1719 the Duke of Newcastle had suggested that Walpole was so close to the Tories, that at the next election the Whig government would have little trouble in portraying them as part of a single party with the JacobitesBlack p.17 by 1720 the Whig rivals began to move towards each other again. A formal reconciliation was agreed between the King and his son. Both Walpole and Townshend returned to office in June 1720, becoming respectively Paymaster of the Forces and Lord President of the Council. Stanhope continued as first minister. Despite assurances given to her by Walpole, the Princess and her husband were not given full access to their children. Although she remained politically aligned with him, the Princess considered that she had been exploited by Walpole during the reconciliation. Aftermath After reconciling with his Whig opponents, Sir Robert Walpole became the Prime Minister from 1721 to 1742. During the scandal over the South Sea Bubble, many prominent Whigs were forced to leave office. Although Walpole had not been involved in the management of the bubble, he defended those who had. Two months after Stanhope died while himself defending the government's conduct in the House of Lords, Walpole was appointed to replace him. Led by Walpole at the 1722 general election the Whigs won a decisive victory. His premiership lasted for over twenty years, firmly establishing the Whig Party's ascendancy. Walpole was subsequently accused of hypocrisy for attacking in opposition many of the same policies that he later advocated in government.Black p.16 In the 1730s, a fresh group of Whigs split off to form the Patriot Whigs and established a working alliance with the Tories. In 1742 their combined strength was sufficient to bring down the Walpole government. However Whig dominance continued under Henry Pelham, a long-standing minister under Walpole, and his successor the Duke of Newcastle. ReferencesBibliography * Black, Jermey. Walpole in Power.

The game is being developed by WB Games Montr√©al and will be published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. It is set to be released in 2021 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It was first revealed at DC FanDome in August 2020. The game's story takes place some time after Batman's apparent death. With the GCPD having grown corrupt following James Gordon's death, there is a rise of crime and lawlessness in the city, leaving Batman's allies ‚Äì Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and Red Hood ‚Äì as the only ones able to restore justice to Gotham and prevent it from descending into chaos. At some point during the game, the heroes will come into conflict with the Court of Owls, a secret criminal society that is as old as Gotham itself, and their legion of brainwashed assassins called Talons. Gameplay Gotham Knights is an action role-playing game set in an open world Gotham City. The game features four playable characters: Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and Red Hood; each character has their own unique playstyle and abilities, such as Robin being able to teleport via the Justice League's satellite. While it can be played solo, the game also features a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode, wherein the second player can drop in and out at any time without affecting the other one. Players can level up their characters, but enemies will be automatically leveled up as well. They can also use the Batcycle to explore the city. Setting and characters The game is set in Gotham City, after the deaths of Batman (voiced by Michael Antonakos) and Police Commissioner James Gordon, which has resulted in a rise of crime and lawlessness. Players assume the role of Batman's former proteges ‚Äì Dick Grayson / Nightwing (Christopher Sean), Barbara Gordon / Batgirl (America Young), Tim Drake / Robin (Sloane Morgan Siegel), and Jason Todd / Red Hood (Stephen Oyoung) ‚Äì as they attempt to continue his legacy by protecting Gotham upon receiving a pre-recorded message from Batman. During the game the heroes encounter several supervillains, including the Court of Owls and Mr. Freeze. Supporting characters include Bruce's former butler Alfred Pennyworth (Gildart Jackson) and Police Captain Renee Montoya, one of the few honest cops left in the city. Despite WB Games Montr√©al's previous work developing Batman: Arkham Origins, and the fact that Gotham Knights features many of the same characters from the Batman: Arkham series, the new game is an original story separate from those games.

The area contains three dams and receives its water source from Backus Creek, which itself flows into the Cut River and eventually to Houghton Lake. The state game area is mostly surrounded by undeveloped state forest lands, which are part of the Roscommon section of the Au Sable State Forest. Only a small portion along the western boundary consists of private property. It is accessible by several unmaintained dirt roads, with the main entrance being Backus Creek Road off M-18 (North Roscommon Road). Interstate 75 (I-75) forms the northeastern boundary of the state game area. M-55 and M-157 are to the south but not within the area's boundaries. The state game area's headquarters are located at the Roscommon DNR Service Center and Wildlife Office at 8717 North Roscommon Road to the north at exit 239 off I-75 (M-18 and BL I-75). The nearest sizable communities include Prudenville and Houghton Lake to the southwest and St. Helen to the northeast. The village of Roscommon is located to the north, and West Branch is the nearest incorporated city to the east. Located to the south, the Denton Creek Flooding State Wildlife Management Area is the next nearest unit managed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Backus Creek State Game Area is one of 12 state game and wildlife areas located within Roscommon County. History Prior to state ownership, the land was under single private ownership. The Backus Lake Dam was first constructed in 1937 and created the artificial wetlands. The surrounding land was purchased by the state of Michigan through a grant allocated by the Pittman‚ÄìRobertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act. The state game area was dedicated on October 13, 1954. Soon after its establishment, two additional dams were constructed in 1956 to expand the artificial wetlands to enhance the recreational area. In 2008, the state game area was expanded to include the southern Backus Lake Flooding near the original dam, which made the total area approximately . In 2017, Backus Creek State Game Area was also designated as a Grouse Enhanced Management Site (GEMS). There are currently 19 GEMS in the state of Michigan, which are designated bird hunting locations with advanced mapping and flora identifications. Being designated as a GEMS allowed the state game area to receive improvements in walking trails and mobility for hunters, in which the Backus Creek State Game Area consists of of maintained walking trails for hunters and hikers. Further mapping identifies 60% of the state game area consisting of aspen trees and also an abundance of conifers and tag alders. The area designated as a GEMS extends slightly further than the boundaries of the state game area. All three dams receive annual maintenance, and in 2019, the Backus Lake Dam and Backus Creek Dam were disabled to provide extensive reconstruction, while the Little Mud Dam remains operational. The water levels within the state game area were significantly reduced, as the two disabled dams have lowered the water level to the natural flow of Backus Creek. The two dams and their dikes will be strengthened to provide better water level control. The project is slated to be completed by late 2020, in which water levels in the reservoirs will slowly be restored. The state game area has remained opened during this project, although normal hunting and fishing activities are greatly reduced. Dams and reservoirs Downstream view of the currently disabled Backus Creek Dam undergoing reconstruction in August 2020 There are three artificial impoundments within Backus Creek State Game Area, which have expanded Backus Creek and created three subsequent reservoirs. The state game area consists of approximately of managed wetlands. The Backus Lake Dam () was first constructed further upland in 1937 and led to the creation of Backus Creek. This smaller dam created the uppermost impoundment, known as Backus Lake (or Backus Lake Flooding) at approximately . This larger impoundment marks the headwaters of Backus Creek and receives its water from natural runoff and the surrounding wetlands. The reservoir is also sometimes referred to as Mud Lake. The Backus Creek Dam and Little Mud Dam were built in 1956. Both dams are small, nearly identical barrage dams consisting of four spillways that are used for flood control. The Backus Creek Dam () is the second dam along Backus Creek, which flows in a northerly direction. Its construction created the Backus Creek Flooding. This reservoir is approximately . The farthest upstream dam is the Little Mud Dam () closer to M-18. Because of this dam's closer proximity to houses, it is considered a \\"high risk\\" and requires more frequent inspections. This dam creates Little Mud Lake (or Little Mud Lake Flooding) at approximately . The water flowing from the Little Mud Dam then flows unimpeded into the Cut River and a short distance to Houghton Lake. Activities The state game area provides a mixed-use of activities, while hunting remains the primary recreational activity. Common fauna hunted within the state game area include deer, turkey, bear (black bear), waterfowl, grouse, woodcock, snowshoe hare, and squirrel. Trapping is also permitted and includes beaver, muskrat, mink, and river otter. Coyote, fox, and raccoon can also be trapped in certain areas. The state game area has of designated walking trails for hunters. Fishing is also a popular activity but is not a main focus for development of the state game area. The water levels within Backus Creek and flooded areas can vary greatly depending on the time of the year and rainfall amounts. There are two rustic boat launches only suitable for kayaks and smaller canoes. Camping is permitted, although there are no designated camping locations. Hiking, birdwatching, and geocaching are also secondary activities within the state game area.

Tactics A common tactic used by colonial British troops was for reconnaissance and pinpointing the exact location of the Darawiish haroun to be a top priority. Once this was done, the intention was for colonial troops to make a surprise attack upon the Haroun once it was located, through the means of the most able and agile and tireless segments of the British army. Another tactic of the British colonialists was to attempt to corner the haroun in order to isolate the haroun from the dervish army. > My force is at present extended along South Nogal towards Adodero to cut off > the Haroun to the south , as a preliminary to regaining touch with the > Dervish force which moved east from Halin after the action at Jidballi on > the ... With the Abyssinians in Somaliland - Page 161 James Willes Jennings, > Christopher Addison Addison - 1905 - Defection Anjeel was a large tree just southwest of Eyl in Nugaal province of Somalia. The leader of the Darwiish, Sayyid Mohamed, referred to it as \\"The Tree of bad Counsel\\". It was named as such because of a meeting where a coup was planned beneath the tree in early 1910. In this meeting several senior members of the Daraawiish called for sedition in one way or another. Individuals who took part in this conspiracy include: *Haaji Hasan 'Awl, Darwiish governor *Abdalla Qoriyow, who was the Darwiish magistrate in Taleh *Ahmad Fiqi, who was a Darwiish theologian *Faarah Mahamuud Sugulle, who was head of the haroun and the wealthiest person in the Daraawiish *'Abdalla Shihiri, who was a Darwiish envoy *Nur Hashi, who was a khusuusi Three plans were put forth, including (a) killing the Sayyid and replacing him with a new leader, (b) replacing him without killing him, and (c) deserting the Darwiish en masse. At the end, the third plan was carried out. Colonial era excerpt describing Shire Umbaal (spelled as \\"Shire Um Belli\\") as a counseller (khusuusi) and threatening the Majeerteen tribe for defecting. Notification The Sayyid was informed about the conspiracy by a man of the Jama Siyaad subclan called Shire Cumbaal, also spelled Shire Umbaal. The exact words spoken by Shire Cumbaal was: Aftermath The Times excerpt describing Shire Umbaal (spelled Shireh Ambaleh), Adam Maleh, and Nur Hiddig as the Darwiish military leaders in 1910. Due to Shire Umbaal's defection from the seditious meeting, and the subsequent notification, the Daraawiish managed to capture many leading conspirators. Haan 'Awl was subsequently killed. Farah Mohamud Sugulle as the leader of Anjeel who sought to usurp the Sayyid's position had his father killed, although his own life was spared. Qoriyow was punished by the decision to have him demoted by stripping him of his previous position. Other figures had fled. The Reer Khalaf, a Majeerteen subclan who had previously been of the Taargooye wing of Darwiish, joined the defectors. As such, they were decimated in retaliation. Confrontations between Darwiish defectors and persistent Darwiish endured for a couple of years, but among the most prominent of these confrontations was the Hadega battle in March 1910 wherein the defectors had been aided by the Issa Majeerteen tribe. Nonetheless, at Hadega, notable casualties occurred on both sides, with Nur Dolbas (Dhalbaas) and Adan Egal (Cigaal) dead on the defectors sidehttps://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/apr/05/somaliland and Darwiish leaders Shire Umbaal and Adam Maleh were dead on the Darwiish side, with Shire Umbaal later being described by Robert Crewe-Milnes as \\"a very important leader of the Dervishes\\".https://api.parliament.uk/historic- hansard/lords/1910/apr/07/somaliland Another Darwiish leader Nur Hidig, the father of Qusuusi member Abdi Nur Hidig, was permanently debilitated from wounds sustained at this battle.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/33240578/ References Category:Nugal, Somalia Category:Individual trees Category:Political organisations based in Somalia ","title":"Haroun (Fadhiweyn)"},{"id":"65046076","text":"Types of art techniques There not an agreed upon definition of what constitutes art.

The chickens lay blue/green eggs, weighing 50-65 grams. The pedigree book of the breed is kept by the Svenska Kulturh√∂nsf√∂reningen - The Swedish Cultural Hen Association. Looks The Silverudd blue chicken is a medium sized chicken, weight ranging from 1,5 kilos (hen) to 2,5 kilos (rooster). It is a friendly, lively hen, active and quick in it's movements and reactions. Color The chicken itself is black, blue or splashed in color. The original, genetic base color of the Silverudd blue is black, which is genetically decolored to blue and splashed. Silverudd blue young hens Black Silverudd blue chickens have peacock iridescence in their otherwise pitch black/ebony plumeage. Their feathers shimmer in the sunlight. The hens are usually a solid black, the roosters display shimmering metallic hackles (neck) and saddle (back), usually adorned with silver, occasionally gold. Blue Silverudd blue chickens range from a pale grey-blue to a much darker blue, almost indigo tone. The hen can have one solid color, or have a blue tone with darker patches. The blue silverudd roosters display the same kind of metallic hackles and saddles in silver or gold as the black ones. Splashed Silverudd blue chickens have a white base color, with a blue spotted pattern throughout their feathers. They hatch as white or a creamy yellow, before their adult feather costume is grown out.. History When Martin Silverudd passed away in 1986, the Silverudd blue breed was called \\"Swedish green egg layer.\\" It was most likely not finished as a breed. Thus, the breed is today varying in size, egg shell color, and body size. The breed was initially (and wrongfully) called Isbar, but has later been renamed \\"Silverudd blue\\" to honour its creator. To create the breed, Martin Silverudd used a smaller individual of the New hampshire chicken breed, together with a Rhode Island Red individual. To create the pale blue egg shell color, he used some Creme legbar individuals. The characteristic blue color of the feathers probably is inherited from Australorp chickens. The breed is regarded as one of the old, Swedish cultural chicken breeds.

Chinese irredentism refers to irredentist claims to territories of the former Chinese Empire made by the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). Background In Chinese political theory, relations between foreign states were governed by the tributary system. Since the Emperor of China held the Mandate of Heaven, his rule was universal and extended to all under Heaven. Sometimes neighboring states were actual protectorates or vassal states over which Chinese dynasties exerted large amount of influence, while in other cases foreign states merely acknowledged China's nominal suzerainty in order to gain access to Chinese trade, which took place through the tributary system.  Qin dynasty  Ying Zheng of the state of Qin first unified the Chinese states to form the Chinese Empire in 221 BC. Under the Qin dynasty, China expanded southward and northward, clashing with ancient Baiyue, Dongyi and Xiongnu peoples.  Han dynasty  The Han dynasty expanded southward and established control over Vietnam. It also ruled over northern Korea and the Tarim Basin.  Sui dynasty  The Sui dynasty attempted to expand into the Korean Peninsula but was stopped after disastrous campaigns that contributed to the collapse of the dynasty. The Sui dynasty also reincorporated Vietnam and attacked Champa.  Tang dynasty  The Tang dynasty expanded greatly into Central Asia as far west as the Caspian Sea. The Tang dynasty aided Silla in defeating Goguryeo and Baekje, and the Tang subsequently established the Protectorate General to Pacify the East, the Ungjin Commandery, and the Gyerim Territory Area Command on the Korean Peninsula. In the north, the Tang dynasty extended its control into the Mongolian Plateau and southern Siberia with the Protectorate General to Pacify the North.  Song dynasty  The Song dynasty, in securing maritime trade routes that ran from Southeast Asia into the Indian Ocean, had established fortified trade bases in the Philippines. It also sought to reclaim Vietnam and various northern heartland from the rivalling Jin dynasty, but the campaigns were unsuccessful.https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33088188/5.Alexander%20Kim.pdf?sequence=1  Yuan dynasty  The Yuan dynasty incorporated northern Burma and Tibet into China.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290817649_The_Mongol_conquest_of_Tibet It also established the Zhengdong Province on the Korean Peninsula and ruled the area through the vassal kings of the Goryeo dynasty. However, its failed invasion of Vietnam and Japan, among others, led to the end of Yuan expansionist desires.  Ming dynasty  During the Ming dynasty, Chinese rule over Vietnam was re-established, but it lasted only 20 years and ended when Ming forces were defeated in the Battle of T·ªët ƒê·ªông ‚Äì Ch√∫c ƒê·ªông. After the failure, China stopped adhering to expansionism until the rise of the Qing dynasty.  Qing dynasty  The Qing dynasty inaugurated a new age in Chinese expansionism. The Qing invaded the Joseon dynasty and incorporated it into its tributary system. Outer Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang were incorporated into China following decades of territorial expansion.http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/repository/81009892.pdf The Qing dynasty also extended its control into Central Asia and annexed Taiwan, which was previously controlled by the Ming loyalist Kingdom of Tungning. However, the Qing dynasty had little success in its campaigns against Burma, Vietnam, and Nepal.https://www.historynet.com/the-first-tet-offensive-of-1789.htm Qing expansionism stopped following its defeat in the First Opium War which marked the start of the \\"century of humiliation\\".  Modern Chinese irredentism = Taiwan  Map showing the de jure territorial claims of the ROC and the PRC. The Republic of China (ROC) was established in mainland China in 1912 following the conclusion of the Xinhai Revolution which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty. The Chinese Civil War that broke out in 1927 was fought between the Kuomintang-led ROC government and the Communist Party of China (CPC). Since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the de facto territories of the ROC are limited to the Taiwan Area which includes the island of Taiwan (ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 by the Qing dynasty of China; handover to the Republic of China in 1945) and several other islands. Meanwhile, the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the CPC, controls mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Officially, both the ROC and the PRC claim de jure sovereignty over all of China (including Taiwan), and regard the other government as being in rebellion. Until 1971, the ROC was the representative of \\"China\\" at the United Nations (UN) and was a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power. In 1971, the PRC replaced the ROC as the representative of \\"China\\" at the UN. Since 1972, the ROC has been excluded from all UN subcommittees. After the UN switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC, many states followed suit. Since 2019, the ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with 14 UN member states and the Holy See; many other states maintain unofficial relations with the ROC. The UN formally designates ROC-held territories as \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\". The ROC currently participates in numerous international events and organizations under the name \\"Chinese Taipei\\" while the World Trade Organization officially refers to ROC-controlled territories as the \\"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu\\". The exclusive mandate claim of the ROC has softened with the rise of Taiwanese nationalism and Taiwan independence movement. The ROC's sovereignty claim over areas under the control of the PRC is also not actively pursued under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party-led government. The PRC and ROC have largely agreed under the One-China policy that only one China could be recognized as the legitimate government of all of China since 1992. However, skepticism from Taiwanese toward the PRC has intensified as a result of growing Chinese nationalist threat to attack the island if an independent Taiwanese state was to be created. Since the election of the independence-leaning Tsai Ing-wen, the PRC has conducted numerous military drills preparing for possible armed conflict with the ROC.  South China Sea  The Nine-dash line represents China's irredentist claims in the South China Sea. Territorial claims of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) in the South China Sea overlap with the claims of Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia. Further escalating the conflict, the PRC announced the establishment of Sansha City, which included the entirety of the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands.  East China Sea  The PRC frequently deploy ships since the 2010s to contest Japanese claim over the Senkaku Islands.  India  Map of Arunachal Pradesh, part of which is claimed by China as South Tibet. China has territorial disputes with India with regard to Kashmir and South Tibet, partly a consequence of the British expedition to Tibet which led to the annexation of the area by the British Raj under the Simla Convention. Tensions between the two countries have erupted into war several times, with the largest war being the Sino- Indian War of 1962 in which China was victorious and gained control over Aksai Chin, and the 1967 conflict in which India won. The 2020 border clashes, which caused casualties for both sides, further strained Sino‚ÄìIndian relations. China has reinforced its claim by publishing maps depicting South Tibet as Chinese territory. China also pushed forward to reinforce its claim over Sikkim and Ladakh, and consolidating border control in Aksai Chin.  Bhutan  On June 29, 2017, Bhutan protested to China against the construction of a road in the disputed territory of Doklam. On the same day, the Bhutanese border was put on high alert and border security was tightened as a result of the growing tensions. In 2020, China claimed that the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary was also part of the territory in dispute.

The primary functions of the building were to store recreational equipment and to serve as a viewing deck for \\"boating events and races that took place on the lake.\\" The design of the building consisted of two brick towers topped with Wright's classic Prairie School style roofs which were visible on the lake side of the building. On the opposite side of the building, a semicircular loggia made up the facade and the entrance on the street. Arches were used throughout the structure, including arched windows adorning each side of the towers in sets of three, arched doorways at the base of each tower on the shoreline, and a large arch situated in the center. The boathouse stood on its site on North Carroll Street in the Mansion Hill Historic District for 33 years until it was demolished in 1926.  References  * Storrer, William Allin.

The building was built in 1927 for the Ohio State Savings Association, a local bank. It was designed in the Art Moderne style by architects Simons, Brittain & English. For a short time, the building held the offices of its architects, and was the central office of sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma from 1929 to 1952. The building now holds office space, and has a steakhouse on the original banking lobby floor. Attributes and history Early view The Ohio State Savings Association commissioned the building around 1926. At the time of the building's construction, Gay Street was becoming a popular location for banks. It was designed in the Art Moderne style by Simons, Brittain & English. The building was completed in 1927, the same year and in the same style as the LeVeque Tower. The steel-frame building utilizes several building materials, including Litholite (a cast stone material) on the exterior of its first three floors, brick on the upper seven floors, and above an ornamental parapet made of multicolored terracotta. Two-story penthouses above it have similar ornamentation. The main entrance on Gay Street uses a warm mix of pale pink marble and polished brass, and includes an elevator lobby and decorative open stairway. It was built as one of several prominent banks in downtown Columbus. The building received extensive architectural press coverage due to its use of Litholite, a new building material at the time. It was operated by the Ohio State Savings Association, which claimed it had the heaviest bank vault door in the city. From 1928 to 1929, the building housed the Columbus office of its architect firm, Simons, Brittain & English. The building is only one of two bank and office towers by the firm still known to be standing, and the only one in the Art Moderne/Deco styles. The other still standing is the City Savings Bank & Trust Company building in Alliance, Ohio.https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/16000602.pdf From 1929 to 1952, the building was the headquarters to Kappa Kappa Gamma, a sorority in the U.S. and Canada. It was the organization's first official office; its prior space was in the private home of its executive secretary. The organization later moved to a historic house on Town Street, becoming the first sorority to own their own headquarters. Since 1998, the building's original banking lobby has housed a steakhouse restaurant, part of the Cameron Mitchell restaurant group. The restaurant interior maintains the original high ceilings with decorative plaster. The interior has intricate decorations, though it added numerous contemporary decorations as well.

It is one of the Three Great Noodles of Morioka, along with Morioka Reimen and Wanko soba. It is based on Zhajiangmian from China. History Before World War II Takashina Kanshou (È´òÈöéË≤´Âãù) visited Manchukuo, now Northeast China, and ate Zhajiangmian. In 1945 he returned to his hometown in Morioka and brought the dish with him. He recreated the miso paste many times on his return and incorporated the opinions of his customers to create a taste that was popular with the people of Morioka. It eventually evolved into its own unique dish that is now a speciality of Morioka with many restaurants and izakayas offering it. Overview Morioka Jajamen uses a thin udon noodle. It is served with a scoop of meat miso which is a combination of minced pork, onion, dried shitake mushrooms, water, vegetable oil, sake, garlic, ginger, miso, mentsuyu, sugar, black ground sesame, and sesame oil. It is then garnished with cucumber, spring onions, and ginger. After mixing the dish vinegar, chilli oil, or garlic can be added to taste. File:Morioka Jajamen.jpgBefore Mixing File:Morioka_Jajamen2.jpgAfter Mixing Chitantan Chi-tan-tan Near the completion of the dish, the eater may decide to turn it into Chitantan (). With the remaining sauce and a few noodles, a raw egg is cracked into the bowl. Boiling water is added to cook the egg and mix with the remaining sauce. Additional meat miso or condiments can be added to taste. The term Chitantan comes from the , but in the pronunciation changes to meet Japanese phonology, but the kanji is not used and is instead written in katakana for foreign imported words. For more information see Sino-Japanese vocabulary. Zhajiangmian Zhajianmian () is the inspiration for Morioka Jajamen, but has many differences. While Morioka Jajamen is a very uniform dish, Zhajianmian has many varieties. The type of noodles can be varied depending on region. As well the main sauce used differs from the Japanese miso base and instead uses sweet bean sauce. Korea also has their own unique variant of Zhajianmian called Jajangmyeon (ÏûêÏû•Î©¥).

It is scheduled to feature performances from many parts of the world following the international protocole against COVID-19 propagation. The telecast marks the 21st anniversary of the Latin Grammy Awards and will honor musical releases within Latin music released from June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. Nominations were announced on September 29.  Background  In March 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the Latin Grammy organization announced that its annual gala was still set for November 2020 and would feature changes. Starting this year, the Latin Grammys will include a category exclusively focused on reggaeton to prevent controversies and callings for boycott as happened the year before. Thus, a new category named \\"Best Reggaeton Performance\\" will be introduced this year. Also, the Latin Recording Academy has decided to stop using the term \\"urban music\\" following many controversies surrounding that term of how they're following the Grammy Awards steps. \\"Best Pop/Rock Song\\" and \\"Best Rap/Hip Hop Song\\" will substitute the \\"urban\\" categories, with the latter one including trap music. The \\"Best Flamenco Album\\" category will make its return to the Latin Grammys after being erased in 2018 due to the lack of competition. On August 18, the Latin Recording Academy announced the official date for the gala's celebration and its functioning. Under the slogan \\"Music Humanizes Us\\", the 2020 Latin Grammy Awards will be headquartered in the city of Miami, marking the first time the Latin Grammys are held in Florida since 2003. The ceremony will feature performances from all around the world and will, as of now, be without a live public.

Unfair treatment of outperformers occurs when focusing away from merit or biases lead to economic inefficiency or suboptimal choice in the wake of intransparent, arbitrary or nepotistic decision-making.

Foundation Discrimination is unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things.\\"Transcript of Civil Rights Act (1964)\\". Retrieved July 28, 2012. Attempts exist to legally abolish, economically counter-weight and societally alleviate the negative consequences of discrimination around the world. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution ban the federal and state governments from discriminating. The United States Employment Discrimination laws seek to prevent discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, physical disability, and age by employers. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lists as especially sensitive areas of discrimination attention age, disability, equal pay and compensation, genetic information, harassment, national origin, pregnancy, race and color, religion, retaliation, sex and sexual harassment. The European Union introduced an Anti-Discrimination Directive to ban discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation. The Lisbon Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union serves as legal protection against discrimination acknowledging equal rights for all human to be treated unbiased and with equal fairness and dignity. Higher education discrimination Discrimination of excellence includes the 2019 college admission fraud scandals, standardized admission test outperformers suing a U.S. higher education institution and the United States Department of Justice scrutinizing higher education over potential systemic biases in college admission standards that would underweight transparent standardized testing criteria. University and college admission and promotion criteria are critical career gatekeeping events, in which unexpectedly overweighting intransparent, non-merit based criteria can result in merit-based outperformers underperforming in admissions. Discrimination bias can occur in merit-based up-or-out placement and promotion criteria in hierarchical rank orders, when performance is partially measured on intangible or intransparent performance criteria implying potential economic inefficiency. Economic foundations Outperformance is the foundation of excellence. Overachievement is related to investments. Outperformance and overachievement are bases of the intellectual elites and related to luxury consumption. Overachievement instigates economic growth. John Maynard Keynes' multiplier effect attributes investments of overachievers as drivers of economic growth. Investments of the striving elite multiply in economic spending in the overall economy. Too-big-to-fail bailout and leadership arguments back the idea of bundling excellence in elites, whose larger-scaled overachiever projects are funded by long-term investments that stimulate economic growth. Consumption of the elite is an economic growth factor. Thorstein Veblen's trickling down of excellence emphasizes that luxury consumption is a driver of economic growth and accelerator of social enhancement and cultural advancement. Conspicuous consumption motivates others to strive to consume as well and be economically productive to achieve this goal. The American Dream ideals of striving to outperform are foundations of economic productivity. Economic inefficiencies of discrimination of excellence range from lost economic potential and inefficiencies, career-switching costs and diminishing human capital and labor productivity. Health and societal risks experienced in the wake of discrimination imply social, socio- psychological and emotional burdens. Historical foundations Slowing down overachievers and abolishing intellectual outperformance has occurred throughout history. Various regimes attempted to eradicate, cut down or slow performance and discourage individual striving. Societal structure Discrimination of excellence theory integrates the '√ºbergroup' in the social psychology social identity theory categorization of society into so-called 'ingroups' and 'outgroups.' '√úbergroups' capture the societal position of natural strivers who outperform and therefore are prone to face discrimination of excellence. Socio-demographic prevalences include age groups, hierarchical positions and seniority principles that may breed discrimination of excellence. Socio-psychological motives Socio-psychological motives and emotions that cause and accompany discrimination of excellence include envy, jealousy, inferiority complex, reputation greed and suboptimal group norms. Alleviation strategies Excellence is an asset of the economy and society. Protection from discrimination is grounded in human beings being treated with equal respect and dignity. Respect for excellence offers individual well-being derived from dignity, economic prosperity grounded in large-scale individuals' striving and societal advancement founded on overachieving elites. Legal codifications, economic action and public policy as well as corporate workplace incentives protect performance free from discrimination. Awareness building, transparency and mandatory access to information on hiring, testing and promotion criteria appear as natural remedies besides legal action to combat discriminating individuals, institutional and systemic structures. Cultures-of-excellence safe havens but also rescue funds for those whose career has taken a hit due to discrimination of excellence are discrimination alleviation strategies. In order to overcome a performance polarization between √ºbergroups and outgroups, √ºbergroups can transfer performance strategies to potentially underperforming outgroups, who can offer in lieu knowledge on discrimination coping strategies. The strategic alliance of out- and underperformers offers a more productive and anti-discrimination-sensitive workplace, economy, democracy and society.

Life Sister Mary de Lourdes Gogan was born Christina Grogan, also known as Chrissie, in Dunshaughlin, County Meath on 21 December 1908. Her parents were John, licensed vintner and general merchant, and Bridget Gogan (n√©e Caul). She was the second of eight siblings. She attended the local primary school and then the Mercy Convent, Arklow. She then entered the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin to train as a nurse, being awarded her RGN in 1932. She was a staff nurse in Pembroke Nursing Home, Dublin until 1936, and was a private nurse until 1940 until she entered the Medical Missionaries of Mary on 11 February 1940, the feast day of Our Lady of Lourdes. Gogan recounted the story that she joined the Medical Missionaries of Mary having met the foundress Mother Mary Martin when she was driving through Dunshaughlin and her car punctured a tyre. While that was being fixed, Martin was invited into the Gogan home for a cup of tea. She professed on 8 September 1942, joining the staff of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, studying midwifery in 1944. On 5 April 1945, Gogan along with Sr M. Aloysius Connolly, and Sr M. Philomena Doyle arrived in Ogoja, Nigeria to establish a medical service to eliminate the leprosy that was endemic in the region. Here they worked with Dr Joseph Barnes. She had responsibility for the treatment administration, which was injections of chaulmoogra oil, which was not a cure for the disease but a treatment for some of the symptoms. For her first few days there she taught basic nursing skills to the small group of boys who spoke English and they became her staff. Her fellow sisters were in charge of the practical day-to- day life. By the end of 1945, a routine service was established in the region and wider region. After this the sisters planned to open a similar service at Abakaliki, and a second unit at Obudu, near the Cameroun mountains. Gogan and Sr M. Brigid Kavanagh were assigned to Abakaliki. In the new region, the local language was Igbo, with a different culture of markets and farming. She was supported by the local missionary priests to introduce her and Sr Kavanagh to the local people. Their leprosy settlement was 4 miles from Abakaliki town with the only transport being by bicycle, despite this the leprosy service was successful. The first resident doctor was Dr Denis Freeman from Dublin. Dapsone tablets, an effective cure for leprosy, became the routine treatment by 1950. More medical services were being established in the diocese, when she returned from her first visit home to Ireland, Gogan was appointed the sister in charge at Ogoja as well as the regional superior at Obudu and the general and maternity hospital at Afikpo. In the following years, she was involved in the foundations of a number of general and maternity hospitals at Obudu, Ikom, Nkalagu and nDubia. SHe had been due to return home to Ireland for leave at the outbreak of the Nigerian civil war on 6 July 1967, but she chose to stay with her sisters until the battle front moved on from Ogoja diocese and the medical services were restored. She continued this work until 1969, when she was not physically fit enough to continue with missionary work. Gogan returned to Ireland in June 1969, where she became sister superior at Airmount Maternity Hospital, Waterford for five years. She lived at the Beechgrove convent and then the √Åras Mhuire Nursing Home, Drogheda for her final 6 years, where she died on 8 May 2000. She is buried in Drogheda.

Morrison and Richard Manuel sing the lead vocals as a duet, with Manuel taking the first verse and Morrison taking the second.

Rolling Stone Magazine critic Jon Landau described the theme of the song as being about \\"being a working artist\\". Berwyn Life critic Steve Sparacio stated that the lyrics work even though the lines sometimes seem to be strung together in ways that don't make sense, giving as an example \\"And I don't know whether to call or to check/But right now I feel like I got a royal flush/And my lady didn't show from 'Frisco/But we had to go on with the show.\\" Geoffrey Cannon of The Guardian praises the internal rhymes in some of Morrison's lines, such as \\"Oh Richard tell me who's got the joker and is it poker.\\" The \\"4%\\" in the title of the song refers to the difference in alcohol content between two brands of whiskey: Johnnie Walker Red and Johnnie Walker Black.

The territory of the region was principally made up of the two subordinate governorates of \\"Astara\\" and \\"Lankaran\\". The city of Astara was its administrative center, the base of Safavid power in the region.  Historiography = Primary sources  There is little information about the History of Talish in the early modern period. In contrast to other regions of the Persianate world, no Talish-based chronicles were written during the Safavid era. Two Persian chronicles were written after northern Talish became a Russian province. The first is the AkhbƒÅr NƒÅmeh (1882) (i.e., The Chronicle), written by Mirza Ahmad ibn Mirza KhodƒÅverdi. Another local chronicle is JavƒÅher NƒÅmeh-ye LankarƒÅn (1869) (i.e., The Jewel Book of Lankaran), written by Saeid-Ali ibn Kazem Beg BorƒÅdigƒÅhi (1800‚Äì1872). Another primary source that may be added to the chronicle-type sources is the Russian survey entitled Istoriia Talyshskogo khanstva (1885) (i.e., The History of the Talish Khanate) written by Teymur Bayramalibeyov (1863‚Äì1937). Two other group of primary sources are documentary material, and travel accounts. Irada Mammadova (born 1967) a historian who studied Russian archives for the matter, especially the Archive of Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire cleared some ambiguities of historiography of Talish. The Talish Khanate (1747‚Äì1828) was the turning point in the history of Talish, thus most of contemporary studies is focused on it.  Analysis  In 1966, Firudin Asadov (1936‚Äì2018), who first studied the pre-establishment of Talish Khanate, gave a brief description of the roots of the establishment of the Khanate in the 1703‚Äì1747 period and did not cover many of the events. Asadov also attributed the coming to power of the Seyyed Abbas, after the proclamation of Nader Afshar () as Shah. However, the decree for Seyyed Abbas was issued in 1654. The author confused \\"Seyyed Abbas\\" with \\"Mir Abbas\\". In the Saeid-Ali's book stated that the foundation of the future Talish Khanate was laid by Mir Abbas Khan who appointed on February 1654 as khalifa (spiritual deputy of the Shah) at the region by the decree of Shah Abbas II. According to The Chronicle, Seyyed Abbas ruled Talish province for 20 years, consisting of Ul≈´f, Dashtvand, and Ujarud districts. Asadov wrote in his book, Talish Khanate (1999), that Seyyed Mir Abbas Beg not only supports Nader's kingship, but even asked to be accepted his son, Seyyed Jamal al-Din, to serve in the Persian army. He wrote these materials based on Saeid-Ali, but there wasn't such a sentence in Saeid- Ali. The historian Mammadova didn't think Seyyed Abbas could have lived that long. Elsewhere, Asadov wrote that Seyyed Abbas' rule of the Talish Khanate did not last long, he died in 1749. If he died in 1749 (according to The Chronicle, his reign lasted 20 years), then he should have come to power in 1729. At that time, Nader was not Shah of Persia. On the other hand, Russian archival documents shows that Mir Abbas Beg was captured and beheaded by the Ottomans in 1726. Asadov wrote that Nader Shah ordered Seyyed Abbas to come to power in Talish. However, he does not say where he got it from. This would not be possible. Because, first of all, the archival documents says that he had killed. The second, is that in the Saeid-Ali's book, when Nader proclaimed himself as Shah, he wrote that Mir Abbas was no longer alive. The contradictions between the The Chronicle and The Jewel Book of Lankaran are obvious and far from reality. Mammadova believed that it would be right to prefer Saeid-Ali, because he approached the events from Mirza Ahmad's historical point of view, used the historical sources of his time and in some cases expressed a critical attitude. The author indicates the exact date of the decree, thus it can be assumed that he saw the decree. The Chronicle attributed this event to the period of Nader's rule and described that he turned from a poor man to the level of Lankaran's ruler. According to Mammadova, This is not convincing because it is incompatible with historical events. Seyyed Abbas is not mentioned in the works of Russian and foreign travelers who visited these areas, only Musa Khan is mentioned a lot. It should be concluded that there were two person with the name of \\"Abbas\\". The first was Seyyed Abbas, who founded the dynasty of Khans of Lankaran. The second was Mir Abbas or Abbas-Qoli Khan, who became a Khan in the early 18th century and was killed by the Ottomans in 1726. This is confirmed by other facts. An archival document mentions Mir Aziz Khan as brother of Mir Abbas Beg. Elsewhere, Mir Abbas Beg offers to entrust either his brother or his son to Russia to show his allegiance. Mammadova named Mir Abbas as son of Seyyed Abbas, but Khansuvarov believed that Mir Abbas was grandson of Seyyed Abbas. His father's name was Seyyed Y≈´sef, who succeeded his grandfather in religious affairs. Seyyed Y≈´sef was buried at Yuxarƒ± N√ºv…ôdi village of Lanakaran.  Administration  It is known that in the Safavid administrative division, the ulkas (i.e., country) were governed by a tribal leader, who was subordinate to the beylerbeys, but was either appointed by a shah's decree or given to any congregation, whose authority was still confirmed by the shah. In both cases, ruler of \\"ulka\\" was called hƒÅkem (i.e., governor). During the travel of Adam Olearius (1599‚Äì1671), ambassador of Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp to Persia, the governor of Astara was Saru Khan and the center was the city of Astara. He also showed that the rule of Qurchi-bashi in Lankaran and Huseyn Sultan's rule in Qizilaghaj (). There are contradictory opinions in the historical literature and sources about the management and administrative division of the region at the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries. Some of them shows that the region consisted of two administrative- territorial units, but others shows that it consisted of three units. Vidadi Muradov (born 1956) believes that the occurrence of this contradictory information was connected with the complex political situation existing in the region. The battles for power here led to frequent changes in the boundaries of territorial units and their rulers, and thus, to the emergence of contradictory information. A decree issued during the reign of Shah Sultan Husayn () states that in the Rajab 1115 AH (November 1703) the whole of Mughan, together with the city of Lankaran, was ruled by a ruler named Abbas- Qoli Khan. In Astara, Musa Khan was the ruler. In one part of a document translated by Vladimir Puturidze (1893‚Äì1966), Abbas-Qoli Khan is shown as the ruler of Mughan, and in the other part as the ruler of Lankaran and other territories. The Scottish traveler John Bell (1691‚Äì1780) visited Astara, Qizilaghaj and Lankaran From 12 December 1717 to June 1718 and mentioned the names of these places in his book. The Russuan envoy to Persia, Artemy Volynsky (1689‚Äì1740) visited the region in 1717‚Äì1718. He mentioned Astara, Lankaran and Qizilaghaj, and said that a Khan ruling in Astara and a Sultan ruling in Qizilaghaj. The Russian lieutenant Fedor Ivanovich Soimonov (1692‚Äì1780) and the Dutch cartographer Carl Van Verden (died 1731) whom set out in May 1720 to explore the Caspian Sea, wrote at the mouth of the Astara River that they had been greeted with great kindness and friendliness by the ruler of Astara, however they didn't mention the name of him. The historian Ilya Pavlovich Petrushevsky (1889‚Äì1977), based on Tazkirat al-Mul≈´k ( 1725), mentioned only two districts of Astara and Qaraaghaj. Astara, Ujarud (), Mughan and Qaraaghaj () are mentioned in the list of local governors in Tazkirat al-Mul≈´k. The Russian historian, Pyotr Grigorievich Butkov (1775‚Äì1857) indicated that Talish was governed by two rulers in the 1720s. He stated that the ruler named \\"Omir Agis\\" ruled Lankaran, and Musa Khan ruled Qizilaghaj. Mammadova took into account that in the Russian historical documents, the ruler of the Qizilaghaj was Bijan Sultan and Musa Khan was mentioned as ruler of Astara but Butkov shows him as the ruler of Qizilaghaj. She believed that Butkov's information is incorrect. According to above information, in 1720s, Lankaran and Mughan were managed by Mir Abbas Khan, Astara was ruled by Musa Khan and Qizilaghaj was administered by Bijan Sultan. In the Mirza Ahmad's book, Musa Khan is mentioned as the ruler of Astara consisting of Karganrud, Asalem, Vilkij, Drigh and Zuvand districts.  History = 16th century  alt= The Safavids' kinship with the ruling dynasty of the Talish had a serious impact on its socio-political life for several centuries. Apparently, this kinship was the reason that young Ismail Safavi () spent the winter of 1500 in the Archivan village of Astara. This played a major role in increasing the number of Safavid supporters. It might be assumed that the kinship with the Safavids was more advantageous for the Talish rulers. They became much stronger by relying on this kinship; even though they rebelled against the Safavids in the 1540s and 1590s, they were able to maintain their power. The leading figures of Talish were among the seven companions of Ismail in 1500's exodus from Gilan. The inherited rulers of Talish became active participants in the political processes at the second half of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th century. They assisted Safavids in the fight against the Aq Qoyunlu Confederation and Shirvanshahs' state. Highly praising their help, the Safavid rulers, included the Talishis in the ranks of the Qizilbash tribes. The presence of Talish chiefs in secondary posts affirms the relative importance of these figures in the Qizilbash. For example, At Baghdad's 1508 conquest, a Talishi was made governor of the city and all of Arabian Iraq. Also another Talishi chief was governor of Astarabad. Haydar (1554‚Äì1576) was a son of the Shah Tahmasp I (). The succession of Haydar, after his father's death, was supported by a complex coalition which consisted of some Talish elements at the royal court. This coalition was opposed by a similarly complex groups. In short order, this latter group captured and killed Haydar and freed his older half-brother Ismail II (). Aftermore, Enthronement of Abbas I () in Qazvin was supported by Talishis from Astara. According to the document which related to Babagil tomb, Bayandor Khan was the incumbent governor of Astara region in 1551. Bayandor Khan was the great ruler of Astara region for a long time during the reigns of Tahmasp I (), Ismail II () and Mohammad Khodabanda () and lived in Astara. During the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War, Amir Hamzeh Khan rebelled against his father, Bayandor Khan, and took control of the Astara region. In 1590‚Äì91, , who was appointed as the governor of Ardabil, nominated his brother Alvand Sultan as the ruler of Lankaran. Upon learning of Alvand's appointment as governor of Lankaran, Hamzeh Khan Talish tried to prevent him from taking up his post and spoke out against government troops. However, he was defeated and resisted in the Shindan Castle in the Talish Mountains. this event took place in 1000 AH (October 1591 ‚Äì October 1592). The castle was besieged for months, the resistance broken and Hamzeh Khan exiled to Ottoman-occuped Shirvan. Hamzeh Khan stayed in Shirvan and was killed there by the Shah's secret agents. Two years after the revolt of Amir Hamzeh, out of compassion for his sons, Bayandor II and Saru, Shah Abbas granted the rule of Astara to Bayandor II and after him, granted the hereditary territory to Saru Khan. Finally, Alvand Sultan Qaramanlu was installed, with the help of Safavid officials of Ardabil and the class of the Sheikhavand and Shahsevans.  17th century  In 1604, nomads of Talish were ordered to help the Georgian Prince Constantine I of Kakheti to retake the province of Shirvan. The deceased Hamzeh Khan's sons, Bayandor II and Saru, consistently ruled Talish and were on the list of great emirs. During the great revolt of the peasants against the Shah in Gilan and Talish, Saru Khan was appointed as sepahsƒÅlƒÅr (commander-in-chief) of the Shah's army. He suppressed the revolt with great cruelty and was therefore highly respected by Shah Safi (). In the list of emirs of 1628, Iskandar Beg Munshi ( 1560 ‚Äì 1632) mentioned two emirs of Talish: Saru Khan as the ruler of Astara; Badr Sultan as the ruler of several Talish districts. Seyyed Abbas was ordered to Lankaran in Rabi' al-Thani 1064 AH (February 1654) by the decree of Shah Abbas II (). The cause of this appointment was his bravery against the Ottomans. Seyyed Abbas was the figure that founded future dynasty of Khans of Lankaran. It is said that he had had a kinship with the Safavid dynasty. Persia's external borders came under pressure at the end of the 17th century. Turkoman tribesmen were raided the northern borderlands, entering Safavid territory as far as Astara and Farahabad in the Caspian region.  18th century  When the Russians captured Rasht in 1722, the ministers (vizier) of Astara and campaigned to Rasht. They had gathered the 15,000-strong troops to drive them out the Russians. During the invasion of the Caspian coast provinces in 1723, Mir Abbas Beg ruled in Lankaran and Mughan, Musa Khan in Astara, and Bijan Sultan in Qizilaghaj. After the occupation of Baku in August 1723, Mir Abbas Beg wrote a letter to major-general Mikhail Matyushkin (1676‚Äì1737) and declared his allegiance to him. According to the Treaty of Constantinople in 1724, the Caspian coast provinces from Derbent to Astrabad were to be under Russian protection. However, during the Russian occupation of the Caspian coast provinces in 1722‚Äì1735, the Talish rulers maintained their authorities. In 1725, the Ottomans captured Ardabil. In 23 December, Russian major-general Vasily Yakovlevich Levashov (1667‚Äì1751) demanded that the Ottomans abide by the terms of the agreement between the two empires and withdraw from Ardabil. However, the Ottoman side not only rejected this demand, but even captured Astara and Karganrud in 1726. This caused the Russians to protest. Ali Pasha of Ardabil explains the occupation of Astara and Karganrud as follows: However, the strict tax policy of the Ottomans soon led to a popular uprising. They demanded 140,000 manats from the people of Astara. The main cause of this uprising, the Astara's Khan, had to seek Russian protection for fear of being punished by the Ottomans. All this created favorable conditions for the capture of Astara and nearby provinces by the Russians. Mir Abbas beg, ruler of Lankaran, asked the Russian commander's office in Baku to send some troops in boats to Sari island without delay and said that Mir Abbas beg would stay on Sari Island until Russian troops captured Lankaran. He wanted weapons and ammunition and said that he had gathered a group of a thousand people. Some times earlier, Mir Abbas Beg's brother, was against the Russians. Mir Aziz Khan began to speak to his brother, citing the example of Musa Khan from Astara under Ottoman protection. Soon, a conflict arose between the two brothers, probably as a result of a certain plot by Musa Khan of Astara. At the same time, the Ottomans captured and killed Mir Abbas Beg. After that, Mir Aziz Khan was afraid and had to seek Russian protection. According to Levashov, in October 1726, Musa Khan was under the protection of the Ottomans and had several Ottoman warriors with him to protect him. After the Ottomans withdrawal from Astara, in autumn 1726, Musa Khan came to Rasht in order to ask general Vasily Vladimirovich Dolgorukov (1667‚Äì1746), commander-in-chief of the Russian forces in Caucasus, protect them from revenge, promising his allegiance to Russia and asking for Russian protection. Instead of the Russians help, he agreed to pay a certain amount to the Tsar's treasury. On 8 December 1726, Musa Khan and his courtiers took an oath of allegiance to Russia. He was the ruler of Astara and Karganrud regions in that time. On 18 March 1727, the Qizilaghaj's Sultan, Bijan, came to Dolgorukov and swore his allegiance to the Russia. By confirm of Dolgorukov, Bijan remained his rule. Bijan's origin was Georgian. Dolgorukov decided to capture the lands from Gaskar to Salyan. In January, brigadier- general Shternshants, who sent by Dolgorukov, arrived in Astara with 500 troops. Following him, Dolgorukov, along with 300 dragoons, moved Astara. Musa Khan welcomed him with pleasure and promised to build a fortress in Astara by his own expense. Dolgorukov promised him the emperor's patronage, which would be confirmed him as the ruler of Astara province. Instead, Musa Khan promised to pay 50,000 from the income of Astara and Karganrud provinces to the Tsar's treasury. Dolgorukov instructed Shternshants to build a fortress in Astara. Also, he gave the administration of the districts of Astara, Karganrud and Lankaran to Shternshants. On 12 December 1727, a treaty was signed between the Russian and Ottoman empires at the village of Mabur (near Shamakhi). According to the decision of the representatives of the both states, the Russian troops kept a share of Mushkur, Niyazabad, Javad, Salyan, Lankaran, Astara and Qizilaghaj regions and Talish Mountains, but without using weapons. After capture of Astara, Shternshants headed for Lankaran with his army. Mir Aziz Khan initially had a negative attitude towards to the arrival of Russian forces. Learning the enemy position of the Lankaran's ruler, Shternshants sent his troops there, but Mir Aziz Khan avoided military clashes, except small skirmishes. Finally, Mir Aziz Khan found that they could not resist the Russian troops, so accepted the patronage of the Russian Empire and undertook to pay at least 5,000 manats a year. Shternshants ordered to build a fortress in Astara and in the village of Jil at the Lankaran's countryside. In connection with Dolgorukov's return to Moscow in 1728, the administration of Gilan and Astara was entrusted to Levashov. According to Levashov, Mustafa Pasha of Ardabil repeatedly tried to persuade Musa Khan to take his side. The Ottomans, with the help of a person called Veysel, and other locals who had attracted to the Ottoman side, inflicted heavy damage on the Russian government of the Caspian coast. In 1728, Veysel carried out a series of guerrilla raids on Astara and other districts. Levashov informed Ivan Neplyuyev (1693‚Äì1773), the Tsar's secret envoy to Constantinople, about these events and wrote that he attacked Astara province with 600-700 troops. On 28 August 1730, general Famitsy informed Dolgorukov that Musa Khan had left one of his sons in Rasht and the other in Astara and joined the Mohammad-Qoli Khan, the Ottoman governor of Khalkhal. Jafar Sultan and the ruler of Karganrud, Zarb-Ali Beg, also joined them. The main reason for his departure was the boundless suspicions of Russian general Famitsy. It seems that the Russian government not only limited the power of the local feudal rulers, but also treated them with suspicion and strict control. Levashov informed the Empress Anna () that Musa Khan attacked the Cossack squads, killed 3 soldiers and wounded 3 soldiers. This time, Musa Khan was seen with Mohammad-Qoli Khan in Ardabil. According to Levashov, in September 1730, many insurgents gathered in Lankaran and Arkivan districts. As the whole of Karganrud revolted, general Famitsy sent colonel Stupish with a detachment of 500 troops. In 13 December, he came from Astara to Karganrud and returned to Astara on 13 January 1731 when colonel Stupish burnt several villages and destroyed a large number of rebels. Thus, the uprising showed that the native people were not inclined to the Russians. When Musa Khan returned to Astara in September 1730, taking into account his prestige among the population, the Russian officials reappointed him. According to the Treaty of Rasht which signed on 1 February 1732, Russia undertook the territories of south of the Kura river, and according to the Treaty of Ganja in 1735, the territories of north of the Kura river were returned to the Persia, and Russian troops were completely withdrawn from these territories. In 1730s, a large part of the region was ruled by Musa Khan, who recognized Nader's power. It should also be noted that in this period, the situation in the region was extremely problematic. The continuous wars led by Nader and heavy tax policies have seriously worsened people's situation a great deal and triggered rebellions in the region. Nader ruthlessly suppressed one of these rebellions in Astara in 1734.  Economy  Astara and Lankaran were among the important cities through trade routes, specially Astara was through the silk routes of northern Iran. That much of the silk transported for manufacture in Italy at this time indeed originated in Iran. seta talani was the name of silk of Talish. Apparently, the Chinese silk was no match to the silk of Talish in type and price.  list of governors = Astara  * Mirza Mohammad Talish (?‚Äì1530s) * Qobad Khan (?‚Äì1539) * Bayandor Khan I (1539‚Äì1581) * Hamzeh Khan I (1581‚Äì1592) In 1593, Shah Abbas I granted the region to Farhad Khan Qaramanlu as tuyul. * Bayandor Khan II (1610‚Äì1628) * Saru Khan (1628‚Äì1648) * Qalich Khan (1648‚Äì1659) * Hamzeh Khan II (1684‚Äì1697) * Musa Khan  Lankaran  * Koke Takhan (1695‚Äì1697) * Abbas-Qoli Khan (1697‚Äì1726) * Aziz Khan (1726‚Äì )  Footnotes = Notes  References  Sources      * * Talish Talish Talish Talish Talish Talish Talish Category:History of Talysh ","title":"Safavid Talish"},{"id":"65046360","text":"Kaup is a village in Garhani block of Bhojpur district, Bihar, India.

There were various boundary changes in the period before the Congo Free State was annexed by Belgium to become the Belgian Congo. 1886 districts A decree of 3 September 1886 by the administrator general Camille Janssen defined nine districts in the colony, each headed by a district commissioner: *Banana *Boma *Matadi *Lukungu *L√©opoldville *Kin-Chassa (Kinshasa?) *Bangala *Stanley-Falls *Lubuku-Kassa√Ø Districts of the Congo Free State in 1888 1888 districts Article 3 of the decree of 16 April 1887 provided for the Congo Free State to be divided into administrative districts headed by district commissioners, assisted by one or more deputies. The decree of 1 August 1888 divided the Congo Free State into eleven districts, of which the first five were in the lower Congo region: :District (Capital) *Banana (Banana) *Boma (Boma) *Matadi (Matadi) *Cataractes (Lukunga) *Stanley Pool (L√©opoldville) *Kasa√Ø (Luluabourg) *√âquateur (Coquilhatville) *Ubangi-U√©l√© (Nouvelle Anvers); *Aruwimi-Uele (Basoko) *Stanley Falls (Stanley Falls) *Lualaba (Lusambo) Lualaba District had been formed from the southern part of Stanley Falls District. A 12th district was created, Kwango Central, on 10 June 1890. By 1890 there was a governor general resident in Boma and commissioners in these 12 districts. 1895 districts Districts of the Congo Free State in 1895 In 1895 the number of the districts was increased to fifteen. Aruwimi-Uele was split into two districts: Uele (Niangara) and Aruwimi (Basoko). Uele was threatened by the Arabs, and was placed under special administration. The districts were: * Banana * Boma * Matadi * Cataractes * Stanley Pool * Kwango * Kasai * Lac L√©opold II * √âquateur * Bangala * Ubangui * Uele * Aruwimi * Stanley Falls * Lualaba An 1897 map of the Congo Free State showed it divided into the districts of Banana, Boma, Matadi and Cataractes along the lower Congo River, then the district of Stanley Pool along the east bank of the river to the north. The district of Kwango Orientale was to the southeast of Stanley Pool District, south of a narrow extension along the Kasai River of the Lualaba Kassai District, which covered the Kasai and Sankuru river basins. The Lac L√©opold II District was north of the Kasai River and south of √âquateur District to the east of the Congo River. North of √âquateur the Bangalas District stretched along the northwestern section of the Congo River, and the Ubangi District defined the northeastern border of the colony with the French colonies, which lay across the Ubangi River. Further east the Uell√© District covered the basin of the Uele River, the main tributary of the Ubangi, and extended along the north of the colony to the Lado Enclave on the Nile, leased from Britain. The Aruwimi District lay to the south of Uell√© District along the Aruwimi River, formed where the Ituri River flowing west from the Lake Albert region meets the Nepoko River. The Aruwimi District had a long extension to the south of the Congo River along the west bank of the Lomami River. The remainder of the colony was covered by the huge Stanley Falls District, stretching south along the Congo into Katanga, bordered by the British and German possessions to the east of Lake Tanganyika and Lake Albert.

Later changes On 15 July 1898 the Stanley Falls District officially became the Orientale Province, with Stanleyville as its headquarters. A 1907 report listed 14 districts, with Lualaba and Kasai combined in one district as in the 1897 map. The Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 as the Belgian Congo.

His consideration was that the construction and maintenance of monorails in hilly terrain, apart from saving one rail, would be considerably cheaper than the usual two-rail tracks, such as those of the Cepu forest railway. As a result, monorails were built by plantation operators and wood processing companies throughout the mountains of Central Java. There were monorail lines in the Grobogan, Undakan, Monggot, Cepu and Djombang-Babat forest administrations. In 1919/1920, however, the hand-operated monorails gradually disappeared and were replaced by narrow- gauge railways with steam locomotives as forest utilization changed.Pernah ada Monorel hutan (forestry monorail) di Jawa.

According to South Sudanese Transport Minister Madut Biar Yol there were five crew members, all Russian nationals. According to early reports, the plane crashed into a residential area. It burned as residents approached it. Some reports indicated the aircraft was on a charter flight for the World Food Programme (WFP) when it crashed, and was carrying spare parts, motorbikes, food, as well as NGO staff salaries, though the WFP subsequently clarified that the aircraft had in fact been chartered by Galaxy Star International, a local company that provides services to the WFP and other UN agencies.

He founded Rhodes Homes in 1985, and has developed various housing projects in the Las Vegas Valley, including the golf course communities Rhodes Ranch and Tuscany Village. In the 2000s, he was a well known philanthropist in Las Vegas. In 2008, he formed Harmony Homes and began buying distressed properties during the Great Recession. He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009, and turned over most of his residential projects to creditors. Rhodes is considered one of Las Vegas' most controversial developers. Various lawsuits have been filed against him, alleging issues such as fraud, self-dealing, and home defects. In addition, several of his housing projects received opposition from nearby residents. Among the opposed projects is a series of controversial efforts to develop a residential community at Blue Diamond Hill, located west of Las Vegas near Red Rock Canyon. In 2005, he proposed five residential communities in Arizona, mostly near the city of Kingman. The communities would add 131,000 new homes, but residents and government officials were concerned about the amount of water that these projects would require upon completion. The projects never materialized, and Rhodes subsequently used some of the property as farm land beginning in 2013, when he formed Kingman Farms and developed an interest in agriculture. However, locals were still concerned about his use of water for the farming operations. As of 2017, Rhodes had built approximately 11,000 homes in the Las Vegas Valley as developer, and 25,000 to 30,000 homes working as a contractor. For the past 20 years, he had been one of the largest private homebuilders in Las Vegas. Early life Jim Rhodes was born in 1958, to parents Leonard and Betsy Rhodes. He grew up in Las Vegas and attended Clark High School. Leonard Rhodes was a dentist who had friends in real estate. Leonard's friends owned boats and planes, and this instigated Jim's desire for wealth. He later said, \\"My dream was to buy a Rolls-Royce or a Bentley or something, just to have it. Not that I wanted to drive it ‚Äî just that I was able to do it.\\" In his youth, Rhodes mowed lawns and also worked at the Las Vegas Country Club, where he washed towels and tennis courts. There, he met various business moguls, furthering his interest in wealth. He spent four years saving money to buy a Chevrolet Corvette. After high school, Rhodes moved to Idaho, where he worked at a ski resort and lost much of his money. He returned to Las Vegas in 1977. Leonard had been disappointed with his son's life choices and forced him to move out. Jim Rhodes sold his Corvette for $4,200 and hoped to acquire wealth through blackjack betting at the Mint casino, but lost most of his money. He subsequently moved in with a friend and used a bicycle as transportation, working odd jobs as a laborer. Career Rhodes soon began framing houses in Las Vegas, and started a subcontracting firm a few months after moving out of his father's home. By the age of 21, he had a crew of approximately 100 people and earned up to $100,000 a year. In 1984, Rhodes became a contractor and started building his own houses. He founded Rhodes Homes in 1985, and served as its president. He also held the position of chief executive officer for 21 years. Rhodes Companies was founded in 1988. Three years later, Jim Rhodes purchased property in southwest Las Vegas and built the Spanish Hills community on the land. Other residential communities followed thereafter. In the mid-1990s, Rhodes Homes built Palm Gardens and Elkhorn Springs, located respectively in the southeast and northwest Las Vegas Valley. Two other projects, Palm Canyon and Palm Hills, were built at the base of Black Mountain in Henderson, Nevada. In 1996, he proposed a residential project known as Rhodes Ranch in the southwest Las Vegas Valley. The project proceeded despite opposition from residents in what was then a rural area. Rhodes Ranch opened in 1997. It includes a golf course designed by Ted Robinson. Rhodes Ranch is Rhodes' signature project, and it later became one of the most successful master-planned communities in the Las Vegas Valley. Another prominent project is Henderson's Tuscany Village, originally proposed by Rhodes in the 1990s as Palm City. The site for Palm City was located near sewage ponds and a longtime manufacturer of chemicals which had contaminated the land. Ground water was also found to have high radioactive levels, but Rhodes Design and Development Corporation planned to proceed with the project, as local officials had yet to declare a health concern. Nearby residents were concerned about the presence of chemicals, as well as the size of Palm City and the increased traffic that the project would bring to the area. After Rhodes' lender became insolvent, he sold the undeveloped land in 2000, and it was renamed Tuscany. However, he later took back control of the project. Tuscany opened in the mid-2000s, and includes a golf course designed by Robinson. Since 2003, Rhodes has been involved in several controversial efforts to develop a residential community at Blue Diamond Hill, located west of Las Vegas near Red Rock Canyon. In the meantime, Rhodes has operated a gypsum mine on the site, known as the Blue Diamond Mine. Rhodes sold approximately 1 million tons of gypsum each year. Outside Nevada In April 2004, Rhodes began to consider the idea of residential development in Arizona. Later that year, he purchased 2,500 acres in Mohave County, Arizona. In 2005, he announced his plans to develop residential projects in Golden Valley and White Hills, both in Mohave County near the city of Kingman. In Golden Valley, Rhodes had acquired 5,760 acres for development, and the project there would include a golf course and a recreation center. Rhodes also planned to open a Golden Valley park with two baseball fields. More than 3,000 acres had been purchased for the White Hills project. Both sites were considered desirable because of their location between Las Vegas and Phoenix. The completion of the Hoover Dam Bypass project was also viewed favorably, as it would cut down on the amount of travel time between Las Vegas and the proposed communities. During 2005, Rhodes built 69 homes in Kingman to test the local market. The homes sold out in seven hours. Later in the year, Rhodes Homes announced plans for five master-planned communities in Arizona, containing 131,000 houses spread across more than 20,000 acres. The projects were planned as bedroom communities to Las Vegas. The Mohave County Planning and Zoning Commission recommended approval of four of the projects, which initially received little opposition from the public. Rhodes formed a water company to serve residents of the future communities. Among the projects was Golden Valley Ranch, which would have more than 33,000 homes; and The Village at White Hills, with approximately 20,000 homes. Golden Valley Ranch would have similarities to Rhodes Ranch, such as a golf course designed by Robinson. Two other approved projects, Peacock Highlands and Peacock Vistas, would be located northeast of Kingman, near the Peacock Mountains. They would contain a total of 59,000 homes on more than 9,200 acres. Despite some opposition from locals, the Mohave County Board of Supervisors granted preliminary approval in late 2005 for four of the communities. The fifth, known as the Retreat at Temple Bar, was rejected. It was to include 19,000 homes on approximately 3,000 acres. The National Park Service opposed the project, which would have been located within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. In addition, residents in Boulder City, Nevada were concerned about the amount of traffic that would travel through their city, located in between the proposed Arizona communities and Las Vegas. In 2006, Rhodes prevailed in a bidding war to purchase approximately 57,000 acres of New Mexico land from Westland Development Company. The property, mostly vacant, was located west of Albuquerque. Rhodes was to purchase the land through one of his companies, Sedora Holdings. However, another company ultimately outbid Sedora. At the end of 2006, Rhodes paid $58.6 million to purchase more than 1,000 acres of state trust land in Apache Junction, Arizona, where he planned another residential community, separate from the other five. Rhodes also had the rights to master- plan another 6,700 acres of surrounding land in Apache Junction. The Golden Valley project later became known as Pravada. Construction was temporarily suspended in April 2007, because of approval issues concerning land use, zoning, and water availability. Only four model homes had been built, and construction was expected to resume once approval had been granted. Some local residents welcomed the Pravada project, while others were against it and the growth it would bring to the area. Residents and government officials were also concerned about the large amount of water that Pravada would require. Rhodes sought approval to operate his water company in Mojave County for his residential projects. The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) debated for years whether to approve Rhodes, as there were concerns about his past legal problems, as well as a lack of water in the area. Rhodes testified to the commission in April 2007 that he was usually the victim in past legal disputes, blaming employees or immoral lawyers and business partners. The ACC considered Rhodes' plans a top priority and one of the most important cases in its history. The Arizona Department of Water Resources conducted a preliminary study which indicated that there was not enough water in the area to support the various residential projects. Rhodes and the Mohave County manager later worked together to put pressure on the ACC to get approval for the water company. This caused concern about Rhodes receiving favorable treatment from county staff. Rhodes had also donated to congressional members of Arizona. In a separate case, the Arizona Department of Water Resources granted an application to another Las Vegas developer, Leonard Mardian, for water rights in Mohave County. Mardian's application had been filed after Rhodes had already requested the water rights, but Mardian's was approved first as it was considered a complete application. This reduced the amount of water that Rhodes would be eligible to take. Rhodes sued the water department, stating that his application should have been approved first. Rhodes' affiliation with a Nevada politician became a topic of concern during his effort to get water approval in Arizona. In the 2000s, Rhodes had close connections with members of the Clark County Commission, and he was a major financial contributor to commission campaigns. Commissioner Erin Kenny was a resident in Rhodes Ranch, and she was later charged in a bribery scheme that was investigated through Operation G-Sting. Strip club owner Michael Galardi, a witness in the case, told the FBI that Rhodes had paid commissioner Kenny $20,000 a month to work in his favor while she was on the county commission, a claim that Rhodes denied. Rhodes was also a significant donor to Kenny's failed 2002 campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada. After she left the commission in 2003, Rhodes hired her to work as a consultant for $200,000 a year. He continued to pay for her services even after she admitted to bribery later in 2003. Rhodes' relationship with Kenny became a subject of interest for Arizona officials. Rhodes responded that he was no longer paying Kenny and that the matter was irrelevant to ACC's approval of water rights. However, in July 2007, a judge ordered that the ACC's investigation into Rhodes be reopened after the revelations involving Kenny came to light. The ACC had questions about why Rhodes continued to pay Kenny $200,000 a year after she admitted to the bribery scheme. In late 2007, Rhodes sold his Arizona water company to an Illinois firm that would manage it, negating the need for him to get approval from the ACC. The sale made it unlikely that Rhodes would have to testify about his relationship with Kenny. He sold the company in hopes of expediting development of the proposed communities. Rhodes subsequently stated that there was enough water to last 100 years for residents of Pravada. In 2008, the Mohave County Board of Supervisors approved a zoning plan and development agreement for Pravada, despite continued opposition from some local residents. By the end of 2008, Rhodes hoped for construction of Pravada to begin in a year. However, the proposed communities in Arizona never materialized. Great Recession As the Great Recession began, Rhodes used it to his advantage by buying low-priced lots, allowing him to affordably build homes and make a profit unlike other builders. Rhodes Homes was prohibited from purchasing distressed property, due to a 2005 loan agreement with Credit Suisse. Rhodes formed a development firm, Harmony Homes, to purchase such property instead. The firm was founded in 2008, and sold an average of 400 houses a year. Harmony Homes later expanded to southern California. By 2009, Rhodes had earned revenue of $2.4 billion, while Rhodes Companies had developed 40 communities and had built more than 6,000 homes in the Las Vegas Valley. Rhodes Companies soon defaulted on the 2005 loan from Credit Suisse. Rhodes Companies and 31 affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2009. Rhodes estimated that there would be 5,000 to 10,000 creditor claims in the case, but said the filing would have only a minimal impact on daily operations. The filing would also have no impact on plans to develop a community in Apache Junction. At the time, Rhodes Homes was the third-biggest private homebuilder in southern Nevada. The company had liabilities of $390 million, but only $100 million in assets. The demise of Rhodes Homes was partially attributed to Jim Rhodes' plan to build thousands of homes throughout Arizona, despite infrastructure issues. The main assets of Rhodes Companies included Rhodes Ranch and Tuscany. The companies had less than 100 employees. A group of creditors, including Credit Suisse, sought to replace Rhodes with a trustee to operate his companies. The creditors claimed that Rhodes was irresponsible with finances, alleging that he had recently used company funds to pay family members large sums of money for limited services. The creditors also alleged that Rhodes gave himself a $75,000 bonus in addition to his annual $400,000 salary. It was also alleged that he used corporate money to make payments to his ex-wife, Deborah Rhodes, as part of a divorce settlement. Simultaneously, Rhodes was sued in a separate case by a local bank for failing to make loan payments. The creditors later withdrew the motion to replace Rhodes, letting him retain control of company operations. Later in 2009, Rhodes agreed to turn most of his Nevada properties ‚Äì including Spanish Hills ‚Äì over to lenders to close the bankruptcy cases. Residents of Tuscany welcomed the news of Rhodes' departure, as they felt that Rhodes had mismanaged the community's homeowner association (HOA). In recent years, the HOA had seen frequent changes in its board presidents and community managers, and residents alleged that community upkeep had been neglected. Creditors led by Credit Suisse were owed $370 million, and they took over control of Rhodes Ranch and Tuscany in January 2010. Later that year, Rhodes paid $1.4 million to buy back 1,600 acres in Golden Valley. The land was part of the unfinished Pravada project, which had four model homes and five unfinished homes, all of which faced the possibility of demolition. In 2012, Rhodes had concerns that the trustee in charge of his former Rhodes Companies was planning to sue him for misuse of corporate funds. In response to the potential lawsuit, Rhodes sought to remove the judge, Linda Riegle, from the case. Rhodes' lawyer stated that Riegle displayed \\"open and blatant animosity towards Rhodes and his business practices\\" during an earlier hearing, and that she had encouraged the trustee to file a lawsuit. Riegle denied the allegations and the request that she be taken off the case. Later in 2012, creditors filed a lawsuit against Rhodes, alleging that he had misused $132 million in company funds, resulting in the 2009 downfall of his companies. Rhodes stated that the bankruptcy filing was caused by the Great Recession, not wrongful spending. Despite the earlier takeover of Rhodes' properties, lenders were still owed $302 million. Creditors wanted to seize Rhodes' land at Blue Diamond Hill to recoup their losses. During 2012, because of poor economic conditions caused by the Great Recession, Rhodes returned 1,000 acres of Apache Junction land to the state of Arizona. Rhodes lost $18 million on the failed project. Farming In 2013, Rhodes ventured into the farming industry. He founded Kingman Farms and began using land in Golden Valley that was previously planned for Pravada. Rhodes grew alfalfa and melons on the property. In addition, he owned two sites at Red Lake, also near Kingman. At one of the sites, he sold the land to Red Lake Ventures, a limited liability company formed in April 2014. The two partnered, with Red Lake Ventures employing Kingman Farms to farm on the land. Their partnership ended less than five months later, as Red Lake Ventures was displeased with the work. Meanwhile, Rhodes sought a land exchange with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to increase his acreage at the other Red Lake site for further farming. The BLM later found that Rhodes had illegally built a road on part of BLM property, and had also destroyed a historic section marker in the process, which is a federal crime. The proposed land swap never took place. Like his housing projects, the farming operations also drew a negative response from local residents. Rhodes' farms required a significant amount of water, causing concern among locals, who also complained of severe dust caused by the farming operations. Harmony Homes spent $30 million on farming equipment and workers for the Kingman Farms venture. Farming took up most of Rhodes' time, partially taking his attention away from the real estate market. He found the farming experience to be enjoyable and educational, although his attorney initially stated that Kingman Farms was an experimental enterprise with an unknown future. Another attorney later denied local concerns that Rhodes would eventually build houses on the land, saying that his shift to agriculture was not just a temporary project. In 2018, a subsidiary of Kingman Farms filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Rhodes' farming largely shifted from alfalfa to nut orchards, which consume less water. As of 2019, the farming site at Red Lake was no longer in use. Controversies and lawsuits Rhodes is considered one of Las Vegas' most controversial developers. He has been involved in numerous lawsuits, accusing him of fraud, theft, and self-dealing. By 2007, approximately 50 lawsuits had been filed against Rhodes over the course of his career. Rhodes had lost or settled most of the major cases. He has also been the subject of much publicity, variously describing him as successful, impatient, and untrustworthy. He said, \\"I signed up to be a builder and not (to) be popular or unpopular.\\" Rhodes said the criticism came from jealous competitors, as well as business partners who had tried to swindle him out of money. In later years, Rhodes avoided business partners, saying, \\"They don't always have honest intentions, and they are little scammers. They lay awake at night trying to figure out how to scam you.\\" Rhodes also blamed himself for critical stories, saying he often allowed them to be written, without defending himself or raising concerns about inaccuracies. Construction workers have filed various complaints against Rhodes, claiming he failed to pay them, although Rhodes said that such workers are dishonest about the amount of work and the time it actually took. In the 1990s, Rhodes' partners in the Palm Gardens project accused him of withholding their share of the profits. They also accused him of taking money from the development partnership and diverting the funds to his own companies. An arbitrator later ruled in favor of the partners, while concluding that Rhodes had engaged in self-dealing, although Rhodes appealed the case several times. In 2006, after 11 years of court battles, the Supreme Court of Nevada ruled that Rhodes had to pay a $2.1 million judgment in the case. In 1998, Rhodes was also sued by his partner in the Palm Canyon and Palm Hills projects. The partner, Rainbow Development Corporation, alleged that Rhodes became more difficult to access as the projects progressed. The lawsuit alleged that Rhodes mismanaged the projects and withheld financial information. The company sought to be appointed as the managing member of Palm Canyon or to have the property placed into receivership. The suit also sought $10,000 in damages for fraud, breach of contract, and negligent mismanagement. Rainbow Development also accused Rhodes of self-dealing. His attorney denied the claims and stated that Rainbow Development was frequently kept updated through weekly meetings. A judge denied Rainbow Development's request to remove Rhodes Design and Development as managing partner. Palm Hills was later placed under the control of a receiver, who blocked Rhodes' attempts to take back control of the project. The case was eventually resolved confidentially in 2007. As of 1999, residents of Elkhorn Springs had yet to receive a promised five-acre park, despite a verbal agreement made three years earlier between Rhodes and the director of Las Vegas parks. However, a written agreement was never made, and the lack of a paper trail led to a dispute between Rhodes and the city about which would be responsible for building the park. To force Rhodes into discussions, the city temporarily refused to issue occupancy permits for some of his completed homes. Rhodes Homes eventually agreed to provide land for a park, while the city would provide $1 million to construct it. In 2002, Rhodes was accused of breaking federal law after he allegedly funneled money to Dario Herrera's congressional campaign and Harry Reid's 2004 Senate campaign. Through 14 employees and two employee spouses, Rhodes spent a total of $27,000 in corporate funds to support the two campaigns. Federal law prevented corporate funds from being donated to federal campaigns, and prohibited money from being contributed in other people's names. Rhodes had also exceeded the maximum donation amount. Both campaigns were unaware of the true source of the contributions. After an investigation by the Federal Election Commission, Rhodes agreed in 2005 to pay a $148,000 fine to settle the complaint. Rhodes and businessman Scott Dunton had initially competed against each other in a bidding war for the land in Golden Valley. Dunton claimed that Rhodes had later agreed to sell a portion of the land to him, before reneging on the deal and keeping ownership of all the acreage. In 2007, a court ruled in favor of Dunton and ordered Rhodes to sell 5,184 acres in Golden Valley to him. Rhodes sought to improve his reputation in 2007, when he pledged to donate $11 million to the Nevada Cancer Institute, following his father's death from cancer in 2002. Rhodes intended to make the donations over the course of 10 to 15 years, but the institute wanted the money sooner. In response, Rhodes tried to delay the payments, leading to a lawsuit by the institute after it spent 18 months trying to resolve the issue. The case was later withdrawn by the institute. Rhodes has said that his biggest weakness is lack of commitment to others, which led to the donation controversy. Defective housing Numerous lawsuits were filed against Rhodes for defective housing. He has blamed such lawsuits on corrupt lawyers, stating that they had recruited clients to sue housing developers for minor issues. Rhodes said, \\"I'm sure some cases have some merit. But I also think they might be playing a little fast and loose in making allegations that are not substantiated.\\" In 1999, the Nevada State Contractors Board suspended the contractor license for Rhodes Homes following complaints from 19 homeowners about construction defects. One couple had more than 30 problems with their house, and the suspension occurred due to Rhodes Homes' slow response to repair the couple's house. The slow response was blamed on an employee who was fired because of it. The suspension lasted a year, and it came after the board adopted stricter policies. Rhodes Homes was also fined $5,000. New complaints regarding home defects came in as the company worked to resolve existing complaints. At the end of 1999, more than 350 homeowners at Palm Gardens filed suit against Rhodes Homes, alleging numerous defects. The case was resolved four years later, with Rhodes Homes paying $3 million as part of a $12.5 million settlement. Subcontractors in the case also contributed to the settlement money. In 2000, after four years, Rhodes settled a case involving 188 defective homes in its Casa Linda subdivision, located in northwest Las Vegas. The houses had been built on expansive soil, which lifted some homes as high as five feet, causing cracks in drywall. The case was settled for $16.2 million, the highest residential construction defect settlement in state history. In 2001, Rhodes was sued by 19 homeowners at Elkhorn Springs over defective housing. Personal life and philanthropy Rhodes has two brothers, and has been married four times. In the 1980s, he married Deborah Parness. They were married for 12 years and had two sons. Rhodes married wife Glynda in Hawaii on April 8, 2004. The couple had children from previous marriages but none together. The couple soon became known for their fundraising efforts and extravagant spending, and became well known philanthropists in the Las Vegas area. In 2007, Rhodes donated $2 million to the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. Free houses were also given away through Rhodes Homes, and the company was also a supporter of the Make-A- Wish Foundation. Rhodes was also a longtime donor to the Down Syndrome Organization of Southern Nevada. His nephew has down syndrome, which inspired him to become active in the organization. Jim and Glynda Rhodes filed for divorce in 2011, citing incompatibility. Glynda Rhodes alleged that her husband was responsible for the couple's debt. Their divorce proceedings were ongoing as of 2012. A year later, Rhodes married his fourth wife, a woman almost half his age. Rhodes has owned several mansions in the Las Vegas Valley. In 2016, he began construction on a mansion in his Spanish Hills community. Three years later, he listed it for sale, at a price of $30 million. It sold later that year for $16 million, marking the second-highest home resale in Las Vegas history. In the 2000s, Rhodes was a Republican. He is also a Presbyterian. Although he has developed several golf courses, he rarely plays golf himself, saying in 2005, \\"I have played three or four times in my life and the last time I played was 20 years ago. I can see myself picking up the game and becoming obsessed, playing four hours a day. I don't have that kind of time.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Rhodes Homes official website, archived via the Wayback Machine Category:Real estate and property developers Category:Businesspeople from Las Vegas Category:Philanthropists from Nevada Category:21st-century philanthropists Category:Living people Category:1958 births ","title":"Jim Rhodes (developer)"},{"id":"65046789","text":"right The Dresden New City Reichstag constituency was constituency No. 4 in the Kingdom of Saxony which returned a deputy to the German Reichstag.

Commissioned in July 1944, she operated as a kaiten manned suicide attack torpedo carrier during the final year of World War II. Surrendered at the end of the war, she was scuttled by the United States Navy in 1946. Design and description The Type C submarines were derived from the earlier KD6 sub-class of the with a heavier torpedo armament for long-range attacks. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 192 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft.

The boats were armed with eight internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of 20 torpedoes. They were also armed with a single /40 deck gun and two single or twin mounts for Type 96 anti- aircraft guns. They were equipped to carry one Type A midget submarine aft of the conning tower.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 104 Construction and commissioning Ordered under the Rapid Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and built by the Sasebo Naval Arsenal at Sasebo, Japan, I-47 was laid down on 21 November 1942 with the name Submarine No. 377. She was numbered I-47 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District on 31 July 1943. Launched on 29 September 1943, she was completed and commissioned on 10 July 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-47 was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District. From July through September 1944, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 6th Fleet for work-ups in the Iyo-nada. On 8 October 1944, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet, and during October she was configured to carry four kaiten manned suicide attack torpedoes on her after deck, two of them with access tubes that allowed their pilots to enter them while she was submerged. She conducted kaiten launch exercises in Tokuyama Bay from 29 to 31 October 1944, and on 6 November 1944 embarked four kaitens at Otsujima Naval Base. First kaiten mission I-47 at Otsujima Naval Base on 8 November 1944.On 7 November 1944, the commander- in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, and the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa, visited Otsujima to see off the kaiten pilots. On 8 November 1944, the Kikusui-tai Kaiten Group ‚Äî made up of I-47 and the submarines and ‚Äî got underway from Otsujima to conduct the first kaiten operation. Plans called for I-37 to target an American fleet anchorage at Palau with kaitens, while I-36 and I-47 were to carry out a kaiten attack on the U.S. anchorage at Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands, then proceed to Leyte Gulf to attack Allied ships with conventional torpedoes. On 16 November 1944, the submarines received a report from a Nakajima C6N1 Saiun (\\"Iridescent Cloud\\"; Allied reporting name \\"Myrt\\") reconnaissance aircraft which made a high-altitude flight over Ulithi Atoll and sighted four fleet aircraft carriers and three battleships as well as cruisers and destroyers in the north central part of the lagoon and transports, oilers, and other ships in the south-central part. By the evening of 18 November 1944, I-47 was west of Ulithi, and she began her approach to the atoll from the southwest. She surfaced off Ulithi at dawn on 19 November and moved in at to only off the atoll, observing over 200 ships in the anchorage. She surfaced again at 00:30 on 20 November 1944, and between 03:28 and 03:42 launched all four of her kaitens. At 05:47, one of them hit the U.S. Navy fleet oiler , which caught fire, capsized, and sank at 09:28. I-47 then withdrew on the surface at to head for her patrol area in Leyte Gulf. After she transmitted a report of the sinking of Mississinewa on 22 November, however, she and I-36 received orders on 24 November to return to Japan rather than proceed to Leyte Gulf. After stopping at Otsujima, the two submarines arrived at Kure, Japan, on 30 November 1944. On 2 December 1944, over 200 staff officers and specialists covened aboard the 6th Fleet flagship Tsukushi Maru to evaluate the results of the kaiten attack on Ulithi Atoll. After examining after-action reports and post-attack reconnaissance photographs, they credited the attack with sinking three aircraft carriers and two battleships. In fact, the attack had sunk only Mississinewa. Second kaiten mission On 8 December 1944, I-47 was assigned to the Kongo (\\"Steel\\") Kaiten Group along with the submarines I-36, , , , and for an attack scheduled for dawn 11 January 1945 on five different U.S. anchorages in widely separated locations; the date of the attack later was postponed to 12 January 1945. She got underway on 25 December 1944 bound for her target, Hollandia on the coast of New Guinea. On 30 December 1944, during her voyage, she rescued eight starving Imperial Japanese Army soldiers from a raft in the Philippine Sea west of Guam; the soldiers had participated in a failed attempt to storm the U.S. airfield on Guam and then escaped the island aboard the raft, drifting at sea for 32 days before I-47 found them. On 8 January 1945, an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flew over the Hollandia area and sighted 40 large transports anchored in Humboldt Bay () and 10 smaller vessels outside the anchorage, and the Japanese passed this report to I-47. I-47 sighted Cape Soeadja on the north coast of New Guinea at 10:30 on 11 January 1945, then proceeded north. After dark, she surfaced off New Guinea to recharge her batteries. She sighted a U.S. hospital ship, which passed without noticing I-47, then headed south at 23:30 to reach her launch position off Humboldt Bay. Submerged, I-47 reached the launch area north of Cape Soeadja by 03:00 on 12 January 1945. She launched all four kaitens between 04:14 and 04:30, then surfaced and departed the area at flank speed. In Humboldt Bay, one kaiten grazed the port side of the anchored Liberty ship below the waterline, causing a small leak in her No. 3 hold. The kaiten then exploded about off Pontus H. Ross‚Ä≤s port bow at 05:21, causing additional minor damage to her hull. A few seconds later another explosion took place off Cape Soeadja. At sea, I-47 noted a column of red fire rising from the direction of Humboldt Bay after 05:20. She reached Kure on 1 February 1945. During a conference aboard Tsukushi Maru on 7 February 1945, the 6th Fleet's staff credited I-47‚Ä≤s kaitens with sinking four transports at Humboldt Bay. February‚ÄìMarch 1945 During I-47‚Ä≤s stay at Kure, her deck gun was removed and she was equipped to accommodate two more kaitens in its place, raising her kaiten-carrying capability to six. She suffered an accident on 16 March 1945 in which a member of her crew died of carbon monoxide poisoning while she was carrying out kaiten launch exercises in the Seto Inland Sea off Hikari. On 20 March 1945 she conducted combat exercises in the Seto Inland Sea with the submarines I-36, , I-53, I-56, and I-58. On 27 March 1945, I-47 was selected to lead the Tatara Kaiten Group in an attack on American ships off Okinawa. After loading provisions for two months and 20 torpedoes at Kure, she departed on the morning of 28 March 1945 and moved to Hikari, where she embarked six kaitens. She conducted diving tests with the six kaitens aboard on 29 March 1945, then returned to Hikari and embarked the kaiten pilots. Third kaiten mission I-47 got underway from Hikari on the afternoon of 29 March 1945, heading through the Bungo Strait on the surface at under the escort of the submarine chaser . About two hours after she rendezvoused with CHA-200, American carrier aircraft attacked the two ships in the Sea of Hy≈´ga off Kyushu at around 16:00, forcing I-47 to crash-dive and sinking CHA-200. I-47 surfaced after dark, but two American aircraft illuminated the area with flares and attacked her wiith several depth charges. She survived the attack with only minor damage. While I-47 was on the surface recharging her batteries south of Kyushu east of Tanegashima at 02:30 on 30 March, she sighted two Allied patrol vessels directly ahead of her and crash-dived. A main ballast tank vent malfunctioned, and she assumed a 50-degree down angle, reaching a depth of before her crew could stop her descent. Her crew finally stabilized her at a depth of . Allied vessels pursued her for the next 11 hours, during which one of her periscopes and one of her fuel tanks developed leaks and her internal temperature rose to . After finally breaking contact, I-47 surfaced south of Tanegashima and headed south, but two Allied patrol aircraft sighted her and attacked her, dropping 20 depth charges. I-47 submerged and escaped with only minor additional damage, but her crew found it impossible to stop the leak in her fuel tank. She entered Uchinoura Bay on the coast of Kyushu before daybreak on 31 March 1945 so that her crew could inspect her damage. Her crew found an unexploded depth charge on her bridge and damage to her outer hull above her ballast tanks and to her anti-sonar coating. After reporting the damage to 6th Fleet Headquarters she received orders to abandon her mission and return to Hikari, which she reached on 1 April 1945. After disembarking her kaitens there, she proceeded to Kure for repairs. Arriving there on 2 April, she was drydocked until 15 April 1945. Fourth kaiten mission With her repairs complete, I-47 departed Kure on 17 April 1945 bound for Hikari. There on 20 April 1945 she and I-36 formed the Tenmu (\\"Heavenly Warriors\\") Kaiten Group, each carrying six kaitens, with orders to attack Allied sea lines of communication between Okinawa, Ulithi Atoll, and the Mariana Islands. Bound for the waters east of Okinawa, I-47 got underway from Hirao on 22 April 1945. During her voyage, she was on the surface recharging her batteries on 23 April 1945 when her radar detector picked up a radar signal and she submerged. She avoided attack, but when she surfaced she sighted a sonobuoy apparently dropped by an American patrol plane that had been searching for her. I-47 arrived in her patrol area southeast of Okinawa on 26 April 1945. Her starboard diesel engine immediately broke down, and her crew began repairs. She received a message from I-36 on 27 April 1945 in which I-36 reported a successful kaiten attack on an Allied convoy. I-47‚Ä≤s crew completed repairs to her engine on 28 April 1945. On 1 May 1945, I-47 was south-southwest of Okidait≈çjima when she detected an Allied convoy on radar at a range of . She closed the range and launched three kaitens at a range of , subsequently hearing large explosions. On 2 May, she was south-southwest of Okidait≈çjima when she sighted a 10,000-ton tanker heading northwest at escorted by two destroyers. She launched a kaiten five minutes later, and subsequently heard two heavy explosions. Her sound operator then heard the propeller noises of two destroyers, and at 11:20 I-47 launched another kaiten. I-47 temporarily lost sound contact with the kaiten, but then heard high-speed propellers, followed by a heavy explosion. I-47 then departed the area at flank speed, heading southeast. On 7 May 1945, I-47 detected what she identified as a British Leander-class light cruiser south-southwest of Okidait≈çjima on radar. She launched a kaiten and reported a hit on the cruiser. She could not launch her two remaining kaitens because of malfunctioning torpedoes, and the 6th Fleet ordered her to return to Hikari, which she reached on 12 May 1945. After disembarking her two kaitens and their pilots, she got back underway and arrived at Kure on 13 May 1945. May‚ÄìJuly 1945 After arriving at Kure, I-47 underwent repairs that lasted until late June 1945. During this time, she probably had a snorkel installed. When her repairs were complete, she departed Kure on 30 June 1945 for work-ups in the Seto Inland Sea. She arrived at Hikari on 5 July 1945 and embarked kaitens with dummy warheads and their pilots to practice kaiten launches in the vicinity of Hikari. She returned to Kure on 13 July 1945 and refueled from other submarines located there. She moved from Kure to Hikari on 17 July and embarked six kaitens and their pilots, then conducted several test dives off Hikari on 18 July 1945. Fifth kaiten mission On 19 July 1945, I-47 became part of the Tamon Kaiten Group along with the submarines I-53, I-58, , , and . She got underway that day, headed for a patrol area east of Okinawa. She arrived in her patrol area on 23 July 1945. By 29 July she had made contact with three Allied ships but had launched no kaitens, and 6th Fleet Headquarters ordered that day to proceed to a new patrol area northeast of the Philippine Islands. On 30 July 1945, a typhoon struck the area. Unable to finish recharging her batteries, I-47 had to remain on the surface during the storm. Large waves swamped her several times before she finally could submerge. When she surfaced in heavy seas on 1 August 1945, one of her kaitens was washed overboard, and it collided with her after it went over the side. Her remaining kaitens developed leaks. She was recalled to Japan on 6 August and arrived at Hikari on 13 August 1945, where she disembarked the kaiten pilots and the five kaitens that remained aboard. She then proceeded to Kure, which she reached on 14 August 1945. End of war On 15 August 1945, World War II ended with Emperor Hirohito‚Ä≤s Jewel Voice Broadcast announcing the cessation of hostilities between Japan and the Allies. Not willing to accept defeat, I-47‚Ä≤s crew decided to refuse to surrender and to try to reach Japanese-held Rabaul on New Britain in the Bismarck Archipelago, where they hoped to continue to fight. I-47 crewmen boarded a kaibokan escort vessel in the harbor at Kure and confiscated its food supply and several rifles and machine guns. They gave up on their plan when they could not find enough fuel for the voyage to Rabaul, and they abandoned I-47. I-47 surrendered to the Allies on 2 September 1945, the same day that Japan formally surrendered in a ceremony aboard the battleship in Tokyo Bay. Final disposition The Japanese struck I-47 from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. In Operation Road's End, the U.S. Navy scuttled her off the Goto Islands on 1 April 1946. Using a multibeam echosounder and a remotely operated vehicle, a research team of the Society La Plong√©e for Deep Sea Technology found and photographed the wreck of I-47 on 7 September 2017. The wreck lies at a depth of .

It was developed by Jim Rhodes. The community was announced in 1996, after Rhodes gained 1,330 acres, some of it through the Bureau of Land Management. At the time, much of the surrounding area was rural, and nearby residents opposed the development of the land. Despite the opposition, the Rhodes Ranch project was approved and began construction. The Rhodes Ranch Golf Club opened to the public on November 6, 1997. The course is 162 acres, and was designed by Ted Robinson. Rhodes Companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009, and Rhodes Ranch was turned over to creditors. Dunhill Homes was subsequently chosen to continue development of the community. Century Communications purchased it in 2014. History=Planning and opposition Rhodes Ranch was developed by Jim Rhodes, who acquired 950 acres of land from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in March 1996. The site was located in the southwest Las Vegas Valley. The land was appraised at nearly $9 million, and Rhodes purchased smaller properties in the area for $8 million, forming a contiguous parcel totaling 1,330 acres. The proposed site for Rhodes Ranch was located several miles outside of development boundaries that had been set by the Clark County Commission. The nearest sewer and water lines were miles away, presenting an infrastructure issue. Rhodes ultimately had to run pipelines eight miles to reach the new community. When Rhodes Ranch was announced in 1996, the area was rural and largely undeveloped. Residents in the area had concerns about the Rhodes Ranch project and how quickly it was proceeding. Rhodes initially sought zoning approval for 15,000 homes, retail and commercial space, and a casino. A total of 137 residents signed a petition for the county to designate the area as a rural preservation site, restricting homes to half-acre lots. Rhodes sought to annex portions of the proposed land into the Spring Valley Township, which would make planning easier while also negating the possibility of rural preservation status. Some complained that the Clark County Planning Commission granted a six-month permit for Rhodes to operate a gravel pit in the area even though zoning changes had yet to be approved for Rhodes Ranch. Approximately 145 residents appealed the permit for gravel mining in the area, which was meant to help prepare the land for a Rhodes Ranch golf course. In June 1996, the Clark County Commission postponed a decision on the gravel pit for three months, following the opposition from residents. The commission also allowed a two-week period for residents to review the Rhodes Ranch conceptual plan. Commissioner Bruce Woodbury believed that the project was proceeding too quickly: \\"We were told that not too long ago the application for the land was just privatized, and here they are already moving forward on a batch plant and massive development. We see all over the county a gradual expansion (of development), but this is not a gradual expansion. This is very rapid, massive development. The word leapfrog comes to mind.\\" The commission approved the concept plan later in the month, without the support of Woodbury. A study would be undertaken to determine issues such as roads and sewage lines. Rhodes ultimately received permission to process 250,000 tons of gravel at the site, on the condition that roads be paved by a certain date to prevent dust from being raised into the air. Because of an error, Rhodes had gained the right to sell sand and gravel located on the property after he acquired it. Residents subsequently sued Rhodes and the BLM for the loss of money in gravel and sand sales. The commission approved the final master plan in October 1996, with Woodbury casting the sole vote of opposition, saying the project was too large for the area. Rock blasting was necessary to prepare the land for construction, and nearby residents complained of dust from the blasting. Air- quality officials prohibited construction crews from performing blasts on weekends and holidays, a decision that pleased local residents and that would prolong the construction period. Residents later complained about late-night noises and bright lights, both a result of the gravel pit operations. Residents continued to oppose the project. Despite the opposition, a development agreement was approved in December 1996. Simultaneously, the Clark County Commission approved a petition creating the unincorporated town of Enterprise, Nevada. The commission also approved the annexation of the Rhodes Ranch property from Enterprise into Spring Valley. The property consisted of five square miles totaling 1,372 acres. Woodbury and Enterprise residents opposed the annexation, which was proposed by commissioner Erin Kenny, a future resident in Rhodes Ranch. In early 1997, the Clark County Board of Commissioners granted approval of final maps for two residential subdivisions, to be built by Rhodes Design and Development. The subdivisions would contain 29 acres each. Construction of the golf course was underway later that year. Opening and ownership changes The Rhodes Ranch Golf Club opened on November 6, 1997, with little fanfare. It was designed by Ted Robinson, and was open to the public. The 135-acre course featured eight lakes, and was the centerpiece of the Rhodes Ranch community. The course was later increased to 162 acres, and it includes more than 3,500 palm trees. The community's entrance includes a \\"Rhodes Ranch\\" sign spelled out in giant letters like the Hollywood Sign. Rhodes Ranch became one of the most successful master-planned communities in the Las Vegas Valley. In 1999, Rhodes Design and Development Corporation proposed a hotel-casino for Rhodes Ranch, with 1,040 rooms, a shopping center, movie theaters, and a bowling alley. The following year, Rhodes sold property in Rhodes Ranch to Station Casinos, which has had plans for years to eventually construct a hotel-casino known as Durango Station. Construction of new homes continued into 2000. At the time, approximately 700 homes had been built in the community. Rhodes Design and Development sought to relocate a proposed drainage ditch so it would be built directly outside of the Rhodes Ranch project, rather than on-site. The company said the proposed relocation was sought for the sake of aesthetics, denying that additional homes would be built on the land. Residents and the county had concerns about the cost of relocating the ditch and the impact it could have on the design plans for a nearby school and park. The presence of a drainage ditch would reduce the value of the property by $186,000, and Rhodes had been opposed to the ditch since 1997. During 2000, commissioner Kenny, a friend of Rhodes, arrived unexpectedly at a staff member meeting to advocate for the relocation of the drainage ditch. Staff members later said they felt intimidated by Kenny to approve the relocation. County planners requested that Rhodes pay the cost of the relocation in the event that it were approved. With Kenny's help, Rhodes won county approval for the proposal and was given three months to make the relocation happen. However, after months of meetings, the county decided to keep the ditch on Rhodes' property. The county compromised with Rhodes and agreed to make the flood channel more narrow than previously planned. A 23-acre shopping center was added in 2004, to keep up with growing demand for retail and commercial space. As of 2005, most of the golf course's clientele consisted of locals, with tourists accounting for the remaining 40 percent. Around that time, home prices at Rhodes Ranch averaged between $370,000 and $1 million. Rhodes Companies filed for bankruptcy in 2009. At the time, Rhodes Ranch was still being built out. The community had 314 finished home lots available for purchase, and another 1,993 undeveloped lots. Jim Rhodes had an option to purchase the golf course for $5.9 million as part of the bankruptcy reorganization plan. The course was worth an estimated $8 million. Creditors led by Credit Suisse were owed $370 million, and they took over control of Rhodes Ranch in January 2010. Dunhill Homes, a newly formed company in Dallas, was named later that year to manage and further develop Rhodes Ranch. As of 2012, the golf course hosted approximately 65,000 rounds a year. Century Communities purchased Dunhill Homes and acquired Rhodes Ranch in 2014. By the end of 2015, Century Communities had more than 500 home lots left to develop at Rhodes Ranch, expected to take three years to construct and sell. In 2017, Century Communities launched an effort to sell the golf course, which was struggling financially. Later in the year, the company proposed building 32 homes on six acres of the golf course, reducing its par from 72 to 71. The proposal received opposition from residents. Education Before Rhodes' acquired the land for Rhodes Ranch, the Clark County School District had held 70 acres through BLM. The school district agreed to give up its property for the Rhodes Ranch project on the condition that 10 acres be set aside for a possible future school, although Rhodes Ranch was initially being planned as an adults-only community. The Clark County Commission later exempted Rhodes from donating property to the school district, although by 1998, Rhodes had started selling homes to families of all ages, without notifying the county or donating land for new schools. By 2004, there had three years' worth of meetings between Rhodes representatives and school district officials to determine an appropriate site for a school. Rhodes Ranch had 500 elementary school-age children as residents, and more than 1,000 were expected to reside there upon full completion. Children in Rhodes Ranch attended nearby schools, but the district stated that the community had enough elementary students to warrant a new school site. However, Rhodes had been hesitant to give up property for a school, instead suggesting eight nearby BLM sites, all of which were rejected by the school district. The district wanted a school site within safe walking distance, as school buses were not permitted to travel through the private streets of Rhodes Ranch. Rhodes had set aside a 10-acre property for a school as a last resort option, but preferred to save the land for more homes. In June 2004, the Clark County Commission declined to approve permits for any new homes in Rhodes Ranch until a suitable site could be provided to the school district. The district and Rhodes Homes reached a tentative agreement for a school site shortly thereafter. The site was located just outside Rhodes Ranch, on BLM land. The property had no water access, but Rhodes agreed to spend up to $10 million to build the necessary infrastructure, including a pump station. Rhodes believed that the pump station could be finished in 2007, for a school opening that year. However, there were concerns from the Las Vegas Valley Water District that three years would not be an adequate amount of time for construction of the pump station. After several more delays, the county gave approval to the proposed school site in October 2004. The Forbuss Elementary School opened as scheduled in 2007.

It was originally proposed by developer Jim Rhodes in 1995, under the name Palm City. The project was proposed for the former site of the Stewart gravel pit. The surrounding area initially sparked concern about the location's suitability, due to various environmental issues at the time. The site was located near sewage ponds and a longtime manufacturer of chemicals which had contaminated the land. Ground water was also found to have high radioactive levels. Rhodes graded the property in the late 1990s, but never began construction. His lender became insolvent and he sold the property in 2000 to Commerce Associates, which renamed the project Tuscany Hills. The property and surrounding acreage was designated by Henderson as a redevelopment area, making the project eligible for city funding. After various delays, the Tuscany Golf Club opened in 2003. It is 150 acres, and was designed by Ted Robinson. Rhodes subsequently took back ownership of the course and the undeveloped residential land. Home construction was underway in 2005. Rhodes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy four years later, and Tuscany was turned over to creditors. At the time, 700 of 2,000 planned homes had been built. Ownership changed several more times, and the golf course was renamed Chimera Golf Club in 2015. History=Original plans The project was originally proposed by developer Jim Rhodes in 1995, under the name Palm City. It was initially planned as an age-restricted community with 2,600 homes. As years went by, the unbuilt project was redesigned as an all-ages community, and was downsized to 2,200 homes. Plans for a three-acre commercial building site were also scrapped. Added to the plans were a 10-acre elementary school, two parks, and trails and bike lanes. Palm City was meant as an affordable version of Rhodes Ranch, another community in the Las Vegas Valley. Like Rhodes Ranch, it would also include a golf course designed by Ted Robinson. Rhodes received approval from the city of Henderson in 1998, and he began grading the property that year. The site included the Stewart gravel pit, which had been abandoned since the 1980s. The former gravel mine accounted for a majority of the future community's land. Most residents in the area initially approved of Palm City. However, the site for Palm City was located near sewage ponds and a longtime manufacturer of chemicals which had contaminated the land. Ground water was also found to have high radioactive levels, although Rhodes Design and Development Corporation planned to proceed with the project, as local officials had yet to declare a health concern. Residents became worried about the presence of chemicals, and also become concerned about the size of the Palm City project and the increased traffic that it would bring to the area. Another possible issue was that ground water would rise to the surface and flood yards in the future community. In addition, state and local environmental officials said there was the possibility that the Las Vegas Valley's water supply would become contaminated if Rhodes was not careful. Palm City would be developed adjacent to the Las Vegas Wash, and officials stated that Rhodes would need a plan to prevent contaminated water from entering the wash. Meanwhile, the city had concerns about a 26-building condominium complex that Rhodes wanted to include in the community, stating that his 13-acre site was not large enough to support the project. In 1999, a contractor on the project sued Rhodes, claiming that he refused to pay $150,000 for underground utility work. This came after the contractor filed a lien on the project. In 2000, Rhodes Homes sold the undeveloped Palm City land in a $30 million deal, after its lender became insolvent. The 521-acre site had been graded, but construction had yet to begin. Tuscany Commerce Associates, the new owner, renamed the project Tuscany Hills. The project was approved by the Henderson Planning Commission in 2001. An 18-hole golf course was scheduled to open to the public in 2002, to be followed later in the year by completion of homes. The city also designated the site as a redevelopment area, making it eligible for city funding. Tuscany was expected to provide $263 million in new tax revenue for Henderson over a period of 30 years. Aside from Tuscany's 525 acres, the redevelopment area also included 325 surrounding acres, for a total of 850. The redevelopment deal created controversy over city ethics, as two minority owners in Commerce Associates also sat on the Henderson Redevelopment Advisory Commission, and they resigned only weeks prior to the deal. In June 2002, a majority stakeholder in Commerce Associates sued his business partner in the company, claiming that he diverted millions of dollars from the company for his own uses. A month later, Henderson mortgage executive Tom Hantges filed a civil lawsuit alleging that the redevelopment agency broke state laws. The Tuscany project had been approved for redevelopment funds because a portion of the property was classified as an abandoned mine. However, aerial photographs showed that little had remained of the gravel pit, as Rhodes had cleared most of it out. City officials stated that the site still qualified as a blight. Henderson mayor James B. Gibson said, \\"It has to be a priority of the city to reclaim that land and a lot of the surrounding land and it's no easy task given the industrial uses that were prevalent on much of that area.\\" Managing partners at Commerce Associates stated that Hantges' lawsuit was part of an effort to force a settlement in an unrelated racketeering suit that the company had filed against him. The city requested that the suit be dismissed, and a district judge later ruled against Hantges, stating that his lawsuit was filed nearly a year after a 90-day deadline for such action. Hantges had also been concerned about a conflict of interest regarding the redevelopment agency, although the Supreme Court of Nevada ruled against him as well, stating that there was no such issue as the board members recused themselves from discussions and voting. The United States Environmental Protection Agency evaluated nearly 400 acres of evaporation ponds, located west of Tuscany. The agency concluded that there was no risk posed by the former ponds, which had previously been used to dispose of chemical wastewater. However, there was concern about a nearby Good Humor-Breyers ice cream factory, which used ammonia as a coolant. More than 99,000 pounds of the chemical were stored at the facility. In the event of an accidental ammonia leak, a toxic plume would extend up to 2,300 feet, well within range of Tuscany. Studies were taken in 2003 to determine whether the Tuscany plans would need to be altered to avoid a health hazard. City officials said they had not previously considered conducting such studies. Because the site used to be a gravel pit, much of Tuscany was built at least 40 feet below street level, a fact that would work in favor of the community in the event of an ammonia leak, as the chemical would rise into the air. A final report in 2003 found that Tuscany would not need to be altered because of the ammonia threat, allowing the project to proceed. The Tuscany golf course contains 150 acres. Because of a lack of surrounding infrastructure, the developers had to bring in water and sewer lines. The course had been completed in early 2002, but it sat un-used for more than a year as the opening was delayed by the lawsuits, as well as permit problems. The slow construction of roads and parking lots was another factor. The golf course eventually opened in 2003, and is the centerpiece of the community. It was designed to resemble an Italian vineyard. Home construction had yet to begin at that time. In 2004, Jim Rhodes purchased the Tuscany Golf Club from Commerce Associates. He closed it for renovations to restore the previous design intended by Robinson. It reopened later that year. Rhodes Homes also took over the residential aspect, now known as Tuscany Village. Construction of homes was underway in 2005, and the community opened that year. There were 168 homes built by 2006. The community's architecture is based on the Italian region of Tuscany. The golf course was praised. As of 2007, the facility hosted 46,000 rounds of golf annually, and it was named by Golf Magazine as the number-one course in Las Vegas. Homes at Tuscany In 2009, Jim Rhodes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to turn over Tuscany to his creditors. Residents of Tuscany welcomed the news of Rhodes' departure, as they felt that he had mismanaged the community's homeowner association (HOA). In recent years, the HOA had seen frequent changes in its board presidents and community managers, and residents alleged that community upkeep had been neglected. Empty home lots were also spread throughout Tuscany. Only 700 of 2,000 homes had been built in the community up to that point. Creditors led by Credit Suisse were owed $370 million, and they took over control of Tuscany in January 2010. Dunhill Homes, a newly formed company in Dallas, was named later that year to manage and further develop Tuscany. In 2014, Century Communities purchased Dunhill Homes and acquired Tuscany Village. In 2015, the golf club was sold to two golfers who renamed it as Chimera Golf Club. They also made various improvements and reopened an outdoor bar and grill. At the time, Century Communities had approximately 450 vacant home lots left to develop at Tuscany Village, with residential construction expected to continue into 2019. Some home lots were developed by Lennar Corporation.

In 1893 she became the first African American woman to graduate from the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf. She was described by a prominent deaf newspaper as \\"the most accomplished deaf lady of her race in America\\". Early life and education Blanche Hilyard Wilkins was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, on December 1, 1876. She became deaf at an early age. Wilkins attended the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf from 1883 to 1893, and was the first Black woman to graduate from the school. She wrote to Edward Miner Gallaudet several times, asking for information on admission to Gallaudet College, but she was rejected; Gallaudet would not admit a Black student until 1950. Career She joined the literary department of the North Carolina School for the Colored Deaf and Blind in Raleigh in 1895. In 1897 she was paid a salary of $250 in that role. Wilkins and other Black deaf teachers were role models for their students, demonstrating that deaf people could assume leadership positions. In 1898 she resigned her position at the North Carolina School for the Deaf to take a new teaching role at the School for the Colored Deaf and Blind in Austin, Texas, working there only a year before returning to Raleigh. In 1899 Wilkins married Charles N. Williams, the hearing African American principal of the North Carolina school. She organized a new department for the Raleigh school, teaching sewing and dressmaking to deaf students and crocheting and knitting to blind students. Her husband died suddenly in 1907, leaving her with two children to raise. Wilkins applied for a position with the Maryland School for the Deaf in 1910, but was rejected as the school wrote that they did \\"not believe in the social equality of colored and white people.\\" Around 1918, Wilkins moved the family to Chicago. While in Chicago Wilkins worked in several factory jobs, including doing beadwork, lampshade work, and power machine sewing. She continued to teach young deaf black children as well, working at a school for the deaf in Chicago. She married her second husband, Thomas Flowers, in 1920; they had worked together in Raleigh and were both widowers. Along with her second husband, she was active in missionary work in the Chicago area. Wilkins died in Evanston, Illinois on March 24, 1936, and is buried in Lincoln Cemetery near Chicago. Legacy Wilkins was the first Black deaf person to serve on the Executive Committee of the National Association of the Deaf.

As a Correspondent with the Allied Forces, Mosley had accompanied Bliss and the Battalion during the D-Day Landings, parachuting into France with a typewriter strapped to his back. Life Colin Leo Bliss was born in Sandy, Bedfordshire, England, on 27 April 1907, the fifth son of Inspector John Wilfred Bliss and Dora Amy Louise (n√©e Andrews). He was educated at Bedford Modern School between 1919 and 1922 where he enjoyed rugby. After school, Bliss joined the Merchant Service and travelled extensively. He later enlisted with the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment and decided to volunteer for airborne service in the early stages of World War II, reportedly the second person to volunteer. He served in the 1st Parachute Battalion and was appointed Seargent Major of ‚ÄòS Company‚Äô. He took the 1st Advanced Parachute Training Course at RAF Ringway in January 1942. Bliss was commissioned on the 5 December 1942 and joined the 12th Parachute Battalion. Bliss's early dangerous work parachuting from low flying planes with heavy equipment helped design the parachutes that were later used as part of the Airborne D-Day Landings. On a visit to the 6th Airborne Division, shortly before the D-Day Landings, King George VI asked who was responsible for the ingenuity behind the parachute training and the General explained it was Bliss who was subsequently introduced to the King by whom he was congratulated.

After the landing in France on the morning of 6 June 1944, Bliss was missing (assumed dead) for two days but had reached Caen to begin his work. According to Mosley, Bliss: > ‚Äòmoved around the outskirts of the town, sniping sentries and dynamiting > unattended lorries. When things got too hot for him, he stole a Nazi > regimental commander‚Äôs car and sped north. When machine gun bullets put his > car in a ditch, he scrambled out, did a quick run round the back of the Nazi > post which had stopped him and gave it three hand grenades through the > slits.‚Äô Bliss‚Äôs battalion captured Ranville and later acted in support of the attack on the Germans at St Honorine. Bliss was put in Command of a Composite Company of the battalion on 18 June 1944. On 3 July 1944, Bliss gained command of A Company of the battalion. On 7 July 1944, A Company was subject to heavy fire whereupon Bliss fired a Bren gun from the hip as he advanced towards the enemy but was wounded. He died from his wounds on 10 July 1944, and was buried at Ranville War Cemetery in Normandy, France. Bliss married Anne May Moore at St Lawrence Church, Bedfordshire, on 28 March 1932.

The gathering took place contrary to public health advice that had been issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. A total of 81 guests attended a dinner organised by the society, including a number of high-profile Oireachtas members; the European Commissioner for Trade, Phil Hogan; and a Supreme Court judge, S√©amus Woulfe. Following the publication of the story on 20 August by the Irish Examiner, there was widespread public anger across Ireland that attendees had contravened restrictions that had been drafted by the ruling Fianna F√°il‚ÄìFine Gael‚ÄìGreen Party coalition government, one of whose ministers was in attendance at the dinner. The scandal resulted in the resignations of Hogan; the Minister for Agriculture and the Marine and Deputy Leader of Fianna F√°il, Dara Calleary; and the Leas-Chathaoirleach of Seanad √âireann, Jerry Buttimer. It also resulted in calls for a number of other resignations, and the affair was seen to have shaken public confidence in the coalition government. Background Under the third phase of a roadmap issued by the government for reopening the national economy after the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, indoor gatherings of up to 50 people had been permissible since 29 June when conducted in line with public health advice. However, in response to an increase in confirmed cases, Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin announced on 18 August that more restrictive measures would be reintroduced across the country until 13 September, in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Among the restrictions announced were a limit on indoor gatherings and events to six people from no more than three households, with exemptions granted for weddings, certain religious ceremonies and cultural facilities, provided appropriate protective measures could be maintained. On 20 August, Irish Examiner journalists Aoife-Grace Moore and Paul Hosford reported on an event organised by the Oireachtas Golf Society that took place over two days in Clifden, County Galway, including a dinner on 19 August at the Station House Hotel. The event, organised by the society's captain, Independent TD Noel Grealish, and its president, former Fianna F√°il Senator Donie Cassidy, was organised as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the society, as well as a commemoration of the death of former Fianna F√°il MEP, Mark Killilea Jnr, in 2018. It consisted of games of golf and a gala dinner. The golfing competitions, held over the two days at Connemara Golf Links in Ballyconneely, were won by Niall Blaney and Gerry Brady. The dinner was held in a single room with a removable dividing partition, splitting the 81 attendees into 45 and 36 people on either side in an effort to enforce social distancing. Subsequent newspaper reports stated that not only had social distancing not been properly observed at the dinner, but public health advice had generally not been observed. It was also reported that former independent TD and Monaghan County Council member, Paudge Connolly, had attended the dinner despite playing in another golf event in Spain just nine days previously. This meant that he could not have been compliant with the 14-day period of restricted movements that was mandatory for people entering Ireland from Spain, under the then- current travel restrictions enforced by the government.

The Taoiseach, Miche√°l Martin, was described as \\"furious\\" about the event, and in particular by the attendance of Dara Calleary. Calleary resigned as Minister for Agriculture and the Marine on 21 August, stating in an interview to MidWest Radio that \\"[he] made a big mistake. [He] shouldn‚Äôt have gone to the function. [He] didn‚Äôt want to let people down and [he takes] responsibility for that mistake\\". He elaborated by saying his actions had undermined the work of frontline workers in Ireland and he was deeply sorry for having done so. Calleary's resignation made him the second Minister for Agriculture and the Marine to be forced to resign in less than two months, following the resignation of Barry Cowen on 14 July 2020 for a controversy surrounding driving under the influence of alcohol. Coverage of Calleary's resignation was covered not just domestically, but also internationally, with the story featuring in the New York Times, BBC News, The Guardian, Euronews, The Times, Politico, Le Parisien, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and Ouest-France. In addition to his ministerial role, Calleary resigned as deputy leader and national secretary of Fianna F√°il. As well as the resignations of Calleary and Leas-Cathaoirleach of Seanad √âireann, Jerry Buttimer, six senators who attended the event also lost the party whip as punishment. Speaking on RT√â News: Six One on Friday 21 August, Martin would not comment on the position of judge S√©amus Woulfe ‚Äì citing the need for legislature not to interfere with the judiciary in line with the Constitution of Ireland ‚Äì but while he suggested that Phil Hogan should apologise for attending the event, Martin declined to comment on whether he should resign, saying that Hogan's position was a matter for the European Commission. Following initial reluctance, Hogan subsequently apologised for his attendance at the event on 22 August. President of Sinn F√©in and Leader of the Opposition, Mary Lou McDonald, heavily criticised both the gathering and the government, stating that the government had \\"descended into new levels of chaos\\". McDonald had requested that the D√°il be recalled from its summer recess, but this was initially rejected by Martin. In response, McDonald stated that Martin was wrong, that the government had lost its direction and that it needed to be held to account. McDonald also said that she had been unaware of the existence of an Oireachtas golf society, and questioned the ethics of an organisation that allowed wealthy donors to interact with members of the Oireachtas. The Leader of the Labour Party, Alan Kelly, said that not only had the government lost the confidence of the people, but also that he had rarely seen such public anger in response to a political issue as to the event. The co-leader of the Social Democrats, Catherine Murphy, called the event \\"inexcusable\\" and asked for the D√°il to be reconvened. While Martin resisted calls on 21 August to recall the D√°il ‚Äì which was on summer break ‚Äì the government announced on Sunday 23 August that the D√°il would return sooner than planned, most likely by Tuesday 15 September. An Garda S√≠och√°na announced on 21 August that they would be investigating the event to see if it breached the Health Act 1947, which was amended on 20 March 2020 to include public health regulations pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the immediate wake of the scandal, Ceann Comhairle Se√°n √ì Feargha√≠l requested that the Oireachtas Golf Society be disbanded with immediate effect. On 22 August the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, used discretionary powers under the 2005 Garda S√≠och√°na Act to inform the government that Hogan had been stopped by An Garda S√≠och√°na in County Kildare for using a mobile phone while driving ‚Äì a criminal offence punishable by three penalty points and an ‚Ç¨80 fine ‚Äì on his way to Clifden. Hogan's very presence in the county was an issue in itself, as it was under a local lockdown at the time, meaning that Hogan would have been entitled to travel to the county for essential purposes such as work, but not to leave again for non-essential purposes such as attending the golf dinner. In light of this, Martin and the T√°naiste, Leo Varadkar, changed their stance on Hogan retaining his European Commission portfolio; Martin publicly suggested that Hogan should \\"reconsider his position\\", and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, requested a detailed report from Hogan on the matter. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O'Brien, called on Hogan to resign, while the Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, stated that what he called Hogan's \\"unclear answers\\" on the issue damaged confidence in politics and the EU, and that President von der Leyen must consider this when considering Hogan's report. It was announced on 24 August that the Supreme Court had requested a former Chief Justice, Susan Denham, to report on Woulfe's attendance at the dinner, including the question of whether he should have accepted the invitation and whether \\"he should in all the circumstances have left the hotel in light of the situation prevailing\\". On the same day, it was also reported that former Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny, had participated in the golf competitions arranged as part of the event, but declined to participate in the gala dinner, telling others that he thought it was \\"a bad idea\\" and would \\"send out the wrong signal to the general public\\". RT√â announced that further projects involving Se√°n O'Rourke, which had been planned, would not now proceed. On 25 August, Hogan published a timeline of his movements since his he arrival in Ireland from Brussels on 31 July, including new details of a trip to Adare to play golf on 13 August. It was noted that Hogan was admitted to a Dublin hospital on 5 August, where he tested negative for COVID-19; he was discharged from hospital and returned to a temporary residence in County Kildare the following day. On 7 August, hours before a local lockdown was enforced in Kildare, Hogan travelled to County Kilkenny; from there, he travelled to Dublin for essential work purposes on 12 August. After playing golf in Adare on 13 August, he returned to Kilkenny, and travelled to Clifden via Kildare on 17 August. Hogan participated in the golf competitions on 18 and 19 August and subsequently attended the gala dinner, before returning to his temporary residence in Kildare on 21 August, and subsequently to Brussels the following day. Following publication of this timeline, reports appeared in the media claiming that Hogan had been seen at public restaurants with other individuals during this period, including on the evening of his arrival in Ireland, and that he had made a further trip to County Roscommon on 17 August for social purposes; these previously undisclosed details were seen as contradicting Hogan's own timeline. Martin, Varadkar and the Leader of the Green Party, Eamon Ryan, released a joint statement on 25 August, stating that while it is clear Hogan breached COVID-19 public health guidelines, they welcomed his apology. Facing increased pressure in both Brussels and Dublin, Phil Hogan resigned as Trade Commissioner on 26 August. The scandal was compared to the earlier Dominic Cummings scandal that occurred in the United Kingdom.

She was a member of the Baby Sitters children's folk music group along with Alan Arkin and Lee Hays, and she wrote Lonesome Traveler: The Life of Lee Hays (1988), describing his career with the Almanac Singers and the Weavers. Willens worked for the New York Journal- American as a columnist covering Madison Avenue advertising agencies. For nearly two decades she ran public relations for ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach, ending as vice president. Later, she punctured the reputation of William Bernbach by writing about him from an insider's perspective. She wrote a handful of musicals and plays including Piano Bar in 1978. Creating a theatrical group for seniors ‚Äì Primrose Productions ‚Äì Willens co-produced musicals in Long Island, New York, in the 1990s and 2000s. Her older brother was wealthy political donor and Nuclear Freeze activist Harold Willens (1914‚Äì2003). Early life Willens' Jewish family came from the northern Chernigov region of Ukraine. Her mother was born Badana Heskin in 1895, and she married Samuel Wilensky (or Wolensky.) Because of rising antisemitic violence, her father and his younger brother Ben traveled to the United States in July 1914 just as World War I was starting. The two men settled in The Bronx supported by the lantzman community. Back in Chernigov, her mother raised a son, Harold. Mother and son barely escaped death in the Kiev pogroms (1919), and in 1922 they paid a smuggler \\"mule\\" who was guiding a group of Jews out of Europe. The family reunited in The Bronx, where Doris was born in 1924. At the urging of her mother's brother to join him, the family moved to Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, in 1927. Her mother, known as \\"Bobbie\\", was a garment worker, and her father was a business agent for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. Willens attended Manual Arts High School, then entered the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to get a bachelor's degree in English. She was the chief editor of the Daily Bruin in 1944‚Äì1945 during her senior year. Willens returned to New York to enroll in the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, earning a scholarship in 1946 from the Woman's Press Club of New York City. Journalism and advertising Willens was a newspaper reporter in Minnesota, hired in 1947 by the Minneapolis Tribune as the first woman to cover the police beat. She competed for scoops against 24-year-old Harry Reasoner who worked for rival newspaper The Minneapolis Times. The police detectives complained that they would have to clean up their language in front of a woman, but Captain Gene Bernath was supportive, accommodating Willens' schedule by holding news briefs in the afternoon. Willens started a romance with 28-year-old Milton L. Kaplan, assistant city editor at the Tribune. In 1948, Kaplan accepted a position with William Randolph Hearst's International News Service in New York City. He married Willens in May 1949. In 1950, Kaplan was assigned the London office, bringing Willens to London for five years. Their son Jeffrey was born in London on May 5, 1954. Moving back to New York City, Kaplan rose through various executive positions in Hearst's organization, including a stint as Washington Bureau Chief, 1963‚Äì66. Returning once again to New York City, Kaplan's career culminated as chief of King Features Syndicate. At the close of 1972, he died of a heart attack at age 52 while skiing in the Catskill Mountains. Willens was employed by the New York Journal-American and became the first woman columnist covering the advertising agency industry. In 1966 the ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) hired her as their director of public relations. In that role, she penned a wide variety of texts, including speeches for executives, company annual reports, and a musical salute for an internal party thrown every five years. She rose to the rank of vice president. Willens published the DDB News internally, conducting interviews and reporting on events. She was recognized in 1982 by the Academy of Women Leaders (AWL) for her \\"achievements... and contributions to the success of other women.\\" The AWL is a program of the YWCA of the City of New York. The Baby Sitters In 1955, Kaplan and Willens took a flat in Brooklyn. Willens discovered that folk singer Lee Hays lived one floor below them. Hays was struggling to get by because of the blacklisting of the Weavers, and he helped Willens soothe and entertain her baby son Jeff with music Hays composed and words she wrote. From this kernel, Hays determined to form a group to make children's music, and he brought on board Alan Arkin, a young actor, and his nurse wife Jeremy Yaffe. Yaffe and Willens both bore sons in 1956: Adam Arkin in August and Andrew \\"Pete\\" Kaplan in October. By 1958, the four adults had become the Baby Sitters, singing together and playing toy instruments. Arkin covered acoustic guitar while Hays strummed the autoharp. The Baby Sitters produced two albums in 1959, with Willens credited as Doris Kaplan. Two more boys were born in 1960: Dan Kaplan on March 15 and Matthew Arkin on March 21. Arkin and Yaffe divorced in 1961. The Baby Sitters reformed in 1964, with Arkin's second wife, Barbara Dana, replacing Yaffe. Their next album, The Baby Sitters' Family Album (1965), featured eight-year-old Adam on two songs. All five of the Arkin and Kaplan boys participated. This album was reviewed by Audio magazine, with praise for the casual context of the music, apparently recorded in the living room. The songs were complimented for being entertaining \\"without being patronizing.\\" The reviewer remarked about how the guitar sounded \\"inept\\" at some points and \\"extremely expert\\" at others, with Willens' voice drifting off pitch, all of it perfectly appropriate and enjoyable. The group's final studio album was released in 1968. Vanguard Records compiled a 40-song greatest hits album, releasing it on two LPs in 1975, then again on CD in 1991. Theatre Willens authored dramatic and musical pieces for the theatre. Piano Bar enjoyed a brief run off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre in 1978. Willens wrote lyrics for 21 songs, teaming with her friend Rob Fremont who wrote the music. The musical was mounted again in Chicago in 1992, using 19 of the songs. Willens wrote song lyrics in 1990 for Aristophanes' play Lysistrata, collaborating with composer Laurence Dresner. In 1996 she wrote Disraeli, a one-man play about Benjamin Disraeli, performed in 1998 by William Lawrence, a 75-year-old actor. Willens partnered with Lois Stein to found Primrose Productions to produce plays around Long Island, New York, near Willens' home in Northport. The company name came from Disraeli's favorite flower, the primrose. The actors are mostly seniors, with younger ones in their 50s. Joined by Norman Ward as musical director, the company produced Spent: A Musical Revue About Growing Older in America in 1998, a Gilbert and Sullivan revue titled Great Books: A Musical Romp in 2000, and Monkey Business in 2002, written for a family audience. All of these titles were directed by Stein and written by Willens. In 2004, they produced Money: The Musical, and also a musical narrative titled Lonesome Traveler, telling the story of the Weavers and the Almanac Singers. Books The long friendship between Willens and Hays inspired Hays to give her a collection of audio tapes that he had recorded of himself speaking about his life and experiences. Hays asked Willens to transcribe the tapes and write a book. He said, \\"I think the truth that I haven't faced is that I don't even want a book with my name on it published in my lifetime. I've been living a very private life... If a book came out with some of the things that would have to be discussed... I would be embarrassed and horrified.\\" She dutifully transcribed the tapes but was daunted by the task of researching and writing a biography. Hays died in 1981, and many of his colleagues inquired of Willens about the book, expecting her to write it. She eventually realized that it was indeed her responsibility, and she researched Hays' life further, talking with friends, family and musicians to flesh out Hays' own words. The book, Lonesome Traveler: The Life of Lee Hays, was published in 1988 by W. W. Norton & Company. From her vantage point as PR maven for DDB during 1966‚Äì1984, Willens wrote a biography about adman William Bernbach titled Nobody's Perfect: Bill Bernbach and the Golden Age of Advertising. Prior to publication, excerpts from the book appeared in the industry magazine Ad Age, stimulating controversy because Willens revealed Bernbach as less than the creative genius of his reputation. Ad Age editor Fred Danzig said that Willens' text was \\"more than accurate\\" in its portrayal. Willens published the book herself in 2009. Hosted at MediaPost.com. Adweek reviewed the book positively, saying that Willens skewers Bernbach as a man who took credit for the work of others, but she also admits Bernbach's flair for finding the \\"big idea\\" in advertising, and his instinct for emerging marketing trends. Ad Age noted that Willens gave credit to Bernbach for being a dedicated family man rather than a womanizer, and for his professional skill at combining art and ad copy. Personal life Willens married Milton L. Kaplan in May 1948, and the couple had three children: Jeffrey (1954), Andrew (later known as Pete, 1956), and Dan (1960). They lived mostly in New York City, with five years in London and three years in Washington, D.C., following Kaplan's career moves. In December 1972 Kaplan died. Willens never remarried, but she had a longterm relationship with Leroy B. Block, an advertising executive. The two lived in Northport, New York, on the north side of Long Island. Block died in 2006. Willens' older brother Harold was a captain in the marines, translating Japanese during the Occupation of Japan. He became a millionaire from real estate holdings on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, and he supported many progressive and liberal issues, especially focused on stopping the nuclear arms race. Harold was a leader of the Nuclear Freeze movement. He died in 2003. Willens' son Andrew changed his name to Pete Kaplan; he is a financial advisor with Merrill Lynch in Charlotte, North Carolina. Her son Dan Kaplan trained as a classical guitarist in Seville, Spain, and specializes in folk music, especially Bob Dylan's early work. Willens' son Jeffrey Kaplan graduated Harvard Law School in 1980 to become an attorney in New York. He married Mary Shaw in 1983, divorcing in 1992. Jeffrey married Deb Sugarman, a drama teacher, in 2001. He was a partner in Chadbourne & Parke, then he co-founded Kaplan & Walker.

The HCCF houses both women and men, with separate wards for women and men. History The predecessor building to the current Hudson County Correctional Facility first opened in 1845 next to the original Hudson County Court House as a small jail located in Jersey City. Over the years new jail facilities were constructed in the county with new facilities built in Secaucus in 1926, to the current jail located in Kearny which was built in 1990. Controversy=Prisoner conditions Hudson County Correctional Facility has had several reports in recent years about conditions for prisoners at the facility. In February 2018 Human Rights First published Ailing Justice: New Jersey, a report about three New Jersey prison facilities (Hudson County Correctional Facility, Essex County Correctional Facility, and Elizabeth Detention Facility) found prisoners at HCCF overall were provided poor quality medical care (or outright denial of care), were given poor quality food lacking nutrition, and food were served on dishes that were unwashed or washed with dirty water.https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/Ailing-Justice- NJ.pdf Mental health facilities were also called out in this same report, with the report concluding that the program \\"may actually discourage people from seeking mental health care and may contribute to suicidal inclinations\\". Contract with ICE Hudson County Correctional Facility is one of the many regional centers used by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the New York metropolitan area. The partnership between HCCF and ICE (then the Immigration and Naturalization Service) dates back to 1996, with a contract resigned in 2003. Hudson County government has gone on record on stating that the money used from this contract has gone to pay for various infrastructure improvements around the county, with at least half of all inmates at the facility being ICE detainees.

The Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes mentioned ‚ÄúTigretes‚Äù in 525 AD ‚Äì the earliest recorded mention of Tigrina people in Eritrea. Sizable Tigrina diaspora communities also exist in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and North America.  Etymology  The origin of the word Tigrina or Tigri(g)ni (‚Äòtigrƒ©na‚Äô) is disputed. One view holds that the name comes from the word ‚ÄúTegeret‚Äù ('t…ôg…ôr…ôt‚Äô) (v., sing., fem.) (‚Äú·â∞·åà·à®·âµ‚Äù) (·åç·ç£ ·äï·åΩ·àç·ç£ ·ä£·äï·àµ), which stands for ‚Äúascend‚Äù. The word \\"Tegeru\\" ('t…ôg…ôru‚Äô ) (v., pl.) (‚Äú·â∞·åà·à©‚Äù) (·åç·ç£ ·â•·ãô) describes the ascension of the earliest indigenous people to the mountainous highland part of Eritrea as the first settlers of the plateau. Tigrina people literally, thus, means the ascended people, referring to the highland people of Eritrea. Together with the Tigre people, the Tigrina tribe, known as Tigretes, were first mentioned around 300 BC near Adulis. This theory is the accepted version of events on the Eritrean side of the border. Another theory relates to the narrative of Tigrai and Tigray people in Tigray, Ethiopia. This theory states that Tigrai people (Tigrinya: ·â∞·åã·à©; t√§garu) are the people who speak Tigrigna in Eritrea and Tigrinya-speaking people in present-day Tigray region (of Ethiopia), with the exclusion of Tigre speaking people in Eritrea.Levine, Donald (1965). Wax & Gold. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. pp. 1‚Äì2. This theory is recounted by Tigrinya speaking people on the Ethiopian side of the border. There is currently no etymological and chronological evidence to support this theory. There is some evidence that the name Tigra is an old Persian name for Tiger.F. Delitzsch, Sumerisches Glossar, Leipzig (1914), IV, 6, 21. There has been discord between these two narratives for centuries and it has played a part in igniting several wars, most recently the Eritrean-Ethiopian (1998 - 2000) border war.  Tigray- Tigrigni or Tigrigni-Tigray  Both the Tigrina and Tigre tribes of the Tigurats people are very close kin to Tigrai and Tigrayan in Tigray, Ethiopia. All the Tigrina,Tigre and Tigray peoples were supposedly the same people until the 8th century, sharing the Aksumite Kingdom before its demise. Tigurats in Eritrea and Tigrayans in Ethiopia grew apart in lexical, societal construction and dialect from around 9th century, right after the conquest of the Red Sea coast by the Abbasid Caliphate. The conquest cut all the trade routes and relationships of the Aksumite Kingdom had with the outside world. This led to the Kingdom's demise. At the time, Tigrayans in Tigray abandoned the declining Kingdom of Aksum and the Tigurats built both the kingdom of Medri Bahri in Eritrea by Bahre Negasi/Bahre Negash. In English, this means \\"king of the Sea\\" and the Zagwe Dynasty in Ethiopia by Morara Gebrekrstos of Hamassien. The divergence between the two Tigrigna language speaking people has been on record for the last millennium. However, unwittingly the term Tigray-Tigrigni (‚ÄòT…ôgray-T…™…°r…™gn…™‚Äô) (·âµ·åç·à´·ã≠ ·âµ·åç·à™·äö) was used by Tigrigna speakers in Ethiopia to manifest the distinction. Tigrigni was used to refer to the people who speak the Tigrigna language in Eritrean. Likewise, Tigray was used to describe the speakers of Tigrinya in Ethiopia. The Eritrean version of the language is spelled as Tigrigna/·âµ·åç·à≠·äõ and pronounced differently implying the actual dialect adhered by Eritrean Tigrigna speakers. Similarly, the Ethiopian version of the language is spelled as Tigrinya \\"·âµ·åç·à≠·äì\\" and pronounced in line to the dialect adhered by Tigrinya speakers in Ethiopia. The Tigrina people in Eritrea and Tigray people in Ethiopia have been erroneously portrayed as the same people sharing common ancestors with the exclusion of Tigre people from the domain. The exclusion of Tigre speaking Tigurats is considered a conscious misrepresentation and disregard to the historical context, and cannot be a tenable argument. On the other hand, Tigrina tribe Tigurats in Eritrea, with the exception of a few communities along the border, do not consider themselves the same people to Tigray tribe in Tigray. To the contrary, some Tigrayans prefer to consider themselves as the same people with Tigrina in Eritrea sharing common ancestors. Rather both Tigrina and Tigre peoples were the same people up until the 13th century. At the time, both of the Tigurat people were also believed to have spoken the same language known as Ge‚Äôez and adhered to the Orthodox Tewahedo Church. However, Tigre people in Eritrea were forced to submit and convert into Islam following the expansion of Islam in the 11th century and the subsequent conquest of the Ottoman Empire to the Red Sea Coast and northern highlands in the 15th century. Tigre people, thus, were cut off from the outside world and obliged to keep most of the Ge‚Äôez dialect. Tigrina people, on the other hand, diverged from Ge‚Äôez developing a different dialect to adapt to the changing dynamics in their surroundings since the 11th century.  Origin  This part of the planet is considered to be the location of the origin of the human race. It is believed that the first ancestors of the human race migrated to other parts of the world from this area. Bob Walter discovered the oldest evidence of stone tools near the coastal areas of Eritrea. The tools are believed to be 125,000 years old. Modern Tigrigni or Tigrina people are suggested to be descendants or an admixture of the ancient people who settled in Eritrea (Erythrea) before 1800 BC. There were already people living on the Red Sea coast and Eritrean highlands from Palaeolithic and Neolithic ages and thus it is logical to assume there was intermingling between these people and subsequent migrants. Eritrea has seen migration and settlement of many people at different periods in its history. The Kunama, the Nara, the Beja, the Greeks, the Assyrians, the Indians, the Persians, and the Kush have their respective origin of myths, like most ancient and medieval peoples. One of the first known inhabitants of Eritrea is the Kunama and Nara people. They migrated from the southern Nile valley before 2500 BC and settled in the southern lowlands and central highlands of the country. And in Around 2000 BC early Beja pastoral people from Nubia (southern Egypt and northern Sudan) entered to Barka valley and northern highlands of Eritrea. Beja displaced the first wave of Kunama and Nara people southwards. Earliest Beja migrants to the highlands of Eritrea around 2000 BC.  Settlements and Kingdoms = Ona  Ona-Site, earliest settlement in Asmara around 800 - 350 BC. The oldest settled pastoral and agricultural community lived in Ona around 800 BC. Ona site refers to the villages and towns around Asmara. Ona was the oldest known indigenous culture in the Horn Africa. Archaeologist Peter Schmidt compared Asmara settlement to those of Athens and Rome. Semitic language known as Tigre was also believed to be spoken in the region around 1000 BC.  D'mt Kingdom  D'mt (Daamat) Kingdom around 500BC. D'mt (Daamat) was believed to be home for settled community in Southern Eritrean and Northern Ethiopia from around 8th century BC to 4th century BC. Archaeological evidences for D'mt Kingdom are very scant.  Metera Metera was a major city in the D ømt and Aksumite kingdoms. Since Eritrean independence, the National Museum of Eritrea has petitioned the Ethiopian government to return artifacts removed from the site. However, the efforts have thus far been rebuffed. Hawulti, a pre-Aksumite or early Aksumite era obelisk, is situated here. Kingdom of D ømt (circa 8th century BCE).  Adulian kingdom  The Greeks, the Romans, the Assyrians, the Persians and the Indians traveled to the political and trade center called Adulis Kingdom on the Red Sea coast around 300 BC. At the time, Adulis was ruled by a Greek ruler, Zoskales. The tribes near Adulis were supposedly known \\"Tigretes\\", making it the first mention of the Tigurat people of Eritrea. Archaeological survey of islands on the Red Sea coast shows there were Roman settlers in the area around the 1st century AD. The Agaw people of northern Ethiopia started to intermingle with the indigenous highland settlers in Eritrea, with the rise of the Aksumite Empire around 150 BC. Adulis Kingdom around 300 BC.Aksumite Kingdom around 150 BC.  Qohayto  Temple of Mariam Wakino at Qohayto A tomb entrance on the Qohaito plateau (1965). Rock art near Qohaito appears to indicate habitation in the area since the fifth millennium BC, while the town is known to have survived to the sixth century AD. Mount Emba Soira, Eritrea's highest mountain, lies near the site, as does a small successor village. Rock art in the Adi Alauti cave Qohaito is often identified as the town Koloe described in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greco- Roman document dated to the end of the first century AD.G.W.B. Huntingford, Historical Geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704 (London: British Academy, 1989), pp. 38f The settlement thrived as a stop on the trade route between Adulis and Aksum. It is thought that crops were interspersed with buildings in the town. These old edifices included the pre-Christian Temple of Mariam Wakino and the Sahira Dam, which might also be pre- Aksumite.Phillipson, David (2012);Foundations of an African Civilisation: Aksum and the northern Horn, 1000 BC-AD 1300;. The ruins at Qohaito were first located in 1868. However, they were at the time erroneously identified as a \\"Greek depot\\".C. R.

History  In February 1905, the prominent physician Frederick Teepoo Hall called a meeting of scholars to call attention to the need for an organization which protected the profession of massage. By December 1905, the idea had considerable traction and Teepoo Hall convened a special meeting to form the Australasian Massage Association (AMA) with the purpose of establishing massage as a professional field. Sir Thomas Anderson Stuart was the association's first president. The first formal field of study for physiotherapy was developed by the AMA, and was approved by Federal Council in May 1906. During World War I and World War II, physical therapy and massage as a field became in much higher demand, and the term physiotherapy became more well known. At the Second National Physiotherapy Congress in 1939, a decision was made to rename the organization as the Australian Physiotherapy Association. The APA began publishing Australian Journal of Physiotherapy (which was later renamed the Journal of Physiotherapy) in 1954. In August 1962 Queen Elizabeth II granted royal patronage to the APA.

He was brother to Flemish merchant, art collector and art dealer Ferdinand van den Eynde, and father of the latter's namesake Ferdinand van den Eynde, Marquess of Castelnuovo. Van den Eynde's granddaughters were Elizabeth van den Eynde, Princess of Belvedere and Baroness of Gallicchio and Missanello, and Jane (Giovanna) van den Eynde, Princess of Galatro and Sonnino. Early life and family Van den Eynde was born in Antwerp, Spanish Netherlands, into a wealthy family of merchants, artists and art dealers possibly tied to the local nobility. The Van den Eynde were related to several notable Netherlandish artists, including Brueghel, Jode, and Lucas and Cornelis de Wael. Lucas and Cornelis de Wael were Ferdinand van den Eynde's nephews. Move to Italy In the early seventeenth century, at least two Van den Eyndes moved to Italy. Jan and his brother Ferdinand departed from Flanders either together or at different times. Ferdinand reportedly was active in Venice as early as the second decade of the 17th century. He would later resettle in Genoa, ca. 1619, before moving to Southern Italy. Jan, on the other hand, firstly appears in Naples, as he did not follow his brother in either Venice or Genoa. Epitaph of Ferdinand Van den Eynde by Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, Santa Maria dell'Anima, Rome Between 1633 and 1640, a remarkable epitaph to Jan's brother Ferdinand was realized in Rome by Fran√ßois Duquesnoy. The putti included in this funerary monument are considered one of Duquesnoy's best realizations. Both Giovanni Battista Passeri and Giovanni Pietro Bellori stressed the fame of the Van den Eynde's putti, which served as models of the infant putto for contemporary artists. Other notable artists praised the Van den Eynde's putti, among whom Johann Joachim Winckelmann (generally a harsh critic of Baroque sculpture) and Peter Paul Rubens, who requested a copy of them and commented \\"I do not know how [...] can I praise their beauty properly. It is nature, rather than art, that has formed them; the marble is softened into living flesh.\\" Ferdinand died prematurely in Rome in 1630, and was buried in Santa Maria dell'Anima. His nephew Cornelis de Wael was buried next to him. Two days before his death, Ferdinand made his will, bequeathing his art collection to his brother Jan. In Naples, Jan established himself firstly as a dealer in grain, silk, diamonds, and lace. Later, Van den Eynde also became a successful banker. In 1636, Van den Eynde entered a partnership with Gaspar Roomer, whose company dealt in luxury goods, lace, silk, grain, diamonds and ship insurance. When Van den Eynde became Roomer's partner and co-owner of their company, there was a substantial increase in the company's volume of business, particularly in brokering operations and silk trading. Jan van den Eynde became exceedingly rich. This allowed him, among other things, to buy his son Ferdinand a peerage title. He purchased the monumental Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano, in central Naples, which he acquired in 1653. Van den Eynde would go on to fill the palace with a colossal collection of paintings, by artist such as Leonard Bramer, Giacinto Brandi, Jan van Boeckhorst, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Paul Bril, Viviano Codazzi, Aniello Falcone, Guercino, David de Haen, Pieter van Laer, Jan Miel, Cornelius van Poelenburch, Cornelis Schut, Goffredo Wals, Bartolomeo Passante, Mattia Preti, Pieter Paul Rubens, Carlo Saraceni, Massimo Stanzione, Van Dyck, Simon Vouet, Pieter de Witte and many others. Throughout the Baroque period, the Van den Eynde's was the largest collection of paintings in Naples and the Napoletano. It included the finest artwork of Italian and Flemish painters. Their collections influenced other art collectors of the period, and had a fundamental influence on the following generation of local painters. Jan van den Eynde did not only become one of the richest men in Naples, but also one of the most prominent figures in the city, developing strong ties with the Italian nobility and a close relationship with the viceroys. The Neapolitan citizens called him Vand√¨n. Last years and progeny Jan van den Eynde made his will in 1671, and died in Naples in 1674, the same year his son Ferdinand passed away. Ferdinand, Marquess of Castelnuovo, was Jan van den Eynde's designated heir. However, in 1671 Van den Eynde ordered several legati. He left an yearly 10 000 ducats' revenue off some of his landed estate to his infant grandson, Don Giovanni Mastrillo-van den Eynde, 3rd Marquess of Gallo (later 5th Duke of Marigliano) the son of his daughter Catherine van den Eynde, provided that his grandson add Van den Eynde to his surname (item lascio jure legati a D. Giovanni Mastrillo Marchese del Gallo mio carissimo nipote docati 10 mila di capitale con sue annue entrate, cio√® docati 5000 sopra la gabella del carlino a staro d'oglio, che da me si possiede, e gli altri docati 5000 sopra la grana 25 ad oncia con li loro frutti, con condizione, che appresso il suo Cognome si debba mettere il mio di Vandeneynden) and the right to 10 000 ducats' worth of income off his land is never sold, lent out, or pledged. Van den Eynde ordered an identical legato for the firstborn that would be produced from the marriage between his other daughter, Donna Giovanna Maria van den Eynde (mother of Giuseppe di Gennaro Vandeneynden, 1st Prince of Sirignano), and Don Filippo di Gennaro, with the same conditions: that the surname Van den Eynde be appended and the bequest not given away. Both marriages produced offspring, and both heirs added Van den Eynde to their name. Van den Eynde's son Ferdinand, for whom, as mentioned, he purchased a peerage title, married Olimpia Piccolomini, nephew of Cardinal Celio Piccolomini, restored the Van den Eynde's Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano, widened its art collection, and built the Villa Carafa of Belvedere in Vomero. Ferdinand had two daughters, Elizabeth and Jane, who married the heirs of two of the most powerful Italian families, the Colonna and the Carafa. Both marriages produced offspring.

An accountant by trade, Lind volunteered for service during the First World War, eventually being killed in action on the Western Front in France. Correspondence written by Lind prior to his death later became widely published in his native Newfoundland, with Lind becoming a symbol of Newfoundlander service in the war. In light of his writings, Lind has been referred to as \\"Newfoundland's unofficial news correspondent\\" during the First World War.  Biography  Lind was born on March 9, 1879 in Betts Cove, Little Bay, Newfoundland. He was the son of a schoolteacher and one of five children. Following his schooling, Lind found work as a clerk and later as an accountant for a number of Canadian businesses, including Ayre and Sons. When the First World War broke out, Lind - who at 35 was older than most recruits - volunteered for military service, joining the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. Lind and the regiment were first deployed to England for training and later to Fort George, Highland. While there, he wrote his first correspondence, one part of which (a complaint about the poor quality of English tobacco) was published in a St. John's newspaper and spurred the Imperial Tobacco Company to send the Newfoundland Regiment extra tobacco supplies. This occurrence allowed Lind to sign up for regular shipments of tobacco, known in the regiment as the \\"Mayo-Lind Tobacco Fund\\". Lind was also nicknamed \\"Mayo Lind\\" due to his new association with tobacco companies. In 1915 the Newfoundland regiment was shipped to Egypt for acclimatization and then mobilized for the Gallipoli campaign. During the drawn out campaign and battles around Sulva Bay, Lind was hospitalized for jaundice, frostbite, and later influenza. In the spring of 1916 the Newfoundlanders were deployed to the front lines in France, taking up positions near Beaumont-Hamel. Lind continued to write until June 26, stopping before the start of the 1916 Battle of the Somme on July 1.Encyclopedia of Nfld (Smallwood et al.). G. W. L. Nicholson, The fighting Newfoundlander: a history of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment (St John‚Äôs, [1964]). M. L. Taylor, Westward with Henry and Caroline (Grand Falls, Nfld, 1989). On the first day of the offensive, the Newfoundland Regiment assaulted the German positions, losing several hundred men before being forced back. While advancing across a field near a landmark (a tree known as the \\"Danger Tree\\"), Lind was killed in action. His remains were not identified until after the battle, with Lind eventually being interned in the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial. Lind's death was reported on in local Newfoundland newspapers. Following the war, Lind's correspondence was published in Newfoundland and eventually released as a volume, The letters of Mayo Lind. Lind's writings were disseminated throughout Newfoundland, with one source describing Lind as \\"Newfoundland's unofficial news correspondent\\". The Dictionary of Canadian Biography notes that Lind is remembered as a symbol of Newfoundler resilience during the First World War.

It was operated on two separate licenses by two separate groups, each of which ended with authority to continue operations being denied by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). History=First license By 1960, three applicants sought the use of 1460 kHz in Burlington County: the Burlington Broadcasting Company, owned by William Halpern and Louis Seltzer and proposing operation of the station in Burlington, and the Burlington County Broadcasting Company (co- owned with the Mount Holly Herald daily newspaper) and Mount Holly-Burlington Broadcasting Company, which proposed to build at Mount Holly, respectively. The three applications, mutually exclusive with each other, were designated for comparative hearing, in which major issues included nighttime coverage and protests by two nearby outlets, WFPG in Atlantic City and WBCB at Levittown, Pennsylvania. In an initial decision, FCC hearing examiner Jay A. Kyle selected the Burlington County Broadcasting application in May 1962. Kyle found that the allocation of the station to Mount Holly‚Äîwhich had no licensed radio stations‚Äîover Burlington would promote equitable distribution of service, and that the Burlington County Broadcasting application would serve more people than that of Mount Holly-Burlington, headed by John J. Farina. Appeals of the initial decision at the FCC stretched well into 1963; when Farina's credibility was questioned, he submitted to a lie detector test, believed to be a first in an FCC proceeding. Burlington Broadcasting was finally denied in June 1963, in an initial decision that granted the construction permit to Mount Holly-Burlington. On December 14, 1963, Burlington County gained its first radio station when WJJZ began broadcasting as a 5,000-watt, daytime-only outlet. The brand-new station aired a middle-of- the-road music format, though an omen as to the rocky history that would ensue was quick to come. On its fourth day of operation, a field mouse entered the transmitter on Burlington Island; it was electrocuted, and the station was silenced for 30 minutes. Within months, a series of legal problems derailed the station's operations. Burlington Broadcasting challenged the FCC decision against its application in court; the court ordered hearings be held. In July 1964, the station failed to appear at a hearing in Mount Holly; as a result, the company was placed in default and a receiver appointed. Days later, the FCC hearing examiner recommended that the license application be denied and the underlying construction permit be canceled and program testing ended. In December, the FCC recommended Burlington Broadcasting's application be granted over that of another aspiring owner, the West Jersey Broadcasting Company, owned by Henry H. Bisbee, a Burlington optometrist. However, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the FCC in March 1965 to accept West Jersey's application and any others made for a station at Mount Holly. Radio listeners in Burlington County continued to hear WJJZ's broadcasts into 1965. Second license By early 1967, the FCC had four applications pending, from Burlington Broadcasting, Mount Holly- Burlington, West Jersey Broadcasting, and a new entrant, the Burlington-Ocean Broadcasting Company; West Jersey and Burlington-Ocean both specified daytime- only operation. The commission dismissed Mount Holly-Burlington immediately for failure to prosecute. On March 29, 1967, after reaching FCC-approved settlements with the other two competing applicants in the amount of $35,000 (for Burlington Broadcasting) and $7,795 (for Burlington-Ocean Broadcasting), the West Jersey Broadcasting Company received the construction permit for the second WJJZ, requesting the facilities of its predecessor on Burlington Island. (second license) The new outlet took to the air on July 13, restoring local broadcasting to Burlington County after more than two years. To get the station, West Jersey was reported to have spent $200,000, more than two-thirds of that in legal fees and the remainder in purchases of equipment owned by the receiver for Mount Holly-Burlington and used in operating the previous incarnation of WJJZ; the new owners quipped that \\"only the call letters remain the same\\". It did not take long for new financial problems to emerge. The station began to fall behind on its payments to the United Press International news agency; in February 1969, UPI sued for $7,649 in unpaid services and damages. West Jersey filed to renew its license on January 30, 1975. A month later, however, a competing application emerged, from Farina and John H. Vivian, doing business as the Mount Holly Radio Company. The competition was serious for West Jersey, which had made several legal lapses at the FCC. The headline charge, which emerged in 1976, was that the company had improperly paid an additional $25,000 to competing applicant Burlington-Ocean Broadcasting Company, after its principal, Frank Allen, requested funds beyond those in the FCC-approved settlement agreement that reimbursed Burlington- Ocean for its expenses; in addition, a stockholder had concealed option agreements from the commission. By 1977, the station was airing a country music format. At license renewal hearings, Nicholas Grand, one of the three principals in West Jersey, said that West Jersey paid the money as a bribe to local officials in its efforts to obtain a cable television franchise. His partner William McDaniel admitted the payment had been made, but as an \\"investment\\", not a bribe. In 1978, administrative law judge Thomas B. Fitzpatrick recommended denial of the WJJZ license renewal application and found Mount Holly Radio unfit to be a licensee. The decision was later sent by the FCC back to the judge, who confirmed his prior ruling in February 1982. By this time, the station broadcast from Camden's city hall building. The FCC Review Board affirmed the decision in June 1982, calling West Jersey Broadcasting \\"utterly and irredeemably unfit\\" and rejecting a proposal to save the facility by selling to a partner who was not involved in the 1967 payoff, which it declared \\"brazen\\" and \\"border[ing] on the incredible\\". Burlington County radio after WJJZ Burlington County would wait nearly a decade for a new station‚Äîand get two in the same month. In 1984, the FCC granted Real Life Broadcasting a construction permit for a new 1460 station in Mount Holly; the group, controlled by the Fountain of Life Church in Florence Township, had the city of license moved there and finally received zoning approval for the transmitter facility on the order of a judge in 1988. The station, originally known as WRLB, began broadcasting as WIFI in November 1992. Farina and his Mount Holly Radio Company would file for 640 kHz, a clear channel frequency that rule changes allowed to be installed on a high-power outlet in New Jersey, in 1980. Construction began on the facility more than a decade later, in 1991, and WWJZ began broadcasting in November 1992, on Thanksgiving Day. WWJZ itself moved to the Florence site in 1994.

Puerto Rican superheroes take on man- made disasters as well such as pollution, debt, military occupation and they rally around reconstruction efforts after the disasters. Comic books are a male dominated industry but there are a growing number of Puerto Rican and Latinx female superheroes, especially in indie publications.  Puerto Rican Super Heroes  Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez‚Äôs LA BORINQUENA received widespread attention for creating Marisol, a New York City college student turned superhero who uses her powers to save the environment and her beloved island of Puerto Rico. Her superpowers from the Ta√≠no gods of her Puerto Rican ancestors, was acquired by the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History‚Äôs Superheroes exhibition. Marisol is the only superhero in the exhibit that was created and published independently and is not part of a large comic book imprint like Marvel. Ricanstruction: Reminiscing & Rebuiliding Puerto Rico (2018) is an anthology featuring the Puerto Rican comic book community of artists and friends such as Gail Simone, Greg Pak, Reginald Hudlin, Denys Cowan, Tony Daniel, Bill Sienkiewicz, Yanick Paquette, Gabby Rivera, Will Rosado, Jorge Jimenez, Mike Allred, Chris Sotomayor, and Latinx celebrities such as Rosario Dawson, Ruben Blades, Javier Munoz, and Sonia Manzano. Among the highlighted Puerto Rican artists and organizers is Edgardo Miranda- Rodriguez creator of La Borinque√±a, the Puerto Rican heroine he created in 2016, who fights alongside Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman for the betterment of Puerto Rico. Proceeds from the sale of the book were directed to the rebuild of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Giannina Braschi and Joakim Lindengren collaborated on the comic book United States of Banana (2017), a prophetic book that depicts natural disasters, war, the rise of Donald Trump as \\"Oliver Exterminator\\", and liberation of Puerto Rico. The superheroes are drawn as aging intellectuals: the Puerto Rican poet Giannina, the depressed actor Hamlet, and the bearded, decrepit philosopher Zarathustra; they join forces to free the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo from the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty. The first Puerto Rican superhero in a Marvel comics was the first White Tiger, Hector Ayala, a street level crime fighter in the 1970s and 1980s. A person becomes the White Tiger via the powers of a magical amulet that enhances the body to superhuman levels. Yo-Yo Rodriguez (Slingshot, 2017) is a Puerto Rican born superhero and daughter of known super-criminal John Horton, aka the Griffin. She has the ability to run faster than a human heartbeat.

It is a remnant of a dry fallen meander of the river Moselle.  Geography  The Geisberg is a narrow, elongated mountain ridge in a valley widening of the Middle Moselle. Surrounded by a wide circulating valley, it stands isolated from the other Moselle Hills and the adjacent Haardtwald Hills of the Hunsr√ºck. Starting from M√ºlheim on Moselle, about half a kilometer from the banks of the Moselle, it extends over 3 km to the south, past Veldenz village up to the village of Burgen. Its flanks, which are well developed with numerous paved paths, are almost entirely covered with vineyards. It has two wooded summits, of which the more southerly near Veldenz is 262 m above sea level and the other in its central area 226 m. The peaks are lying 80 to 100 m above the level of the surrounding valley.. The Geisberg is located in the region of the Middle Moselle. It belongs to the right-hand side, the Hunsr√ºck facing Moselle Hills, which are part of the Rhenish Massif on the left bank of the river Rhine. The hills of this region were not raised by tectonic uplift of individual masses from a low-lying plain, but rather through downcutting which cut valleys and ravines into a coherent mountain mass. The predominant rocks are Clay Slate and Greywacke from the Lower Devonian which is not quite water resistant.  Genesis  The Old Moselle: Course and breakthroughs between the former circulated mountains of Osann-Veldenz. From the Quaternary onwards, the Moselle formed Meander in an originally flat plain with a balanced, flat undulating relief and cut progressively into today's narrow valley. At the beginning of the Upper Middle Terrace period, the Geisberg was a peninsula in a Moselle meander. On the west side of the mountain, the Moselle turned south, deviating from today's course, and turned in a loop near Burgen village back north and further along the east side. The Moselle continued flowing across the today's course past the Brauneberg mountain, and further in a north-westerly direction through the valley of Osann-Monzel into the Wittlich Depression. There it turned back south and reached in Lieser the current course of the river again, at 2 to 3 km from the point where these bends began. At the time of the Lower Terrace, a first breakthrough of the Moselle took place on what was then an impact slope near today's M√ºlheim. Further breakthroughs followed at the villages of Noviand and Maring. The Geisberg became the first and oldest circulating mountain in this area, before the Noviander H√ºttenkopf and the Maring Mountain. Today the rivulets Frohnbach and Veldenzer Bach are flowing through the former Moselle valley at the Geisberg.

It is located in the Columbus Civic Center area, diagonal to Columbus City Hall. The mid-century modern building was designed by Benham, Richards and Armstrong and completed in 1957. It was first owned by the Beacon Mutual Indemnity Co., and was sold to the City of Columbus in 1987, which used it for government offices until 2018. History Construction began around 1955, with an expected opening on May 1, 1957. The building was completed in 1957. It was purchased by the city in 1978 for just over $2 million. At this time, the city extensively renovated it, and it became home to five city agencies: the Departments of Community Services and Public Utilities, the Divisions of Electricity and Traffic Engineering, and the Civil Service Commission. The city tried selling it five years later for $2 million, though there were no buyers. It later became home to only the city's public service department. By mid-2018, the department moved to the new Michael B. Coleman Government Center, and the city was looking to sell the Beacon Building to a developer. In 2014, most of the building's three decorative fins were removed. The aluminum fins were removed following a faulty bolt breaking in the wind. The removal work included a full exterior inspection, which found other deteriorated bolts, though no other damage. Design The Beacon Building was designed by Benham, Richards and Armstrong, a Columbus architecture firm. It has six stories and . The building was a notable entry in a Columbus Landmarks-hosted mid-century modern architecture survey in 2011-12. The building features numerous midcentury modern materials: a red granite tower and storefront base, Indiana limestone curtain walls, and three decorative aluminum fins. The fins originally stretched parallel to each other from the first story to the sixth, in 5-foot sections, though most of the sections were removed in 2014. The building has narrow hallways and ramps with unusual turns and corners, leading some offices to be large and others remarkably small.

The Warriors' Day Parade Council organizes, promotes and executes this event every year. History The parade council was formed in Toronto in 1921, extending the work of the Canadian National Exhibition which had been hosting military parades and demonstrations beginning in 1879. The council desired a specific day to pay tribute to living veterans of the First World War. \\"Warriors' Day\\" was therefore declared; in early years, it was the first day of the Exhibition. The first parade was held in 1921, and the parade has continued to honour the service of Canadian men and women in the armed forces ever since. The parade is often planned to commemorate specific events. In 2015, the parade commemorated veterans of World War II. In 2017, the parade was designed to commemorate the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the Dieppe Raid. In 2020 the parade was cancelled due to COVID-19. Participants Following the world wars, participants in the parade included up to 30,000 military veterans. In 2019 the number of veterans participating was estimated at just below 3,000. A number of privately owned military vehicles and classic cars also take part in the parade.

Early life and education HoSang was born in Springfield St. James, Jamaica to Mr. and Mrs. Henry HoSang who had migrated from China in the early 1900s. He is the eighth child of ten, six boys and four girls. At age 12, HoSang's parents moved to Montego Bay. He received his early education at Cornwall College. In February of 1968, HoSang migrated to the Bronx, New York. Career In February 1978, HoSang and his wife bought a fast food store known as Kingsbridge Delight in the West Bronx, selling fried chicken, shrimp, ribs, and French fries. In 1980, Sunrise Bakery on Dyre Avenue, which was owned by another West Indian, became available. The HoSangs bought it in December 1980 with the intention of making it a full-fledged Jamaican bakery and changed its name to Royal Caribbean Bakery. In 1984, they expanded into a 15,000 sq ft.facility on East 233rd street in the Bronx where Caribbean Food Delights was incorporated and became the frozen food division of Royal Caribbean Bakery. The company at this stage expanded into the wholesale trade. Three years later in 1987, both companies expanded into a 20,000 sq ft facility in Mount Vernon, New York. The HoSangs next bought a 73,000 sq. ft. building on 10 acres of property in Tappan, New York in 1993 and named it Caribbean Food Delights. Philantrophy HoSang established the Vincent HoSang Family Foundation (VHFF) in April 2002 as a means of giving back to the community and educating future entrepreneurs. The VHFF is a 501(c)(3) organization that comprises the philanthropic arm of Caribbean Food Delights and Royal Caribbean Bakery. The foundation funds full scholarships for six students studying entrepreneurship at the University of the West Indies. The Vincent HoSang University of the West Indies Venture Competition (UWIVC) was started in 2002. Sponsorship was taken over by the foundation since its inception. Each year, the foundation is involved in a range of philanthropic projects, such as serving over 4,000 meals to student athletes at the Penn Relays in Pennsylvania every year, and donating US$250,000 to Missionaries of the Poor in Jamaica to build a place of worship, a food pantry, and other community activities. Personal life HoSang met his wife, Jeanette (n√©e Leefatt), who is from Spanish Town, Jamaica, in New York City and got married in August 1976. The couple have four children: Damian, Sabrina, Simone and Brian. Brian HoSang met in a fatal motorcycle crash on May 12, 2008 at the age of 24.

Its battery capacity is lower than in the Model S and only slightly higher than in the Model 3 Long Range. At RMB 229,800 ($32,800), the base electric model is cheaper than any Tesla. The all-wheel drive, performance variant costs RMB 279,500 ($40,000). The BYD Han utilizes a kind of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery dubbed \\"the blade battery\\" by the manufacturer. This type of battery takes less space than a conventional LFP battery of the same capacity. The manufacturer also emphasized the battery's safety even in case of damage, and showed the results of a test in which the battery was pierced with a nail while an uncooked egg was placed on top of it. The battery's temperature remained low even when it was pierced with a nail, and the egg remained uncooked.

He is now in his sixties, and he works for the town's largest merchant and eventually also consul, Gordon Tidemand, the son of Theodor at Bua (known from the books Children of the Age and Segelfoss Town). August is only referred to by the people of the town as Altmulig 'the Handyman', and his former desire to create development, change, and greatness seems to be gone. August is now a helper and indispensable handyman, who has apparently found his place under the consul's friendly hand.

She worked as an educator for deaf students and advocated for the deaf community throughout her life. Hanson also wrote poetry and edited a newspaper for the deaf. Early life Agatha Mary Agnes Tiegel was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 14, 1873. At age seven she contracted spinal meningitis, which left her deaf and blind in one eye. She attended a private Catholic school beginning at age nine, and when she was thirteen began attending the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. Education at Gallaudet Gallaudet College (then named the National Deaf- Mute College until 1894) enrolled women on an experimental basis in 1887 and six women enrolled. Tiegel enrolled in preparatory classes at the college in 1888 at the age of fifteen. To overcome the challenges women faced in an overwhelmingly male environment, thirteen women students established a literary society named O.W.L.S. in 1892, naming Tiegel their president. The group discussed literature and debated with each other, since they were not permitted to debate with male students. The meaning of the O.W.L.S. abbreviation is secret, with only members knowing what the letters stand for. Over time O.W.L.S. would become a national alumnae organization, and in 1954 the National O.W.L.S. changed their name to Phi Kappa Zeta. Graduation Tiegel was the only woman to graduate from the College in 1893 and the class valedictorian. Although the \\"experimental\\" status of women students had been made permanent in 1889, deaf women still had reasons to feel their education was not valued as highly as that of men. At commencement, Tiegel gave a fiery speech titled \\"The Intellect of Women,\\" saying, \\"That such repression and restraint upon mental action are artificial has been demonstrated in all ages by women whose independence has burst every fetter and won them recognition in the fields of science, theology, literature, politics and art.\\" Alto May Lowman was the first woman to graduate from the school, receiving her Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1892; Tiegel was the first woman to earn what was considered the more prestigious Bachelor of Arts degree. Career After graduating Tiegel accepted an appointment to teach at the Minnesota School for the Deaf, where she worked for six years. She married deaf architect Olof Hanson in 1899; they moved to Seattle and had three children. Hanson was a prolific writer. She wrote poetry throughout her life and published a book of poems titled Overflow Verses. In her poem titled \\"Inner Music,\\" she described her deafness as an \\"imperfection,\\" but one that allowed for \\"diviner harmony\\" and \\"peacefulness\\". She contributed articles to a national newspaper for the deaf, The Silent Worker, and later served as an editor for the Seattle newspaper for the deaf community, The Seattle Observer. Later life Hanson and her husband were both influential leaders in the Seattle-area deaf community. She was active in several organizations, including the Puget Sound Association of the Deaf, the Washington State Association of the Deaf, and the deaf mission of the Episcopal Church. Hanson died in Portland, Oregon on October 17, 1959. Legacy Gallaudet's Hanson Plaza and Dining Hall is named in her honor. In 2014 Gallaudet celebrated its 150th anniversary by selecting fifteen notable alumni to highlight as \\"visionary leaders\\"; both Hanson and her husband, Olof, were among the fifteen selected. In 2020 a biography of Hanson was written by Kathy Jankowski, Agatha Tiegel Hanson: Our Places in the Sun.

The fire complex consisted of fires in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, including fires that had previously been separately tracked as the Warnella and Waddell fires. The firefighting effort was primarily administered by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The fires started at 6:41 AM on August 16, 2020, the result of a thunderstorm that produced close to 11,000 bolts of lightning and started hundreds of fires throughout California. These lightning strikes initially started fires separately known as the Warnella Fire, near Davenport and the Waddell Fire, near Waddell Creek, as well as three fires on what would become the northern edge of the CZU Complex fire. Two days after the fires began, a change in wind conditions caused these three northern fires to rapidly expand and merge, growing quickly to over 40,000 acres. The fires destroyed 8,988 buildings, including those in the communities of Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, and Swanton; and along Empire Grade Road. Fires burned in both Butano and Big Basin Redwoods state parks, where a number of historic buildings were destroyed, including the visitor's center at Big Basin.

In handling his neologisms, Lem singles out two translators. Irmtraud Zimmermann-G√∂llheim (German), in Lem's opinion, remarkably succeeded in literal translation, while Michael Kandel (English) was inventive in finding semantic equivalents in English in difficult cases.Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr., Twenty-Two Answers and Two Postscripts: An Interview with Stanislaw Lem, Science Fiction Studies, #40 (Volume 13, Part 3), November 1986Lem's interview to , page 6, Shargh newspaper He also singled out a Russian mathematician Shirokov (Feliks ShirokovFeliks Shirokov's page at fantlab.ru) for finding fitting language equivalents in translation of Lem's grotesque-humorous works.

History In 1986 the Social Credit Party changed its name to the Democratic Party. Many activists in the party were uneasy with the rebranding, fearing that the party would jettison the social credit monetary policies that had always been central to the party since its creation in 1953. In July 1988 former Social Credit Party leader Bruce Beetham established Social Credit-NZ after coming to the belief that the Democratic Party was no longer a true social credit based party. Beetham and party president Alan Shaw said the new party would offer an alternative to interventionist and free-market policies by resurrecting original social credit economic ideas. At its launch the party said it intended to contest every electorate at the and already had 45 members lined up to contest electorates. Few rated the party as having much chance of electoral success and media were quick to compare it with the New Democratic Party, a previous splinter social credit party in 1972, which quickly vanished. At the 1990 election the party fielded 68 candidates and won 17,897 votes, only 0.98% of the total compared to the Democrats' 30,455 (1.67%). In March 1991 Beetham retired from the leadership of the party. He was replaced by Martin Hine, an Auckland lawyer, who had been a Social Credit candidate in and in and respectively. Beetham remained the party spokesperson on finance. Shaw also resigned as president and was replaced with Heather Maloney. As leader Hine attempted to conciliate with the Democrats, even going as far as to join the Democratic Party to negotiate a merger. His application for membership was treated with suspicion by the Democrats however. Hine resigned as leader after just nine months; he announced his resignation on 13 November 1991, called for reunification with the Democrats and announced he would remain a member only of the Democrats. Beetham resumed the leadership of the party which continued on as more of pressure group organisation dedicated to furthering Social Credit monetary aims and financial principles. Eventually the remaining members of the party ended up as part of a supposedly centrist party known as the New Zealand Coalition after joining together with the remnants of the New Zealand Party and the United NZ Party. In 2018 the Democratic Party changed its name back to the Social Credit Party. Electoral results { class=wikitable - ! Election ! Candidates ! # of seats won !

She developed the first female-sounding voice synthesizer.  Early life  Syrdal was born on December 13, 1945 in Minneapolis. Her father, Richard, was a physicist and engineer; her mother, Marjorie () was a sales clerk. She was raised by her mother after her father died when she was two years old.  Career  Syrdal became interested in psychology after helping with laboratory experiments involving rats, and subsequently completed a bachelor and then PhD degree in psychology. After receiving her PhD, she began research work at the University of Texas at Dallas's Callier Center for Communication Disorders. In the early 1980s she received a five-year grant from the National Institutes of Health, and began studying the mechanics of human speech at Stockholm's KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After the grant ended, Syrdal took a job at AT&T; Bell Laboratories. At the time, synthesized voices were primarily male. In 1990 she developed a system that could generate a female voice. In the 1990s she joined a project that developed a new method of speech synthesis; instead of creating the sounds artificially, the synthesis joined fragments of recorded speech to create new words and sentences. Sydral oversaw the initial recordings, of six women's voices. In 1998, AT&T;'s \\"Natural Voices\\" system won an international competition for speech synthesizers, using a female voice. She was named a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America in 2008, for her work in female speech synthesis. Syrdal died of cancer on July 24, 2020, in San Jose, California.  Personal life  Syrdal married and divorced three times; at the time of her death she had been in a domestic partnership for 23 years. She had three children, a son and two daughters.

Made from weathering steel, the sculpture depicts Freddie Gilroy, a former soldier who participated in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, sitting on a bench in his old age. Gilroy was a friend of the sculptor and Lonsdale made the piece partly as a tribute to him, but also as a wider war and Holocaust memorial. Originally intended to sit on the seafront as a 4-week loan in 2011, a local resident donated money to purchase the sculpture for the town.  Description  Gilroy and the bench are sculpted at twice lifescale, making the figure almost in length. The sculpture, fabricated of weathering Corten steel, took artist Lonsdale three months to make. Gilroy, a South Hetton brickmaker and colliery worker, served with the Royal Artillery during the Second World War and became one of the first Allied troops to help liberate Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. He died in November 2008. Lonsdale created the sculpture as a commercial piece but also as a memorial to Gilroy and soldiers in general. The statue is intended to represent ordinary people who were called upon to serve their country during war. The sculpture itself contains no mention of the connection with Belsen or the war and at first appearance is just an old man sat on a bench. Gilroy occupies one seat on the bench which, despite its height, offers visitors an opportunity to sit next to him. A plaque is placed in the front centre of the bench, in common with memorial benches elsewhere on the seafront. Text on the plaque includes a poem written by Lonsdale: Victoria Nesfield of the University of York, in her review of the piece said that \\"it occupies an unusual place between memorialization and art\\". She noted that by offering a space for people to sit and pose with Gilroy Lonsdale has created a sculpture unlike most other holocaust memorials. The term \\"Belsen stragglers\\" is a phrase used at the time of the liberation to describe the survivors of the camp. The sculpture has been described as \\"much loved by people in the town\\".  History  The sculpture was installed on Royal Albert Drive, Scarborough in a position overlooking the town's North Bay in November 2011. The installation was initially supposed to be a 4-week exhibition provided via the Artsbank initiative, which promotes local artists through short-term loans. The sculpture proved popular and a local appeal was set up to raise ¬£50,000 to purchase the sculpture for the town. In December a local resident, Maureen Robinson donated ¬£50,000 to the appeal, from her life savings. Robinson dedicated the gift to her husband Michael to mark their wedding anniversary on 19 December.Plaque at the statue site The sculpture is now owned by Scarborough Borough Council and is considered a local landmark. At around 8pm on 26 January 2012 the sculpture was vandalised with yellow gloss paint. Due to the Belsen connection and for occurring on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day an anti-Semitic motive was considered possible. The paint was removed by a council team on the day after the attack. Later in 2012 an explanatory plaque was added nearby. Also in 2012 Lonsdale proposed that the piece be moved to a position overlooking South Bay near to the Rotunda Museum, as it was suffering corrosion from sea water in rough weather. The move was planned for January 2013. Despite this, as of September 2020 the sculpture remained in its original location on Royal Albert Drive. Some of Lonsdale's other works are also located in the town, including The Tunney on Marine Drive, South Bay; The Smuggler's Apprentice on Merchant's Row, South Bay; A High Tide in Short Wellies in Filey and Pull Don't Push in Dalby Forest. Another of Lonsdale's works, 1101, known popularly as Tommy, depicting a First World War Soldier is situated in Seaham, County Durham.

He has performed both in Singapore and abroad, including a guest performance at the World Harmonica Contest in Switzerland in 1970. Impressed by his virtuosity, the leading harmonica manufacturer, Hohner, specially designed and manufactured a silver harmonica for him. He studied the harmonica with virtuoso Tommy Reilly during his 12 years‚Äô stay in Europe. He had also been a music educator, actively promoting harmonica in Singapore through teaching in schools and higher institutions.  Early life and education  Ho was born in Singapore in 1933. He has been interested in playing the harmonica since young. In 1948, he joined the Donghua Harmonica Band. He started playing the violin in 1960 with the aim of learning advanced musical articulations and expressions that can be applied to the harmonica. He studied the violin with Paul Abisheganaden, a Singapore music pioneer and Cultural Medallion winner. He also studied the violin with Goh Soon Tioe. In 1962, he attained a distinction in the Grade 8 violin examination of the Associated Board of the Royal schools of Music (ABRSM), being one of the first few Singaporeans to receive this certification. In 1963, Ho travelled to London to pursue his musical career. He studied the harmonica with virtuoso Tommy Reilly, accompanying him to participate in music festivals and concert performances throughout Europe. He spent 12 years in Europe, honing both violin and harmonica skills.  Musical career = Harmonica soloist  Ho established a harmonica quartet with three other harmonica enthusiasts in 1952. The quartet gave frequent guest performances on radio and television. In 1962, Ho made his orchestra debut during his vacation in Singapore. He played The Concerto for Oboe and Strings composed by Domenico Cimarosa with Singapore's National Symphony Orchestra (now Singapore Symphony Orchestra) under the baton of the late Israeli conductor Shalom Ronli-Riklis. Upon his return from Europe to Singapore in 1975, Ho formed an ensemble with his students. Their rendition of Zigeunerweisen, Op. 20 composed by Pablo de Sarasate, a Spanish violin virtuoso and composer of the Romantic era, caused a sensation in Singapore's music scene. In 1977, he was invited as a judge for the harmonica school band contest in the Youth Festival held by the Ministry of Education, Singapore. In 1982, he was invited to perform in Thailand as a guest artist at the 2nd ASEAN Pop Festival and was subsequently awarded a medal by The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). He was also invited to perform ‚ÄúToledo‚Äù Spanish Fantasy for Harmonica and Orchestra composed by James Moody as a soloist with the National University Concert Orchestra in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1992. In August 1994, Ho performed four virtuosic pieces in the concert entitled The Eminent Harmonica Recital to demonstrate the versatility of harmonica in terms of technique and expression: * ‚ÄúToledo‚Äù Spanish Fantasy for Harmonica and Orchestra by James Moody * Scherzo from Concerto for Harmonica by M. Spivakovsky * Janine by Albert Raisner * Woodpecker by James Moody The concert was held at Singapore Victoria Theatre Concert Hall as the grand finale of the 9th Harmonia Workshop held in June 1994. Alex Abisheganaden (classical guitarist) and Josephine Koh Poh Yoong (pianist) were the Guest performers.  Music educator  Ho took an active role in the harmonica movement in Singapore. Passionate in promoting the instrument to local talents, he was a harmonica instructor for more than 10 Singapore schools and higher institutions with students ranging from primary school kids to university graduates. In 1981, Paul Abisheganaden, the Director of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Musical Activities (had been incorporated into the NUS Centre For the Arts) invited Ho to set up and direct NUS Harmonica Band (now NUS Harmonica, an Arts Excellence group of NUS Centre For the Arts) since its inception. He researched and selected the band's repertoire, and guided the organization of Harmonia music workshops where harmonica groups from various institutions gathered to exchange and share knowledge and skills with each other. As the Conductor of the Band, he had, through his teaching, honed the skills and musicality of individual players and developed the harmonica bands from various institutions to present concerts of high musical standards. Harmonica soloists from NUS Harmonica Band including Lai Mun Guan, Loo Liat Siang, Low Teng Yong, Tan Kwang Eng and Wong Swee Meng presented numerous pieces during the above-mentioned concert The Eminent Harmonica Recital. The other harmonica soloists in the Band trained by Ho included Cheng Jang Ming, Lee Cheng Lian, Loh Kai Chee, Tan Yong Chuang and Tui Cheng Guan. Although harmonica's popularity greatly increased in 1980s in Singapore, NUS Harmonica Band identified that there was a dearth of instructional material in English. Ho obtained approval from Paul Abisheganaden to publish a handbook under the umbrella of NUS Centre for Musical Activities. Together with Paul Abisheganaden, Bernard Tan, Joseph Peters, Josephine Koh Poh Yoong, Loh Kai Chee, Ho Chow Pheng and Yeo Siang Tiong, Ho provided editorial and advisory assistance to a group of harmonica enthusiasts and harmonicists to prepare the book Harmonicist's Handbook. The book was published in 1991, after more than two years of preparation. Since its publication, harmonica enthusiasts have had access to a reasonably complete handbook. It is hoped that harmonica can be recognised as a serious instrument. In June 1995, NUS Harmonica Band was invited by The Chinese Musicians‚Äô Association of China to stage a public concert at the Beijing Concert Hall and to participate in two exchange programmes and seminar with China harmonica counterparts at the Working People's Cultural Palace in Beijing and Shanghai Music Conservatory respectively. The Band also performed at The Central Music Conservatory. The tour was led by the then Co-Director of NUS Centre For the Arts, Dr. Tong Chee Kiong, and Ho was the Deputy Leader and Music Conductor. Ho‚Äôs collaborators, Alex Abisheganaden and Josephine Koh Poh Yoong, accompanied the band on the tour.  Discography  * Asian Delights (1980).

Since 2013, it has been owned by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Inspired by the house's history and its former owner, Rebekah Harkness, Swift released a song titled \\"The Last Great American Dynasty\\" from her eighth studio album Folklore (2020). History=The Harkness family Stephen Vanderburgh Harkness was a progenitor of the extended Harkness family. He and his step-brother, Henry Flagler, and John D. Rockefeller invested heavily in Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, the corporate forerunner to Standard Oil. Harkness became the second- largest shareholder, which made him extremely wealthy. Harkness was a silent partner, though he served on Standard Oil's Board of Directors until his 1888 death. A half-brother of Vanderburgh Harkness, Daniel M. Harkness, was a trustee of Standard Oil and a very rich man (the equivalent of a billionaire in 2013 USD). The money was left to his son, William Lamon Harkness. William died in 1919, with $53,439,000, about 70% of which came from Standard Oil shares. In 2020 USD, the fortune would be worth $800,352,505.14. William and Rebekah Harkness William fathered two children with Edith Hale: Louise Hale Harkness (1898‚Äì1978) who married David Sinton Ingalls, and William Hale Harkness. In 1947, William Hale married Rebekah Semple West, who was previously married to Dickinson Pierce, a descendant of Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the United States. After William Hale Harkness died in 1954, Rebekah remarried twice: first to Dr. Benjamin Harrison Kean, then to Niels H. Lauersen. Rebekah lived at Holiday House after it was built in 1930. She apparently was quite unpopular with her neighbors, doing unusual things such as cleaning her pool with champagne. Rebekah used her late husband's fortune to support charitable causes, such as supporting the Joffrey Ballet. She withdrew funding when the Ballet refused to rename in her honor, and created her own dance company: Harkness Ballet, hiring most of the Joffrey Ballet's dancers. The Harkness Ballet closed in 1975. Rebekah also funded medical research. Taylor Swift In 2013, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift purchased Holiday House.

He was called \\"The Human Aquarium\\" for his controlled regurgitation of live animals including fish, turtles and frogs as well as his ability to water spout. Career Delair was born in 1876 in Lyon, France. He began his vaudeville career in 1894 as a singer. He reportedly took the name Mac Norton after a bodyguard of Mary Queen of Scots. He later began his career in the regurgitation act and garnered the nickname, \\"The Human Aquarium\\". He was able to drink gallons of water and regurgitate it at will. He could control the force of the stream of water and could gently press it out to wash his hands or force it out rapidly. Delair began swallowing frogs, goldfish and turtles. He could keep turtles and frogs alive in his body for approximately two hours. He traveled to Paris, Brussels, Antwerp and Russia. Delair performed in front of leaders such as Nicholas II of Russia. In 1915 and 1916 in traveled to South America, but never visited the United States because of objections from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Harry Houdini noted in his book Miracle Mongers and Their Methods that on one occasion Delair had lost count of the animals he swallowed and feared he had digested a frog.

Huvenne writes about it that \\"[Pourbus] manages to lift the striking likeness that is expected of any portrait to an icon that radiates societal and spiritual values. In doing so, he endows the person depicted with a detached, but animated beauty that leaves no one unmoved\\".Paul Huvenne, in Marc de Beyer and Josephina de Fouw, Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda (catalogue of the exhibition at Museum Gouda, Feb 17 ‚Äì June 17, 2018), page 18.  Identity of the sitter  No inscription or family crest is to be seen on the painting, and none could be found after infrared or X-ray examination. However, the infrared photos reveal unidentified marks on the upper left hand side of the painting, which suggest that a crest or symbol was perhaps present on this side at some point (see infrared photos 1 and 2 in gallery below). It is therefore not yet possible to identify with certainty the woman depicted, but her rich dress and distinguished appearance suggests that she was of considerable standing. Her dress and its distinctive lace collar allowed Huvenne, who discovered this painting in 2006, to date the portrait as having been painted before 1560. The infrared examination conducted before the exhibition in Bruges in 2017 confirmed Huvenne's hypothesis and revealed that Pourbus executed the portrait in 1554. Pourbus's signature, a monogram, two \\"P\\"s separated by the master's mark resembling the numeral \\"4\\", appears on the upper right hand side, together with the date 1554 (see infrared photos 3 and 4 in gallery below).

Her high-necked gown is a ropa, which Spanish fashion spread all over Europe in the 1550s, trimmed with ruched white silk braid held in place with gold buttons. The ropa, probably Portuguese in origin, was a sort of loose-waisted mantle open in front, in which some authors have seen the continuation of the fifteenth-century surcoat. It often had double funnel sleeves, one part of which could be worn hanging, in accordance with a purely Spanish tradition.Fran√ßois Boucher, Yvonne Deslandres, and John Ross. A History of Costume in the West, with 1188 illustrations, 365 in colour. London: Thames and Hudson, 1997, . From Portugal it spread to Spain and was soon adopted in many countries, due to the influence of Spain at the time. In the 1550s, this new garment became extremely popular across Europe. The ropa could be worn all in a loose version, and was then known under various names: the \\"sumarra\\" in Italy, the \\"marlotte\\" in France and the \\"vlieger\\" in the Low Countries. The fitted silhouette commonly seen in the 1540s remained popular, however. Women could choose between loose ropa-style gowns and more fitted ones, such as the one our noble young lady wears.Jane Ashelford. A Visual History of Costume: The Sixteenth Century. Drama Book Publishers, 144 pages, 1983, : \\"By the 1550s women had a choice of two styles of gown to wear over the bodice and skirt. The loose gown fitted across the shoulders to fall in set folds spreading outwards to the ground‚Ä¶ The gown could be closed by means of buttons, bows and aglets‚Ä¶ [or] The closed gown fitted to the waist and then extended over the hips to fall in folds to the ground\\". Worth also noting is the fact that her fitting gown is black. Black clothing was particularly expensive, an intense deep black colour being costly to produce and hard to maintain over time. It was a colour much favoured at the Habsburg court and was commonly worn at weddings in the sixteenth century. She also wears an elegant ruff. Ruffs were highly luxurious garments, a visible symbol of status and wealth, and not anyone could afford to wear it. They could also only be worn once as body heat and the weather would cause it to droop and loose shape. As a result, persons doing manual labor were not wearing them. The wearer of a ruff had also to keep chin up and assume a proud and haughty pose, which also explains why they became rapidly popular among nobility. Her hair is not covered with the traditional white coif often seen in continental Europe, and particularly in the Seventeen Provinces at the time, which even rich merchant women would wear (such as in the Portrait of a Woman, of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, or also the Portrait of an Unknown Lady, holding a pomander on a Gold Chain of 1560 (see the gallery of portraits in the article about Pieter Pourbus). But she wears instead the fashionable French hood, particularly preferred by noble women, and in her case ornamented with pearls.  Underdrawings and pentimenti  Pourbus had a systematic style of underdrawing, as noted and studied by Anne van Oosterwijk in her article dedicated to \\"Pourbus' style in terms of paint and underdrawing\\".(en) (nl) Anne Van Oosterwijk.

Infrared photograph 5: Detail lower arms, revealing pentimenti Pourbus always prepared his overall compositions using long contour lines and long parallel hatching for the shadows. For darker shadows, or growing darker, he used more closely spaced hatching. For the darkest shadows, he used cross hatches. Also in this portrait, the careful preparation of the composition is also shown by the underdrawing, which appears in some areas. These hatches are present and well visible on the portrait, even sometimes through the painting and glazes. For instance, they appear particularly on the temples and cheek of the sitter. The lines are visible on the IR photos, carefully designing the hair around the face, as well as the position of the hands. The infrared photos also reveal interesting pentimenti on the left arm. Untouched, and beautifully preserved, they indicate that Pourbus changed his mind on the position of the sleeve while painting the portrait (see infrared photo 5).

A unique feature of Ry≈´ky≈´'s writing conventions is that in the Old Ry≈´ky≈´ period (?‚Äì1609), it developed a predominantly kana writing convention that was based on s≈çr≈ç-style Written Japanese but exhibited heavy Okinawan influence. After the conquest by Satsuma Domain in 1609, however, this style of writing was replaced by standard s≈çr≈ç-style Japanese that was written predominantly with kanji. Other than that, Okinawan features were confined to the recordings of songs to sing, poems to read aloud, and plays to perform verbally, and did not have an autonomous status as literary writing. Instead, the samurai class of the kingdom was aligned with the literary tradition of mainland Japan that was established during the Heian period. Rear side of the S≈çgen-ji geba-hi (1527). Predominantly kana writings of Old Ry≈´ky≈´ It is not clear when and how writing systems were introduced to Okinawa Island. Modern scholars generally speculate that Zen Buddhist monks brought kana from mainland Japan to Okinawa Island. During the Muromachi period, Zen monks worked as translators, diplomats and political advisers using a network of temples that was centered in Kyoto and was extended to Okinawa Island. Writings they left on Okinawa Island in the 15th century were mostly Classical Chinese (Kanbun) stone inscriptions, but a stone epitaph was written with kana. In the 16th century, a new style of stone inscriptions emerged, with Kanbun on one side and s≈çr≈ç-style Japanese on another side. This style of writing is noted for heavy linguistic interference from Okinawan. An example of this style is the S≈çgen-ji geba-hi (1527), which reads: The first part of the inscription, anji mo gesu mo, is a characteristically Okinawan phrase. The word kuma (this place) is an Okinawan word that corresponds to Standard Japanese koko. Verbs, in addition to nominals, exhibit Okinawan characteristics. The verb oreru was chosen instead of the Written Japanese form oriru, and it regularly corresponds to the modern Shuri speech form /uriyun/. At the same time, however, this inscription exhibits non-Okinawan features. The Okinawans would have used wote (modern Shuri speech: /wuti/) as the locative marker, but the standard form ni te was used in the inscription. The obligation marker beshi at the end of the sentence is another Written Japanese feature that was borrowed into the Shuri variety but remains rare. Overall, the Okinawan influence is so heavy that this writing style can alternatively be seen as Written Okinawan with heavy interference from Written Japanese. Nevertheless, it was markedly different from any spoken register of the day. Jiajing era (1523) (ICP), kept at the Okinawa Prefectural Museum & Art Museum Another genre where this writing style was adopted was letters of appointment. In the famous Dana Documents, a collection of appointment letters preserved by a samurai family, the first appointment letter dated 1523 reads: In the document, the king appointed Shiotarumoi as a member of Takara-maru, a ship designated for a tributary mission to China. Although Okinawan flavor is non- negligible, the phrase tamawari m≈çshi s≈çr≈ç (an honorific form of \\"to be given by the king's order\\") is a distinctive characteristic of s≈çr≈ç-style Japanese. Apart from lexical and grammatical features, a notable characteristic as a writing convention is the ratio of kana in relation to kanji. Kanji appeared very infrequently, and the number of unique kanji in the corpus is less than a hundred. This Old Ry≈´ky≈´-style writing disappeared after the conquest of the kingdom by Satsuma Domain in 1609. Shift to standard s≈çr≈ç-style Written Japanese Under Satsuma Domain, the style of appointment letters shifted to standard s≈çr≈ç-style Written Japanese. The relative frequency of kanji remarkably increased during a transitional period. An example from the transitional period is the 12th appointment letter from the Dana Documents (1627): In the end, kana disappeared from appointment letters: Although this letter was written completely with kanji, it was read aloud as s≈çr≈ç-style Japanese. This writing convention was used in local administrative documents and correspondence between Ry≈´ky≈´ and Satsuma. Except for the use of Chinese era names, the local administrative documents were no different from those procuded in other domains under the Tokugawa shogunate. Recordings of oral performance The Omoro S≈çshi (1531‚Äì1623) was the first systematic attempt to record songs. The song at the very beginning of the anthology, for example, was: The first line specifies the melody (the melody of Aoriyae) while the special characters \\"‰∏Ä\\" (start) and \\"Âèà\\" (repeat) are used for flow control. Kana was chosen to precisely record the oral tradition. Only 51 unique kanji were used in the song part of the Omoro S≈çshi. Some songs were accompanied by notes that were written in Written Japanese. Because the Omoro S≈çshi was enigmatic even to the Okinawan elites of the day, a dictionary named Kon- k≈çken-sh≈´ was compiled in 1711, where each archaic word is described in Written Japanese, with extensive references to Japanese classics such as the Tale of Genji and the Tales of Ise. In parallel with the shift in administrative documents, Ry≈´ky≈´'s elite oral culture came to be recorded with the mixture of kana and kanji, under the influence of mainland writing conventions. As a result, the relationships between spelling and pronunciation became complicated. At the time omoro songs were recorded, radical sound changes that characterize the Shuri speech and other modern South Okinawan varieties, such as vowel raising, palatalization of [k] and [g] before [i], dropping of [r] before [i] was not completed if they had started. In contrast, ry≈´ka songs and poems and kumi odori plays have significant gaps between spelling and pronunciation. For example, the first block of a ry≈´ka is written as: However, it is pronounced as: Still, this pronunciation convention has non-negilible differences with modern colloquial speech. In the modern Shuri speech, the first word, meaning \\"today\\", is pronounced as [tÕ°…ïuÀê], not [kiju]. King Sh≈ç Nei's 1611 portrait of Taich≈´, along with an inscription, from the Kyoto temple of , deposited at Kyoto National Museum Adoption of the Japanese literary tradition Instead of developing their own literary writing, the samurai class of the kingdom embraced the literary tradition of mainland Japan. Fragmentary sources indicate that Japanese classics took a firm hold in the elite society even before Satsuma's conquest. The social lives of the elites at the very end of the Old Ry≈´ky≈´ period were depicted by Taich≈´'s Ry≈´ky≈´ ≈çrai (early 17th century), a collection of correspondence arranged by month for the purpose of elementary education. In a letter between two ruling elites, one asked the other for copies of waka anthologies, namely, the Kokin Wakash≈´, the Man'y≈çsh≈´, the Tales of Ise, the Shin Kokin Wakash≈´, and the Senzai Wakash≈´, in order to hold a renga (collaborative poetry) session. After the session, they played a kemari game. Kemari was taught by a member of the Asukai family, who had visited Okinawa prior to the event. One had visited mainland Japan and learned the Ikenob≈ç school of ikebana (flower arrangement). Apparently, the ruling elites enjoyed the complete set of mainland high culture. However, most extant literary works date back only to the end of the 17th century. Two notable excaptions are the Kian Nikki (early 17th century) and the Ch≈´zan Seikan (1650). The Kian Nikki was written by Kian, a tea master from Sakai. It is the sole extant record of Satsuma's conquest of Ry≈´ky≈´ from the view point of Ry≈´ky≈´. It followed the style of gunki monogatari (war tales) and extensively copied the Tale of the Heike, the Tale of H≈çgen, and the Tale of Heiji. The unprecedented event was hardly explained with Okinawa's own words. The style of war tales was adopted in a more sophisticated way by the Ch≈´zan Seikan, Ry≈´ky≈´'s first official history book written by Haneji Ch≈çsh≈´. Haneji Ch≈çsh≈´ issued a set of directives known as the Haneji shioki in 1667, where young samurai were instructed to study an array of subjects including Japanese arts and literature. Haneji's directives remained in effect for long periods of time. The testament of Aka Chokushiki (1778 and 1783), which was written in s≈çr≈ç-style Japanese by a samurai of Naha, enumerated a wide range of subjects to be mastered by his young son. He was instructed to follow the Nij≈ç school of waka by studying introductory books published in mainland Japan. He was also expected to master the classical writing style by reading the Tales of Ise, the Tale of Genji, and the Tsurezuregusa among others. Haneji Ch≈çsh≈´'s policy resulted in a flood of literary works from the end of the 17th century to the early 18th century. The Omoidegusa (1700) by Shikina Seimei was a poetic diary, a genre of Japanese literature with the Tosa Nikki as a representative work. In this work, Shikina Seimei detailed his official trip to Satsuma, intermixed with waka poems. Another major genre of Japanese literature, monogatari (narrative tales), was pursued by Heshikiya Ch≈çbin (1701‚Äì1734). He left four short tales, the Manzai, the Koke no shita, the Wakakusa monogatari, and the Hinkaki. The sole form of literary writing the Okinawan elites acquired in the end was Written Japanese. Kanbun kundoku Since the reign of King Satto in the 14th century, the king of Ry≈´ky≈´ maintained tributary relations with the emperor of China. Diplomatic duties were performed by technocrats of Kumemura, who were believed to have their roots in Fujian. Their duties covered writing of diplomatic documents in Classical Chinese and interpretation of Spoken Chinese as well as sea navigation. Since the reign of Sh≈ç Shin, however, Ry≈´ky≈´'s sea trade under the disguise of tributary missions had shown a steady decline, which devastated the community of Kumemura. The population dropped and the remaining population had limited command of Chinese. In addition, Kumemura was largely isolated from the rest of the Okinawan society during the Old Ry≈´ky≈´ period. In fact, most Classical Chinese stone inscriptions were written by Buddhist monks, not the people of Kumemura. Satsuma's conquest of Ry≈´ky≈´ of 1609 turned Chinese affairs into Ry≈´ky≈´'s raison d'etre. The Tokugawa shogunate refused to embrace the Chinese world order and had never established diplomatic relations with China. As a result, Ry≈´ky≈´ became Japan's one of four gateways to foreign countries. Under the direction of Satsuma, Ry≈´ky≈´ was committed to rebuild Kumemura. In the 17th century, the samurai of Kumeura replaced Buddhist monks as the writers of stone inscriptions. The 18th century is dubbed as the \\"century of Kumemura\\". They switched from Written Japanese to Classical Chinese as the language of Ry≈´ky≈´'s official books. The Ch≈´zan Seifu, the Ky≈´y≈ç, and other official books were the products of this period. However, the samurai of Kumemura were assimilated to the Okinawan society to the level that they chose s≈çr≈ç-style Written Japanese for daily activities. How Classical Chinese texts were read aloud in Okinawa is a question that attracts scholarly interest. There were two approaches in Japan: chokudoku and kundoku. Chokudoku is a way of reading Chinese texts in the original order, usually with Chinese sounds. Kundoku is an elaborate method to read Chinese texts as Japanese. While Chinese uses the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order, Japanese is SOV. To cope with the ordering differences, kaeri-ten markers were added to the texts to change the word ordering to the Japanese one. While Chinese is an analytic language, Japanese is an agglutinative language with a rich set of small grammatical markers. For this reason, Chinese texts were annotated with okurigana, Japanese grammatical markers written with kana. The annotation scheme that realizes kundoku is called kunten (reading marks). The Okinawan elites adopted the Japanese way of reading Classical Chinese. Tomari Jochiku (1570‚Äì1655), a Confucian scholar from Yakushima, is credited for introducing a style of kunten called Bunshi-ten, together with the Satsunan school of Neo- Confucianism. Bunshi-ten was developed by Tomari Jochiku's mentor, Bunshi Gensh≈ç. Tomari Jochiku brought the Four Books of Confucianism annotated with Bunshi-ten. Kundoku based on Bunshi-ten became the standard way of reading Classical Chinese in Ry≈´ky≈´. Even in Kumemura, both chokudoku and kundoku were taught in school. When Ry≈´ky≈´ received Classical Chinese documents from countries under the Chinese world order (i.e., China and Korea), the samurai of Kumemura made kunten annotations to them. The government officials then read them as Japanese. Linguistically speaking, the Okinawan varieties underwent radical sound changes in the relatively recent past, but how they affect Okinawan kundoku reading is not clear from historical sources. Higa Shunch≈ç (1883‚Äì1977), a historian from a samurai lineage, recorded Classical Chinese education of his father's days. According to Higa, there were two varieties of kundoku: g≈çon kundoku and kaion kundoku. G≈çon kundoku was obtained by applying the rules of regular sound correspondences and thus reflected Okiawan sounds while kaion kundoku is standard Japanese reading. Higa cited a famous passage of the Analects as an example: * Original text: ÊúâÊúãËá™ÈÅ†Êñπ‰æÜ‰∏ç‰∫¶Ê®Ç‰πé * g≈çon kundoku: t _u_ m _u_ ari _'i_ np≈ç y _u_ _i_ _chi_ taru, mata tan _u_ shikarazu ya * kaion kundoku: tomo ari enp≈ç yori kitaru, mata tanoshikarazu ya The students of Kumemura and would-be interpreters were taught chokudoku and g≈çon kundoku. The rest of the students started with g≈çon kundoku and then proceeded to kaion kundoku. Recalling the years of his childhood, Iha Fuy≈´ (1876‚Äì1947) also mentioned g≈çon kundoku but he referred to it as shima kaig≈ç and stated that it had attracted scorn. Higa Shunch≈ç recalled that although his father had been unable to speak Modern Standard Japanese, he had fully comprehended orally realized written-style Japanese. Iha Fuy≈´ found that kaion kundoku training enabled him to smoothly adapt to Modern Standard Written Japanese, which originated from kanbun kundoku-style Written Japanese.

Biography  Hagerty was born in Sydney in 1964. After obtaining a certificate in Visual Arts, Meadowbank College of TAFE, Sydney, she moved to Canberra. In 1988 Hagerty obtained a BA in Visual Arts at the Canberra School of Art, later returning to the Institution in the 1990s to teach part-time. Hagerty's first exhibition as an emerging artist in 1988 was reviewed by senior art critic for the Canberra Times, Sasha Grishin. He found the exhibition Marie Hagerty: Paintings \\"full of energy and mischievous wit\\" but identified the work as that of a recent graduate. The figurative works were painted with emotion and Grishin found some of the more successful paintings \\"powerful and moving\\". The exhibition included three sculptures. In 1994, Hagerty was selected as a finalist in the Moet Chandon Travelling Exhibition. At the time of her selection, she referred to her creative inspirations as \\"manipulation, Spanish artists, and the Baroque period\\" and in particular Velasquez. In 1998, Sebastian Smee, art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald, reviewed Hagerty's work, discussing in particular her technical skill which she had developed through close observation of the works of the Rennaisance and early Dutch painters. The sensuous, almost voluptuous forms in her works combined elements of the figurative and non-figurative, and Hagerty unusually worked in both oils and acrylics. Hagerty was commissioned by the architects Guida Moseley Brown to design the exterior of the Peter Karmel building, an extension to the existing School of Music at the Australia National University. The building was officially opened in October 2001. Her brief was to create \\"a patterning and enlivening of the glazed and solid surfaces of the building's exterior in a large-scale architectural form.\\" Hagerty said of the commission: \\"‚Ä¶The end result is a design which concentrates on planar manipulation, palette and perception of space.\\" Hagerty's design was predominantly white, framed with black defining the first floor with large areas of red utilised on the ground floor. Hagerty said of the final design: \\"The massed red of painted walls and white pillars underscores the motifs above and unifies the pictorial and architectural spaces, including the entrance court\\". In 2016, her exhibition Blue Blooded, curated by David Broker, at the Canberra Contemporary Art Space was one of the Canberra Times art critic Peter Haynes's top five art picks for the year. In discussing what he regarded as a \\"standout exhibition\\" Haynes referred to Hagerty's talents and found her work \\"powerfully incisive and aesthetically beautiful\\". The Canberra Contemporary Art Space website has a short description of Blue Blooded found they were reminded of \\"Modigliani‚Äôs voluptuousness stripped of figurative connotation\\" and that Hagerty's \\"luxurious overlay of form and virtuoso use of colour is paradoxically best described as sculptural, and calls to mind the organic abstraction of Jean Arp\\". In 2018 Hagerty was made Canberra Capital Arts Patrons' Organisation (CAPO) Fellow for 2018/19. The Fellowship Award was \\"to mount an exhibition of her paintings at Olsen Gruin Gallery, New York, as well as pursuing a new development in her practice incorporating assemblage.

It was founded in 2014 by Nourdin El Ouali, a former municipal councillor in Rotterdam for GroenLinks. The party is currently only represented at the municipal level, with two seats in Rotterdam and one seat in The Hague. The party shares the same electorate as Denk, mostly Islamic immigrants, although NIDA is more religiously oriented.  History = 2014 municipal elections  The party first participated solely in Rotterdam, where it received 2 seats in the municipal council with 4.8% of the vote. It did not have a political programme, instead promoting their plans by means of a 'political pamphlet'.  2018 municipal elections  The party kept its 2 seats in Rotterdam, increasing its vote share to 5.4%. The party also expanded to The Hague, getting one seat with a vote share of 2.3%. The party initially participated in the \\"Leftist Covenant\\" with the PvdA, SP and GroenLinks, releasing a joint manifesto supporting a 'social, ecological and inclusive Rotterdam' and against Livable Rotterdam. However, the coalition collapsed over a tweet from 2014 where party leader Nourdin El Ouali compared Israel to Daesh.  2019 Provincial States elections  The party's first attempt to participate in national politics came in 2019, where it participated in provincial elections in North Holland and South Holland. The party did not receive any seat in the Provincial States, receiving 0.4% and 0.5% respectively.  2021 general election  In 2021, the party will participate in their first general election. Nourdin El Ouali has been appointed as lijsttrekker.  Protests and actions  The party received national attention in June 2014, when party members organised a solidarity march for Gazans with a reported turnout of over ten thousand people. In November 2015, the party organised a similarly large march named 'Unity in Diversity Against Terrorism', with notable guests including the mayor of Rotterdam. As a reaction to a partial ban of face-coverings such as the burqa, resulting in people wearing less restrictive head coverings such as hijabs being fined as well, the party started a 'hijab fund' to pay incorrectly applied fines.

Further programmes; BSc International Tourism and Hospitality Management, Master of Education and MSc Business Management have been added to the portfolio of programmes delivered. * 2009 ‚Äì 48 Bishopsgate and thereafter moved into a rented property at Curtain Road, London. * 2013 - To further widen its scope of the provision, the school began holding some of its classes in another rented property on Monteagale Court, Wakering Road, Barking. * 2017 - LSME officially opened its new premises in Gants Hill (Cambrian House on Cranbrook Road) in a Ribbon Cutting Ceremony held on the 20th of April 2017. The event was attended by The Lord Northbrook, Cllr Gurdial Bhamra, the Mayor of the London Borough of Redbridge, Mr Mike Gapes, the (then) MP for Ilford South, Hassan Shifau, the Deputy Ambassador for the Republic of Maldives in the UK. * 2020 - the school applied and received extra funding from the HSBC bank UK as part of its ¬£14bn lending fund to support management education schools in the UK. LSME organises a series of annual International Research Conferences focused on Responsible Research and Innovations (RRI). These conferences have also produced reports such as the Report on the Proceedings of the International Conference on Responsible Research in Education and Management and its Impact. To nurture the culture of responsible research and innovations, the school had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Panjab University in recognition of the establishment of a new collaborative working arrangement for responsible research in India. The school is affiliated to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME)https://www.unprme.org/ whose principles are focused on engaging businesses and management schools to ensure future leaders are provided with the skills needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs).  Academics  London School of Management Education (LSME) do not currently own the powers to award degrees or diplomas in the UK. All degree-level programmes offered at the London campuses are validated and awarded by reputable UK academic institutionsfile:///C:/Users/tonny/Downloads/london- school-of-management-education-ltd-scd-am-18%20(1).pdf. As of 2019, the school offers courses in a range of business management and social care subjects, including two Masters degree programmes validated and awarded by the University of Chichester while OND and HND level programmes are awarded by Pearson Education.  QAA Reviews  The LSME (and its associated division) underwent its first and successful Review of Educational Oversight in 2014 by the UK's Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) and has continued to have annual monitoring visits as well as full higher education review. LSME's last monitoring by the QAAreport was published in February 2019 and concluded that: * The maintenance of the academic standards of awards offered on behalf of external degree-awarding bodies and other awarding organisations met UK expectations * The School has a clear understanding of how the admissions process is supporting access for students of different backgrounds and the School takes active steps to target under-represented groups. * In the last year, the School has continued to develop partnerships with universities with a view to furthering research and enabling students to make research proposals. * The good practice in the context of individualised learning and the development of research activity continues to the benefit of both staff and students. * While the School has made considerable progress with the recommendation in relation to trends in complaints and appeals, there was insufficient evidence within Academic Board minutes to demonstrate a strategic response to analyses of complaints received.  Campuses and locations  LSME is located in the bustling area of Gants Hill in Ilford, London Borough of Redbridge, close to many amenities for students. Nearest London Underground Station is Gants Hill Station on Central Line, which is a minute walk from the second site of LSME and a 2-minute walk from the main site. Ilford Station on TfL Rail is just about 10 minutes by local bus service. Gants Hill bus station is right in front of LSME‚Äôs new site and Gants Hill Library is located just a stone-throwOfficial website. To cater to the growing demands for expansion and to improve upon the learning environment offered to students, LSME acquired an additional teaching and learning facility on Cranbrook Road, Gants Hill, Essex and developed a modern hi-tech teaching and learning environment for the benefit of the students. thumb  Organization and administration  LSME is governed by a Board of Directors. The School had 274 registered students, of whom 62 were enrolled under the University of Chichester programmes and the remainder on Pearson programmes. The School has a total of 13 teaching staff, of whom seven are employed on a full-time basis and six on a part-time basis in 2018.  Achievements  LSME is a student-focused and student-centred learning environment which is reflected in its achievement of 97.5% overall student satisfaction rate in the National Student Survey of 2019. This puts the school among the top ranks in overall students‚Äô satisfaction in England. The official Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) ratings for universities and colleges in 2019 indicated that the school was awarded a Bronze which is a satisfactory rating by a panel looking at a range of measures centred around 'teaching quality', 'learning environment' and 'outcomes'.

According to the old Hungarian sources, she was the daughter of the Belgian Limburg duke Arnulf, the son of Rudolph, duke of Limburg, and countess Luitgard of Namur.Vita Arnulfi Episcopi Suessioniensis, MGH SS 15.2, Holder-Egger ed. (Hannover 1888) 879. In reality Arnulf might be Arnulf, Count of Holland, the father of Dirk III (the maternal great- grandfather of Sophia of Loon) or Arnulf of Haspinga (her paternal grandfather); and Luitgard might be Luitgarde of Namur, her paternal grandmother; thus, Rodolph was her paternal great-grandfather (see the ancestry chart below), who can possibly be identified with Richwin II, Castelijn of Baelen-Limbourg (1033).  Family  She was the daughter of Emmo of Loon, the third count of the County of Loon, and his wife Swanhilde, the daughter of Dirk III, Count of Holland, and Othelindis (c. 985-1043/44), who in turn was the daughter of Bernard I of Saxony. Marriage and issue  Sometime around 1062 or 1063, Sophie married the Hungarian prince G√©za, the later G√©za I of Hungary.Kerbl, Raimund: Byzantinische Prinzessinnen in Ungarn zwischen 1050 - 1200 und ihr Einflu√ü auf das Arpadenk√∂nigreich.

(Vol. 1-2) Berlin (1940 - 1943) p. 270; cited in Kerbl 1979. p. 8. at which time he must have been unmarried in line with the custom of not sending married men as hostages to foreign courts. Sophia probably died soon after her husband became king (1074-1077), since G√©za in 1075 had already another wife, the Byzantine princess Synadene. According to the sources, they had seven children, but not all of them reached adulthood. Sophia and G√©za had the issue: *K√°lm√°n (c. 1065/70-1116), King of Hungary *√Ålmos (c. 1068/71-1127, in Byzance), claimant to the throne *Katalin (may also be the daughter of G√©za's second wife, Synadene) Only these names survived. In addition to them, two more sons died in infancy, and probably three daughters reached the adulthood. One of them became the mother of isp√°n Bors, a claimant to the Hungarian throne (exiled to Byzantium), while another daughter became the mother of Iv√°n, a claimant to the Hungarian throne (executed in c. 1130).For Bors, and Iv√°n, the claimants to the throne see: Tam√°s K√°d√°r: Saul herceg, Bors isp√°n √©s Iv√°n √∫r.

Despite extensive investigation, aided by the FBI and Scotland Yard, nobody was ever convicted of the murders, all of which remain unsolved. Murders On September 8, 1998, 13-year-old Sherilee Nicholas, a fifth-grade student at Wesly Upper School in southern Belize City went missing while walking towards her school. The girl's whereabouts remained unclear until October 9, when her body was found in a pool of water near the George Price Highway. She had been stabbed more than 40 times in the head and chest, with one of her arms nearly cut off and face cut open. The body also showed signs of rape, but most ominously, Nicholas was found to be wearing the clothes of another girl who had gone missing just two days prior to her discovery. That girl was 9-year-old Jay Blades, whose skull and a few bones were recovered six months later, along Sherilee's knapsack. On March 23, 1999, another young girl, 12-year-old Jackie Fern Malic, vanished during recess while playing on her school's playground. Just two days later, her body was found face down in puddle along a dirt road bordering the area where Nicholas was found. She had been stabbed multiple times and her left arm severed, with indications that she had been run over by a car. On June 26, 1999, 8-year-old Erica Wills disappeared, but it went unnoticed for three days, as at the time, she was supposed to stay over at some relatives, who in turn thought that she was at home with her family. On July 18, her skeletains remains were found behind a quarry in Gracie Rock, 20 miles west of Belize City. Her body was identified by her mother via a hair band and a Tweety ring, which Erica always wore. By this time, tenstions among the populace were rising and demands for the killer to face justice were high, with the victims' families holding candlelight vigils. The police force issued a curfew to all underage children, but despite their efforts, the Ripper struck one final time. On February 15, 2000, 14-year-old Noemi Hernandez went missing while doing an errand on Mosul Street. Nine days later, her mutilated body was found on a sandy mound along the Belize River, with multiple stab wounds to the face and neck, and several of her body parts missing. Her father identified the body as that of Noemi by the blue jeans she was wearing. Unrelated crimes During the height of the Ripper murders, three other girls were killed in similar circumstances, but were ultimately proven to be unrelated to the case. They were: * Samantha Gordon (15) - last seen on November 6, 1998, after telling her mother that she was going to visit the old Civic Center with some friends. Two days later, Samantha's naked, bruised body was floating at sea near Ladyville's Vista Del Mar, with deep stab wounds to the back and knees. In June 1999, four men were charged for her murder and convicted. * Karen Cruz (10) - in June 1999, Cruz disappeared from the veranda of her Orange Walk Town home. The day after her disappearance, her corpse was found at a stadium two blocks from her home, with signs of being raped. Initially believed to be a Ripper victim, suspicions were later directed towards her next-door uncle, 38-year-old Antonio Baeza, who was reportedly stalking the girl. He was later charged and convicted in her murder. * Rebecca 'Becky' Gilharry (13) - shortly after Blades' disappearance, on February 15, 1999, Becky's body was found near a Mayan archaeological site in Santa Rita Hill in Corozal Town, after being reported missing the previous day. She had been raped and subsequently strangled. Gilharry was last seen in the company of a family friend, 22-year- old Robert Hill, who was later charged and convicted in her killing. Investigation The killings caused widespread panic in the tiny nation, with a national curfew imposed and guards posted at school. In the months following the last murder, several incidents were reported of a man driving a red car and wearing a stocking mask attacked young girls and unsuccessfully attempted them in Belize City. The assailant was never located. In 2000, pathologist Dr. Mario Estradabran announced a harrowing revelation: prior to being brutally murdered, all of the girls were plied with alcohol and drugs, as well as being tortured. The Ripper had used the same instrument in all five cases, and judging by the precision of the cuts made on the bodies, it is assumed that he either has a medical background or at the very least access to surgical utilities. Authorities also believed that there's a possibility that there might be more than one person involved. At present, no new leads have been reported, and the Belize Ripper murders are considered the country's greatest cold case. Suspects=Michael Williams The only person to be charged in any of the killings was a Belize City automechanic by the name of Michael Williams, who was a neighbor of victim Jackie Malic. At the time of her murder, the then-40-year-old Williams was seen offering a ride to Jackie and her sister Adelma, but both declined. After she disappeared, the police questioned Michael and released him, but after her body was found, he was rearrested and charged with the killing. While in jail, Williams was also accused of raping a 13-year-old girl a decade prior. The authorities' hopes about his guilt were dashed when not long after, Wills disappeared while Williams was still in custody. This, coupled with alibis provided by his clients and a police officer, as well as insufficient evidence, leads to his exoneration for the crimes. Lonnie David Franklin, Jr. It was suggested that Lonnie David Franklin, Jr., an American serial killer connected to the murders of at least ten sex workers in Los Angeles, California over several decades, could be a possible suspect. Known as The Grim Sleeper for an apparent 14-year break between his known murders, lasting from 1988 to 2002, it is claimed that Franklin had connections to the country via his marriage to Sylvia Castillo, who was from Belize. Aside from this, the coincidental break matched the murder spree, one of the victim's aunts alleged seeing him in Belize City at the time, and the fact that his van, used in one of his proven killings, was later found in Belize, serves as potential circumstantial evidence of his involvement. He was never charged with the killings, and died at the San Quentin State Prison in 2020.

Allen had been given the rights in 1989 after the death of Norton tuner Ray Petty and had received special permission to use the name \\"Norton\\" in England. Except for the magnetos, all the components used were of new manufacture. The engines were supplied by Summerfield Engineering of Derbyshire, the frames came from Goodman Engineering and were made from Reynolds 531 tubing. The machines were fitted with a 5 speed gearbox and a belt primary drive. (The originals used a 4 speed gearbox and chain primary drive.) Although the original Manx machines were pure racers, Allen fitted a speedo, horn and brake light so the machines could be ridden on the road. The machines were renown for their quality. Former Norton race engineer and designer Doug Hele commented on the Allen machines \\"They are better than when we made them\\". Production numbers were low. Allen delivered the first machine in 1992, but was only able to build 1 every 2 weeks. He was 61 years old at the time.

It is a body of the Committee for Industry, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE). Formation Initially known as the OECD Working Party on SMEs (WPSME ‚Äì until 2002), the group was created in 1993 after Australian businessman and philanthropist Peter Fritz advocated the establishment of a body that focused on SMEs during meetings with OECD representatives in Australia earlier in the year. At a meeting in the Australian Embassy in Paris, OECD representatives agreed to create the Working Group, and its draft mandate was published in March. Early years (1993-2000): accumulation of SME analysis The group initially undertook a comprehensive analysis of SME policies and issues at both the national and international level. This led to the creation of a comprehensive analytical framework identifying best practice policies in member states which informed a series of reports, including the OECD Manual for the Evaluation of SME and Entrepreneurship Policies. The Working Party also focused on the potential and promotion of women's entrepreneurship and published a report on this topic in 1997. A complementary international conference was also organised to assess national issues in member states and develop best practice policies. Bologna Process The research published by the WPSMEE led to the first Ministerial Conference on SMEs in Bologna, Italy, from June 14‚Äì15, 2000. The conference, entitled ‚ÄúEnhancing the competitiveness of SME‚Äôs in the Global Economy: Strategies and Policies‚Äù, focused on innovation, Ecommerce, and SME exporterss in developing countries. Forty-nine countries participated and SME and Industry ministerial representatives adopted the Bologna Charter on SME policies. ‚ÄòThe Bologna Process‚Äô. gained momentum with the second Ministerial Conference, held in Istanbul in June 2004. This conference saw 72 countries participate, with Ministers committing to the ‚ÄòIstanbul Ministerial Declaration on Fostering the Growth of Innovative and Internationally Competitive SMEs‚Äô. The Ministerial Conference in Istanbul led to the development of an evaluation framework of SME programmes and policies, the improvement of SME data and statistics with an emphasis on female entrepreneurship, and additional work on SME globalisation. Since the second Ministerial Conference, the Working Party has organised further high-level events under the auspices of the Bologna Process. These include: * The OECD Global Conference on ‚ÄòBetter Financing for entrepreneurship and SME growth‚Äô (2006, Brasilia) * The OECD Global Conference on ‚ÄòEnhancing the role of SMEs in Global Value Chains‚Äô (2007, Tokyo) * ‚ÄòBologna +10 high-level meeting on SMEs and entrepreneurship‚Äô (2010, Paris) Recent and ongoing initiatives Since the Bologna +10 meeting, the Working Party has published numerous reports, comparative notes and policy briefs: *Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs ‚Äì an OECD Scoreboard Now in its ninth edition, the Financing Scoreboard provides data from 48 countries on SME lending, financing conditions and policy initiatives. *OECD Strategy for SMEs In 2019, the WPSMEE develop a new project to assist economies in developing effective SME policy, reporting on global megatrends, economic and institutional contexts and financial measures. *OECD Policy Note on Responses towards SMEs in the context of COVID-19 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the WPSMEE prepared periodically updated notes on the economic outlook for SMEs and analysis of emergency support measures and SME policy approaches in OECD member nations.

In 1983, the International Boxing Federation was founded in the United States. In order to fill boxing weight divisions with some IBF recognized world champions, the fledging group recognized some established world champions from the WBA and WBC, like Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Aaron Pryor, Larry Holmes and Donald Curry as also being IBF world champions from the group's start, but it also sanctioned fights as being for their vacant world titles. In one instance, Filipino Joves De La Puz made his professional debut by fighting Satoshi Shingaki for their world Bantamweight title. On March 3, 1984, Arter became the second Indonesian ever to fight for a professional boxing world championship after Thomas Americo four years before, when he faced Keun Oh for the IBF's vacant world Featherweight championship. Oh had a record of 12 wins and 2 losses coming into this fight. The two boxers traded punches at Munhwa Gymnasium in Seoul, South Korea, with Oh winning the world championship by second-round knockout. Arter never again fought as a professional.

The witch trials in the Holy Roman Empire, composed of the areas of present-day Germany, Switzerland and Austria, were the most extensive in Europe and in the world, both to the extent of the witch trials as such as well as to the number of executions. The witchcraft persecutions differed widely between the regions, and was most intense in the territories of the Catholic Prince Bishops in Southwestern Germany. The witch trials of the Catholic Prince Bishops of South West Germany was arguably the biggest in the world. Witch trials did occur in Protestant Germany as well, but was fewer and less extensive in comparisson with Catholic Germany. The witch trials of Catholic Austria and Protestant Switzerland were both severe. Legal situation Witchcraft was formally categorized as a crime in the Holy Roman Empire in the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina in 1532. The Holy Roman Empire consisted of a number of autonomous states, both Protestant and Catholic who all had their own laws and regulations, and the witchcraft persecutions, therefore, varied considerably. Formally, however, all states within the Holy Roman Empire were under the jurisdiction of the Emperor. This made it possible for the accused and their next of kin to appeal any sentence of a local court to the Imperial court. In general, such appeals were successful in the Imperial court, but in practice, the local verdict was still put in place because the Imperial court had great difficulty in enforcing their authority over the autonomous states. History by region=Austria Elisabeth Plainacher In Austria, a witch trial in Innsbr√ºck in 1485 resulted in Heinrich Kramer writing the Malleus Maleficarum (1486). After this, however, there were no more witch trials in Austria until the second half of the 16th-century, when the witchcraft persecutions spread in parallel with the Counter- Reformation.William E. Burns, Witch Hunts in Europe and America: An Encyclopedia In 1583, Elisabeth Plainacher became the first person executed for sorcery in Vienna. In the 17th-century, severe witchcraft persecutions took place in Austria, one of the first being that of Bregenz in 1609, resulting in sixteen executions. In Austria, witch trials were conducted by local secular courts such as estate courts - except in those cases were clerics conducted private witch trials in the courts of their clerical estates. A common accusation was desecration of the eucharist. Women were in majority among the accused, except in the cases in which the accused were men of low status such as Romani people, vagrants and beggars. Torture were commonly used and when used to make the accused naming their accomplices, the trials could grow to be very large. In contrast to Germany, the witch trials in Austria was at its most severe during the second half of the 17th century. About 1500 people are estimated to have been executed for sorcery in Austria. In the early 18th-century, the central government enforced their authority over the local courts, which resulted in a swift decrease in witch trials. By 1730, the witchcraft persecutions in Austria had virtually ended. The execution of Maria Pauer in 1750 was to be the last in Austria. Witch trials were banned by Maria Theresa in 1768. Germany German town of Schiltach in 1531 Present-day Germany executed more people for witchcraft than any other area in Europe. There were however great contrasts within Germany, were certain parts hardly experienced witch trials at all, while the most severe witch trials in Europe took place in others. In general, the witchcraft persecutions were much more extensive in Catholic South Germany than Protestant North Germany. There were exceptions: the Protestant Duchy of Saxe- Lauenburg executed hundreds of people for witchcraft in but a few years around 1630, and the largest Catholic state in Germany, the Electory of Bavaria, only executed about 271 people for witchcraft, since the Elector introduced a witchcraft law in 1590 which was described as uncommonly mild for its time. = Catholic South Germany = A number of extremely large mass trials against witchcraft, which took place in the autonomous Catholic Prince Bishop- states in south-western Germany between 1587 and 1639, are estimated to have amounted to a third of all executions for witchcraft in Germany, and a fourth of all executions of witchcraft in all Europe.Ankarloo, Bengt, Witchcraft and magic in Europe. Vol. 4, The period of the witch trials, Athlone, London, 2002 The mass witch trials which took place in the German Prince Bishoprics could last for years on end and result on hundreds of executions. These enormous trials were infamous in all Europe, and the contemporary Herman L√∂her described how they affected the population within them: :\\"The Roman Catholic subjects, farmers, winegrowers, and artisans in the episcopal lands are the most terrified people on earth, since the false with trials affect the German episcopal lands incomparably more than France, Spain, Italy or Protestants.\\" These gigantic trials started with the great Trier witch trials (1587‚Äì1593), which resulted in between 500 and 1000 executions. The witch hunt migrated in waves through the villages through village inquisitors toward other cities and Prince Bishoprics and resulted in recurring waves of persecutions with high points in 1593‚Äì98, 1601‚Äì1605, 1611‚Äì1618 and 1627‚Äì1631. Among them were the infamous Fulda witch trials (1603‚Äì1606) with 250 deaths, the Alzenau witch trials (1605‚Äì1605) witch 139 deaths, the Ellwangen witch trials (1611‚Äì18) with 430 deaths, the Mainz witch trials (1626‚Äì1631), and the Bamberg witch trials (1626‚Äì1631) with 1000 deaths, before this massive persecutions finally ended with the Cologne witch trial in 1639. These mass trials resulted in the executions of all genders and ages, and while the majority were female, the male minority was by no means small and men were referred to as \\"witches\\" as well, which was used as a gender-neutral expression. These mass trials could also show a great number of wealthy, clerical and aristocratic number of people among the condemned, when the rest of Europe had a majority of poor people among their executed. The mass witch trials of the Catholic Prince Bishoprics in South Germany were exceptional and without contest the largest in Germany, but witch trials existed in all Germany, although in smaller scale in comparison. = Protestant North Germany = While witch trials were fewer and less extensive in the Protestant parts of Germany in comparisson with the big mass persecutions of the Catholic South, they did occur in Protestant North Germany as well. In the Northern Protestant Electorate of Brandeburg (later Prussia), only about 200 people were executed for witchcraft between 1505 and Dorothee Elisabeth Tretschlaff in 1698, with the most extensive persecution being that of 20 executions in 1606.Silke Kamp, Hexenverfolgungen in der Mark Brandenburg Arkiverad 22 april 2016 h√§mtat fr√•n the Wayback Machine., 2009 In 1721, the King of Prussia stated that no death sentences for witchcraft would longer be confirmed by him. = The end = The persecutions became fewer in the second half of the 17th-century, but a few isolated cases are known to have occurred in the 18th-century. Traditionally, the last executions for witchcraft in Germany have been said to be those of Helene Curtens and Agnes Olmanns in 1738. Since then other executions have been found by later research, such as that of Maria Renata Saenger von Mossau in Bavaria in 1749 and Anna Schnidenwind in Endingen am Kaiserstuhl in 1751. Maria Anna Schwegelin was likely the last person to be sentenced to death of witchcraft in 1775, but the sentence was never carried out, and she died in prison in 1781. Switzerland Baden, Switzerland (1585), by Johann Jakob Wick. Advertisement of reward for Anna G√∂ldi's capture in Z√ºrcher Zeitung. Switzerland bordered to North Western France and Southern Germany, where the witchcraft persecutions were more intense than anywhere else in Europe, and belong to the areas where the witch trials were most fervent. A hypothetic number of 10,000 executions has been suggested: the number of executions are unknown, but are estimated to have been very high.Ulrich Pfister und Kathrin Utz Tremp, Hexenverfolgung - Schweiz As early as circa the year 1400, the high profile Stedelen case documents a witch trial in the region. Switzerland, or at least a part of it, was the location of the first European mass witch trial: the Valais witch trials, which lasted between 1428 and 1459, long before the publication of Malleus Maleficarum (1486). This unleashed the first wave of witchcraft persecutions during and was followed by numerous witch trials in Wallis 1430, Fribourg and Neuch√¢tel (1440), Vevey (1448), Lausanne (1460), Lake Geneva (1480) and Domartin (1498 and 1524‚Äì28). During the 15th-century, a third of those executed for witchcraft were women and two-thirds were men, but in the 16th-century, the figure was reversed. A reason for the severe persecutions in Switzerland was the weak central power, where the Imperial court had little to no real influence, something which had a bad effect on the rights of those accused. This is illustrated by the fact that the persecutions were the worst in areas were the central power was weakest: between 1580 and 1655, about 1700 witch trials took place in Vaud, but only about 80 in Z√ºrich. The majority of the witch trials in Switzerland were conducted by local secular courts. Most of the cases were directed against members of the public by other private citizens, and the accusations were normally destruction of property by use of magic and participation in a witches sabbath. The witch trials often took place during times of crisis and were directed toward people who were different in some way, by people with whom they had previously been in conflict. Torture was commonly used and the chance of being acquitted was slim. The method of execution in Switzerland was commonly burning at the stake. The witchcraft persecutions in Switzerland became less common in the second half of the 17th-century. In 1652, Mich√©e Chauderon became the last execution for witchcraft in the city of Geneva in the Republic of Geneva. In the 18th-century, the Swiss authorities and courts were less and less willing to accept charges of witchcraft or, if they did, to declare a death penalty in such cases. Catherine Repond, who was executed for witchcraft in Fribourg in 1731, was the perhaps last clear execution for witchcraft; Anna G√∂ldi is often referred to as the last person executed for sorcery in Switzerland in 1782, though the case was a dubious one.

He was previously nominated to be the Permanent Representative of the Philippines to the United Nations and was a member of Duterte's Consultative Committee to review the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines.  Early life and education  Robles was born on July 1, 1943 to former Quezon Governor Claro Robles, Sr. and Amparo Dia. He studied law at San Beda University and graduated in 1967. He then placed first in the bar examinations conducted that year. He also holds a master's degree from Harvard University.  Career  Robles served as a delegate to the 1971 Philippine Constitutional Convention as a representative of the 1st district of Quezon. At 27, he was the third youngest member of the convention. He was chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Bodies which initially studied offices like the Civil Service Commission, Commission on Elections, Commission on Audit, among others. He is the author of the Miranda doctrine and the Constitutional Rights of an Accused under custodial investigation. He earned the moniker \\"Father of Filipino Ombudsman or Tanodbayan\\" because he authored the law creating the Office of the Ombudsman during the term of Ferdinand Marcos in 1978. In 1977, he was one of the founding deans of the Arellano University School of Law and as such, was the youngest law dean in the country at that time. He also practiced general law with the Robles, Brillante, Ricafrente and Aguirre law firm. Following the retirements of Supreme Court associate justices Alicia Austria-Martinez and Dante Ti√±ga in 2009, Robles was recommended to the Judicial and Bar Council by the Supreme Court as a candidate to fill-up one of the vacancies. He was previously disqualified in 2008 due to his age because the rules in force at that time required nominees not from the judiciary to be able to serve in the Supreme Court for at least five years before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. Robles would have only served for 4 years and 6 months as a justice which was below the minimum five years according to the rules. In 2009 though, the \\"five-year rule\\" was scrapped by the council thus Robles became eligible as a Supreme Court justice nominee. In the end, he was not appointed. In 2012, he was nominated for Chief Justice following the impeachment of Renato Corona but he declined. On January 23, 2018, Robles was appointed by President Duterte as a member of the Consultative Committee tasked on reviewing the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines. He served until August 19. On July 1, 2019, Robles was nominated by Duterte to be the Permanent Representative of the Philippines to the United Nations, a post vacant for almost a year due to the appointment of former Permanent Representative Teodoro Locsin Jr. as Secretary of Foreign Affairs. His nomination, though, was deferred by the Commission on Appointments after being grilled on several issues, including the country's arbitral award over the South China Sea dispute. Senator Panfilo Lacson later claimed that some of his answers \\"disappointed the members of the foreign affairs committee\\". On February 21, 2020, Robles was again nominated by Duterte to another diplomatic post, this time as the Ambassador to Canada. His nomination was approved and confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on March 11. He is to succeed Ambassador Petronila Garcia who was appointed in 2014.  Personal life  He is married to Nora San Buenaventura. In 1974, he was also chosen as one of The Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) awardees in law.

Vyvyan later studied at the Women's University Settlement in London, England, and became a social worker. During World War I, Vyvyan served as a nurse at Rouen, France. After the war ended, she travelled across Canada and Alaska, writing articles for publication. In 1929, Vyvyan married Sir Courtenay Bourchier Vyvyan, the 10th Vyvyan baronet. When he died 12 years later, she inherited Trelowarren estate and house. Her close friend Daphne du Maurier used the house and gardens as settings for her novels Frenchman's Creek and Rebecca.

It premiered on January 26, 2017 at the David H. Koch Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet. Production The Times Are Racing is made by Justin Peck, the resident choreographer of the New York City Ballet. It was created during the 2016 presidential election, Peck said the ballet became \\"less optimistic piece than it could have been\\" after Donald Trump won the election. The music is \\"USA I-IV\\" from Dan Deacon's album America, an electronic score, which Peck first listened few years prior. Though it was an unusual choice for ballet, and might be unpopular among some audiences, he went with it anyways as by then he was known for a \\"hypermodern direction\\". Peck opted the dancers to wear sneakers in the ballet, which had been used in a few ballets in NYCB's repertory and another ballet by Peck. The use of sneakers allowed him to incorporate elements of tap dance. He described the ballet as \\"rhythm tap and hoofing meets Fred Astaire soft-shoe, and Gene Kelly classical tap-film movements meets ballet\\". A tap number danced by Robert Fairchild and Peck himself was inspired by the video game Dance Dance Revolution, which the two played when they were roommates at the School of American Ballet, and Peck planned the sequence to look like the two dancers are \\"following along\\" the game's level track. Peck, who was still dancing at the time but rarely in his own work, said the tap portion was one of the reasons why he casted himself in the ballet. Ashly Isaacs, a female soloist, was chosen to be an alternate of Fairchild's role, due to her tapping ability, and the role is believed to be the first gender-neutral principal role in NYCB's repetory. In later revivals, Taylor Stanley, a male principal dancer, was casted to dance the role originated by Tiler Peck (no relations to Justin Peck), and partnered Daniel Applebaum. Peck said the choice was made to allow his gay colleagues to perform \\"without any pretense\\" and the casting choice would continue the ballet's \\"exploration of gender-neutrality\\", though small changes were made to accommodate the dancers. The Joffrey Ballet in Chicago debuted The Times Are Racing in 2020. Later that year, in response to the performances cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, NYCB streamed the tap number with Fairchild and Peck online, as part of its digital spring season. Critical reception The Financial Times gave The Times Are Racing five stars, called it Peck's \\"darkest, saddest, but also loosest, freest and most grounded dance to date\\". The New Yorker also gave it five stars, and wrote the most impressive part \\"was not the cool-cat factor. It was the opposite. The ballet seemed to show a softness that was new to Peck\\". In a mixed review, the New York Times criticized the music and duets with Tiler Peck and Amar Ramasar but complimented other parts of the ballet. Original cast The Times Are Racing is performed by 20 dancers.

Kousalya, an Engineering student from the dominant Thevar community, loved and married Sankar Velusamy, who studied in the same college and belonging to the Dalit community. The pair were married for 8 months when they both were attacked in daylight on 13 March 2016 near the Udumalaipet Town Bustand by a gang of three armed men. While Sankar died on the spot, Kousalya sustained injuries and survived. The Sessions court sentenced six people including Chinnaswamy, the father Kousalya. The court found it to be a case of honour killing by the father of Kousalya, who married a lower caste man against his wishes. The Court also ordered a compensation of 11.95 lakhs as a compensation to be equally split between Kousalya and Velusamy, Sankar's father. He was later relieved off his sentence by the Madras High Court, for want of evidence. The five others who were earlier sentenced to death also had their sentence reduced to a life term of 25 years. The case had significant political impact and brought to light the occurrence of Honour killing in the state. The case was the second in terms of most number of death sentences in a single case. The heinous crime was not condemned by the major state parties considering the vote bank of the Thevar community and the upcoming 2016 Assembly elections. Kousalya started Sankar Social Justice Trust, which helps victims of caste murder and supports inter-caste marriages. She also got married with Parai artist Sakthi of Nimirvu Kazhaiyagam in Coimbatore on 9 December 2018. A document named India's forbidden Love telecast in Al Jazeera, captured the events and shot to critical fame. Background Kousalya is the daughter of a Chinnaswamy and Annalakshmi who belonged to the Thevar, a caste with significant economic and political clout. The family lived in Udumalaipettai, a town in the Tiruppur district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Kousalya was attending an Engineering college in Pollachi. Sankar was a Dalit who was studying in the same college. Sankar is believed to have met Kousalya in the college bus and proposed to her the second time he met her. Though she initially disagreed, they both fell in love after a point of time. There was strong opposition from Kousalya's family to the love as he belonged to a lower community. Kousalya decided to move away from her home and get married. The pair got married in spit of opposition from the girl's family and started living in Sankar's house. Kousalya quit her college and started working in tiles factory to support the education of Sankar. On 13 March 2016, the pair went to the market in the town to buy shirt for the annual day celebration in Sankar's college. The pair was attacked by a gang of six men near the Town Busstand in Udumalaipet by six armed men. The men who came on bike started attacking Sankar with their sickles till he collapsed. They then turned on to Kousalya and attacked her. Sankar lost his life on the spot, while Kousalya was grievously injured. The police conducted an identification parade and identified all the killers. The whole incident was captured in CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) camera in the opposite shop. Court proceedings The case was conducted in Tiruppur district court from 2016. The prosecution produced B. Chinnasamy, father of Kousalya as chief conspirator (A1), Annalakshmi, the mother of Kousalya as co-conspirator (A2), Pandithurai, Kousalya's uncle as co-conspirator (A3), Jegadesan, a friend of Chinnaswamy as mastermind (A4), Manikandan alias Palani for hiring the hitmen (A5), Selvakumar as a family friend & executor (A6), Kalaitamilvaanan, a member of the gang (A7), and Mathan alias Michael and a member of gang (A8). There were four other produced as police as gangmen namely Madan, K. Dhanraj, V. Prasanna and Manikandan. The prosecution accused Chinnaswamy, Kousalya's father for abetting and coorabrating the murder. Based on the arguments and the documentary and video evidence produced, the court pronounced the sentence on 12 December 2017. The court sentenced Chinnaswamy and five others namely, Jegadeesan, Manikandan, Selvakumar, Kalai Tamilvaanan and Madan to death sentence, K.Dhanraj to life sentence and one another to five year imprisonment. The Justice J Alamelu Natarajan acquitted Kousalya's mother, who was also accused in the prosecution. The Court also ordered a compensation of 11.95 lakhs from the perpetrators as a compensation to be equally split between Kousalya and Velusamy, Sankar's father. The case was the second in terms of most number of death sentences in a single case. The sentenced challenged the judgement in the High court of Tamil Nadu against the appeal. The state also appealed to the High Court against releasing Kousalya's mother and other accused who were not sentenced. The appeal was taken up by the Madras High Court. On 22 June 2020, the court pronounced the verdict. It acquitted Chinnaswamy and reduced the sentence of five others to life sentence. The court relieved two others, the person who was sentenced to life and one another who was sentenced to five years. In its 367-page judgement, the Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice M Nirmal Kumar quoted five major reasons for the sentence based on the submission made by the police and Additional Advocate General C Emilias. There was no evidence that the amount of 80,000 from the joint account of Chinaswamy & Annalakshmi during 12‚Äì14 February 2016 was given to A4-A6. Secondly, there was no evidence to prove that Chinnaswamy booked room in the hotel, nor for the stay of A4, A5 and A8 in the quoted days in the hotel Bakya Mahal. The account of the eyewitness to having seen A4-A6 along with Chinnaswamy was not proven. Kousalya made a police complaint after her marriage that she was forcibly taken away by her parents and her Thali was removed. She withdrew the complaint later when she returned to Sankar and mentioned that no action be taken against her parents. Though there were phone records during the days between 5-Feb-16 to 2-Mar-16 between Chinnaswamy and A4-8, the other evidences were not sufficient to prove beyond doubt that Chinnawamy orchestrated the murder. After the appeal Kousalya accused the prosecution of misguiding her that her mother would also be punished, but the sentence ended up relieving her father. She mantioned that she would appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court of India. Political impact The case was a case study for honour killing in Tamil Nadu even in modern times. Thevar is a strong community in the state. The heinous crime was not condemned by the major state parties considering the vote bank of the community and the upcoming 2016 Assembly elections. There was furore in social media and media over the incidence of honour killing. Most of the Dalit parties condemened the incident. A few days after the Session court's judgement, Kousalya questioned the stance of M.K. Stalin, the leader of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. She opened quoted \\"‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take MK Stalin‚Äôs condemnation of Sankar‚Äôs murder. In that, instead of talking about the truth of why Sankar died or why I was attacked, he simply said it was a murder. The reason for our attack was caste and what happened was an honour killing. He has proved that an opposition party leader can condemn(the incident) by hiding all this. Who does that condemnation save? Who does that condemnation ultimately benefit?‚Äù. After the judgement of High Court that relieved the main conspirator B. Chinnaswamy and reduced the dence sentence of others, K. Balakrishnan of the CPI (M) mentioned that the judgement would support such crimes in futures. Thol. Thirumavalavan, the leader of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and also Kamal Haasan, the leader of Makkal Needhi Maiam condemned the judgement. As per C Lakshmanan at the Madras Institute of Development Studies, there are nearly 150 cases of honour killing every year in the state. According to him and some of the experts, the state where the major parties claim opposition to caste based discrimination, such crimes are pretty prevalent. Aftermath Velusamy, Shankar's father was given a government job by the Governmet of Tamil Nadu in Udumalaipet as solatium. Kousalaya went on to become a social activist. She started Sankar Social Justice Trust, which helps victims of caste murder and supports inter-caste marriages. Kousalya got married with Parai artist Sakthi of Nimirvu Kazhaiyagam in Coimbatore on 9 December 2018. The marriage was attended by Sankar's parents, but not by Kousalya's parents in spite of Sakthi belonging to their same community. A documentary recording the views from various parties involved were shot in a documentary named India's forbidden Love. The documentary, telecast in Al Jazeera received critical acclaim and was nominated for International Emmy Awards in the Best Documentary category.

In terms of population, the Province of Schleswig-Holstein and the new state of Schleswig-Holstein took in the second-most refugees and displaced persons from the eastern regions of Germany between 1944 and 1947, second only to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. This led to an economic and humanitarian crisis in the state throughout the late 1940s. The situation was only resolved in the 1950s as the Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle) enabled physical reconstruction, raised living standards, and aided in integrating the hundreds of thousands of new residents. Origins Refugees began to enter Schleswig-Holstein as early as 1943, when 200,000 people north of the Lower Elbe fled cities such as Hamburg, which was destroyed by Allied bombing campaign, to rural areas in neighbouring states. When the Red Army reached the borders of Nazi Germany in 1944, millions of Germans began to flee west. During 1944 and 1945, Kriegsmarine vessels brought over two million people across the Baltic Sea to Mecklenburg and Schleswig-Holstein. When Allied forces reached the western border of Germany, more people began to flee into Schleswig-Holstein, which Allied forces reached only in the very last stages of the war. From March to June 1945 alone, 700,000 refugees and displaced persons settled in towns and villages across the state. After the war, Schleswig-Holstein became part of the British occupation zone. Over a million Wehrmacht soldiers were interned in two \\"restricted areas\\" within the state.Restricted area F It was not until April 1946 that these soldiers were released ‚Äì 410,000 from the Dithmarschen‚ÄìEiderstedt zone and 570,000 from the Pl√∂n zone. Even then, over 200,000 former so-called \\"foreign workers\\" and forced labourers remained in the camps, and a further 365,000 refugees and displaced persons took refuge in them by the end of 1946. In the first \\"all-German\\" census in October 1946, Schleswig-Holstein recorded a population of 2.6 million, excluding displaced persons. This was an increase of approximately one million from 1939. Excluding the war deaths, this meant that the state was home to approximately three refugees for every four locals. This was much higher than other states, such as Lower Saxony (one refugee to two locals) and Bavaria (one refugee to three locals). The population continued to rise even after the war, reaching 2.7 million in 1949. Living conditions and employment Despite extensive bombing of L√ºbeck and especially Kiel, a relatively large area of Schleswig- Holstein escaped the destruction of the war. In the first few years after the war, only one-fifth of the refugees in the state resided in Flensburg, Kiel, L√ºbeck and Neum√ºnster. By contrast, the population of the rural Eckernf√∂rde and Stormarn districts doubled in the same period; in Rendsburg and Eiderstedt, the increase was 65%. In some areas, the influx was overwhelming; the town of Gro√ühansdorf was home to 1,500 locals alongside 3,500 refugees. The influx of new residents triggered a massive crisis due to lack of housing, food, and employment. Rooms and apartments had to be shared or given up, and kitchens and toilets shared. Since many of the ceded rooms and emergency accommodations were unheated, stoves were set up for warmth. Coal and wood were scarce and expensive, so peat was used as fuel wherever possible. Wool was collected from fences and spun to make clothing, with other material taken from old uniforms, blankets, and bedding. In the first years after the war, the state faced a chronic food shortage; refugees and displaced persons were particularly affected. The food available via ration cards was not sufficient, and many people resorted to the black market, harvest work, or taking food from fields to get by. All employees and workers suffered from the job shortage in the first few years, but the refugees and displaced persons were hit harder than locals. Many lacked the skills required for the available work; even overqualified workers had to retrain and accept what was available. Of 69,000 refugees who had formerly been self-employed, most had worked in agriculture; of this group, only one-fifth had their own business again by 1949. The Refugee Settlement Act of August 1949, and the so-called \\"30,000 Hectare Agreement\\", which obliged large landowners to surrender land, provided relief. Nonetheless, by 1958, only 4,246 displaced persons ran their own agricultural or forestry operations, and only half of them were over 10 hectares. Craftsmen suffered less - their services in the repair of consumer goods were sorely needed after the war. More than half of the 2,368 businesses registered state-wide in 1946 were run by refugees or displaced persons. Many fishermen who fled East Prussia also found employment in Kiel. On 1 April 1950, there were still 728 refugee camps in Schleswig-Holstein, housing a total of 127,756 people. To keep the camps clean, access to sanitation and visits were regulated. The state government had already recognized in 1948 that there was simply not enough work available in Schleswig-Holstein, and half a million refugees could only find wages in other states. A plan to relocate large numbers of refugees was therefore one of the first measures taken by the new federal government upon the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany. By 1960, 400,000 refugees and displaced persons from Schleswig- Holstein had left the state, mainly for North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden- W√ºrttemberg. As a result, the state's population declined substantially, to 2.3 million. Conflict Given the catastrophic situation, in October 1945 provincial president Otto Hoevermann warned of tensions between the refugees and the local inhabitants. He believed an \\"emergency community\\" was required to resolve the economic and social crisis in the state. In addition to material hardship, there was friction and in some cases open hatred between groups. Some feared that Low Prussian and East Pomeranian dialects would displace Low German, while others complained about weddings between the residents and refugees. During Denazification, refugees were able to exonerate themselves of affiliation with the Nazis more easily than the locals since they lacked certificates and papers. In his book Kalte Heimat (\\"Cold Homeland\\"), historian Andreas Kossert describes examples of prejudice directed against refugees and displaced persons by locals in Schleswig-Holstein. Records of violent sentiment survive, such as ‚ÄûIn de Nordsee mit dat Schiet‚Äú (\\"Into the North Sea with that shit [the refugees]\\"). In 1947, the Danish minority magazine Slesvigeren published a cartoon titled \\"Pied Piper\\", depicting Minister-President Hermann L√ºdemann leading a pack of rats, labeled \\"refugees\\", to South Schleswig.Andreas Kossert: Cold Homeland Munich 2009, \\"German racism against German expellees\\", pp. 71‚Äì86. In southern Schleswig, a large number of the locals turned to the Danish minority. The South Schleswig Association, which represents the Danes, grew from 2,700 members to 62,000 between the end of the war and 1946. Many of the new members had no Danish background, did not speak Danish, and had typical German names; these so- called \\"New Danes\\", who were often disparagingly called Speckd√§nes (\\"Bacon Danes\\"), hoped for the separation of southern Schleswig from the rest of Germany and the expulsion of the refugees. The British authorities decided that in order to counter the widespread discontent and to prevent potential conflict, refugees should be involved in the future development of the state, and that political parties dedicated specifically to their interests should be banned. This ban was lifted in 1948. The German authorities, and later the appointed and elected state governments, took into account the intention of the occupation authorities, albeit placing less importance on these issues. Politics In 1950, the League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights (BHE) was formed, a right-wing party appealing to refugees and displaced persons. In the Schleswig-Holstein state election in 1950, the BHE performed exceedingly well, winning 23.4% of votes and becoming the second largest party in the state Landtag. This stoked fears of a \\"takeover\\" by refugees, but the BHE ultimately joined a coalition government with the moderate Christian Democratic Union, which provided Minister-President Walter Bartram, and the liberal Free Democratic Party. Notably, the coalition also included the \\"South Schleswig Community\\", represented by the German Party, a group formed by local Schleswig-Holsteiners to oppose the BHE. The formation of this government eased tensions between the two groups. The BHE's popularity declined after 1950, though it retained a more significant presence in Schleswig-Holstein than in other states. As the economic miracle resolved many of the difficulties of refugees, the party attempted to broaden its appeal to nationalist voters and ex-Nazis, and in the process lost much support among its core demographic. After adding \\"All-German Bloc\\" to its name, the GB/BHE won 14.0% in Schleswig-Holstein in 1954 and 6.9% in 1958, before losing its seats in 1962. Economic miracle Throughout the 1950s, the economic miracle saw a rise in living standards and a boom in the economy nationwide, including in Schleswig-Holstein. The relocation of many refugees to other states began, easing pressure on the economy and particularly housing. The number of unemployed refugees finally began to fall: from 135,144 in 1951 to 22,143 in 1957. When capital and building materials became available at the beginning of the decade, reconstruction began. Purely refugee-populated settlements such as Trappenkamp emerged and the first systematic, uniform and centrally controlled post-war housing construction program began. It took place under the leadership of the trade unions and was implemented at 84 locations in 50 cities and municipalities across the state. The foundation stone was laid on 5 March 1950 in Neum√ºnster.Working Group for Contemporary Building (Ed.): Johannes Scharre, Ulrich Haake: \\"The construction of 10,000 refugee apartments in Schleswig-Holstein (ERP special program 1950) - result, method, experiences and conclusions\\", / Working Group for Productive Refugee Aid; (Research report on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Housing No. 148 (2404/05)); Building research report of the Working Group for Contemporary Building No. 2, Kiel 1952, p. 10 In many cities and municipalities, street names - Ostpreu√üenring (East Prussia Circle), Pommernweg (Pomerania Way), Breslauer Stra√üe (Breslau Street), and many others - serve as symbols of the origin of the people who moved there.
