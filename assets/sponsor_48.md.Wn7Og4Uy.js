Huan Wen became Inspector of Jing Province following the death of Yu Yi (Â∫æÁøº) in 345, so Xi Zuochi must have been born after 316. Shishuo Xinyu is not a reliable historical text, but this is the closest we have to a record of Xi Zuochi's birth. See Mather, p 142. ‚Äì 384Xi Zuochi's death has traditionally been dated to October or November 384, as recorded in the Tang-era Veritable Records of Jiankang, p 275. However, a single line of text in Xi Zuochi's Records of the Elders of Xiangyang records the death of Zhu Xu (Êú±Â∫è) in 393. The editors of the modern annotated version of this work treat the line as a later interpolation (see Shu Fen and Zhang Lingchun, p 407 n 4). By contrast, American Xi Zuochi expert Andrew Chittick adds at least nine years to Xi Zuochi's lifespan (see Chittick, p 41 n 39). Chittick's theory has gained some currency in English-language sinology, being adopted for example by J. Michael Farmer (p 55). The traditional dating of 384 remains the standard for Chinese- language studies, and is retained here.), courtesy name Yanwei, was a Jin dynasty historian native to Xiangyang, Hubei. He is principally remembered for being the first historian to regard the Wei dynasty as an illegitimate successor to the Han dynasty. Life Born into a powerful family of local magnates, Xi Zuochi was ambitious and studious from a young age. Beginning his career as a clerk, Xi Zuochi came to the attention of Inspector of Jing Province Huan Wen through the repeated recommendations of Yuan Qiao (), magistrate of Jiangxia Commandery.Book of Jin, 82.2152 Huan Wen greatly esteemed Xi Zuochi, promoting him three times during the course of a single year,Tan Daoluan (Ê™ÄÈÅìÈ∏û), Á∫åÊôâÈôΩÁßã (Continuation of the Annals of Jin), 2¬ß2, in Tang Qiu and Qiao Zhizhong, p 243 such that Xi Zuochi held the position of Superintendent of Records in the central administration of Jing Province while he was still a young man, possibly not yet thirty years old.Shishuo Xinyu 4¬ß80 Huan Wen would occasionally employ Xi Zuochi as an administrative aide whilst on campaign, and he excelled in all his duties whether in camp or in the office.Book of Jin, 82.2153 Xi Zuochi's relationship with his employer became strained after a visit to the capital city, where he met Sima Yu, future Emperor Jianwen of Jin and political rival of Huan Wen. Xi Zuochi was apparently so taken with Sima Yu that Huan Wen felt it best to distance himself from Xi Zuochi, and demoted him to Grand Administrator of Hengyang, in the Xiang river basin far to the south, in present-day Hunan.Mather, pp 142‚Äì3Chittick calls this episode \\"so patently self-serving a tale that it deserves little credence.\\" (Chittick, p 40 n 36)Many sources have Xingyang (ÊªéÈôΩ) for Hengyang (Ë°°ÈôΩ) as the locale of Xi Zuochi's quasi-banishment, but this was politically impossible, as Xingyang was not only not under Huan Wen's jurisdiction, but in fact was not even controlled by the Jin dynasty until after Huan Wen's death. See Cheng Yanzhen's (Á®ãÁÇéÈúá) commentary to Shishuo Xinyu 4¬ß80, p 217 n 2, and Wu Shijian's (Âê≥Â£´Èëë) commentary to the Book of Jin, included in the same note. Xi Zuochi may have suffered a stroke at this time, contributing to his difficulty walking later in life.Mather, 143 While in quasi-banishment in the deep south, Xi Zuochi composed his greatest work, The Annals of Han and Jin (Êº¢ÊôâÊò•Áßã), in 54 fascicles. Intended as a corrective against Huan Wen's increasingly undeserved imperial ambitions, Xi Zuochi took the inventive and iconoclastic step of delegitimating the Wei dynasty, theorising that ritual abdication alone was not enough to establish a legitimate dynasty with a true mandate. He developed a disease of the feet which caused him to limp, quit his post, and went home to Xiangyang, collecting a local history gazette titled Records of the Elders of Xiangyang ().Despite its title, Records of the Elders of Xiangyang was not merely biographical, additionally containing records of natural topography and human habitation. See either of the modern publications of this work: Shu Fen and Zhang Linchuan (1986), or Huang Huixian (1987). Xiangyang at this time was a flourishing centre of Buddhism, due in no small part to the activity of Shi Dao'an,Z√ºrcher, pp 187‚Äì97 whom Xi Zuochi greatly admired, advocated, and was friendly with. He introduced himself to Shi Dao'an via letter in 365, and the two met shortly thereafter.Z√ºrcher, p 190; also 72, 105, 315.Yan Kejun, 134.1447‚Äì8 In a separate letter to Xie An, one of the most powerful figures in the Jin court, Xi Zuochi effuses solemnly about Shi Dao'an's monastic mastery, and advocates that the two ought meet.Z√ºrcher, 189Yan Kejun, 134.1446 In 378, northern armies under Fu Jian besieged Xiangyang, and in 379 the city fell. Xi Zuochi and Shi Dao'an were taken to Fu Jian's capital at Chang'an.Z√ºrcher, 198Book of Jin, 82.2154 Fu Jian was extremely pleased with his acquisition of two such eminent intellectuals, and rewarded them richly. However Xi Zuochi, citing illness, refused entry into Fu Jian's service and returned to Xiangyang.Z√ºrcher, 201Chittick, 47 Jin forces recaptured Xiangyang in 383, and the court offered Xi Zuochi the job of compiling an official national history, but his death interrupted any progress he may have made on the project. The Annals of Han and Jin In 220, Emperor Xian of Han formally abdicated the imperial throne to Cao Pi, who then became the founding emperor of the Wei dynasty. This succession reflected the political reality of Cao Wei control over the imperial court as well as the majority of economic and demographic resources in China, and satisfied propriety through the ritual abdication ceremony. Since the time of Chen Shou, who compiled his massive Records of the Three Kingdoms sometime in the 280s or 290s, historians had treated the Wei dynasty as the legitimate as well as de facto successors to the Han, in part because the ruling Jin dynasty partially derived its legitimacy through a smooth transfer of the mandate through Wei.Yong Rong, 45.17 Xi Zuochi put forth an alternative judgment, stating that as Wei neither controlled the whole of China nor had imperial blood in its ruling house, it should be considered an illegitimate dynasty, no better than the Xin Dynasty of Wang Mang.Chittick, 41 According to Xi Zuochi's biography in the Book of Jin, he formulated his theory of dynastic legitimation in the Annals of Han and Jin in order to curb and correct his overambitious patron, Huan Wen. Even the work's title, naming the Han and Jin dynasties without mention of the intervening Wei, is indicative of its primary thrust. The annals began with Emperor Guangwu of Han, restorer of the dynasty and founding emperor of the Eastern (or Later) Han, and continued through to the time of Emperor Min of Jin, final emperor of the Western Jin (i.e. years CE 25‚Äì317). Although his primary goal was to argue that ritual abdication was insufficient to achieve a legitimate mandate, Xi Zuochi's aims had the secondary effect of legitimating Liu Bei's Shu Han as the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, which he displayed by employing the Shu Han calendar, going so far as to use dynastic founder Emperor Wu of Jin's taboo personal name in recording the events of Liu Shan's final regnal year.Tang Qiu, 30. Liu Shan's final regnal period was Yanxing (ÁÇéËàà); Emperor Wu of Jin's personal name was Sima Yan (Âè∏È¶¨ÁÇé). Late in life, in his final memorial to the throne, Xi Zuochi laid bare his rationale and method behind delegitimating Wei while conducting the balancing act of considering the Jin dynasty still legitimate.Book of Jin, 82.2154‚Äì8; Tang Qiu 1‚Äì4; Tang Qiu and Qiao Zhizhong 3‚Äì5; Yan Kejun 134.1448‚Äì50. Xi Zuochi's heterodox theory met with little acceptance during his lifetime or in the centuries immediately following his death. It was not until the Song dynasty when Ouyang Xiu and Sima Guang echoed his criteria for dynastic legitimacy that mainstream historiography embraced Xi Zuochi's thought.Chittick, p 50Sima Guang's monumental Zizhi Tongjian employed the Cao Wei calendar, but Sima Guang explicitly states that this was a matter of convenience rather than ideological acceptance of the legitimacy of Wei. Zizhi Tongjian, 69.2187‚Äì8 Zhu Xi was extremely politically concerned with legitimating Shu Han, and arrived at the same conclusions as Xi Zuochi from a different basis and direction. From that point on, according to the compilers of the Siku Quanshu, \\"there were none did not reject Chen Shou [i.e. a legitimate Wei dynasty], accepting instead Xi Zuochi\\", although they emphasised that both men were products of their environments.This section on the theoretical basis, goals, and legacy of the Annals of Han and Jin follows closely Andrew Chittick's full treatment of the subject (dynastic Legitimacy during the Eastern Chin: Hsi Tso-ch'ih and the Problem of Huan Wen), q.v. Criticism Pei Songzhi cites Xi Zuochi repeatedly in his Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms, even preferring his account of certain events over historically closer records.See, for example, Records of the Three Kingdoms 4.144‚Äì5, on the assassination of Cao Mao. However, he also accuses Xi Zuochi of forging a letter from Wang Ling to his nephew Linghu Yu (), basing his suspicions on the letter's style and language, as well as the fact that Xi Zuochi's work alone out of all his sources carried the text.Records of the Three Kingdoms 28.759 n 1 In a separate account, Pei Songzhi cites an episode from Xi Zuochi's Records of the Elders of Xiangyang, about Xiangyang native Dong Hui assisting Fei Yi in a difficult diplomatic encounter with Sun Quan, and subsequently being appointed to the chancellery staff of Zhuge Liang and made grand administrator of Ba commandery. Pei Songzhi goes on to note that Xi Zuochi's own Annals of Han and Jin disagrees with this episode, and that Dong Hui's rapid promotion is incompatible with Chen Shou's base text remarking that Dong Hui held only a minor appointment. Pei Songzhi chides Xi Zuochi as something of an incautious scholar because of these discrepancies.Records of the Three Kingdoms 39.986‚Äì7 n 1 Family * Uncles: Luo Chong () and Luo You () * Son: Xi Piqiang (ÁøíËæüÂΩä or ËæüÂº∑), Palace Retainer for the General of CavalryBook of Jin, 82.2158 NotesReferences      Category:4th-century Chinese historians Category:384 deaths Category:Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420) historians Category:Year of birth unknown Category:4th-century births Category:People from Xiangyang Category:Historians from Hubei ","title":"Xi Zuochi"},{"id":"41859065","text":"Frank Bernhardt (born 26 August 1969) is a German professional football manager and former player currently head coach of UiTM, Malaysia.

Administratively it is within the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral as part of Bidston and St James Ward. The area is bounded by Bidston to the north, Upton to the west and Noctorum to the south. The elevation of Bidston Hill is immediately to the east. The estate was built in the 1960s as the Ford Estate and completed in the mid to late 1970s, to house people moving from the North End of Birkenhead and providing a better standard of living. Most of Beechwood is former council property, bought from Wirral Borough Council by local tenants who formed a community housing association. Some of the council houses have been sold under the Right to Buy scheme. The estate is the most northerly of three housing estates within a mile of each other, the other two being at Woodchurch and Noctorum. The estate is now separated into three sections, these being Upper Bidston Village, Beechwood and Greenfields. In recent years the estate has seen significant redevelopment of the former wooded area at 6th Avenue and through the demolition of maisonettes, tower blocks, Manor County Middle School and residential care homes (Feltree House and Esher House), with the construction of new affordable homes by private investors. At the 2011 census no population figures specific to Beechwood were available. However the total population of Bidston and St James Ward, which includes the estate, was 15,216. Geography Beechwood is in the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, less than south-south-east of the Irish Sea at Leasowe, about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at West Kirby and about west of the River Mersey at Seacombe. The area is situated at an elevation of between above sea level. Governance Beechwood is within the parliamentary constituency of Birkenhead. The current Member of Parliament is Mick Whitley, a Labour representative. He has been the MP since 2019. At local government level, the estate is incorporated into the Bidston and St James Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. It is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 2 May 2019. Local amenities Beechwood is served by the Post Office, a community library, a recreation centre, a social club, a children's centre and a health centre. The estate has a small shopping area. Beechwood originally had five public houses: 'Seven Stiles' (its name was changed to 'The Fender' and after closure it became a children's nursery), 'The Windmill' (closed and demolished after a fire), 'Buccaneer' (it was renamed 'The Fender' before being closed and demolished), 'One O'clock Gun' (closed and subsequently demolished) and 'The Corsair' (closed and demolished after a fire). 'The Windmill', named after the nearby Bidston Windmill on Bidston Hill, was the final public house on the estate to close. There are two churches, the modern Roman Catholic church, which is St. Paul's, and the small, modern Beechwood Chapel which is a Church of England building. Education Beechwood Primary School is situated at the end of Beechwood Drive (named 6th Avenue until the area was redeveloped). This was previously known as Manor County Primary and Middle Schools. In recent years the buildings of the middle school were demolished and both educational facilities combined, utilising the buildings of the primary school. St Paul's Primary School is a Catholic school situated on Farmfield Drive (previously named Feltree Way). Transport=Roads The M53 motorway runs along the western side of Beechwood and the nearest junction, Junction 1 of the motorway, is situated north of Beechwood. The A5027 is situated at the southern side of Beechwood and the A553 is to the north. Buses Until deregulation of the bus services, in 1986, the area was served by both the forerunner to Merseytravel, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (MPTE) and the separate operator, Crosville. Present-day services are run primarily by Arriva, and are coordinated by Merseytravel. Beechwood has bus stops along Fender Way, the main road through the area. Merseytravel's daily \\"Saveaway\\" Area B and All Zones tickets are valid to use from any bus stop in Beechwood, on the basis of being for the passenger of relevant age, in-date and for use after 9:30am. Railways Upton and Bidston railway stations are the nearest to Beechwood, being situated at either end of the estate. These stations are both located on the Borderlands Line to Wrexham. Meanwhile, Bidston station is also part of Merseyrail's Wirral Line, primarily for travel to Liverpool and Chester. There is, however, a proposal for the construction of Beechwood railway station, which would be more centrally located to the area. This would be situated on the modernised and electrified Borderlands Line. Cycling National Cycle Route 56 passes along the western side of Beechwood, alongside Fender Way. This route goes from Chester to Liverpool via Leasowe and Seacombe and includes part of the Wirral Way, along its course.

It was aired on February 5, 2014. The episode was written by Abraham Higginbotham and directed by Gail Mancuso. The episode's theme is the balance between trust and privacy as each character's story arc deals with trust issues in their own lives. Plot Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) meets with a friend, Brett (Noah Weisberg), at a cafeteria and while they are talking, Brett wants to tell Mitch his secret, but makes him promise not to tell anyone especially Cam (Eric Stonestreet) because he will definitely tell everyone. Mitch promises and Brett tells him that he got calf implants. Mitch gets back home and Cam figures out that Mitch is hiding something from him and he pressures him into telling him despite he promising not to tell anyone. Cam starts spreading the news by texting his friends. Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) is mad at Jay (Ed O'Neill) because she thinks he was dreaming of another woman in his sleep. Jay can see that she is mad at him, but he does not know why and believes that Gloria went through his emails and saw that he loaned a woman friend some money. Meanwhile, at the Dunphy house, Claire (Julie Bowen) wants to spy on her kids, Haley (Sarah Hyland) and Luke (Nolan Gould), because she believes they are hiding something from her. Haley has a photography class activity, but she does not want them to go and Luke says he is going to his friend's place with Manny (Rico Rodriguez), but Claire does not trust that friend of his. She gets more worried when Haley tells them that Luke is going to a place that is notorious for kids to do drugs there. Claire asks Alex (Ariel Winter) to snoop into Haley's room and find out what her sister is hiding while she and Phil (Ty Burrell) go and find Luke. Alex finds out where the exhibition is going to be and that Haley was selected from her class as one of the five who should take part at it. She calls the whole family to tell them to go to the exhibition after Claire's urge. Meanwhile, Claire and Phil discover that Luke and his friends are only making a movie and they run away when their drone is spotted by the kids. The whole family meets at Haley's exhibition, and Haley is freaked out to find them there. Her pictures are all moments of her family that she took without them knowing. Claire's paranoia and spying is exposed, but she defensively states that as a parent she has the right to worry. While watching the pictures, Cam claims that he only told one person about Brett, but Mitch sees on his phone that more than one person knows and that Cam lied. Gloria tells Jay why she is mad and Jay explains that he was only dreaming of their son Joe in danger of falling off a building and it was Joe he was calling baby. Jay admits, in a talking head cut, that it was actually Stella, the family French Bulldog, who was in danger in his dream. Everything is settled down when the man who is in charge of the event tells Haley that one of her photos was sold. Haley is excited that she managed to get money from something she did on her own and everyone is proud of her.

KƒÅhala () means, a large drum. Vaidyanatha Dikshita in Chapter VII Sloka 130 of his Jataka Parijata gives two different versions of Kahala yoga, he states that if the lords of the 9th and the 4th be in kendra positions with respect to each other and if the lord of the lagna is strong, the yoga produced is Kahala. If the lord of the 4th bhava occupying its exaltation or its own sign be aspected by or in conjunction with the lord of the 10th bhava, the yoga will be such as the foregoing. This particular sloka is reproduced from Parashara‚Äôs Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra (Chapter XXXIII.9). Parashara tells us that the person blessed with Kahala yoga will be noble, able and dynamic, possess a radiant personality, and command a well-equipped army and lord over cities and villages. In the Raja yoga Chapter XXXV.Sloka 9-11 he states that any two or three amongst the lords of the 4th, the 5th, the 9th and the 10th bhavas establishing a mutual relationship and also involving the lord of the lagna give rise to Raja yoga formations. In Chapter VI Sloka 35-36 of his Phaladeepika, Mantreswara defines Kahala yoga in following words, which version is different from the two Parashari definitions of this yoga, and is of rare occurrence: :‡§≤‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§≠‡§™‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§∞‡§æ‡§∂‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§•‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•ã‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§≠‡•á‡§∂‡•Å ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø ‡§ï‡•ã‡§£‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§É ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§É‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§π‡§≤ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§É :‚ÄúNote in the birth-chart where the lord of the lagna is posited, and where the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the lagna is placed. If the lord of this sign is in his sign of exaltation or own sign identical with kendra or trikona, the yoga so formed is termed as Kahala yoga. The person will be noble, benevolent, kind and propitious. He will be very popular in public.‚Äù In the subsequent Sloka 37 he states that the conjunction or association of the lords of the 9th and the 10th bhavas occupy in an auspicious bhava, it constitutes a Raja yoga.

In the Middle Ages the castle became a large joint inheritance or Ganerbschaft of lesser noble families, who were an important local power in the eastern Wetterau. In 1697, stately home, Schloss Lindheim, was built. Only a few remnants of both buildings have survived today. In the nave there is still part of an old great hall (Rittersaal). B√ºches von Lindheim coat of arms. View of the schloss from the east in a 1755 copperplate by an unknown artist. Memorial tablet for Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Mollersches Landhaus or Schl√∂sschen, 2011.  History = Medieval castle  The settlement of Lindheim was first mentioned in the records in 930 A.D. and initially belonged to the lords of M√ºnzenberg. The first castle was probably destroyed in 1241. In 1289 Conrad von B√ºches was granted permission by King Rudolph to build a new castle in Lindheim, albeit not on the same spot.Regesta Imperii VI No. 2242; Knappe p. 356. In 1324, not long after the second castle was built it became the joint inheritance of several families: the von B√ºches, von Kransbergs and von Bommersheims. In 1391, no less than 17 families agreed a Burgfrieden and by the 15th century the number of joint owners or Ganerben had risen to 56, with frequent changes of hand. The Archbishop of Mainz also tried, in 1405, to gain a foothold on the castle and supported its expansion financially. In order to hold a balance of power against Mainz, however, the joint heirs subordinated themselves in 1458 to Count Palatine Frederick I, on whose side they fought during the Mainz Diocesan Feud. From the early 15th century, the castle launched an increasing number of attacks on merchants on the road to the Frankfurt Trade Fair. The city of Frankfurt had the castle attacked in 1464, 1470, 1485 and 1490, but failed on each occasion. Frankfurt was thus unable to stem the robberies,Demandt 1972 p. 467. whilst the number of joint heirs at this time continued to grow and also had the village of Lindheim surrounded by walls. The village was first referred to as a town in 1342 and was given imperially immediate, town-like rights until 1806.Schl√∂sser, Burgen, alte Mauern p. 14; Denkmaltopographie p. 42. The demise of the Ganerbschaft began with the Sickingen Feud in 1523 and was accelerated by the Thirty Years' War. The place was destroyed in 1623 and 1627, a further destruction followed in 1645 during the Hesse War by Hesse- Darmstadt troops. Interest in owning the destroyed castle crumbled. In 1618 the Rosenbachs and Wallensteins pledged their portion to the lords of Schlitz named von G√∂rtz. In 1630 there were only four joint heirs left. In 1648 the seat was purchased by the lords of Oeynhausen.  Modern era schloss  After the war, Christian Ludwig von Oeynhausen had a schloss built that was finished in 1697. This used stones from the former castle. Later, the lords of Weitolshausen named Schrautenbach owned the house and, in 1736, Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf, who had been expelled from Saxony with the Herrnhuter Br√ºdergemeine, stayed here for a short time.Schl√∂sser, Burgen, alte Mauern p. 14. In January 1747 the famous devotional writer, Friedrich Christoph Steinhofer, was appointed the head of the Theological Seminar of the Herrnhuter Br√ºdergemeine in Lindheim. In the middle of the 19th century the last remaining parts of the castle with its turrets and gatehouses were demolished. Until his death in 1895 the Austria writer, Leopold von Sacher- Masoch, lived in the Mollerschen Landhaus, a wing of the house. Today he is commemorated by a tablet on the building. A large fire in 1928 destroyed the main building of the schloss. The few remains are in private ownership and not accessible.

She also holds the current American record in the W60 and W75 100 metres and the W75 200 metres. Obera found her way into the sport relatively late. In the amateur era, most athletes retired about the end of college when the life requirements to make money overrode the time commitment to become a great athlete. Obera attended Chico State College, playing field hockey, softball, and basketball. She graduated with a teaching credential in 1957. After graduation \\"I was at softball practice when a teammate told me she was a track champion,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúI thought to myself, ‚ÄòIf she is a champion, I know I can be one, too.‚Äô You might say I was a bit cocky.‚Äù Obera ran in her first meet in 1958 and made the national championships in 1959 eventually running against the likes of Wilma Rudolph. She ran in the 1960 and 1968 Olympic Trials, the latter just a couple of months before her 35th birthday, running the 100 metres in 12.1 in the semifinals She was featured in Sports Illustrated's \\"Faces in the Crowd\\" in the June 18, 1962, issue. Obera made her career from 1958 to 1994 as an educator for the Berkeley Unified School District, eventually becoming Berkeley's first female continuation school principal. During her time in the district, Berkeley High School won the state State girls team title in 1974, 1976 and 1981‚Äì3, and the boys title in 1980‚Äì1. She was a pioneer in Masters athletics, but it wasn't easy at first. In 1974, she suffered a bout of Sarcoidosis which left her bedridden for most of the year. She heard about the first world Masters championships due to be held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1975. She used the meet as a goal for her recovery. To her surprise, she didn't win there. It motivated her to return. It wasn't until she reached the 45 age group that world championship wins and records became commonplace. As she passed through each age division W45 to W70, she set the world record in the 200 metres. She performed the same feat W50 to W65 at 100 meters. And W50 through W60 at 400 metres. On January 18, 2014 she became the oldest woman to break 40 seconds for the 200 metres, running 38.10 in an all comers track meet at the University of California, Berkeley. After setting three world indoor records in the 60m, 200m and 400m, Obera was named USATF \\"Athlete of the Week\\" March 19, 2014. In the same meet, she also bested Mary Bowermaster's American record in a new event for her, the Shot Put, but Obera's new record was then bested in the same competition by Gloria Krug. USATF selected Obera ahead of a new M70 weight throw world record by Ed Burke, a new American 15K road racing record by Shalane Flanagan, Phyllis Francis beating Francena McCorory's American indoor record in the 400 meters and Kendell Williams setting an indoor World Junior record in the pentathlon during the same competitive week.

According to oral history, Barbora distinguished herself by her Christian virtues and died young under obscure circumstances. Her remains were said to be incorruptible. This inspired a strong following among local people, and numerous miracles are attributed to her. In 2005, the Diocese of ≈†iauliai began the process of Barbora's beatification and canonization. Biography There is almost no verifiable information about Barbora's short life, which is shrouded by various hagiographical narratives. She was the only child born into a noble family of Umiastowskis. Her mother died early and she had a strict stepmother. Local people tell stories about her care for the sick and generosity for the beggars. She would intercede on behalf of serfs and walk to the church on her knees. It is said that her exceptional piousness and devotion to God displeased and angered her father. She wanted to become a nun, and even joined a Franciscan monastery in Riga, but her non-believer father would not allow it. Narratives tell that she jumped out of the second floor of the manor to escape her father's wrath, and died of injuries. In a document from 1876, vice-governor Vasily Ryzhkov of Kovno Governorate first recorded the claim that Barbora died escaping her father's lust and thus remained a virgin. Remains Crypt dedicated to Barbora Barbora was first buried either in or Umiastowski family crypt. However, due to growing veneration of Barbora, her body was moved to the old church of ≈Ωagarƒó. In 1655, during the Second Northern War, Sweden invaded Lithuania and burned down the church. Barbora's body and hair was blackened, but otherwise untouched by the flames; as a result, her cult grew stronger. Tsarist authorities discouraged Catholicism and the crypt was walled up in 1877 on orders of Pyotr Albedinsky, Governor- General of Vilna; it was reopened in 1896. The remains were put in a glass coffin in the crypt beneath the high altar. In 1906, an entrance was made to the crypt from outside to ease access. In 1963, during an anti-religious campaign in the Soviet Union, authorities of the Lithuanian SSR closed the church and transferred the remains of to an unknown location. At the same time, forensic pathologist and MGB agent Juozas Markulis analyzed the body, but his work did not survive. Reportedly, the Soviets considered displaying the remains at the Museum of Atheism. Efforts to locate the remains were unsuccessful. When the church was returned to the congregation, a symbolic casket was placed in the same crypt. Veneration The old church in ≈Ωagarƒó The virgin of ≈Ωagarƒó was first mentioned by , Bishop of Samogitia, in his report to the Holy See in 1755. The report was discovered by historian Jonas Totoraitis in 1938. The bishop reported the story of her unburned corpse and seven other miracles, mostly healing of various ailments, said to have taken place between 1735 and 1748. On 7 January 1860, Motiejus Valanƒçius tasked the parish priest at the Old ≈Ωagarƒó church with registering miracles or other divine graces attributed to Barbora's intercession. By December 1940, 97 miracles had been documented, but none have been canonically investigated. The book listing the miracles was thought to have been destroyed during World War II. However, after the fall of Communism in 1990, Boleslovas Babrauskas, parish priest at St Peter and Paul's church in ≈Ωagarƒó, found it. The miracles mainly related to curing ailments related mostly to legs and eyes. Local people venerated Barbara as if she were a saint. It was common to circle her coffin three times on knees. Her cult merged with that of Saint Barbara, as the women shared not only name but also similar life stories. Local people celebrated the feast of Barbora ≈Ωagarietƒó on 4 December and sang hymns that were translated from Polish and initially meant for St. Barbara. Other commemorations take place on 29 June, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, and 2‚Äì9 July, the Great ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ Kalvarija Festival. To express his gratitude to ≈Ωagarietƒó for healing his sister, Alfonsas La≈æinskas commissioned an oak wayside shrine by Rimantas Zinkeviƒçius to be installed in the churchyard of the Old ≈Ωagarƒó Church. The shrine was blessed by Eugenijus Bartulis, Bishop of ≈†iauliai, on 6 August 2006. The possibility of Barbora's beatification was investigated by Janina z Ostror√≥g-Sadowskich Umiastowska, philanthropist and widow of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Umiastowski, and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kwiatkowski, rector of the , in 1937‚Äì1938. In November 2004, Eugenijus Bartulis sent a request to the Holy See to begin the beatification and canonization for ≈Ωagarietƒó. In May 2005, the Holy See replied that there were no obstacles in initiating the case; it was officially opened by Bartulis on 24 September 2005. In 2006, a group of nine scientists was dispatched on an expedition to find and collect information on ≈Ωagarietƒó.

The Chinese are the largest Asian American subgroup in San Francisco.Fagan, Kevin. \\"Asian population swells in Bay Area, state, nation.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. Thursday March 22, 2012. Retrieved on February 6, 2014. San Francisco has the highest percentage of residents of Chinese descent of any major U.S. city, and the second largest Chinese American population, after New York City. The San Francisco Area is 7.9% Chinese American, with many residents in Oakland and Santa Clara County. San Francisco's Chinese community has ancestry mainly from Guangdong province, China and Hong Kong, although there is a sizable population of ethnic Chinese with ancestry from other parts of mainland China and Taiwan as well. History The Gateway Arch (Dragon Gate) on Grant Avenue at Bush Street in Chinatown. The Chinese arriving in San Francisco, primarily from the Taishan and Zhongshan regions as well as Guangdong province of mainland China, did so at the height of the California Gold Rush, and many worked in the mines scattered throughout the northern part of the state. Chinatown was the one geographical region deeded by the city government and private property owners which allowed Chinese people to inherit and inhabit dwellings. The majority of these Chinese shopkeepers, restaurant owners, and hired workers in San Francisco Chinatown were predominantly Hoisanese and male . Many Chinese found jobs working for large companies, most famously as part of the Central Pacific on the Transcontinental Railroad. Other early immigrants worked as mine workers or independent prospectors hoping to strike it rich during the California Gold Rush. Although many of the earlier waves of Chinese immigration were predominantly men searching for jobs, Chinese women also began making the journey towards the United States. The first known Chinese woman to immigrate was Marie Seise who arrived in 1848 and worked in the household of Charles V. Gillespie. Within a matter of months of Seise's arrival to the West Coast, the rush for gold in California commenced which brought a flooding of prospective miners from around the globe. Among this group were Chinese, primarily from the Guangdong Province, most of whom were seafarers who had already established Western contacts. ‚ÄúFew women accompanied these early sojourners, many of whom expected to return from after they made their fortune.‚Äù Although the oceanic voyage to the United States offered new and exciting opportunities, dangers also loomed for women while traveling and many were discouraged from making the trip due to the harsh living conditions. Oceanic voyages with Chinese immigrants boarded the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and Canadian Pacific Steamship Company. Chinese immigrants would have to ride in the steerage where food was stored. Many were given rice bowls to eat during the voyage. In 1892, a federal law passed to ensure immigrants who were on board, needed a certificate. Due to tight arrangements, unhygienic situations and scarcity in food, this led to health degradation. Many immigrants were unable to board these voyages due to the Geary Act of 1892 which blocked the reunion of immigrants in America with their families not with them. Many diseases found through these voyages were Hookworm Yersinia pestis which contributed greatly to the Bubonic Plague.Easton, Pa., American academy of medicine Press, 1913 ‚ÄúDuring the Gold Rush era, when Chinese men were a common sight in California, Chinese women were an oddity‚Äù and in urban spaces were rarely seen in public. Unlike the rural areas, Chinatown afforded few opportunities for women to come into contact with the larger society.‚Äù Simultaneously, Chinese women also participated in urban sex work, which resulted in local laws like one passed in April 1854 that sought to shut down \\"houses of ill-fame,\\" not racialized in name but practically deployed to \\"[single] out Mexican and Chinese houses of ill fame, starting with Charles Walden's Golden Rule House on Pacific Street and moving on to establishments run by Ah-Choo, C. Lossen, and Ah Yow.\\" With national unemployment in the wake of the Panic of 1873, racial tensions in the city boiled over into full blown race riots. Like much of San Francisco during these times, a period of criminality ensued in some Chinese gangs known as tongs, which were onto smuggling, gambling and prostitution. In response to the violence, the Consolidated Chinese Benevolent Association or the Chinese Six Companies, which evolved out of the labor recruiting organizations for different areas of Guangdong province, was created as a means of providing a unified voice for the community. The heads of these companies were the leaders of the Chinese merchants, who represented the Chinese community in front of the business community as a whole and the city government. Numerous white citizens defended the Chinese community, among them Pastor Franklin Rhoda whose numerous letters appeared in the local press. By the early 1880s, the population had adopted the term Tong war to describe periods of violence in Chinatown, the San Francisco Police Department had established its so-called Chinatown Squad. The anti-immigrant sentiment became law as the United States Government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 ‚Äì the first immigration restriction law aimed at a single ethnic group. This law, along with other immigration restriction laws such as the Geary Act, greatly reduced the number of Chinese people allowed into the country and the city, and in theory limited Chinese immigration to single men only. Exceptions were granted to the families of wealthy merchants, but the law was still effective enough to reduce the population of the neighborhood to an all-time low in the 1920s. The neighborhood was completely destroyed in the 1906 earthquake that leveled most of the city. One of the more successful sergeants of Chinatown Squad, Jack Manion, was appointed in 1921 and served for two decades. From 1910 to 1940, Chinese immigrants were detained at the Angel Island immigration station in the San Francisco Bay. To be permitted entry to the United States, thousands of mostly Chinese immigrants crossing the Pacific to San Francisco had to enter through the gauntlet of Angel Island, and were detained for months in a purgatory of isolation. Some spent years on the island waiting for entry to the U.S.The exclusion act was repealed during World War II under the Magnuson Act, in recognition of the important role of China as an ally in the war, although tight quotas still applied. The Chinatown Squadwas finally disbanded in August 1955 by police chief George Healey, upon the request of the influential Chinese World newspaper, which had editorialized that the squad was an \\"affront to Americans of Chinese descent\\". Many working-class Hong Kong Chinese immigrants began arriving in Chinatown in large numbers in the 1960s, and despite their status and professions in Hong Kong, had to find low-paying employment in restaurants and garment factories in Chinatown because of limited English fluency. An increase in Cantonese-speaking immigrants from Hong Kong and Guangdong has gradually led to the replacement of the Taishanese (Hoisanese) dialect with the standard Cantonese dialect. The Golden Dragon massacre occurred in 1977. In the Sunset District in western San Francisco, a demographic shift began in the late 1960s and accelerated from the 1980s as Asian immigration to San Francisco increased dramatically. Much of the original, largely Irish American population of the Sunset moved to other neighborhoods and outlying suburban areas, although there is still a significant Irish American and Irish minority in the neighborhood. Informal Chinatowns have emerged on Irving Street between 19th Avenue and 26th Avenue as well as on the commercial sections of Taraval Street and Noriega Street west of 19th Avenue. About half of the Sunset District's residents are Asian American, mostly of Chinese birth and descent. The immigrants in the Sunset District were both Mandarin- and Cantonese-speaking. With the rise of the technology industry in Silicon Valley, many immigrants from China and Taiwan moved to the San Francisco Area. Many of them reside in the South Area cities of Cupertino, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San Jose, and Fremont.

The Chinese Historical Society of America, since 1963, is a non-profit, and the first organization established in the US to preserve, promote and present the history, heritage, culture and legacy of Chinese in America through exhibitions, education, and research; the Museum is located in San Francisco's original Chinatown on Clay Street. Healthcare= Prior to health care  According to \\"Handbook of Asian American Health\\" by Grace J. Yoo, the late 19th century was a period of major epidemics in San Francisco, which included outbreaks as the bubonic plague, smallpox, and cholera. These diseases were commonly found among the poor and working classes. At the time, many believed in the miasma theory, or the spreading of disease due to \\"breathing sick air\\", rather than the now widely accepted germ theory. \\"In 1876, the Chinese were blamed as the source of the disease because of the unsanitary conditions of Chinatown.\\" The area was unsanitary and overpopulated because the city's Chinese population was discriminated against, as Americans saw them as competition for work. This sentiment withheld services, such as access to healthcare or physicians, and property rights from the Chinese, causing them to cluster within Chinatown.  Struggles to establish health care  Before the Chinese had any particular health care system for their community, all of them had to go through the following barriers: they had to walk a very long distance to receive any medical attention at a hospital, and they were denied coverage due to unaffordable rates of the services provided by the hospitals. Instead most Chinese relied on \\"folk healer\\" than on western medicine. The \\"Folk Healers\\" were those that provided Chinese traditional medicine to the Chinese community in San Francisco Chinatown. Therefore, many Chinese did not bother to go to the hospital unless it was a crisis.  First medical facility: Tung Wah Dispensary  The first medical care place in San Francisco Chinatown was the Tung Wah Dispensary. It was provided by the Chinese Six Companies, and it was built in 1900 on 828 Sacramento Street. The dispensary was named after the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, and it housed 25 beds, provided both western and Chinese medicine, free or to low cost care to patients, and its staff was volunteers from the community and physicians from outside of the community. Of those physicians three were American physicians and the rest were Chinese American physicians who helped with the Chinese medicine and translating from Chinese to English for the American physicians.  Natural disaster led to the first modern hospital  In 1906, due to the great earthquake in San Francisco, the Tung Wah Dispensary was destroyed but was rebuilt in Trenton Alley. However, with the many injuries due to the natural disaster, a lot more Chinese patients needed medical attention, and the dispensary was beginning to overflow with patients. Therefore, they decided to expand the dispensary to a modern hospital. In order to build the modern hospital they needed to make $200,000, so they began to have Chinese pageants that helped to contribute the donations from the Chinese Americans and Americans. So, when they got they collected the $200,000, they finally got permission from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to build the Hospital, and in two years the construction was in underway. By April 18, 1925 the San Francisco Chinese Hospital (Êù±ËèØÈÜ´Èô¢) in the San Francisco Chinatown was established. It is the only Chinese-language hospital in the United States. The Asian Aids Project (AAP) was started in the 1987, it is made to help them fight the AIDS epidemic in the Asian Community including the Chinese Americans.

Priest Alexander carries out the duties of his ministry, helped by his wife, Alevtina. Two days later the Nazi invaders enter the village. The Nazi invaders are keen to reopen the Orthodox churches closed by the Soviet authorities. Alexander is offered a mission to the Pskov oblast. An Orthodox church building, confiscated and turned into a hall for film showings and the like, is restored to its former use, the church bell rescued from the lake etc. However life under the Nazis is ambiguous and the priest must walk a tightrope (metaphorically) between faithful Christian service and loyalty to his country and people. A poignant scene is the Easter service, celebrated along with Red Army POWs surrounded by German guards. Alexander and Alevtina also harbour Jewish orphans. Alevtina falls ill from contact with the POWs and puts the children first by losing herself in a snowstorm lest she infect the orphans. The plot concludes with the Soviet authorities back in power and the priest imprisoned by the NKVD. The epilogue shows the priest decades later, visited by the orphans he saved many years before.

Combat history The B-29 that became Dauntless Dotty is a block 40 airframe, manufactured by Boeing at the Wichita, Kansas plant which was built specifically for Superfortress production, and was the twenty-second of a hundred block 40-BWs constructed. It was assigned Army Air Force serial number 42-24592, and Boeing-Wichita constructors number (c/n) 4253. The future Dotty was assigned to the 497th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), with three assigned squadrons, at Pratt Army Air Field, Kansas, in the spring of 1944. The 497th was deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) in September 1944, being assigned to the XXI Bomber Command 73d Bombardment Wing in the Northern Mariana Islands, and stationed at Isely Field, Saipan. The first 497th Superfort arrived there on 17 September. The group began operations in October 1944 with work up attacks against Iwo Jima and the Truk Islands. Robert Morgan Captain Robert K. Morgan (31 July 1918 ‚Äì 15 May 2004), of Asheville, North Carolina, had been the pilot on the majority of the missions flown by the B-17 Flying Fortress, Memphis Belle, when it was designated the official \\"first\\" bomber to complete 25 operations, while flying with the 91st Bomb Group, VIII Bomber Command, in the European Theatre of Operations.

Memphis Belle was the first combat-veteran bomber to return to the United States as part of a publicity campaign to sell war bonds. Morgan flew the plane all over the United States for bond rallies. Return to Tokyo Promoted to Major, Morgan flew a second combat tour in the Pacific Theater, commanding the 869th Bomb Squadron, 497th Bomb Group. Flying B-29 Superfortress, 42-24592, tail code 'A1' named Dauntless Dotty, after his third wife, Dorothy Johnson Morgan, he completed 26 missions over Japan until sent home on 24 April 1945. On 24 November 1944, he led the first mission of the XXI Bomber Command to bomb Japan, 111 aircraft of the 73rd Bomb Wing to Tokyo, with wing commander Brigadier General Emmett O'Donnell, Jr. as mission command pilot and Vince Evans as lead bombardier. Evans had served in England with Morgan as bombardier of the Memphis Belle. \\"The city was 1,500 miles from the Marianas. Brigadier-General Emmett O‚ÄôDonnell flying the Dauntless Dotty led 111 B-29s against the Musashima [sic] engine factory. The planes dropped their bombs from 30,000 feet and came across the first of a number of problems ‚Äì accuracy. The B-29‚Äôs were fitted with an excellent bomb aimer ‚Äì the Norden ‚Äì but it could not make out its target through low cloud. Also flying at 30,000 feet meant that the planes frequently flew in a jet stream wind that was between 100 and 200 mph which further complicated bomb aiming. Of the 111 planes on the raid, only 24 found the target.\\" Dotty also participated in another significant Tokyo raid on 9/10 March 1945, when it flew the first night, low level altitude, fire bombing (Operation Meetinghouse) raid. This was the single deadliest air raid of World War II; greater than Dresden, Hiroshima, or Nagasaki as single events. Demise Dauntless Dotty, departed Kwajalein at 0306 hrs. on 7 June 1945 for the second leg of a ferry flight back to the United States, commanded by Capt. William A. Kelley, of Tifton, Georgia. Forty seconds after takeoff, the aircraft struck the Pacific Ocean and sank, killing 10 of 13 on board instantly. (MACR 14530) Co-pilot 1st Lt. John Neville, of Bradley, Illinois, tailgunner S/Sgt. Glenn F. Gregory, of Waldron, Indiana, and left gunner S/Sgt.

The wreckage of the Dotty and the remains of the ten men who were trapped inside her when she sank have never been located. The wreckage is believed to be at a depth of approximately 6,000 feet.

In 2019 she was amongst the 64 distinguished women barristers selected to feature in the celebratory exhibition of a Century of Women in Law at the Middle Temple. The exhibition marked 100 years since women were permitted to enter the legal profession in England & Wales, led by Helena Normanton, the first woman to practise as a barrister in England. More recently she made news as acting Counsel in the first-world climate change litigation brought by peoples from low-lying islands against a State, before the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the Torres Strait Islanders case. Education and career Feria-Tinta studied international law at the London School of Economics receiving her LL.M with merit in 1996. She received further training at the Institut International des Droits de l'Homme in Strasbourg (1997) and at the Institute of Human Rights of the Abo Academy in Turko (Finland) under the sponsorship of the European Commission and the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2001. In 2000 she was among the 24 lawyers selected worldwide to be trained by members of the International Law Commission in all areas of General International Law, taking part in the thirty-sixth session of the International Law Seminar in Geneva, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 54/111, under a United Nations Fellowship. Her areas of expertise include international dispute settlement, immunities, consular law, diplomatic protection, treaty law, recognition of state and governments under international law, self-determination under international law, boundary delimitation, law of the sea, territory, investment law, human rights, use of force, laws of war, State Responsibility (inter alia State Responsibility for crimes against humanity, genocide, extrajudicial executions and torture); command responsibility for gross human rights violations; victim rights under international law. After teaching Public International Law at the London School of Economics as a Teaching Assistant to Sir Christopher Greenwood (then Professor at LSE), Feria-Tinta spent a year as a Visiting Research Fellow at the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law, University of Cambridge, at the time under the Directorship of former Whewell Professor of International Law, James Crawford. As a practising lawyer Monica Feria-Tinta has advised States, state-owned entities, non self-governing peoples, governments in exile, corporate bodies, international organisations, non- governmental organisations, indigenous peoples, and individuals, in the area of public international law. She started her practising career working for international tribunals; first at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and a year later, at the International Court of Justice, gaining experience in the adjudication of complex international litigation both entailing individual international criminal responsibility and State responsibility. She acted as legal advisor for a State Delegation taking part in the negotiations of the Rome Statute, at the Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court in Rome. During 2018-2019 she served as Assistant Legal Adviser to the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. In litigation, Feria-Tinta has appeared as counsel before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and has advised parties before the International Court of Justice, International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, UN CEDAW Committee, Court of Appeal (England) and Court of Appeal (Hong Kong). Expert opinions provided in different international fora have included an Amicus Curiae to the Constitutional Court of Ecuador (on the Rights of Nature), the UN Human Rights Committee, the Constitutional Court of Colombia (on the Special Jurisdiction for Peace), the Supreme Court of Mexico, a joint Amicus Curiae with Professor John Dugard (former Special Rapporteur on Diplomatic Protection at the ILC) for the Appeals Court of Amsterdam, in the Bouterse case, and expert comments on behalf of the Redress Trust to the Final Report of the UN Independent Expert on the Right of Reparation for Victims of Serious Violations of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law, Cherif Bassiouni. Her advocacy work before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights contributed to pivotal changes in the Inter-American regional system. Monica Feria-Tinta pioneered the rights of victims in the Inter-American system challenging for the first time the use of State appointed Ad hoc Judges in individual petitions before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which led to the end of a practice that had existed for nearly two decades. She also advocated for the need of a Victims' Fund for legal aid before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to ensure access to justice and equality of arms for victims. A Victims Legal Assistance Fund before the ICHR was finally created in 2010. She litigated the first international human rights case in the world on the protection of the rights of the child in times of war and obtained the first international binding decision on gender justice in the history of adjudication of the Inter-American region, initiating the feminisation of human rights law in the Americas. Feria's litigation work marked a before, and an after, in the manner in which the American Convention on Human Rights is interpreted and applied. In particular, she introduced a gender perspective in the interpretation of human rights in the Americas, which the Inter-American Court on Human Rights upheld, and has followed since. She secured the first finding of rape by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights as a violation of the American Convention on Human Rights, and brought the definition of rape in the Americas in line with international law. In addition, Feria Tinta's pleadings prompted the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to hold a State accountable for violations of the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women (\\"Convention of Bel√©m do Par√°\\") for the first time in eleven years, since its entry into force. Most notably, her litigation work on behalf of hundreds of prisoners led to a landmark case on prisoners' rights where the Inter-American Court ruled on a massacre taking place in a prison and on torture practices that had never been tested before an international human rights tribunal, ordering as a consequence, the prosecution of a former Head of State for crimes against humanity. Her forensic experience investigating and documenting torture in international contentious cases, was used as model to train advocates worldwide, representing victims of torture, by the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims. In 2009 she was commissioned to take part on a project by UNESCO entitled \\"Freedom from Poverty as a Human Right: Law's Duty to the Poor\\" (The Philosopher's Library Series) contributing with a thorough study on litigation in Regional Human Rights Systems (European, Inter-American and African) on the justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Feria Tinta has been a speaker in International law in different fora worldwide including Lancaster House (UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office), the Human Rights Caucus of the US Congress, the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Mexico, the University of Oxford (Centre for Socio-Legal Studies), the United Nations (Geneva), Trinity College, Dublin (Distinguished Speakers Series), the British Institute of Comparative and International Law, Universidad de los Andes Law Faculty (Colombia), and Georgetown University Law Center. She has been a guest lecturer at Guangxi Normal University, Faculty of Law, China, University of Cambridge (LCIL Executive Course on Investment Law and Arbitration) and at the Master Program of the Institute Universitaire Kurt Bosch-University of Fribourg, Switzerland.

A graduate of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, she has exhibited in Denmark, Germany and Greenland. Her landscapes are principally concerned with the effects of light and darkness on the appearance of her images. In 2015, she exhibited works in Fan√∏ Museum which she had created by subjecting plates of copper to the effects of various acids, inspired by the landscapes of the Swedish painter Carl Johan Forsberg. More recently her metallic works have drawn on his recently rediscovered watercolours of women. Biography While a student at the Royal Academy, Buus was awarded the 2008 Caspar David Friedrich Prize in Greifswald, northern Germany which led to a solo exhibition \\"Expanding Nature\\" there the following year. Her first major solo exhibition in Denmark was \\"Colour me Blind\\" (2011) at the Galleri Christina Wilson in Copenhagen. Her works exploited the juxtaposition of colours, apparently revealing tones that were not really present. Details only became evident as the observer moved around in front of each of her images. In 2012, Buus exhibited works at a solo exhibition titled Hvide N√¶tter (White Nights) at the Maniitsog Museum in western Greenland with support from the Danish Arts Council. While she had previously worked mainly with \\"light\\", her landscapes now also covered \\"darkness\\" as an important component of life in Greenland. The works on display responded to the intensity of the light in the room. When the lighting was dim, they revealed surprising detail and colour while in bright light, only outlines could be seen. At the end of the year, in collaboration with Krista Rosenkilde, she participated in the \\"Light - Heavy\\" exhibition at the Gentofte Central Library north of Copenhagen in which her \\"light\\" paintings stood in sharp contrast to Rosenkilde's three-dimensional forms. In 2013, Buus exhibited at the Caspar- David-Friedrich-Zentrum in Greifswald, explaining her works were painted with a greatly reduced colour palette. This caused the almost complete disappearance of the contrasts and colours, leaving images that were virtually monochrome. \\"Although the motifs are detailed and figuratively formed, they first remain latent until the eyes become accustomed to the contrasts in the colouring. Only then do the motifs begin to emerge,\\" she commented. In March 2015 at Fan√∏ Kunstmuseum, Buus exhibited a series of images on metal plates crafted by applying various acids. The motifs were inspired by the works of the Swedish artist Carl-Johan Forsberg who painted scenes on the island of Fan√∏. She explained she had fallen in love with Forsberg's works when she first saw his painting \\"S√∏nderho Havn ved nat\\" (S√∏nderho Harbour at Night) which she has reinterpreted applying her new approach. Another exhibition involving Buus's interpretations of Forsberg attracted hundreds to the R√∏nneb√¶ksholm culture centre near N√¶stved for a vernissage on 19 September 2016. Buus has continued to develop her interest in the Swedish painter, especially after she discovered watercolours of both attractive and rather ugly, corpulent women in the archives of Fan√∏ Museum. The exhibition now presents Forsberg's originals side by side with Buus's evolving metallic interpretations of the women he painted with an eye for beauty. The exhibition, bringing attention not only to Forsberg but above all to Buus, is scheduled to continue until 18 December. Other interests In addition to her paintings, Buus also exhibited her \\"Go Baby Glow\\" elephant in the 2011 Copenhagen Elephant Parade. Turning to ceramics, in 2014, she designed plates for Royal Copenhagen which were presented as awards for the winners of the √Örets Ret (Dish of the Year) competition in September 2014. Exhibitions Buus's works have been presented at numerous solo exhibitions.

He displayed virtuoso with his songwriting skills in which his lyrics often provoked a subject from a different perspective and highly poetic form; adding with his unique tenor voice made him highly popular. Early life Bachchu Kailash was born on Shawan 15, 1995 B.S (30 July 1938) in Sapatel, Chhorumbu VDC, Khotang. He was the oldest of six brothers born to Karna Bahadur Basnet and Krishna Kumari Basnet. On the 13th day, his mother died and his father Karna Bahadur Basnet remarried. By the time he was five years old, he was already deep into music. Music used to cheer him up but his maternal aunt and uncle and other relatives never appreciated it. Nevertheless, he persisted in his musical pursuits.  Career  As a young teenager, he was extremely popular among friends due to his singing and later while studying in eight grade, he went to Radio Nepal and sang \\"Nirash Nahou Sathi, Aansu Aansumai Dubeko Chha Jiwan, Nadarau Sathi\\" (composed and written by him). At that time Radio Nepal was the only medium from which new singing talents were exposed to a wider audience and singing would have to be done live on air.

Background He was the son of Arthur Neal MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Annie Elizabeth Neal. He was educated at Leys School, Cambridge and King's College, Cambridge. He married, in 1940, Rosemary Young. They had three sons.'NEAL, His Honour John', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012 ; online edn, Nov 2012 accessed 6 Feb 2014 War 1914‚Äì1918 At the age of 25 he volunteered at the outbreak of war.

He was National Liberal candidate for the Wansbeck Division of Northumberland at the 1922 General Election. This was a seat that the Liberals had held in 1918 with the help of the official endorsement from the Coalition Government. However, by 1922 the Unionists had ended the coalition and a Unionist candidate intervened in Wansbeck. While Neal still retained the endorsement of David Lloyd George and his organisation, he did not have the support of the Liberal party led by H. H. Asquith who also intervened in Wansbeck. Unsurprisingly, the seat was lost with Neal finishing third in a field of four.British parliamentary election results 1918‚Äì1949, Craig, F.W.S. In 1923 following reunion between the Lloyd George and Asquith factions, Neal was selected as Liberal candidate for the Barnsley Division of Yorkshire at the 1923 General Election. A National Liberal had come close to winning in 1922 but by 1923, the Unionists chose to intervene in the contest and Neal was edged into third place. He contested Barnsley again at the 1924 General Election. This time there was no Unionist candidate, but he narrowly failed to gain the seat; He did not stand for parliament again and concentrated on his legal career. War 1939‚Äì1945 At the age of 49 he was placed on the Officers' Emergency Reserve from 1938 to 1940. He was assigned to the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Ministry of Food from 1940 to 1942.'NEAL, His Honour John', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012 ; online edn, Nov 2012 accessed 6 Feb 2014 Professional career In 1920 he received a Call to Bar by the Inner Temple.

His quest to score a date with the hottest girl in the school has been a catalogue of failure, and Bex isn't impressed by Burt's wealth and good looks. Suddenly there is a glimmer of hope when she lets it be known she likes boys in rock bands. Burt sets himself the challenge of forming a band ‚Äì and he needs help. His mates won‚Äôt make the grade so he enlists the help of ginger, musical uber-geek Egg and they hold auditions after school. Burt's gang try out with risible auditions, but then soccer ace Clipper shows what he can do on drums and estate bad-boy Tea surprises them with his skill on the bass guitar. An unlikely quartet is formed and rehearsal sees Burt's first crack as lead singer, Egg's amazing talent on guitar ...and interest from Bex. Burt thinks he's on to a winner ‚Äì and Egg can‚Äôt believe the girl he watches wistfully from across the canteen is actually in the school hall, watching him play. It's not only Burt who needs the band. Clipper is on a fast track to football academy, but that's his dad's dream, not his. Tea needs to get off his rough estate and Egg needs to escape the monotony of music lessons, an overbearing mum and a friendless existence. The band rehearse cover songs with Bex a regular at the weekly rehearsals. The RockAteers are born. Privately, the boys are loving the new call on their time. But Bex's presence barely outweighs Burt's frustrations with his bandmates, especially when Egg surprises them with a self-penned original song. They are all blown away, especially Bex and when Egg reveals he has more, the band take on a new lease of life. Burt announces their first gig in the garage of his mansion, where he lives with his little sister despite his parents being away much of the time. Egg thinks it's too soon for a show, but Burt's already invited everyone and the local press. The RockAteers have the crowd eating out of their hands and everything is brilliant until the after- party sees Egg's ritual humiliation at the hands of Burt's bullying best mate George. Forced to smoke weed until he passes out, Egg escapes the house in the early hours and returns home to find his parents waiting for him and the horrifying sight of his eye-browless face in the bathroom mirror. Clipper also has an unfortunate end to the night and is distraught when George calls him gay. Burt ends up sleeping with a crazy girl from his front row ‚Äì Hazel, who he nicknames Crazel when he sees her lurking outside his house the morning after. Egg decides to stay with the band despite the lack of eyebrows. The RockAteers need to raise the funds for a demo fast. Tea decides to accelerate the process by stealing a car but Burt disapproves and Tea's gangster Uncle makes him take it back. No-one has any cash until Burt's little sister Millie cracks open her money box and insists Burt takes the lot. After some eventful studio time the band are armed with a demo and their online profile begins to see some heat. Egg and Bex's friendship is flourishing after she takes him shopping and puts a brave face on meeting his scary mum, who is less than friendly. Egg realises he is totally in love with her. Next up its a ‚ÄòBattle of the Bands‚Äô and despite an on-stage fight between Tea and Burt the RockAteers emerge triumphant. Once again Egg finds himself the subject of unwanted attention from George and has his pants pulled down in front of everyone back at Burt's house, including Bex. This time he's had enough and leaves the band. Billy Visconti is under orders to find a hot new rock band and he thinks he's struck gold when he discovers The RockAteers online. His boss, the Cowell-like Sir Wilson Cloom, agrees so Billy sets up a meeting. Burt is afraid the new problem with Egg could jeopardise their chances of being signed so he visits the Big Tone offices alone and claims all creative credit. He asks Bex to pretend to fancy Egg to get him back in the band but she refuses and then relays the conversation to Egg. Egg is unable to cope with this new twist and insults her. Their friendship seems irretrievable. It's left to Tea and Clipper to persuade Egg to come back. Burt's untruths are quickly exposed when Billy takes the band, with Egg back on board, out to dinner. Billy sees that the true creative genius is Egg and relationships are smoothed over in time for the band's record company showcase, which Wilson Cloom himself will attend. Egg and Bex's friendship is also repaired in time for the big event. Egg isn‚Äôt sure the band should sign for the first label to show interest and neither is Bex. She arranges for her dad's friend and ‚Äòthird most important person in the music industry‚Äô Jerome Clincher to attend the showcase ‚Äì and he likes what he sees. The band and Big Tone shake on a deal. Egg's instinct not to rush into a deal with Big Tone is validated after he chats to Jerome, who urges caution and puts a different spin on everything. Then Egg sees Burt kissing someone at the back of the venue. It's Bex. His world comes crashing down. Burt feel's he's hit the jackpot despite the fact that Bex was drunk when he made his move. He goes back to Big Tone Records, once again alone because Egg's not taking calls, only to hear that Wilson and Billy wish to remove Clipper as drummer and send them to a ‚Äòsong doctor‚Äô once signing of the deal is complete. Even Burt's not liking what he's hearing. Once again flirting with Cloom's sexy assistant, Sophia, he leaves with the instruction to replace Clipper sooner rather than later. Burt calls a meeting with Tea and Egg on High Bench to talk about replacing Clipper. The suggestion is met with dismay and accusations and despite his protestations Burt realises that Big Tone might not be the best way forward for the band. With Egg once again persuaded back the four of them visit Jerome's office. His advice to just be a band and enjoy it all is refreshing to all. They decide not to sign for Big Tone. Wilson Cloom is apoplectic when he receives the email declining his offer of a recording deal and his thoughts immediately turn to revenge. He orders his assistant Sophia to sleep with Burt and discover the band's immediate plans. She's quick to deliver the news that the band are going to sigh for Jerome's Fictitious Records and have secured a support slot for a UK arena tour in the summer. Wilson calls an old friend and ensures the support slot is withdrawn. Egg secures an awesome set of GCSE results and his romance with Bex is steps up another gear when he writes her a song and arranges to meet on High Bench to play it to her. The result is a kiss and more. Egg is on cloud nine. Burt gets a nasty surprise at the end of the summer when his mother unexpectedly returns from abroad with the news she has enrolled Millie in a Scottish Boarding school with immediate effect. Millie is dragged away and Burt is left devastated. It's easy for Jerome to work out where the leak about future RockAteers plan came from Burt's big mouth via Sophia and straight to Wilson Cloom. He enlists the band in a plan to resurrect their tour support slot involving Burt and the now fired Billy Visconti. Tricking Cloom into admitting his hand in the support slot being cancelled is easy and with the exchange on tape Jerome calls Cloom and warns him of any further meddling in the band's affairs. He sets the date for a triumphant showcase on the River Thames for The RockAteers. Everything is back on track for The RockAteers and Burt's focus is back onto Bex. It's the night of the showcase and Burt is expecting his little sister back but when he is devastated when he sees that Bex is very definitely with Egg. The band storm through a fabulous showcase gig but at the end when Millie has not shown up as promised Burt has had enough of everything. Then Crazel is waiting on the pier with the news she is expecting Burt's baby. Its all too much. Once at home Burt drinks a bottle of vodka and a handful of mother's pills. But then Clipper texts asking him where he is ‚Äì the band have gone down a storm and Millie has arrived. Burt crashes the car in his attempts to reach hospital and survives the crash and overdose.

The monologue in one act premiered in 1981.  History  The manuscript of the play by Patrick S√ºskind dates back to 1980. The monologue in one act, the author's first work for the stage, premiered at the Cuvilli√©s Theatre in Munich on 22 September 1981 and was performed by Nikolaus Paryla, who also directed. Thanks to its minimal staging requirements, the play was successfully reproduced at most German-language theatres. In the 1984‚Äì85 season, it was the play with the most performances on German language stages, playing more than 500 times. Printed in 1984 by the Diogenes Verlag, the play was translated into English by Michael Hofmann and published in 1987 by Hamish Hamilton. This translation was awarded the Schlegel-Tieck Prize in 1988. The play also appeared in the Bloomsbury Classics series. It has been translated into 28 languages, including Arabic, French, Russian, Serbian, Spanish and Turkish.  Synopsis  The play consists of an extended monologue delivered by a double bass player, who speaks to the audience in his small sound-proofed apartment while drinking beer. He is in his mid-thirties and is employed at a State Orchestra. At first he praises his instrument and its importance in the orchestra by telling anecdotes about its history and by actually playing it. With a considerable humour, he reveals more and more of his past and present rather than his current misery. He did not pick his instrument out of love and he never has company. He reveals too that once when his car broke down and stranded him and his instrument in the cold, he gave his coat to the bass, thereby adding to the image of a lonely man who realises that his performance is mediocre: The player dreams of chamber music, especially Schubert's Trout Quintet. He also dreams of approaching a young mezzo-soprano, Sarah, but fails to impress her by playing \\"eklatant sch√∂n\\" (strikingly beautifully). He imagines to win her attention by yelling her name at the festival premiere of Das Rheingold in the silence full of expectation before the soft beginning. When he leaves for the performance in concert dress, the end is open.  Music examples  The narration is accompanied by extracts from the following pieces: * Johannes Brahms: Symphony No. 2 * Richard Wagner: prelude to Die Walk√ºre * Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf: Double bass concerto No. 2 in E major * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Overture of Le nozze di Figaro * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: √à amore un ladroncello, Aria of Dorabella from Cos√¨ fan tutte * Franz Schubert: Trout Quintet  Performance  Many actors have performed the one- man show successfully. Walter Renneisen has played the piece for more than 30 years, admitting that he is too old for the character, but still works on new nuances.

By looking at transit patterns it was discovered that the planet first made 3 transits in 180 days, then in the next 800 days, there were no transits until the next one.

Career Park Chul-min began acting in his high school drama club at Chosun University High School, and though he majored in Business Administration at Chung-Ang University, he spent majority of his college years in theater circles. After graduating in 1988, Park joined the professional theater troupe Hyunjang (ÌòÑÏû•), and for 5 to 6 years he appeared in plays on Daehakro such as A Story of Old Thieves (ÎäòÍ∑ºÎèÑÎëë Ïù¥ÏïºÍ∏∞) and Kim Cheol-sik of the Republic of Korea (ÎåÄÌïúÎØºÍµ≠ ÍπÄÏ≤†Ïãù). After several years of doing bit parts onscreen, Park gained attention in 2004 for his roles in the film Mokpo, Gangster's Paradise and the period drama Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin. Since then, he has become one of the most prolific supporting actors in Korean cinema, most often cast in physical, comic performances in films such as Gwangju massacre drama May 18 (2007), romantic comedy Cyrano Agency (2010), monster movie Sector 7 (2011), and comedy satire Almost Che (2012). In 2014, Park starred in his first major leading role in Another Promise (formerly titled Another Family), the first 100%-crowdfunded Korean film based on the real-life story of Hwang Sang-ki, a Gangwon Province-based cab driver and his legal battle to win compensation for his daughter Yu-mi's death from leukemia in 2007 at age 23, which he believes was contracted when she worked for four years at a Samsung semiconductor factory.

He was born in Narni (Umbria) around 1427, and died in Bohemia in 1497. He studied the culture, language and literature of the classical ancient times from his early youth. After serving as a soldier for a short period, in 1447 he became a pupil of Guarino in Ferrara. Here he became an intimate friend of JanusPannonius, who was a Hungarian student there at that time, and later became a bishop of P√©cs (in Southern Hungary). Galeotti learned the Greek language from Janus Pannonius. After a pilgrimage to Rome Galeotti gave lectures in 1450 at the University of Padova about classical authors, and studied medicine as well. In Padova he married a Venetian (or, according to some sources, Lombardian) girl. She was a daughter of Bartolomeo di Montagna)*. They had a son,Giovanni, and several daughters. After the death of his Italian wife he married a Hungarian noblewoman (her family name was Szepessy). In March 1461 he was in Hungary (probably in Buda) together with his family, in the company of Janus Pannonius. After a short-term stay in Padova, in 1462 he spent a longer time travelling in Spain, France and England, practising medicine. In his book (2 volumes), De Homine, he reflects on the physical and philosophic aspects of human nature and his main concern if the well-being of man. The first volume reflects on the external aspects of the human body whereas the second discusses the nature of some diseases and the internal aspects of the human organism.Dott. Fabio Ronci. Medio Evo - Cronache e Storie. Galeotto Marzio, l'umanista eretico During his journey he made friends and earned a considerable amount of money. In 1464 he was professor of the Latin language at the University of Bologna. Here Galeotti had an intensive polemic with Francis Philelphus. In 1468 Janus Pannonius - who at that time was on a mission in Italy - took him to Hungary. Galeotti spent a long time in the court of King Matthias Corvinus where the king soon took a liking to him. Galeotti became a confidant, companion and court historian of King Matthias. However, there are no reliable sources stating that Galeotti was the tutor of King Matthias or that of Matthias' son, Johannes Corvinus. Galeotti accompanied King Matthias on his campaign to Bohemia against the Czech King George Podiebrad. In 1471 he wrote a book in Buda of the title \\"De homine libri duo\\" about physiology and medicine, a description of the parts of the body. This book was dedicated to Archbishop Janos Vitacz, who was the uncle of Janus Pannonius. From 1473 to 1477 Galeotti gave lectures in Bologna about humanistic studies. He wrote between 1476 and 1478 his book of the title \\"De incognitis vulgo\\", which was dedicated to King Matthias. The book is still unpublished. As he expressed in his book the heretical view that all men, who live according to common sense and the laws of nature, will find salvation - he was arrested by the Venetian inquisition on his estate in Montagna near Padova, and they had him before the court. His property was confiscated, his wife was also put to prison, he was put on the pillory on the market of Venice, his book was burned, and he was forced to publicly recant his \\"diabolical\\" doctrines. He was in prison for 6 months, on dry bread and cold water. Pope IV. Sixtus cited him to Rome on the intervention of Lorenzo di Medici and King Matthias. Here he was cleared of the charge of heresy and he even regained his properties. In 1479 he spent some time in the court of King Matthias, however, he returned to Italy soon. In 1482 he asked from King Matthias for an engagement present for his daughters in Baden near Vienna, and received it. From 1484 to 1487 - supposedly in Italy - he wrote his book of the title \\"De egregie, sapienter et iocose dictis ac factis Matthiae regis\\" (About the excellent, sapient and ingenious sayings and deeds of King Matthias. First published by Sigismund Tordai in 1563. Translated into Hungarian language in the 19th century by Gabor Kazinczy and Ferdinand Barna.). This work contains many interesting data relating to the history of culture in Hungary, anecdotes and characteristic stories about King Matthias and his court. The book was dedicated to Prince Joannes Corvinus, son of King Matthias. Galeotti dedicated one of his books, La Doctrina Promiscua, to Lorenzo di Medici, and another in 1492 to Charles VIII, King of France, in whose court he spent some time after the death of King Matthias (who died in 1490). The title of this book was \\"De Excellentibus\\", this was a somewhat abridged and revised version of another of his books: \\"De promiscua doctrina\\". Until now it is not confirmed that the members of the Martius family living nowadays in Germany are Galeotti's descendants. Martius Galeotti (1442-1494) was an Italian astrologer, born in Narni, Umbria. He settled first in Boulogne and then went to Hungary after his religious views proved unpopular with the Catholic Church. In Hungary he became secretary to King, Matthias Corvinus, and also tutor to the latter's son, Prince John. His work De jocose Dictis et Factis Regis Matthhias Covirni further incurred the displeasure of the church and he was taken to Venice where he was imprisoned for a time. He was released following the intervention of Pope Sixtus IV, whose tutor he is said to have been at an earlier date. He subsequently returned to France where he became state-astrologer to King Louis XI.\\"Galeotti, Martius\\" in Spence, Lewis. (1920) An Encyclopaedia of Occultism. New York: University Books, p. 176. Reprint of 1920 original. Galeotti appears in Sir Walter Scott's story of medieval France, Quentin Durward.

The company began by building valves, compressors and other parts for steamships.\\"Sentinel Waggon Works\\", Discover Britain. By 1880 the company had moved to larger premises in Polmadie, and began building complete ships. Because of the factory location far from the ocean, the ships were designed so that they could be transported in sections and assembled at dockside.\\"Alley and MacLellan\\". Captains of Industry by William S. Murphy. Published 1901. Reprinted in Gracie's Guide to Industrial History. In 1883, the company designed a new type of high speed steam engine which was used to generate electricity on board ships. The company was incorporated in 1903 as Alley & MacLellan Ltd. with Stephen Alley becoming a partner after his father's death. Their factory in Polmadie was called Sentinel Works.Administrative summary accompanying \\"Records of Alley & MacLellan (Polmadie) Ltd, engineers, Polmadie, Glasgow, Scotland\\" , University of Glasgos That year the company acquired Simpson and Bibby of Horsehay, a manufacturer of steam powered road vehicles, and by 1905 it was manufacturing steam wagons. In about 1907 the company began building dump trucks; The company continued to manufacture steamships and boats, and in 1912 its output was about 2700 tons. Eventually almost 500 small ships and boats were produced. The vast majority of these vessels were assembled at the Jessie Street works using nuts and bolts, then dismantled and shipped as parts in crates to their client destination where they were re-assembled using rivets. At least one Alley & McLellan ship is still in existence ‚Äì the motor vessel (originally steamship) Chauncy Maples on Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi). in 1915 the wagon and truck aspect of the business had grown to the point that the company opened a subsidiary company in Shrewsbury as the Sentinel Waggon Works, manufacturing lorries and railway vehicles. A group of the core Scottish staff moved from Glasgow to Shrewsbury. In 1918 the company was acquired by William Beardmore & Co., Ltd, and opened another subsidiary, The Sentinel Valve Works, in Worcester, England, to expand its manufacture of valves. Both factory buildings were prefabricated in Glasgow, and reassembled on site, again a group of core Scottish staff moved to Worcester from Glasgow.http://www.britainfromabove.org.uk/image/epw005417?gazetteer=Worcester&ADMIN;_AREA=Worcester&ref;=82 The company manufactured a variety of compressors, including ones used in foghorns. By 1937, Alley & MacLellan was once more an independent company. In 1945 it became a subsidiary of Glenfield & Kennedy Ltd. Alley & McLellan continued to operate in the original Sentinel Works in Jessie Street, Glasgow until the 1950s, producing various engineering products. The 'Sentinel' name continued to be used for the products of the original Glasgow works until the mid 20th Century. In 1975 the company was dissolved. The original Sentinel Works in Jessie Street, Glasgow was still in existence in 2017 though now in a very derelict condition. The design offices and pattern shop is listed category A as a building of significant national importance. It was the first steel-reinforced concrete building in Scotland. The Sentinel Waggon Works In 1915, a subsidiary company, The Sentinel Waggon Works was created in Shrewsbury England, to focus on the production of land-based powered vehicles. Initially these vehicles, lorries, were steam powered. The modern factory was pre-fabricated in Glasgow for rapid assembly giving the local management a state-of-the-art design and production facility. The Sentinel Valve Works Ltd Advert for Alley & MacLellan, 1943 In 1918, Alley & Maclellan formed a second subsidiary company based in Worcester England, this expanded and continued the design and manufacture of mechanical valves allowing the company to again expand production away from shipbuilding at Glasgow and into new lucrative markets.

In 1934 it was assigned to the newly created Escalloniaceae by Hutchinson in his major revision of the dicotyledon families. In the APG III system, Carpodetus has been referred to the Rousseaceae. Phylogeny Carpodetus is the sister to the clade consisting of Abrophyllum and Cuttsia. Roussea is sister to the rest of the family and is geographically most distanced from the other genera. Most related to this family are the Campanulaceae. This results in the following phylogenetic tree. Etymology Carpodetus is derived from the Greek words Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄœåœÇ () (fruit) and (bound together), a reference that the seeds are bound together in clusters in the berry. cited on References Category:Rousseaceae Category:Asterales genera ","title":"Carpodetus"},{"id":"41861559","text":"Deanna Lockett (born 13 November 1995) is an Australian short track speed skater who competed in the 2014 Winter Olympics.

UK Plot The Shamanov family lives in a two-story house in the middle of the Don steppes. Head of the family is the venerable Grigory Ivanovich (Bogdan Stupka), whom every member of the family respects and fears. Father of Grigory Ivanovich, Ivan Matveyevich (Viktor Khorkin), is a veteran of the First World War, chained to a wheelchair and almost unresponsive to the outside world who is preparing to celebrate his centenary. Everyone is busy preparing for the coming celebration. Meanwhile, Viktor (Sergei Garmash) is coming from Moscow to his old home by train - the eldest son of Grigory Ivanovich, an authoritative criminal nicknamed \\"Shaman\\". He is accompanied by three accomplices-subordinates. Upon arrival at the house, the whole family sits down to dine, but the atmosphere at the table is tense, as everyone present knows that Viktor is a criminal. Grigory Ivanovich, on the contrary, is immensely pleased with Viktor's arrival, stressing that it was on him in his youth that he placed his highest hopes. However, Viktor's mother, Nadezhda Petrovna (Larisa Malevannaya), doubts that the reason for his son's visit was the anniversary of his grandfather. In news reports there is information about the elimination of the major St. Petersburg crime boss Leonid Barygin nicknamed \\"Banker\\", and the accomplices understand that the next victim should be \\"Shaman\\". Viktor releases the associates and they in turn, leave him with a part of the arsenal brought with them, including a box of dynamite. Meanwhile, several people are dressed in costumes at the Stepnaya Hotel, not far from the Shamanovs' house (according to Sergei Garmash, these are FSB officers) who are searching for Viktor. Under the guise of electricians, they try to find out information about the whereabouts of the Shaman, but none of the family members admit that Viktor returned home. The next night Pashka (Vladimir Epifantsev), one of the sons of Grigory Ivanovich, goes with Viktor to hunt. Left alone with his older brother, Pashka asks him about how he went to jail. Viktor tells that he stabbed his opponent \\"because of a woman\\", and her, he beat up. He later learned that she had a miscarriage because of what he did. Pashka asks Viktor to take him along to Moscow to join his gang. Pashka provokes a fight with Viktor and insists beforehand that Viktor take him along to Moscow if he wins. The fight ends with Pasha getting beat up and the bet is lost. In the meantime, the militants accidentally meet at the restaurant with Viktor's accomplices and kill all three, first finding out where Shamanov is. The hundredth birthday of Ivan Matveyevich is approaching. To the celebration the second son of the hero, Alexei Ivanovich (Pyotr Zaychenko), comes together with his wife (Tatiana Shankina) and children. After another quarrel in the house the youngest son of the Shamanovs Andrey (Ivan Dobronravov) secretly collects things from his relatives and, having borrowed money from Alexei Ivanovich, gets on a train to Moscow. The battle group approaches the house and takes up positions. The sniper is located on a hill in front of the mansion, looking out for the target, the senior group enters imperceptibly into the house. Viktor feels that danger is near. In the courtyard at this time between the head of the family and his brother, a grand scandal unfolds, into which the rest of the relatives are drawn. A skirmish begins, as a result of which both enemies (both Viktor and the squad leader) are seriously injured. Shouts from the yard drown out the shooting, and no one notices that Viktor alone is in the house confronting the murderers. Finally, the bleeding Viktor notices Pashka. From the window, he opens fire on the machines of the servicemen, but kills only one of them. By order of the senior group, Pashka is killed by a sniper. Having come to the conclusion that they have organized resistance, the senior group gives the order to open heavy fire around the house. The shelling ends with the death of all the members of the Shamanov family who remained in the house, except for Viktor, Natalia and her husband Igor. The children are also saved because they have left for the river sometime before. Shamanov manages to take revenge on the attackers with the help of Ivan Matveyevich, who, realizing that something was wrong, left the house in a wheelchair and, close to the car of the last survivors, blew up a box of TNT that Viktor hid in his room. Having given vent to his anger, Shamanov looks into the distance and sees a girl approaching him. He recognizes in her Sveta (Angela Koltsova) - his former bride. They have not seen each other since Viktor was in prison. Sveta puts a gun to him and shoots twice, taking revenge for her broken life and for the unborn child whom she lost because of Shamanov. In the final scene of the picture, joyful children return home from the river by car.

It ranked even worse than its neighbor, Japan, which was better in terms of anti-corruption. In 2015, Lee Wan-koo, former prime minister of South Korea, resigned after being embroiled in a corruption scandal, which has also damaged the reputation of the president, Park Geun-hye. Lee Wan-koo had become prime minister in February 2015. But two months into his job, Sung Wan-jong, a construction tycoon, committed suicide, leaving a note accusing those who had received money from him. The former prime minister was on this list. Lee Wan-koo initially denied the accusation and showed no intention of vacating his position. However, he ultimately offered his resignation. As a result of such scandals, coupled with other incidents, such as the Sewol disaster, a 2015 report released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed that \\"[a]lmost 70 percent of South Koreans distrust their government, while less than 30 percent of them are confident in the nation's judicial system.\\" This rate is significantly lower than the OECD average, which was 41.8 percent. Despite South Korea's low public confidence rate in 2015, it was at least a step up from the rate in 2007 by 10 percentage points. The government has taken steps to fight corruption, such as the Act on the Protection of Public Interest Whistle-Blowers which protect whistleblowers who report public and private corruption as well as foreign bribery.

Youth and family Marianne Bachmeier grew up in Sarstedt, where her parents fled to from East Prussia. Her father had been a member of the Waffen-SS. Her parents separated, and her mother remarried. In 1966, at the age of 16, Marianne Bachmeier had her first child. She became pregnant again at the age of 18 by her then-boyfriend. Shortly before the birth of her second daughter, she was raped. Both of her children were given up for adoption shortly after their birth. In 1973, her third daughter Anna, was born. She raised Anna alone. After Anna's birth, Marianne Bachmeier was sterilized. Murder of her daughter On 5 May 1980, Anna Bachmeier did not go to school to spite her mother. When trying to visit a friend her own age, Anna was abducted by Klaus Grabowski, a 35-year-old butcher. He is said to have held Anna for several hours at home and then strangled her with a pair of tights. According to the Prosecutor he had tied the girl tight, packed her into a box, which he then buried on the canal bank in a shallow grave. Klaus Grabowski was a convicted sex offender and had previously been sentenced for the sexual abuse of two girls. During his detention, he was castrated in 1976 and, two years later, underwent hormone treatment. Once arrested, Grabowski stated that he did not intend to sexually abuse Anna. He said the girl had wanted to tell her mother that he had touched her inappropriately, with the aim of extorting money from him. Vigilante justice in the courtroom On 6 March 1981, the third day of the trial, Marianne Bachmeier smuggled a Beretta M1934 into the courtroom of L√ºbeck District Court and shot the alleged killer of her daughter Anna, Klaus Grabowski, in the back. She aimed the gun at Grabowski's back and pulled the trigger eight times. Seven of the shots hit, and the 35-year-old defendant was killed instantly. This is probably the most well-known case of vigilante justice in West Germany. It sparked extensive media coverage, and television crews from all over the world traveled to L√ºbeck to report on this case. A large part of the population showed understanding for her actions. She sold her life story for about 250,000 Deutsche Mark in an exclusive to the news magazine Stern. Sentence for manslaughter On 2 November 1982, Marianne Bachmeier was initially charged in court with murder. Later the prosecution dropped the murder charge. After 28 days of negotiations, the Board agreed on the verdict. Four months after the opening of proceedings she was convicted on 2 March 1983 by the Circuit Court Chamber of the District Court L√ºbeck for manslaughter and sentenced for unlawful possession of a firearm to six years in prison but was later released after serving three years. Moving abroad Marianne Bachmeier married in 1985 and moved in 1988 to Lagos, Nigeria with her husband, a teacher. They lived there in a German camp where her husband taught at a German school. They divorced in 1990 and she moved to Sicily. She was diagnosed with cancer there, whereupon she returned to Germany. Interviews In 1994, 13 years after her act, she gave an interview on Germany radio: \\"I think there is a very big difference if I kill a little girl because I'm afraid that I then have to go to prison for my life. And then also the 'how', so that I stand behind the girl and, strangle her which is taken literally from his statement: 'I heard something come out of her nose, I was fixated, then I could not stand the sight of her body any longer '. \\" [1] On 21 September 1995, she appeared on the talk show Fliege on the Das Erste TV channel. She admitted that she had shot the alleged killer of her daughter after careful consideration, to enforce the law on him, and to prevent him from further spreading lies about Anna. [2] Death On 17 September 1996, she died at the age of 46 years from pancreatic cancer in a hospital in L√ºbeck. It had actually been her desire to die in her adopted home of Palermo. Before her death, she asked the NDR reporter Lukas Maria B√∂hmer, to accompany her with movie camera in the last stages of her life.

The church was granted Grade II listed status in 1966. History The original Ellenbrook Chapel was founded by the lords of the manor of Worsley. Sometime between 1272 and 1295 the Rector of Eccles granted a licence to Richard de Worsley to have chantry in his chapel at Worsley. The next mention of a chapel was in 1549 when Sir Richard Brereton complained of the theft of a chalice from his chapel. Dame Dorothy Legh left the interest of ¬£50 for its maintenance in 1638. The Bishop of Chester made an order as to its endowment in 1677. The dissident Lord Willoughby locked out the curate in charge in about 1693 and put in a Nonconformist preacher, but was defeated by the bishop. A replacement church was built on the same site in 1725. Architecture The church in Flemish bond brick has a slate roof and was subsequently extended at the east end. It has a five-bay nave with plain, segment-headed window openings and the chancel has a three-lancet east window. The south aisle and bell cote were added in the 19th century and its vestry dates from the 20th century. The gabled porch on the north side has a Norman- style arched entrance.

Both grand and petty corruption are serious problems in Tanzania yet various comprehensive laws are in place to prevent corruption. It is largely due to a weak internal control and low or non-compliance with anti-corruption regulations within different government agencies. For instance, public procurement, taxation, and customs service are areas that are prone to corruption. Foreign companies have identified that corruption within those sectors poses potential obstacles for doing business in Tanzania as bribes are often demanded. It is also believed that the existing large informal sector, 48.1% of GDP, is associated with cumbersome business registration process which has created opportunities for corruption. President John Magufuli launched a campaign against grand corruption and established a special court to handle the matter. As a result, corrupt officials have been fired. These efforts and similar projects are internationally supported by Germany and the European Union. There are fears that such anti-corruption efforts will end when President Magufuli steps down.

January 2014: Troy Simon, Sci Academy Class of 2012, introduces First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House College Opportunity Summit. April 2014: Sci Academy was named the #2 high school in Louisiana by US News and World Report. Controversy In 2013, three Collegiate Academies schools ‚Äî Sci Academy, George Washington Carver Collegiate and G.W. Carver Prep ‚Äî had the highest suspension rates in New Orleans. At Carver Collegiate, 69 percent of its student body were suspended during the 2012-13 academic year; at and Carver Prep and Sci Academy, the figures were 61 percent and 58 percent, respectively. The suspension rates led to the Southern Poverty Law Center sending an open letter to Collegiate Academies. Students were sent home for matters as trivial as \\"laughing too much ... hugging a friend and most commonly for being 'disrespectful,'\\" according to The Times-Picayune. Allegations of the treatment of special-education students were particularly startling, including violations of the federal law that 10 suspensions of a special-education student should trigger an immediate meeting. In 2014, a coalition called Better Education Support Team joined more than 30 students and their relatives in filing a complaint against Collegiate Academies that its disciplinary policies were so severe that they bordered on child abuse and violated federal civil rights laws. The plaintiffs asked the U.S. departments of Justice and Education to investigate. The incidents that led to the complaint led to three students withdrawing and protests. Students created a list of grievances that said, in part: > We get disciplined for anything and everything. We get detentions or > suspensions for not walking on the taped lines in the hallway, for > slouching, for not raising our hands in a straightline. [sic] The teachers > and administrators tell us this is because they are preparing us for > college. It trains us for the military, orworse [sic], for jail. In addition, students complained that they lacked textbooks or even a library and that the material being taught was below grade level. In 2015, Collegiate Academies were among the New Orleans charter schools subject to a federal judge's landmark New Orleans special education settlement that tightened the state Education Department's oversight and required third-party monitoring. Louisiana Department of Education issued a notice on Jan. 6, 2016 that George Washington Carver Collegiate had violated a special-education student's rights when the school suspended him for a full month.

In 2000, Orloviƒá, who had been living as a refugee and war widow ever since the end of the war, returned to her home in Konjeviƒá Polje to find that a Serbian Orthodox church had been built on her property. She is in a legal struggle to have the church removed from her land. Pre-war life Fata was born to Muslim Bosniak parents ≈†aban and Zlatka Husejnoviƒá in the eastern Bosnian hamlet Hrnƒçiƒái on the outskirts of Bratunac. Sources vary as to her year of birth, between 1940 and 1943, although in a 2013 interview she said she was 71 years old. She married ≈†aƒáir Orloviƒá, with whom she had seven children including four daughters: Fatima, Zlatka, Hurija, and Senija; and three sons: ≈†aban, Hasan, and Ejub. Before the war, Fata had four houses and four stables. Along with many Bosniaks living in the hill villages of the Drina Valley, she was ethnically/religiously cleansed from the village by the ethnic Serb military aggression during the war. Her husband ≈†aƒáir and between 22‚Äì28 other family members were killed and she and her seven children made refugees. Return to Konjeviƒá Polje and legal battle When she returned to Konjeviƒá Polje in 2000 she found that her home had been completely demolished by the Serbs and a Serbian Orthodox church built on her land. The church was built in the summer of 1996, upon the end of the war. The destruction of places of worship and other religious symbols of the communities forced from their homes was an important feature of the ethnic cleansing. New buildings like the church in Konjevic Polje were erected to emphasize that a new ethnic/religious group now owned the land. Fata Orloviƒá has fought tenaciously to have the church removed from her garden, in the face of bureaucratic resistance and physical intimidation. She was beaten. When she complained to the authorities the priest Vasilije Kaƒçavenda accused her of being a disseminator of national hate. She pursued a legal action through the courts which found in her favour and against the priest, ordering the church to be demolished. Although her lawyer advised her to file charges for the mistreatment, injuries and death threats she received, Fata preferred to set an example to her opponents, maintaining that \\"We should let things go now, it is the smartest thing to do. I am hurt, but I can not hurt anymore.\\" She insisted that she was proud of herself and her (seven) children, and of her \\"smart but agonized people.\\" She said that she wanted to say to Serbs \\"If you are not a good person, become one. We will die eventually, so it is better to die as a good person than as a bad one.\\" Her efforts were supported by journalists who wholeheartedly supported Fata and helped spread the news of her struggle. In 2007 the Government of Republika Srpska agreed to fund the relocation of the church. The Office of the High Representative welcomed the agreement as a sign that Fata Orloviƒá‚Äôs right to private property would be respected. The church is empty, awaiting relocation. Dismantling it and moving it elsewhere will cost thousands of dollars. Fata Orloviƒá's fight against the church is regarded as a test of the potential for restoration of the rule of law in a divided Bosnia. According to James Rodehaver, human rights director for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe(OSCE) in Sarajevo, the relocation of the church will be an important indicator of a return to the rule of law and the possibility of resolving the legacy of the war. Fata Orloviƒá is not bothered by the fact that the building on her land is a church and that Orthodox Serbs worship there. She respects churches as much as mosques but insists that if the congregation want a church they should put it on their own land. While respecting all nations and religions, she observes that she can't respect people building on her land. She has had to build her own home on the charred remains of the old one, with her own funds with assistance some assistance from Sulejman Tihiƒá, former member of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who provided roofing tiles, windows, and doors. For a long time she had to get by without electricity or a water supply. Security is poor. Bosniak homes are broken into and robbed, and livestock stolen. It was alleged that Serb police watch over the church while other Serbs, opposed to Bosniaks returning to their homes, go stealing. The bitter experience of expulsion has damaged Fata's ability to trust. When asked for forgiveness by those who accused her of spreading national hatred in the past she refuses to forgive, though she insists she will not hurt anyone either. \\"They massacred to the last, killed everyone, burned all of it, and now they ask me to forgive them. I shall not!\\" Awards The US Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina nominated Fata Orloviƒá for the international \\"The Woman of Courage\\" award, given to brave women who fight for their rights in a nonviolent way. Orloviƒá was chosen as the 2007 Person of the Year by the Bosnian newspapers \\"Dnevni avaz\\" and \\"Preporod\\". Documentary Orloviƒá was the subject of an Al Jazeera Balkans documentary in November 2012 called The House That Fata Didn't Build.

Fujimori has been convicted of having ordered killings, embezzlement of public funds, abuse of power and corruption during his 10 years of presidency (1990-2000). In 2006, Fujimori fled to Japan with an alleged USD 600 million of public assets. He has been sentenced to a total of more than 30 years in prison.

The museum is based on maritime heritage and gives an insight into the local Westfjords fisheries and fishing industry as well the life of the fishermen, their families and the coastal culture through the centuries. The museum has made a policy concerning preservation of boats to restore them to their previous condition and to keep them seaworthy. The main focus is also to maintain knowledge and skills concerning their repair and maintenance and make sure that the knowledge is being passed between generations.Bygg√∞arsafn Vestfjar√∞a / B√°tar The museum was opened in Turnh√∫si√∞ on Fisherman's Day in 1988.Timarit.is - Leita Most of the museum collection consists of various historical things regarding the fisheries and the fishing industry around the Westfjords. Among interesting things is a collection of 190 accordions, a collection of valuable old boats and different things found by divers in the seas around the fjords. The museum is a popular point of interest. Visitors from cruise ships that come to √çsafj√∂r√∞ur are frequent guests. A local theatre group dressed in Icelandic national costumes makes a play of the daily life of the beginning 19th century, where they sing and dance to a music and put the fish bacalao out in the sun to dry.

The museum is open during the summertime.  Museum history  The first ideas about establishing heritage and maritime museum came from a man named B√°r√∞ur G. T√≥masson. In 1939, he wrote a newspaper article suggesting that people should unite in a project that involved a restoration of an old boat model called sex√¶ringur. The boat should be an indicator of a regional heritage and maritime museum. The idea was successful. Few years later, in July 1941, the √çsafj√∂r√∞ur heritage and maritime museum was established and B√°r√∞ur was elected the first chairman. In the early decades little changed concerning the museum and its activities although in the year 1947 the museum came under control of the town council of √çsafj√∂r√∞ur and the county committees. It was not until in the beginning of the 1970s with the restoration of Ne√∞stikaupsta√∞ur that the museum found its future home in Turnh√∫si√∞ which opened on Sj√≥mannadagurinn the year 1988.Bygg√∞arsafn Vestfjar√∞a / Um safni√∞  Ne√∞stikaupsta√∞ur  Ne√∞stikaupsta√∞ur is an old historical site from the time √çsafj√∂r√∞ur was called Skutulsfjar√∞aeyri.

Tj√∂ruh√∫si√∞ was built in 1781 as a storage house and is now a fish restaurant. Turnh√∫si√∞ was built 1784 as storage house now the home of Westfjords heritage museum. Ne√∞stikaupsta√∞ur is the oldest \\"village\\" in Iceland where houses are grouped together from historical time. In 1975 that the houses were put on a preservation list and a major restoration started in 1977. The trading history came to an end in 1926, and since then the houses had lacked maintenance, were used as storage rooms and were in a really bad condition. This monumental site is now a pride for the town and its people, it keeps the history alive in an authentic atmosphere of the 18th century.Bygg√∞arsafn Vestfjar√∞a / Ne√∞stikaupsta√∞ur  Turnh√∫si√∞  Turnh√∫si√∞ or the Tower house is the youngest house in Ne√∞stikaupsta√∞ur.

She trained at Manchester School of Theatre.  Career  Pippa Nixon has had numerous roles in film and television as well as recording drama for BBC Radio, but she is best known for her critically acclaimed theatre work. During her early successful stage career, Nixon took on a mixture of roles in both contemporary and classical writing. In 2011, after stints at Shakespeare's Globe where she was commended in the Ian Charleson Awards for her portrayal of Jessica in The Merchant of Venice, Nixon moved to the Royal Shakespeare Company to take on a number of lead roles.

Currently she is appearing as Celestine de Tullio in the BBC Radio drama, Tommies. In 2015, Nixon reprieved her role as Rosalind in BBC Radio 3's new production of Shakespeare's As You Like It. Orlando was played by Luke Norris who had played Olivier in the 2013 RSC stage version. Later in 2015, Nixon played Lotty in the BBC Radio 4 drama The Enchanted April.  Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC)  At the Royal Shakespeare Company, Nixon played a number of leading roles. The three-year residency with the world-renowned Royal Shakespeare Company received with wide-ranging critical acclaim.  Cardenio and City Madam  In 2011, Nixon played Dorathea in Shakespeare's supposed lost play Cardenio (directed by RSC Artistic Director Gregory Doran). Charles Spencer commented in The Telegraph that \\"Lucy Briggs-Owen and Pippa Nixon give sharply defined neatly contrasting performances as the betrayed girls.\\" In the same season Nixon played the prostitute, Shave'em, in Philip Massanger's city comedy The City Madam, also at the Swan theatre.  A Midsummer Night's Dream  It was her portrayal of Titania in Nancy Meckler's A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream that drew critical attention. The production was Nixon's first in the larger Royal Shakespeare Theatre. Charles Spencer writing in The Telegraph gave the production five stars commenting that \\"there‚Äôs a strong sexual spark between Jo Stone-Fewings and Pippa Nixon, respectively doubling as Theseus and Oberon and Hippolyta and Titania.\\"Spencer, Charles. The Telegraph 5 August 2011. Pat Ashworth in The Stage also commented on the chemistry between Nixon and Stone-Fewings noting that \\"Jo Stone-Fewings and Pippa Nixon are beautifully paired as Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania.\\" Ashworth, Pat. The Stage Friday 5 August 2011. Simon Tavener in What‚ÄôsOnStage.com commented that \\"Pippa Nixon makes a strong impression as Titania\\". The Bastard in King John  In 2012, Nixon worked again with Maria Aberg in a production of Shakespeare's King John, where she played a female bastard alongside Alex Waldmann's King John. The production which split the critics received a range of stars, and was well received by audiences. Michael Billington in The Guardian described the performance saying, \\"Pippa Nixon's Bastard, the illegitimate offspring of Richard I, becomes the key figure in this version; and Nixon successfully turns the character into a perky commentator on, and participant in, the play's world of political expediency.\\"Billington, Michael. The Guardian Friday 20 April 2012. Simon Tavener was full of praise for Nixon's innovative approach to the role exclaiming \\"Pippa Nixon has been given the part of a lifetime ‚Äì and she revels in the mischief and wit of the character as well as playing the emotional shifts and inner conflict brilliantly. Outstanding ‚Äì no other word for it.\\"  Lady Anne in Richard III  In the same season, Nixon played Lady Anne opposite Jonjo O'Neill's Richard III in Richard III. Commenting on this production, the reviewer in the Stratford Observer felt that \\"There are some particularly strong performances from the women - notably Pippa Nixon as Lady Anne.\\"  Ophelia and Rosalind  Most recently Nixon played both Rosalind and Ophelia in the 2013 season. Here critics were impressed with Nixon's portrayal of Shakespeare's rejected and troubled heroine, Ophelia, in Hamlet. Michael Billington in The Guardian wrote, \\"Pippa Nixon's Ophelia is outstanding: a passionate schoolgirl fatally besotted by Hamlet.\\"Billington, Michael. The Guardian 27 March 2013. Fiona Mountford writing in The Evening Standard was particularly complimentary about Nixon's performance exclaiming, \\"Pippa Nixon makes a nicely vulnerable Ophelia, forced into renouncing her ardent love by misguided elders.\\" Paul Taylor in The Independent praised Nixon's approach to Ophelia declaring that ‚ÄòNixon's Ophelia who, heart-rendingly, performs the mad scene in pristine white bridal dress and veil, is stunning\\". But it was Nixon's captivating performance as Rosalind during the summer of 2013 in the joyous production of As You Like It, that was acclaimed by crics. Nixon was again reunited with director Maria Aberg, and actor Alex Waldmann, a working relationship which hailed them as \\"the two most exciting actors in the company today\\". The portrayal of Rosalind received exceptional reviews. Pat Ashworth in The Stage wrote \\"Maria Aberg says she could not imagine directing this play with any Rosalind other than Pippa Nixon, whom she deems extraordinary. She is. She has a dancer‚Äôs body, a spareness and litheness which make her cocky and capering in the guise of a man and deeply vulnerable as a woman. But it‚Äôs her openness and quick- wittedness that is so appealing. She makes us able to read her mind, and that really is extraordinary.\\"Ashworth, Pat. The Stage Thursday 25 April 2013. Lyn Gardner tweeted: ‚ÄòPippa Nixon is enchanting, knee-trembling, sexy and sad in Maria Aberg‚Äôs As You Like It. Up there with the greatest Rosalinds‚Äô. Simon Tavener reviewing for What‚ÄôsOnStage.com made the point that, \\"For my money, Pippa Nixon is the brightest star in the RSC ensemble at the moment and I hope that they continue to nurture and cherish her.\\" Charles Spencer writing in The Telegraph felt that \\"Pippa Nixon now gives one of the most entrancing Rosalinds I have ever seen.\\" Spencer, Charles. in The Telegraph, 25 April 2013. Echoing Spencer, Michael Billington in his review of As You Like It in The Guardian went so far as to exclaim that, \\"Its chief delight is Pippa Nixon, who, for me, joins Vanessa Redgrave, Adrian Lester and the late Susan Fleetwood in the select pantheon of memorable Rosalinds ... It is a captivating, wittily androgynous performance that ushers Nixon to the threshold of stardom.\\"Billington, Michael. The Guardian 23 April. Other Theatre Work In the Summer of 2014, Pippa could be seen on stage in the Theatre Royal Bath production of Helen Edmundson's adaptation of Emile Zola's novel Th√©r√®se Raquin. Michael Billington wrote in his review that \\"Pippa Nixon is destined for stardom.\\".Billington, Michael. The Guardian 8 August 2014. He went on to describe Nixon's \\"great gift is the ability to act with every inch of her body.\\" Dominic Cavendish writing in The Telegraph said, \\"Rising star Pippa Nixon succeeds splendidly in suggesting Th√©r√®se‚Äôs unbridled yearning with her bright, watchful eyes - an alluring force of suppressed nature in a voluminous turquoise dress.\\" Cavendish, Dominic. The Telegraph 10 August 2014. Paul Taylor in The Independent was equally positive about Pippa's performance and said \\"The glorious Pippa Nixon delivers a performance perfectly pitched to the production's propulsive, light-on-its-casters blend of the realist and the expressionist.\\" Taylor, Paul. The Independent 11 August 2014. The Observer review headline made the point that, \\"Pippa Nixon is a compelling presence.\\" Brennan, Clare. The Observer 17 August 2014. Nixon has been cast as Ariel in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse production of The Tempest.

Skully Helmets Inc  The helmet was invented by Marcus Weller who also served as the company CEO. As of July 12, 2016 Marcus Weller was removed as CEO and replaced by Martin Fitcher. Fichter was an executive at mobile device company HTC's American subsidiary in Bellevue, Washington. Washington Technology Industry Association (October 2, 2012) The helmet's software is based on the Android platform, and can be controlled with voice commands. Users can see rearward through the heads-up display and the rear camera. The helmet also includes Bluetooth functionality, allowing music streaming from smartphones. As of August, 2014, the manufacturer was taking preorders for the helmet. The company also had the fastest fully funded Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to-date, raising $1.1 million. However, there were significant production delays with the helmet including company insider accounts estimating no more than 20 to 100 shipped units as of July 12, 2016. Skully Helmets Inc shut down in July 2016 and was expected to declare bankruptcy shortly afterward. Despite having raised $2.5 million through the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, and an additional $11 million in venture capital from Intel and others, the company was unable to secure additional funding. Former executive assistant, Isabelle Faithauer, sued Skully Helmets Inc and the founders, Marcus and Mitchell Weller, for fraudulently using corporate funds for personal use, though Marcus Weller denied the claims of the lawsuit. Faithauer later dropped her claims, stating \\"a reasonable jury [could] conclude that my claims were totally without merit.\\" Skully Helmets Inc was also sued by supplier Flextronics for over $1 million in unpaid inventory expenses. The case was stayed during bankruptcy proceedings, and the assets were sold to Skully Technologies.  Skully Technologies  The assets of Skully Helmets Inc were acquired in 2017 by Ivan and Rafael Contreras, renaming the company Skully Technologies and relocating it to Atlanta, Georgia. The new owners demonstrated a new prototype at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, with plans to begin shipping that summer. The new company also promised to provide a helmet to anyone who had ordered one through the IndieGoGo campaign. The company sent confirmation emails on Friday September 21, 2018 to IndieGoGo campaign supporters that paid for the helmet in 2014. As of March 2020, neither those who have been promised a helmet through the IndieGoGo campaign or have made new orders have received a helmet from the Company.

Some French friends suggested that Yuri Mamin should make a joint Russian-French film, which led to the creation of the 1993 film \\"Window to Paris\\" or \\"Salade Russe\\". The film starts with residents of a Saint Petersburg communal apartment of 1990s finding a window hidden behind a cupboard that leads to a mansard roof and shows the effect of this discovery. The film is a grotesque prediction of the effect of fall of the Iron Curtain on the life in Europe, about the invasion of Russian demoralized businessmen and the humiliation of the intelligentsia in Russia. At the end of the film, the main character, Nikolai Chizhov, a school music teacher and a member of the Russian intelligentsia, gives a persuasive speech to the children, who have decided to remain in Paris. In his words: You were born in a terrible time in a poor, devastated country. But it is your country, after all! Don't you want to make it better? At that time, this was a rather rare demonstration of patriotism; the authors of the film and all its actors were quite sincere. As a division of Lenfilm, the film company Troitsky Most refused to participate in financing the project, thus putting the French partners on the edge of financial collapse and threatening the production of the film. Because of this situation, Yuri Mamin was urged to establish his own film company in order to attract support from commercial businesses that were thriving in post- Perestroika Russia. That is how Yuri Mamin's Fountain Fund for Support and Development of Cinematography was created. Yuri Mamin's Fountain Fund The name of the fund, \\"Fountain\\", is from Mamin's preceding film that won the grand prize at a French film festival, which had been organized under the patronage of Madame Danielle Mitterrand, the wife of the French then-president Fran√ßois Mitterrand. It was this in particular that facilitated financing for the film \\"Window to Paris\\" from the French fund CNC. The comedy \\"Window to Paris\\" attained such success in France and at the Berlin Film Festival that Michael Barker, the co-president of the American distribution company Sony Pictures Classics, arranged for the film to be released in the United States, and twice requested Goskino to submit the film \\"Window to Paris\\" for the 1994 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Barker wrote: \\"The response to the film at screenings in Los Angeles and New York has been terrific with both the critics and the audiences. It seems to communicate the message of bringing two cultures together in a warm and enlightening manner... should 'Salade Russe' be the Official Russian Entry to the Academy for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award, we feel confident the picture will not only be nominated for the Award, but has a very good chance to ultimately win the Award itself.\\" Yuri Mamin's official biography However, at that time Nikita Mikhalkov, with his freshly finished film \\"Burnt by the Sun\\", greatly wished to be considered for the Oscar. After the chairman of the Russian Oscar Committee, Elem Klimov, did not agree to submit Mikhalkov‚Äôs film to the competition, Mikhalkov demonstrated his outstanding skills in behind-the-scenes intrigues. Elem Klimov was immediately replaced by Mikhalkov's brother, Andrey Konchalovsky, who agreed to send the film \\"Burnt by the Sun\\" to the United States. Thus, Mamin was deprived of the opportunity to win the Oscar. The members of the Russian Oscar Committee remain under the control of Nikita Mikhalkov, who shapes the politics of Russian cinematography. Therefore, in Mamin's opinion, neither the best nor the most talented films are being submitted to the American Film Academy, but rather the ones created by Mikhalkov's favorite artists. Nikita Mikhalkov is currently Vladimir Putin's cinematography adviser.

He told this idea to the filmmaker Aleksey German, who sold it 20 years later to Arkady Tigai, Yuri Mamin' co-author, for a bottle of cognac.

As soon as Salakaraju heard about the plans of Aliya Rama Raya and his brothers (Tirumala Deva Raya and Venkatadri Raya) to dethrone him, he invited Ibrahim Adil Shah I and placed him on the throne of Vijayanagar for seven days. This was too much for the nobles of Vijayanagar to tolerate. But they acted cleverly, offered full support to Salakaraju and requested him to send away Ibrahim Adil Shah which he did after paying him a suitable compensation.

Scodelario stars as an injured and pregnant gymnast who must defend her boyfriend's house against a home invasion. The film is produced by the United Kingdom-based Glass Man Films and the South Africa-based Tiger House Film. The film, set in the United Kingdom, was filmed in South Africa. Koch Media acquired distribution rights for the United Kingdom. Tiger House was released for digital download on 2015 and on home media on 2015. Plot Mark, who comes from a well-off family, meets his gymnast girlfriend Kelly after school. She becomes uncomfortable when he shows her a crossbow. While demonstrating it, he accidentally shoots her in the leg. An unspecified time later, Kelly sneaks into Mark's house through his second-story window and confronts him on why he has not contacted her lately. Mark reveals that his parents have grounded him and taken away his mobile phone after finding a condom and drugs among his possessions. Lynn, Mark's mother, interrupts them. As Kelly hides, she overhears Lynn insult her, calling her low class and unworthy of Mark. After Lynn leaves, Kelly tells Mark she is pregnant. Upset, Mark complains his life plans could be ruined. Before they can discuss it further, Mark hears a loud thump. Unknown to Mark, home invaders have killed his dog and taken his parents hostage. He leaves his room to investigate, and Kelly hears further noises. Panicking, she hides under Mark's bed. The bedroom door bursts open, and robbers Shane, Callum, Sveta, and Reg enter. Shane has a glass shard embedded in his side, and they set him down on the bed. He instructs the others to stick to their plan: Reg and Sveta are to take Mark's father, Doug, to his bank and rob it while Callum and Shane watch the hostages. As Callum researches how to make a tourniquet on Mark's computer, Kelly desperately reaches for a cell phone, only to find its battery is dead. Callum becomes excited when he learns Lynn is a doctor, and he temporarily frees her so she can look at Shane. Suspicious Mark may have invited her over, Lynn intentionally drops an item so she can glance under the bed. After stabilizing Shane, she is taken back to her bedroom and tied up with Mark. As Callum is distracted and Shane rests, Kelly escapes the bedroom. She is about to leave the house when Ferdinand, a man with whom Lynn is having an affair, arrives. When Ferdinand sees Callum's unmasked face, Callum kills him. As Callum menaces Mark and Lynn, Kelly sneaks up on him and stabs him with a pair of scissors. Callum chases her back to the bedroom, and she flees to the attic, stacking heavy objects on the trapdoor. In the attic, Kelly finds Mark's crossbow, though it is not loaded. As Callum enters the attic, she slips by him and traps him there. Shane stops her with a pistol. He confesses to her that he knows he is dying and has become scared. After they have a tense conversation, in which he learns about Ferdinand's murder, Shane allows Kelly to go. She frees Mark and Lynn, and they race downstairs. Mark and Lynn are immediately recaptured by Reg and Sveta, who have returned from the successful heist. Reg and Sveta free Callum. After grabbing a bolt, Kelly returns to the attic and retrieves the crossbow. When Reg refuses to kill the hostages, Callum takes his shotgun and says he will do it himself. As Callum leaves to look for her, Kelly shoots Reg with the crossbow, killing him, though he starts a fire before he dies. As the house burns, Kelly jumps out a window and surprises Sveta, killing him with the same bolt used to kill Reg. Kelly puts on Sveta's mask, tricking Callum into believing he needs assistance. Before she can kill him, Doug knocks her unconscious. As Callum prepares to kill Kelly, Shane recovers long enough to shoot and kill him. Doug says he only wanted to escape his unhappy marriage and retire wealthy. Blaming him for the entire ordeal, Lynn shoots and kills him with Reg's shotgun. With all the robbers dead, Mark, Kelly, and Lynn leave the burning house. As Mark helps Kelly load up her car with the stolen money, he offers to leave with her. Kelly stops him, telling him that he has his whole life ahead of him. Mark and Lynn practice their story, in which they say Kelly was never there and infighting caused the deaths of the robbers, and Kelly drives off.

Notable participants include individuals from various creative fields, including poet Elizabeth Alexander, writer and documentarian Alain de Botton, author and Families and Work Institute founder Ellen Galinsky, sculptor Tim Hawkinson, and architect Greg Lynn.  Overview  Broodwork's projects are often experiments in interdisciplinarity that investigate using one methodology to explore another. As a social practice entity, outside of curatorial installations, the creative output of Broodwork consists mostly of events, actions, and conversations. While adults are their primary audience, Broodwork's projects, particularly workshops and installations, are often designed for the two distinct audiences of adults and children, which is atypical for a contemporary art entity whose nature is not wholly pedagogic. Some of Broodwork's events involve parent- child interaction.  Exhibition History  Broodwork has presented several major exhibitions since 2009, at venues including the Ben Maltz Gallery at the Otis College of Art and Design, Santa Monica Museum of Art, Trajector Art Fair (Brussels), and the Center for the Arts, Eagle Rock. These exhibitions range from large group exhibitions featuring many artists, to smaller, thematic projects featuring 3-4 artists. In exhibitions, Broodwork acts in diverse roles as curator, artist organizer, and artist. Typical for a social practice entity, some of Broodwork's projects have also been realized in non- gallery/museum spaces and via radio, or do not involve any object-making practice at all.  Non-Exhibition Activities  Broodwork has acted as an advisor and collaborator to other entities and projects including the Architecture and Design Museum, the Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and Urban Design, and the Social Practices Art Network (SPAN). Their articles for the Herman Miller Company's LifeWork Blog are demonstrative of the group's ongoing participation in a public dialog of work-life balance issues. Founders Niederlander and Regn have represented the practice and the practice's themes at academic conferences, such as Feminist Art Project's 2014 sister conference to the College Art Association annual conference and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles Colloquy Series.  Participants  Broodwork's organizational structure includes four advisors: artist and Museum Director Tibbie Dunbar, Families and Work Institute founder Ellen Galinsky, artist- educator Asuka Hisa, and Visual Understanding in Education (VUE) founder Phillip Yenawine. Within Broodwork's own projects, collaborating artists and creatives vary from project to project, with many artists participating in multiple projects. Due to Broodwork's emphasis on family, several collaborators have participated alongside their partners or spouses.

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 85th place out of 180 countries.  Dynamics  The European Commission reports that electoral fraud persists in Kosovo representing serious shortcomings in the electoral process. Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer 2013 points out that political parties are considered the second most corrupt institution in Kosovo by a significantly high number of households, second only to the judiciary. Corruption is considered the largest obstacle to doing business in Kosovo, and businesses frequently resort to bribes when interacting with public officials.

The play focuses on former Yankee Yogi Berra and his wife, Carmen, as they interact with other Yankees from different eras. It made its Broadway debut on February 6, 2014 and closed on March 2, 2014. Development Kirmser and Ponturo met while working on the 2009 Broadway revival of Hair. Bronx Bombers is the third play produced by Kirmser and Ponturo to focus on sports, following Lombardi, which followed American football head coach Vince Lombardi, and Magic/Bird, which focused on basketball players Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Ponturo, who worked in sports marketing before theatre, worked with Major League Baseball (MLB) executives, which enabled him to gain an \\"endorsement of authenticity\\" from MLB and the New York Yankees, to write a play about the Yankees franchise. Kirmser and Ponturo sat down with Yogi Berra and his wife, Carmen, to discuss writing a play where the plot would center around them, gaining their approval. Bronx Bombers began as an Off-Broadway production, premiering at Primary Stages. It ran from September 20 through October 19, 2013. Present day Yankees Mark Teixeira and CC Sabathia promoted the show on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Previews for the Broadway production began on January 10, 2014, and it made its official debut on Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theatre on February 6, 2014. The play was able to recoup only a quarter of its potential box office take of $733,260. The play closed on March 2, 2014, after 29 regular performances.Hetrick, Adam. \\"Eric Simonson's Yankees Drama 'Bronx Bombers' Will End Broadway Run\\" playbill.com, February 20, 2014 Plot overview The show begins in 1977, the day after Reggie Jackson and Billy Martin engaged in a near-brawl during a game. Berra attempts to bring Jackson and Martin back together, with the help of other Yankees stars. In the first scene, Berra brings Martin and Jackson, with team captain Thurman Munson, to his hotel room to settle their argument. Berra spends the night with his wife discussing the problem. Berra then has a dream where he and his wife have dinner with Yankees' greats Joe DiMaggio, Elston Howard, Mickey Mantle, Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, and Derek Jeter. Cast Peter Scolari and Tracy Shayne star as Yogi Berra and his wife, Carmen. Scolari and Shayne were married in 2013. Richard Topol and Wendy Makkena played Yogi and Carmen Berra in the Off-Broadway production. Joe Pantoliano was cast in the role of Yogi Berra for the Broadway production, but he dropped out during rehearsals due to \\"creative differences\\". The play features cameos of other famous Yankees. In both the Off-Broadway and Broadway productions, C. J. Wilson plays Ruth, Christopher Jackson plays Jeter, Francois Battiste plays both Jackson and Howard, Chris Henry Coffey plays DiMaggio, Bill Dawes plays Mantle and Munson, Keith Nobbs plays Martin, and John Wernke plays Gehrig.

It has increasingly become the preferred residential section of downtown. It is also home to the site of the \\"Superblock\\" project that will include hundreds of condos and apartments as well as a variety of retail and commercial space. The former home of Baltimore's many and famed department stores, Westside Baltimore is now anchored by the University of Maryland, Baltimore consisting of the University of Maryland Health System, University of Maryland School of Law and the University of Maryland Biopark. The Westside is also home to several performing arts centers, including the Hippodrome Theatre, Royal Farms Arena and the future home of the Everyman Theatre.Downtown Baltimore Geography Baltimore's Westside is located within the Downtown area of Central Baltimore. The Westside is generally bordered by Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard to the west, Mulberry Street to the north, Howard Street to the east, and Pratt Street to the south. History Former Hutzler's department store on Howard Street The Westside of Downtown Baltimore has been an area of heavy economic development over the years. The Westside was known to be the \\"Garment District\\" for the many clothing factories placed throughout the neighborhood. This name continued to have relevance up until the mid twentieth century due to the abundance of department stores throughout the Howard Street corridor. Some of these include, Hutzler's, Stewart's, Hecht's, and Hochschild Kohn's. The Lexington Market is another commercial center that has made the Westside a cornerstone of Baltimore's shopping history. Neighborhood revitalization Hippodrome Theater in 2004 During the late twentieth century, the Westside fell into decay due to the majority of shopping being relocated to the surrounding suburban malls. Numerous efforts have been made to revitalize Baltimore's Westside, including the Baltimore Light Rail running through the center of the neighborhood on Howard Street, and the restorations of Lexington Market, Hippodrome Theater, and the Everyman Theatre. Future Baltimore's Westside is expected to see a rise in development and revitalization due to the construction of the Red Line subway running under the neighborhood from east to west. The Red Line will have two stations in Westside; Poppleton Station on the western edge serving the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and University Center/Howard Street serving the central part of the neighborhood. The University Center/Howard Street station will be a major transfer point for the existing Blue Line on Howard Street.

Background Lillian Schelew and her sons, Jeffrey, Michael, Bernard and Alan, owned a company named Joyce Avenue Apartments Ltd which was in possession of an apartment building in Moncton, New Brunswick. The four sons owned eighty percent of Joyce, equally divided via two corporate entities, the respondent Bram Enterprises Ltd. and Jamb Enterprises Ltd. The remaining twenty percent fell to the appellant, A.I. Enterprises Ltd., owned and directed by Alan Schelew. Joyce, Bram, Jamb and A.I. signed a syndication agreement whereby the majority of investors were granted the right of sale, subject to a right of first refusal by any minority investor to purchase the apartment at a professionally appraised price. The terms of the syndication agreement limited the irreversible offer of sale to a fifteen-day window. In 2000, Bram and Jamb wished to sell the apartment, at that time valued at $2.2 million, but A.I. and Alan Schelew declined to purchase it. Bram and Jamb attempted to sell the property to multiple buyers but were unsuccessful. Two years later, A.I. purchased the apartment for $2.2 million. Bram and Jamb then sued A.I. for causing loss by unlawful means. They alleged that, due to A.I. and Alan's conduct, the sale had been delayed and at a lesser price than they could have received from a third-party buyer. Bram and Jamb claimed that A.I. and Alan had broken the terms of the syndication agreement, that Alan had breached his fiduciary duty as a joint director of the respondent corporate entities, and that the A.I. and Alan had unlawfully interfered with their economic relations. The courts below At the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick, the trial judge focused on four of the appellants' acts:NBQB, par. 282, quoted at SCC, par. 13 :* they misused the arbitration provisions of the Syndication Agreement as a means of stalling the sale of the Joyce property; :* they advanced legally groundless defences for a \\"Notice of its first right of refusal\\" which they had filed against the Joyce property; :* they subsequently filed an equally baseless certificate of pending litigation against the property; and :* they denied entry to the Joyce property to prospective buyers. In the trial judge's view, all of this conduct was unlawful because it lacked any legal basis or justification. He found that Schelew's conduct in obstructing the sale also breached his fiduciary obligations as director of Bram and Jamb and that A.I. had breached its obligations towards Bram and Jamb under the Syndication Agreement.SCC, par. 14 The trial judge's decision was affirmed on appeal. At trial, neither side had referred to the recent case of OBG Ltd v Allan that had been decided in the House of Lords. Its merits were argued at the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, which opted to prefer the more narrow reasoning that was expressed by Lord Hoffmann in it for a narrow definition of \\"unlawful means\\" whereby only breaches of the civil law such as a tort or breach of contract would suffice. It did, however, allow for principled exceptions to mitigate the rigidity of the narrow rule and crafted an exception, which covered this case, in the following terms: At the Supreme Court The appeal was dismissed, Cromwell J., writing for a unanimous Court, noted that the Court had previously addressed the issue only once before, at that time favouring a narrow construction of the tort.SCC, par. 5859 In the present case, it concluded that: #Liability to the plaintiff is based on (or parasitic upon) the defendant's unlawful act against the third party. The two core components of the unlawful means tort are that the defendant must use unlawful means and that the defendant must intend to harm the plaintiff through the use of the unlawful means.SCC, par. 2326 #In order for conduct to constitute \\"unlawful means\\" for this tort, the conduct must give rise to a civil cause of action by the third party or would do so if the third party had suffered loss as a result of that conduct.SCC, par. 76 The unlawful means tort should be kept within narrow bounds, and it is not subject to principled exceptions.SCC, par. 8387 #The defendant must have the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff as an end in itself or the intention to cause economic harm to the plaintiff because it is a necessary means of achieving an end that serves some ulterior motive.SCC, par. 97 #The focus of this tort is unlawful conduct that intentionally harms the plaintiff's economic interests. There need be no contract or even other formal dealings between the plaintiff and the third party so long as the defendant's conduct is unlawful and it intentionally harms the plaintiff's economic interests.SCC, par. 93 #The tort of unlawful means is available even if there is another cause of action available to the plaintiff against the defendant in relation to the alleged misconduct.SCC, par. 7782 Therefore, the tort of unlawful means was found not to be made out in this case, but Schelew was nevertheless found liable because he had breached his fiduciary obligations as a director of the family companies.SCC, par. 98105 Impact The Court also noted that the Civil Code of Quebec (\\"[e]very person is bound to exercise his civil rights in good faith\\"), (\\"[n]o right may be exercised with the intent of injuring another\\") goes farther than the common law's unlawful means tort, where liability may be imposed on the defendant for conduct which is otherwise lawful but which is done with the intent to injure the plaintiff or in a manner inconsistent with the social ends of that right. In such cases, the appellants' conduct may have been found to fall within the liability's scope in Quebec.SCC, par. 73 References Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:2014 in Canadian case law Category:Moncton Category:Canadian tort case law ","title":"AI Enterprises Ltd v Bram Enterprises Ltd"},{"id":"41862597","title":"2010 Davis Cup Americas Zone Group IV"},{"id":"41862610","text":"Vorontsovo (; ) is a rural locality (a selo), one of two settlements, in addition to Olenegorsk, the administrative centre of the Rural Okrug, in Yukagirsky National Rural Okrug of Allaikhovsky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia.

Overview At its very core, a rootkit that employs DKOM hides itself from the Object Manager or Task manager. By modifying the linked list containing a list of all active threads and processes, this type of rootkit can essentially hide all traces from the Object Manager by wrapping the pointer away from the rootkit itself. This is possible due to the fact that kernel modules and loadable drivers have direct access to the kernel memory from its privileged access. When the system kernel pings to find the list of all processes running in the system, it relies on the EPROCESS to find them. However, because a Windows Kernel is thread based and not process based, pointers can be freely modified without any unintended effects.https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/win-usa-04/bh-win-04-butler.pdf Butler, Jamie. DKOM, HBGary. Retrieved 5/14/2014. By modifying linked list pointers to wrap around the rootkit process itself, the rootkit becomes invisible to the Windows event viewer and any system integrity applications that rely on this list. This allows DKOM rootkits to have free rein over the targeted system.

Retrieved 5/1/2014 *Hide process *Hide drivers *Hide ports *Elevate privilege level of threads and processes *Skew forensics *Full control of system Hiding from the Object Manager Each process is represented as an object and is interconnected with one another in the operating system. Within each process, there is a pre-allocated set of space that contains the address of the current, next, and mutex_locked thread. This vital information is listed in the EPROCESS in memory; the section in the object manager contains a double linked list of all known processes running, which is also known as the EPROCESS. However, DKOM's take advantage of this structure by modifying the front link (FLINK) to point to the previous node of the processor that we want to hide, and pointing the back link (BLINK) of the hidden processor to the previous structure.http://fluxius.handgrep.se/2011/01/02/ring-0f-fire-rootkits-and- dkom/ FlUxIuS Ring Of Fire: Rootkits. WordPress, 2 January 2011. Retrieved 5/5/2014 By modifying a subsection of the EPROCESS block, the list of currently active processes points around the hidden process. This essentially hides any paper trail of a given process or injector from the scrutiny of the scheduler because the process is hidden; yet it runs indefinitely because the thread it is in is active due to the round-robin policy. The main issue with this type of rootkit is that hidden processes are still able to run despite various context switches. In a Windows scheduler, threads are segregated to perform tasks, not processes. Rather, a thread calls multiple processes during a given time frame. This process is controlled by the round-robin nature of the scheduler and threads are put on idle to allow other threads to be active. Even though a process becomes invisible to the task manager, the process still runs concurrently with the system because the threads are active.https://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/when.malware.meets.rootkits.pdf Florio, Elia. \\"When Malware Meets Rootkits\\". Symantec, December 2005. Retrieved 5/09/2014 This makes detecting hidden processes created by the rootkit extremely difficult. Detection Detecting rootkits is separated into many complex layers that include integrity checking and behavioral detection. By checking the CPU usage, ongoing and outgoing network traffic, or the signatures of drivers, simple anti-virus tools can detect common rootkits. However, this is not the case with a kernel type rootkit. Because of how these types of rootkits can hide from the system table and event viewer, detecting them requires looking for hooked functions. Not only is this very difficult to implement, but it also requires iterating through each and every node in the EPROCESS. However, even though the presence of any malicious processes is not physically present in the handler, calls are made to it in the background. These processes point to threads, network connections points to processes, and drivers point to threads. For a DKOM rootkit to be viable, it has to hide its presence from every single reference in the EPROCESS.http://jessekornblum.com/presentations/dodcc11-2.pdf jessekornblum. Windows Memory Forensics,. KYRUS Technology, (2006). Retrieved 5/14/2014 This means that the rootkit has to routinely update any linkers to point away from itself. By iterating through each and every entity in the scheduler (threads, object headers etc), detecting a DKOM rootkit is possible. Certain memory patterns or behaviors may appear in the scheduler, and if one is found, the actual rootkit can be eventually found as well.

RP-CARS takes advantage of polarization-dependent selection rules in order to gain information about molecule orientation anisotropy and direction within the optical point spread function. CARS process Coherent anti- Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) is a non- linear process in which the energy difference of a pair of incoming photons matches the energy of the vibrational mode of a molecular bond of interest. This phonon population is coherently probed by a third photon and anti- Stokes radiation is emitted. Polarization-dependent artifacts In presence of molecular orientation anisotropy in the sample, CARS images often display artefacts due to polarization-dependent selection rules that affects the measured intensity with respect of the alignment between the polarization plane of the incident light and the main orientation plane of the molecular bonds. This is due because the four-wave mixing process is more efficient when the polarization plane of the incident light is aligned with the main orientation plane of the molecular vibrations. RP-CARS RP-CARS takes advantage of the polarization- dependent selection rules to detect the local microscopic orientation of the chemical bonds under investigation. By means of RP-CARS it is possible to visualize the degree of orientation anisotropy of selected molecular bonds and to detect their average orientation direction. It is possible by continuously rotating the orientation of the polarization plane of the incident light with a rotating waveplate and then, sequentially, for each image pixel, analysing the orientation dependence of the CARS signal intensity. This allows measuring for each pixel the average-orientation plane of the molecular bonds of interest and the degree of this spatial anisotropy in the point-spread- function volume. Applications Possible biomedical-oriented applications of this technique are related to the study of the myelin and myelopathies. Myelin is a highly ordered structure, in which many lipid- enriched, densely compacted phospholipid bilayers are spirally rolled up around the cylindrical axons. The linear acyl chains of the phospholipid molecules present a perpendicular orientation with respect to the myelin surface. Therefore, in a myelinated nerve fiber, a large number of molecular bonds are ordered around a radial axis of symmetry. Such a strong molecular anisotropy and azimuthal symmetry make RP-CARS a suitable tool to investigate neural white matter.

Filmography  Wong‚Äôs first substantial movie role was in 1972, for the movie He qi dao, in which he played Kao Chang. Using several pseudonyms, Wong appeared in multiple martial arts movies for many years. The majority of his movies are shot in China and Taiwan and spoken in his mother tongue Mandarin. With the growing popularity of Chinese kung fu films in the rest of the world, a great number of movies Wong played in were overdubbed in English, among which is the 1978 kung fu Hall Of Fame Classic Tai ji yuan gong (translated as Born Invincible), in which he plays a shaolin fighter that is trained so heavily from childhood on, that he is now impervious to weapons. With the film Yong zheng ming zhang Shao Lin men (1982. translated and released Shaolin Invincibles) he drew attention from Hollywood and he was invited to make movies there too.

Smith (May 2, 1917 ‚Äì May 31, 1991), was a jazz double bassist and music educator. Although he never pursued a solo career, and, as a result, is not often remembered by jazz historians, Smith was an important player in early jazz history as a sideman. Most notably, Smith was the bassist on Coleman Hawkins' iconic 1939 recording of \\"Body and Soul\\". The great jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie said of Smith, \\"Of all the musicians I've had the pleasure of associating with, I can say that Oscar Smith was among the most gifted. His timing and resolution were almost perfect. He helped me discover my own sense of harmony and rhythm.\\" Gillespie describes him as a sideman extraordinaire.  Life and career  W.O. Smith was born in Bartow, Georgia on May 2, 1917. When he was six months old, his family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, due to threats his father received from local white supremacists. Smith spent the remainder of his childhood in Philadelphia, graduating from Benjamin Franklin High School. He lived in the same neighbourhood as Dizzy Gillespie who moved to Philadelphia in 1935. Smith and Gillespie started out in music together, playing for the Frankie Fairfax Band until 1937, when Gillespie moved away. After attending Mastbaum Vocational School of Music and graduating from Lincoln University in 1937, Smith made his way to New York City to enroll at New York University (NYU). During this period, Smith played with some of the greats of jazz history, including Bessie Smith, Fats Waller, Dizzy Gillespie and Coleman Hawkins. Smith became a part of jazz history as the bassist on Coleman Hawkins seminal 1939 recording of \\"Body and Soul\\". In June 1942, he received his Bachelor's Degree from NYU. Smith began graduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin and ultimately earned his Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. During World War II Smith acted as the band director in the Thirty-Seventh Special Services Company, U.S. Army, stationed in Fort Huachucha, Arizona. Following his military service, he briefly returned to New York, working as a musician. During this period, Smith began his lifelong career as an educator, teaching at Seward Park High School in New York. In 1945, Smith moved to Baltimore, where he met and married Catherine Leeds in 1948. The couple had three children together: Jacqueline, Jay and Joel. In 1952, the family settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where Smith began his career on the faculty of the Tennessee State University. In 1962, Smith became the second black member in the history of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, with which he played double bass and viola for seventeen years. Smith also worked as an adjunct professor at the Blair School of Music at Vanderbilt University. In 1984 smith opened the W.O. Smith Music School in Nashville with the aim of offering musical instruction to low-income families. On inception, the school served 45 students, it has since developed into a state-of-the-art facility with over 650 students. In his memoir, Smith remembered his life as that of \\"a witness, an anonymous witness. A sideman along for the ride. A witness to the birth and growth of jazz as an American art form. A witness to the unfolding drama of the civil rights movement.\\" As he put it, \\"It has been long and interesting gig for me.\\"  Death  After a lengthy struggle with cancer, W.O. Smith died on May 31, 1991 in Nashville. Shortly before his death, Smith completed his memoir, Sideman: The Long Gig of W.O. Smith, a Memoir which was published posthumously in 1991.

Early life Enzo Ashford Zelocchi was raised between Europe and the United States, being of both Italian and French descent. His mother, Fatma, is a former dancer and grew up in France. His father, Carl Alberto, is a criminal. Fatma and Carl Alberto met in Paris and later set up a home in northern Italy, in the city of Carpi near Modena where he attended Elementary school and the A. Meucci High School. The relationship was a troubled one; and three years after Enzo's birth Fatma and Carl Alberto chose to go their separate ways. Zelocchi grew up between several homes. Paternal grandparents and uncles from his father's side were considered his main guardians during his childhood and formative years. Zelocchi has extended family, spread between New York, Kansas, New Jersey, Carpi and France. In this period he played football for the Limidi Lycans Football team, playing as external defender famous in the city for is powerful and precise free kicks. Zelocchi graduated with a degree in accounting from a private international school in Rome and moved to Milan shortly afterwards to pursue a specialty in marketing, media strategy and public relations at the IULM University of Milan. Despite excelling in his coursework, Zelocchi still lived with a deep emptiness. He began to do some modeling, became a student of the Theatre Center in Milan where the Stanislavski method was taught and performed in live theatre plays, booked commercials, indie films and eventually got a starring role in a television show for several seasons, where he felt the inspiration and fulfillment of performing and at last a sense of being \\"home.\\" His acting skill set was strongly developed when he moved back to New York and studied acting from coach Susan Batson, whose Lee Strasberg inspired method he totally connected with Zelocchi continues to hone his craft, exploring and developing his abilities as an actor. He resides in Los Angeles where his strong commitment is transforming his dreams into media marketing strategy, producing projects, and honoring his passion for acting and a professional career.

Similar to Space Invaders, the object of the game is to destroy all invading aliens while also avoiding fire.  Gameplay  The player controls a robot inside of the mobile laser cannon which is used to attack the enemy robots. The Merciless Monstroth (an eye shaped enemy that constantly moves back and forth across the top of the screen) leads the invasion force of 8 robots. Each robot has a cannon and is protected by an indestructible green shield. The shields constantly move back and forth giving both the player and the enemy the opportunity to fire. If the player's laser cannon is struck, they will be defenseless unless they retreat to under one of the three large black shields. Once the player fires, the shield will disappear and the laser cannon will reappear. If all three shields are lost, the Merciless Monstroth will engage the player until either all enemies are destroyed or the player is destroyed.

Reception Space Monster was reviewed by Video in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it was described as \\"a surprisingly innovative switcheroo on good old Space Invaders\\". Despite noting that the game has only eight attackers, the reviewers argued that the game \\"is no pushover\\", and suggested that it is a \\"unique and interesting S-F videogame\\" and that it \\"makes a nice change of pace from the usual run of space-invasion games because it is less derivative by far than most of them\\".

Its main purpose is to defend remote islands in Japanese territorial waters, specifically in the Kyushu region and south, including the islands of Okinawa prefecture. In April 2018, a new brigade modeled along the lines of the US Marine Corps was activated within the JGSDF, designated as the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade. When the new brigade is fully formed, and all troops and equipment assigned, the WAIR will be tasked as and perhaps also renamed the 1st Amphibious Rapid Deployment Regiment. The regiment is based at Sasebo in Nagasaki, in proximity to the large naval base there. History A WAIR soldier holds his binoculars while kneeling on the ground during a training mission with US Marines in Camp Pendleton. The WAIR was created on March 27, 2002, in order to defend remote islands in the western part of Japan in case of an invasion or enemy attacks, although they are also mandated to assist in search and rescue efforts in case their assistance is needed. It consists of Ranger-trained JGSDF soldiers and at the initial formation, it consisted of 600 soldiers. In August 2010, a proposal was being considered by the Japanese government to convert a conventional [battalion strength] regiment from either the 8th Division or the 15th Brigade into a \\"US-style\\" amphibious unit, effectively giving the Western Army a battalion of marines for dealing with contingencies. In 2013, troops from the Western Army Infantry Regiment deployed from the JS Hyuga and JS Shimokita for an amphibious warfare exercise in California. Possible sister unit WAIR soldiers lift inflatable rafts during a training exercise alongside a US Marine, who is serving as their Japanese interpreter. As of June 2013, as part of an ongoing expansion of defense capabilities in the Western Army's area of responsibility, the MOD were considering creating a special \\"isle assault unit\\", whose role would be the recapture of remote Japanese islands that had been invaded by a foreign power. It would share this mission with the pre- existing Western Army Infantry Regiment, itself currently undergoing an expansion in manpower and equipment (e.g. increase in authorised strength to 680 effectives, & adding (initially 4) AAVP-7A1's to its TOE). Equipment for the new unit on the other hand, may ultimately include the Maneuver Combat Vehicle and the Light-weight Combat Vehicle (LCV) System alongside MV-22 Ospreys. Its growth is part of the National Defense Programme Guidelines that were adopted by the Japanese Government in order to ascertain the JGSDF's capabilities in amphibious warfare in defending its islands in case of a future war involving Japan, which can bolster the Japanese‚ÄìAmerican military alliance. When mustered, the new unit together with the WAIR would form a major part of the Western Army's first response to a hostile incursion in the more remote parts of its AOR. New parent unit In early September 2015, plans for the creation of the new unit, now referred to as the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade were confirmed. The new unit was planned to be stood up by the end of FY2017, with a training corps to be set up in the interim (by the end of FY2016).http://www.atimes.com/article/japan-readies-first-marine- combat-brigade-since-wwii/ As part of this plan, around 300 WAIR soldiers were sent to Camp Pendleton for direct training with US Marines in 2016.Fuentes, Gidget U.S. Marines Teach Japanese Forces How to Fight From the Sea in Expanded Iron Fist Exercise January 25, 2016 USNI News Retrieved December 11, 2016 The new marine brigade (ARDB) was established on March 27, 2018, and is commanded by Major General Shinichi Aoki.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/04/08/national/ground-self- defense-force-marines-debut-much-preparatory-work-remains-done/#.XOJlIqRS-Uk Training Potential recruits for WAIR must be Ranger-qualified before they are accepted.

However, in November 2013, Netflix, partnering with Fox Television Studios (the production company for The Killing), announced it had picked up the series for a fourth and final season consisting of six episodes. Series developer and executive producer Veena Sud returned as showrunner, with Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin returning as writers and executive producers. Because they are airing on Netflix, episodes in the fourth season have a longer running time of approximately 55‚Äì59 minutes compared to 43 minutes when the series aired on AMC with commercials, and characters are able to use stronger profanity.  Casting  Cast members Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman return as detectives Sarah Linden and Stephen Holder, respectively. New series regulars for the fourth season include Joan Allen as Margaret Rayne, the head of an all-boys military academy. In February 2014, Sterling Beaumon, Levi Meaden, and Tyler Ross were cast as Lincoln Knopf, AJ Fielding, and Cameron Stanton (later changed to Kyle Stansbury), respectively; playing teens connected to the military academy. Gregg Henry, who had a recurring role in the third season as Detective Carl Reddick, was promoted to series regular for the fourth season.

Federal unemployment insurance taxes must also be paid if the household pays any number of employees a total of $1,000 or more in a calendar quarter.\\"Topic 756 - Employment Taxes for Household Employees,\\" IRS Tax Topics. State unemployment insurance taxes have the same requirement with the exceptions of California ($750), \\"California Tax Service Center publication\\" New York ($500), and Washington, D.C. ($500) have lower thresholds. The law does not allow a household employer to classify a domestic worker as an independent contractor when the employer sets the employee's schedule, dictates how duties are to be performed, and provides the tools and equipment to do the work. The nanny tax can be legally avoided by hiring someone through an agency that carries the nanny or employee on the agency's books as an employee.Jacoba Urist, \\"Should You Be Paying Taxes on Your ?,\\" New York Times, April 14, 2013.

Employers of household workers can offer benefits such as parking, public transportation, college tuition, and health insurance as non-taxable compensation.Lora Brawley, \\",\\" Nanny FAQ, November 7, 2014.  Requirements  Five steps are required to comply with nanny tax laws in most states: #The employer must establish tax accounts with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state tax agencies and obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN). Employers must also obtain a completed Form I-9 for every employee. This form is used to verify the identity and employment eligibility of a domestic worker. #Social Security, Medicare - commonly referred to as FICA taxes - and any other required state taxes may be withheld from each paycheck. If the employer is withholding, the employer may withhold 7.65% of the employee's cash wages for FICA taxes. Employers pay an FICA tax equal to the same amount.Kathleen Webb, \\"What Payroll Taxes does my Nanny Pay?,\\". Anything not withheld, other than income taxes, must be paid by the employer. Employers also pay federal unemployment taxes, which is 6% of the first $7,000 of wages per employee (commonly reduced to 0.6% when state unemployment taxes are paid on time). Household employers are not required to withhold federal and state income taxes from their employee. #The employer must file any required state unemployment insurance and state income tax returns and remit the appropriate payments to the state as required by each state. #By January 31 of each year, the employer must provide a Form W-2 to the employee and file a W-2 Copy A and W-3 with the Social Security Administration. #A Schedule H with the employer's personal income tax return (Form 1040) that summarizes the FICA taxes and federal income taxes withheld from the employee and the FICA and federal unemployment insurance taxes paid by the employer must be completed.Guy Maddalone. \\"7 Compliance Steps for Clients Who Hire Household Workers,\\" AccountingWeb, November 30, 2016. To avoid penalties for underpayment of estimated tax, the employer should ensure that sufficient funds to cover the employee and employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, federal income taxes withheld from the employee and federal unemployment taxes are paid to the IRS throughout the year, either by additional withholding on Form W-4 or via Form 1040-ES. Nanny taxes are also required in many countries outside the U.S. For example, in the UK, hiring a nanny to work in a home requires the employer to pay tax and National Insurance on behalf of the nanny or risk monthly fines of ¬£100.Emma Simon, \\"Paying tax for your nanny: Q&A;,\\" Daily Telegraph, March 26, 2012.  Employee vs. independent contractor  Under U.S. law, workers who provide services in a private home are generally classified as employees. Providing a nanny, housekeeper, or senior caregiver a Form 1099 and treating them as an independent contractor is incorrect. Misclassification ‚Äì the practice of treating an employee as an independent contractor ‚Äì is a major enforcement priority of the US Department of Labor. Household employment is a targeted field. In 2015, Wage and Hour Division investigations into misclassified workers resulted in more than $74 million in back-wage payments for more than 102,000 nationwide workers.Kathleen Webb, \\"What You Need to Know About Paying Nanny Taxes,\\" Chief Executive Magazine, February 19, 2016. Those payments, in addition to penalties and interest, were coming out of the employer‚Äôs pockets. Domestic service workers who are improperly treated as an independent contractor pay their own employment taxes, and lose the safety nets of unemployment compensation when the job ends and workers compensation insurance should they suffer a workplace injury.

Tax breaks  There are two tax breaks for child care costs: the child and dependent care credit and a pre-tax flexible spending account through the employer. The credit can be claimed by attaching Form 2441 to a personal income tax return and can reduce an employer's tax bill by $600, for one dependent, or $1,200 for two or more dependents.

Identifying monoamine oxidase and demonstrating its function in the brain early in his career, he became a prime mover in his field. In 1968 he was involved in the foundation of the British Brain Research Organization (BRA). Prior to this he helped to establish the Mental Health Research Fund, later renamed The Mental Health Foundation,(1949). He also established the Journal of Neurochemistry (1956), of which he was one of the chief editors from 1956 to 1969. He was involved in the foundation of the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) (1960), of which he became secretary-general, and the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) (1967). After leading a research unit at Whitchurch Psychiatric Hospital (1947‚Äì1960), he became director of the Medical Research Council Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton (1960‚Äì1971). Throughout his life he promoted international collaboration in research.  Biography  Richter was born in Bath, Somerset, third child of Charles A Richter, co-founder of the family firm, Bath Cabinet Makers. From Oundle School he won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he gained a first-class honour's degree in Chemistry. At Munich University he worked under Nobel Prize-winning Heinrich Wieland. In 1931 he gained a PhD (magna cum laude) for the autoxidation of aldehydes. He then moved to Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins Biochemical Laboratory at Cambridge alongside Nobel laureates Ernst Chain, Richard Synge, Frederick Sanger, Hans Krebs and Archer Martin. This was a defining period, working with Hermann Blaschko on monoamines that have great physiological interest. A year before the outbreak of World War II, he took a post at the Maudsley Hospital to work on amphetamines. Married to Beryl Ailsa Griffiths, with whom he had three children, he set up a wartime research laboratory for treating shell-shock in the Mill Hill Emergency Hospital. Despite taxing commitments, he simultaneously qualified in medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1947 Richter received a Rockefeller Foundation grant to set up a laboratory in the Whitchurch Psychiatric Hospital, Cardiff. Four years later, with one of the first Geiger counters to measure radioisotopes in the country, he and RMC Dawson had isolated nuclei from the cells of the cerebral cortex and demonstrated changes in brain metabolism with changes in brain function. With Linford Rees he carried out early work on biochemical changes concerning epilepsy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and collaborated with W. Grey-Walter in EEG studies. With Miki Gaitonde, he worked on the metabolic activity of proteins of the brain. At Carshalton, Richter gathered a multidisciplinary international group of scientists with a global approach to their research. He became involved with the World Health Organization, and Amnesty International. In retirement he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and wrote a series of humanitarian books. Typically, his last book was intended for foreign visitors. Concern for the childless women prompted him, through medical colleague Bertold Wiesner to become one of the first sperm donors at Mary Barton (Wiesner's wife)'s insemination clinic in London. Some of these children have been identified by DNA markers. Between April 1945 and 1951 he made weekly contributions at a time when AID was strictly anonymous and very controversial. It was a precursor to modern developments in reproductive technology such as IVF, that are leading to changes in the structure of families. He continued to write and edit enlightened books, gardened passionately and joined his second wife, Molly Bullock, in establishing South Lodge, a refuge in Epsom for discharged mental patients.

He was given the opportunity to complete his degree in 1970. In the 1970s, Senderov taught mathematics at the Second Mathematical School in Moscow. Toward the end of the decade, he joined the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, an anticommunist organization headed by Russian emigres, and also the International Society for Human Rights. In the 1980s, Senderov became one of the leaders of the International Society for Human Rights and one of the founders of the Free Interprofessional Association of Workers, the first labor union in the Soviet Union that sought to be free of government control. In 1982, Senderov was arrested by the KGB for publishing anticommunist articles in Russian-language newspapers printed abroad, in particular the magazine Posev (Sowing) and the newspaper Russkaya Mysl. After his arrest, Senderov openly admitted to the KGB that he was a member of the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, becoming one of just two openly avowed members of this anticommunist group in the Soviet Union. At his trial, Senderov stated that he was a member of anticommunist groups and expressed that he would continue to fight against the Soviet regime even after he was freed from incarceration. He was sentenced to 7 years of hard labor and a subsequent probationary exile of an additional 5 years. He was sent to a prison camp for political prisoners near Perm, where he spent much of his time in solitary confinement in a cold cell on rationed food for his refusal to comply with the rules of the prison camp. He refused to comply to protest the confiscation of his Bible and the prohibition against studying mathematics. In 1987, Senderov was released and, in 1988, became the leader of the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists in the Soviet Union, holding the first official press conference in this new role in 1988. During the period of perestroika, the National Alliance took an active part in supporting opposition parties. Over the course of his life, Senderov authored dozens of political articles in magazines, newspapers, and anthologies, as well as a number of mathematical works dealing with functional analysis. He also wrote three books. Death On 12 November 2014, he died at the age of 69 in Moscow. Struggle against Antisemitism In 1980, Senderov self-published with Boris Kanevsky a work titled \\"Intellectual Genocide\\" about the discrimination by Soviet universities against Jewish applicants. In particular, the work singled out the mechanical and mathematical departments at the prestigious Moscow State University. Senderov shed light on the various methods used by the university administration to dissuade and reject Jewish applicants. One method was to hand-pick the most difficult problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad and to give these problems to Jewish applicants as part of the entrance examinations - a practice that was specifically prohibited by the Soviet Ministry of Education. Another method was to select problems that could be solved given the standard high school curriculum, but whose solution required far more time than allotted for the entrance exams. In addition, admission committees would ask Jewish applicants questions that were far outside the standard high school curriculum or separate them into special groups and then find reasons to fail those groups during the more subjective oral exams. In addition to describing the various methods used to reject Jewish applicants, Senderov also provided practical advice on preparing for the types of questions often asked of such applicants and using the appeals process to fight against unfair admission decisions. In conjunction with publishing this work, Senderov became one of the founders of a set of informal courses of study under the moniker of \\"Jewish National University\\", where well-known mathematicians gave lectures to applicants who had been denied admission to Moscow State University for being Jewish.

The legend has its origin in a mid-12th century French manuscript written by Hermann de Tournai, which tells how a party of canons from the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Laon, France, witnessed a five-headed dragon destroy the church and much of the town. Although well- documented, the legend is little-known in the town of its origin. Legend synopsis In Hermann de Tournai's account, a party of nine canons on a fund- raising tour from Laon Cathedral arrive at the town of Christchurch during a torrential rainstorm. They seek shelter at the local minster church but are rejected by the dean, who claims that the doors of the newly built church are not yet secure. In truth, the dean is concerned that their shrine and holy relics of the Virgin Mary would collect more offerings than his own altars. Being the Saturday after Pentecost, the canons have arrived on the eve of the town's annual fair, so all the inns and lodging houses are full with merchants. However, one group of merchants kindly vacate their rooms in a newly built lodging house. The merchants then attend mass held at the house by the canons and agree to shun the church. That night the canons tend to a poor herdsman's daughter who had been born with a deformed foot. The girl spends the night in prayer before the canons‚Äô portable altar and the following morning her foot is found to be miraculously healed. Later that morning the merchants all go to the fair. The canons depart from the town, but before they have travelled very far they are overtaken by two horsemen who tell them that the town is being set ablaze by a terrible dragon that had flown in from the sea. Eager to see this incredible spectacle, the canons race back to Christchurch. The dragon is seen to be incredibly long and have five heads from which it breathes sulphurous flames. It is setting houses alight one by one, but the canons are astonished to find that the lodging house and herdsman's shelter are both completely unscathed and their occupants are safe inside. The kindly merchants have also all escaped unharmed, having departed from the fair early, before the dragon had appeared. However, the church where the canons had been denied shelter has been entirely destroyed. The uncharitable dean is seen trying to save all his most valuable possessions by loading them on board a boat on the nearby river, but the dragon then swoops down and reduces the boat and everything on board to ashes. The repentant dean subsequently prostrates himself before the canon's shrine and prays to be forgiven for all the wrong he had done. History The background story to the canons‚Äô visit is described in Monodies (Book 3), a contemporary document written by Guibert de Nogent. This mentions the fund-raising journeys undertaken by the canons of Laon after the cathedral of Notre-Dame was badly damaged by fire during a civil uprising at Easter in 1112. In Chapter XIII Guibert refers to the burning of an unnamed English town visited by the canons, but he ascribes this to lightning heaven-sent as a punishment for the ungodly behaviour of the inhabitants and makes no mention of a dragon. In the mid-12th century, Herman de Laon, otherwise Hermann de Tournai, a retired Flemish Abbot, elaborated on the canons‚Äô English journey in De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudunensis (Of the Miracles of St Mary of Laon). Two short chapters describe the events that took place in \\"a town called Christikerca\\", though Hermann replaces Guibert de Nogent's lightning with a five-headed dragon. Hermann's account was reproduced in the Patrologia Latina (Vol 156, Col 979-982) published by Jacques-Paul Migne in the 19th century. In the early 13th century the story was retold in rhyming couplets by Prior Gautier de Coincy, a French poet-composer. An illustrated manuscript of this work, Miracles de Notre-Dame et Autres Po√©sies de Gautier de Coinci, which features depictions of the dragon flying over the town and river (Folio 210v), is held in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. In the early 14th century the story appeared in the Nikolaus Saga written by Bergr Sokkason, an Icelandic monk and scholar. He probably had access to earlier Latin and Icelandic versions of the story. It was subsequently reproduced in other Icelandic sagas. Some key details of Hermann de Tournai's account are confirmed by the Christchurch Priory cartulary, the bulk of which was compiled by 1372. It records that the Holy Trinity minster church was undergoing major reconstruction instigated in about 1094 by Ranulf Flambard. It also confirms that an annual fair was held a week after Pentecost on the feast day of the church, which only later became known as Trinity Sunday. It indicates that the dean in 1113 was the self- serving Peter de Oglander, who \\"imbued with evil intent, took away for himself all things set aside by ancient custom for the work of the church\\". However, the cartulary makes no mention of the church being badly damaged during construction. Modern era In 1933 John Strong Perry Tatlock, a specialist on medieval literature at the University of California, examined Hermann de Tournai's text and asserted that he could find nothing that contradicted the presumed date of 1113 for the canons‚Äô journey. In 1985 much of Hermann de Tournai's account was translated by English folklorist Jeremy Harte. This is thought to be the earliest translation of Hermann de Tournai's text into English. A more recent translation (in French) of Hermann de Tournai's account appears in Les Miracles de Sainte Marie de Laon by Alain Saint-Denis (2008). Saint-Denis calculates the date of the dragon's appearance to be Sunday 1 June 1113. In May 2013 the 900th anniversary of the dragon's appearance in Christchurch was commemorated by a locally organised Christchurch Dragon Festival with contributions by local schools, the Christchurch Chamber of Trade & Commerce, Christchurch Library, and the Red House Museum. On 1 June 2013, the five-headed dragon was mentioned in Search for Christchurch, a poem especially written by performance poet Elvis McGonagall and read by him at the official reopening of the newly refurbished Christchurch Library and Learning Centre. Explanation There is no accepted explanation for the Christchurch Dragon. However, the references to an abnormally violent rainstorm accompanied by lightning bears a resemblance to the Great Thunderstorm on Dartmoor in 1638. This has led to the speculation, supported by Christopher Chatfield, Deputy Director of the Ball Lightning Research Division of TORRO (Tornado & Storm Research Organisation), that the canons of Laon may have witnessed a rare example of prolonged ball lightning.

Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. He also testified at the trials of Casey Anthony and Phil Spector, the 1996 civil trial against O.J. Simpson, and consulted on the investigation of JonBen√©t Ramsey's 1996 death. He wrote and with his son Daniel co-edited the book Spitz and Fisher's Medicolegal Investigation of Death: Guidelines for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigation. Biography Werner Spitz was born in 1926 to Siegfried and Anna Spitz in Stargard, Germany (now Poland); both of his parents were physicians. Given the growing antisemitism in Germany, his family fled to Mandatory Palestine when he was a child. Spitz's father got Werner as a youth a job working in a medical examiner's office, where he was charged with cleaning and other small duties. Spitz eventually began assisting with the autopsies. He recalls assisting with the autopsy of Morris Meyerson in 1951; he was the husband of Golda Meir, the future Israeli politician and Prime Minister. Spitz returned to Europe for medical school, where he started studies at Geneva University in Switzerland. After he had been four years in Geneva, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem established the university's Medical School and Spitz transferred there. He received his medical doctorate after an additional three years of studies and clinical work. He graduated at the age of 27. Spitz immigrated to America in 1959. His decision to leave his native Israel was partly inspired by the lack of regional need for his chosen career path. \\"In seven years in Israel, there was only one murder.\\" He said. \\"It just wasn't the right place for a forensic pathologist.\\" Spitz later served as Deputy Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, Maryland, and Chief Medical Examiner for Wayne County, Michigan (Wayne County includes the city of Detroit). There he made many controversial changes, and in 1976 he was charged with taking parts from bodies without getting permission from the next of kin, privately charging for his services, and improperly conducting ballistic experiments on dead bodies. Although Spitz admitted some of the charges, the Wayne County Prosecutor declined to prosecute him, saying that \\"He was just being a doctor.\\" Work as a forensic pathologist In 1969, Spitz testified on behalf of Joseph and Gwen Kopechne, the parents of Mary Jo Kopechne, who died following a car accident in the vehicle of Ted Kennedy at Chappaquiddick Island. Kopechne was presumed to have died from drowning after Kennedy's car swerved off a small bridge and plunged into the water. Kopechne's parents were seeking to prevent her body from being exhumed and autopsied. Spitz testified that the autopsy was unnecessary, and the available evidence was sufficient to conclude that Kopechne died from drowning. The judge sided with Kopechne's parents and denied the request for exhumation. In 1970, while Spitz was the deputy chief medical examiner for Maryland, he determined that Sister Cathy Cesnik, a 26-year-old Catholic nun who disappeared in November 1969, had been murdered by a blow to the head. In 1994, a witness came forward and said a priest took her as a young teen, to see Cesnik's body shortly after she had gone missing. She said that he was threatening her not to say anything about the sexual abuse that was allegedly occurring at her Catholic school. The witness told police she remembered maggots on Cesnik's corpse, but was not believed. The police said that maggots were unlikely in November. However, in 2016, when Spitz's original autopsy was made public, it had documented that there were maggots present. Werner confirmed this when interviewed for the 2017 Netflix series The Keepers, about Cesnik's murder. In 1975, Spitz was asked to work as an advisor to both the Rockefeller Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations. He reviewed the autopsy performed 12 years earlier on president John F. Kennedy by military pathologists. \\"They botched that autopsy,\\" Spitz said. \\"They had absolutely no experience in forensic pathology.\\" He attributed the flaws in the investigation to the fact that at that time in the United States, forensic pathology was in its infancy. Despite his conclusion that the original investigation was flawed, he agreed with the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the shooting. In 1979, Spitz consulted with the same committees on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. The committee determined that King was killed by one rifle shot by James Earl Ray. In 2011, Spitz testified for the defense in the trial of Casey Anthony for the death of her daughter, Caylee. He disagreed with the prosecution's medical examiner Jan Garavaglia, who had said that the death could be ruled as a homicide based on the autopsy, and described her work as \\"shoddy\\". Garavaglia acknowledged that the cause of death could not be ascertained by the autopsy she performed, but ruled the death a homicide based on the circumstances. Spitz criticized her for failing to open the skull and test sediment found in the skull; he believed that was proof that Caylee had decomposed while lying on her side, rather than the position in which she was found. He disagreed with the state's theory that duct tape found next to Caylee's body was used as a murder weapon, saying it is much more likely that the duct tape was placed after her death to hold the mandible in place when moving the body. He also believes that the placement of Caylee's hair was staged by someone before being photographed. In a CBS Detroit interview on September 2016 and in the documentary series The Case of: JonBen√©t Ramsey (2016), Spitz accused Burke Ramsey of killing his sister, although the pathologist had not performed an autopsy of the girl. On October 6, 2016, Burke filed a defamation lawsuit against Spitz, seeking a total of $150 million in damages since Burke had never been considered a suspect by the Boulder police. In 2003, DNA evidence found from an unidentified male appeared to have cleared each family member from suspicion, as their DNA was excluded from matching. New testing in 2016 revealed there was DNA from two persons other than JonBen√©t Ramsey. Spitz is a professor of pathology at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan and an adjunct professor of pathology at the University of Windsor in Canada.

Yachi received his master's degree at the University of Tokyo Graduate School for Law and Politics in 1969. He entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, retiring in 2008. His service in the Foreign Ministry included work in the Asian Affairs Bureau, the Treaties Bureau, the North American Affairs Bureau, and the Japanese delegations to the Philippines, the European Community, and the United States. He served as Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2005 to 2008. Yachi was a foreign policy advisor to Shinzo Abe in Abe's 2006‚Äì2007 stint as Prime Minister. When Abe became Prime Minister again in late 2012, he selected Yachi to be a special advisor to his cabinet. He was appointed the first head of the NSC upon its creation in December 2013. Career Yachi was a self-described outlier in the risk-averse Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was influenced by Wakaizumi Kei, an international politics thinker who acted as Prime Minister Eisaku Sato's emissary for the negotiation of secret protocols allowing the US to introduce or station nuclear weapons in Japanese territory. According to an author, Yachi has engaged extensively in secret diplomacy under Abe. Yachi has taught at Waseda University, Sophia University, Seinan Gakuin University, Keio University, and Chuo University. From June 2012 to December 2013, he was a director for the Fujitsu corporation. One of Yachi's first tasks as National Security Advisor was to strengthen the new NSC's relations with the American government.

Caller confidentiality Kaan Pete Roi does not share any caller details outside the organization. The organization's policy is not to ask the callers for any information relating to their identities and all the volunteers sign a very strict confidentiality agreement. If callers involuntarily disclose traceable personal information, volunteers are strictly asked not to note down anything of that nature. Kaan Pete Roi realizes that it is often easier to seek help knowing that the callers would not be subject to any scrutiny. The volunteers are trained to make it clear that they require no information about the person but are there just to talk. This works not only to protect the caller's identity but helps him or her open up more, knowing that they can hang up anytime and not have to answer questions. Volunteer confidentiality Kaan Pete Roi volunteers are asked not to disclose their own names or identities and are discouraged from forging a relationship with their callers.

The purpose of a hit-and-run DDoS is to prevent a user of a service from using that service by bringing down the host server. This type of attack is to be distinguished from a persistent DDoS attack which continues until the attacker stops the attack or the host server is able to defend against it. Method of attack A DDoS attack is characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. A hit-and-run DDoS is accomplished by using high volume network or application attacks in short bursts. The attacks only last long enough to bring down the server hosting the service, normally 20 to 60 minutes. The attack is then repeated every 12 to 24 hours over a period of days or weeks, causing issues for the company hosting the service. Hit-and-run DDoS is sometimes used as a test DDoS attack. An attacker will inject a few bad packets into a network to test if it is online and functioning. Once the network is verified as functioning, an attacker will then use a persistent DDoS attack. Hit-and-run DDoS exploits anti-DDoS software and services which are used to defend against prolonged DDoS attacks. Activating such software can take longer than the actual attack, allowing a denial of service before DDoS protection can start to defend from the attack.

Several of the bills transfer federal lands to state or local governments. The bill also addresses cattle grazing. The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Federal lands are lands in the United States for which ownership is claimed by the U.S. federal government. As of March 2012, out of the 2.27 billion acres in the country, about 28% of the total is owned by individuals represented by the federal government according to the Interior Department.Lipton, Eric, and Clifford Krauss, \\"Giving Reins to the States Over Drilling\\", New York Times, August 23, 2012. Retrieved 2012-08-26. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. Title I, Escambia County, Florida Formerly the original Title I would authorize Escambia County in Florida to convey certain property that it received from the federal government. The specified properties had been part of the Santa Rosa Island National Monument and were transferred to the county in 1947 for public purposes. As a condition of that conveyance, Escambia County can reconvey the properties to the federal government or to the State of Florida. Title I would remove that condition and add new conditions. First, any conveyance of the specified properties would require the county to convey to Santa Rosa County any of the property that falls within the jurisdictional boundaries of Santa Rosa County. Second, any proceeds above the direct or incidental costs from conveyances would be transferred to the federal government. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing title I would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information provided by the National Park Service (NPS) and local government entities, CBO estimates that the proceeds from any conveyances would be used to cover those costs. Title II, Anchorage, Alaska Formerly Title II would require the Secretary of the Interior to convey the reversionary interest of the United States in three acres of land to the city of Anchorage, Alaska. Under current law, the city holds title to those lands and will retain title as long as the lands are used for public purposes. If the city stops using the lands for such purposes, title would revert to the federal government. Based on information provided by the city of Anchorage, CBO expects that, under current law, the city would continue to use the affected lands for public purposes and hold title to those lands over the next 10 years. Furthermore, under title II, any administrative costs associated with conveying the reversionary interest in those lands would be paid by the city; therefore, CBO estimates that implementing title II would have no effect on the federal budget. Title III, Fernley, Nevada Formerly Title III would direct the Secretary of the Interior to sell up to 9,400 acres of federal land to the city of Fernley, Nevada. Based on information provided by the city, CBO estimates that enacting that provision would increase offsetting receipts, which are treated as reductions in direct spending, by $5 million over the 2014-2024 period. Under title III, if the city offered to purchase any of the affected lands, the Secretary would be required to sell the lands for fair market value. CBO expects that the city would only offer to purchase the lands if a private developer provided the amounts necessary to complete those purchases. Based on information provided by the city, CBO expects that up to 25 percent of the affected lands would be purchased over the 2014-2024 period. We estimate that the average value of those lands would be about $3,500 per acre, based on the value of similar lands in the area. Tile IV, Database of BLM Lands Formerly Title IV would prohibit Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from acquiring new lands until the agency develops a public database of all BLM lands that have been identified for disposal. Based on information provided by BLM, CBO expects that the agency would need less than a year to construct the database, and we expect that the agency would defer the purchase of some lands during that period. Because, under current law, BLM has the authority to spend receipts from the sale of federal lands in southern Nevada to purchase environmentally sensitive lands, CBO estimates that enacting title IV would reduce direct spending by about $7 million in 2015 and increase direct spending by that amount in 2016. Overall, we estimate that enacting title IV would have no net impact on direct spending. Title V, Cape Hatteras National Seashore Formerly Title V would require the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina to be managed according to the Interim Protected Species Management Strategy/Environmental Assessment (Interim Strategy) issued by the National Park Service (NPS) on June 13, 2007, until the NPS issues a new final rule. Under the bill, that final rule could not include additional restrictions on pedestrian or motorized access to the seashore beyond those in the Interim Strategy unless the restrictions are based on peer-reviewed science and the public has had the opportunity to review and comment on them. Title V also would prohibit implementation of the existing final rule entitled \\"Special Regulations, Areas of the National Park System, Cape Hatteras National Seashore‚ÄîOff-Road Vehicle Management\\" and would invalidate the consent decree concerning use of off-road vehicles at the seashore, which was filed on April 30, 2008. Based on information provided by the NPS, CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would cost about $2 million over the 2014-2019 period, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. Those costs would be incurred as management of the seashore transitioned to the Interim Strategy and the new final rule is developed. CBO estimates that enacting title V also would affect direct spending. Under the existing final rule, the NPS charges fees (which are recorded in the budget as offsetting receipts) for off-road vehicle permits. Those fees are available to be spent without further appropriation. Those fees are not a part of the Interim Strategy; therefore, under title V, the NPS would collect fewer fees. However, CBO estimates that the net impact on the budget of that change would not be significant. Title VI, Green Mountain Lookout Formerly Title VI would prevent the United States Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in Washington state unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors. Based on information provided by the Forest Service, CBO estimates that implementing title VI would have no significant net impact on the federal budget. In 2012, a federal court ordered the Forest Service to remove a lookout structure from Green Mountain, located in the wilderness area. Under title VI, the agency would be authorized to remove the structure only if it poses a risk to public safety. Because the lookout was recently reconstructed, CBO expects that, under title VI, the agency would allow the structure to remain on the mountain for several years. As a result, CBO estimates, the Forest Service would not need to spend about $200,000 in appropriated funds to remove the structure; the amounts required to maintain the structure over the next five years would be minimal. Title VII, Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks Formerly Title VII would nullify within three years of enactment existing regulations prohibiting hand- propelled vessels on streams and rivers in the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Title VII also would direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to coordinate the use of hand- propelled vessels on the Gros Ventre River within the National Elk Refuge in Wyoming. Under existing regulations, the National Park Service prohibits boating on five of the 168 lakes in Yellowstone National Park and a 1,000-foot section of the Snake River in Grand Teton National Park. Based on information provided by the Department of the Interior, CBO estimates that implementing title VII would cost about $4 million over the 2014-2019 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds to conduct resource studies, promulgate new rules, and manage boating in the newly opened areas. Title VIII, Federal Grazing Lands Formerly Title VIII would increase the term of new grazing permits on federal lands from 10 years to 20 years and allow expired and transferred grazing permits to remain in effect until new permits are issued by BLM or the Forest Service. Based on information provided by the affected agencies, CBO estimates that enacting that provision would have a minimal impact on offsetting receipts each year because those agencies have the authority under current law to extend expired permits. The bill would allow the affected agencies to collect offsetting receipts from transferred permits sooner than it would under current law. Because title VIII would allow transferred permits to remain in effect under the terms of the original permit until that permit expires, CBO expects that the agencies would receive fewer requests for new permits in the next few years; however, because those permits would need to be renewed in later years, CBO estimates that implementing the provision would have no significant net effect on agencies' workloads over the 2014-2019 period. Finally, title VIII would exclude certain grazing lands from compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and would exempt certain renewed or transferred grazing permits from NEPA requirements. CBO estimates that those provisions would have no effect on discretionary spending because we expect that any funds not spent on NEPA activities on those lands would be spent to reduce the agencies' backlog of incomplete NEPA activities on other federal lands. Title IX, Stanislaus National Forest Formerly Satellite image of the Rim Fire, August 23, 2013 The sale of timber from damaged trees due to this fire would be affected by Title IX of this bill. Title IX would direct the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to conduct salvage sales of dead, damaged, or downed timber resulting from the 2013 Rim Fire in California. Sales of salvage timber under title IX would be exempted from certain laws related to the environment and forest management. In addition, sales conducted under title IX would not be subject to administrative or judicial review. CBO estimates that implementing title IX would have no significant net impact on the federal budget. Under current law, we expect that the Forest Service will sell significant amounts of salvage timber from areas affected by the 2013 Rim Fire over the next several years. In addition, based on information provided by the Forest Service, CBO expects that other factors, including a lack of manufacturing capacity and hazardous weather conditions in the affected areas, will prevent the agency from significantly increasing the amount of salvage timber sold under the bill. Finally, CBO expects that any increase in the amount of salvage timber sold in the affected areas would be partially offset by reductions in the sale of such timber in other national forests. Title X, Chesapeake Bay Formerly Title X would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop, no later than one year after the bill's enactment, a management plan for the Chesapeake Bay Program and for restoration activities related to the bay. EPA would be required to update the management plan every two years. The legislation would require new financial reports on the Chesapeake Bay Program from the Office of Management and Budget and would require EPA to appoint an independent evaluator, who would review and report to the Congress on the plan. Based on information from EPA, CBO estimates that implementing this legislation would cost about $1 million annually over the 2015-2019 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Procedural history H.R. 2954 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on August 1, 2013 under the long title \\"To authorize Escambia County, Florida, to convey certain property that was formerly part of Santa Rosa Island National Monument and that was conveyed to Escambia County subject to restrictions on use and reconveyance.\\" The bill was introduced by Rep. Jeff Miller (R, FL-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and then to the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. It was ordered reported by voice vote by the committee on October 30, 2013 and was reported alongside House Report 113-296 on December 16, 2013. On February 4, 2014, the United States House Committee on Rules passed House Resolution 472. The resolution merged the original H.R. 2954 with nine other land use bills as one omnibus bill. The Rules Committee changed the name of H.R. 2954 to the Public Access and Lands Improvement Act. The bill passed the House on February 6, 2014, with a vote of 220-194. Debate and discussion Overall, President Barack Obama's administration opposes most of the bill. However, Obama did not threaten to veto the bill. The White House announced in a Statement of Administration Policy that it opposed Title VII of the bill, a portion that would allow paddle boats into additional areas of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. According to The Hill, the White House did not say why it opposed this, but \\"the White House is likely bothered by the idea of Congress using legislation to strike down two federal regulations.\\" Supporters of Title VII argued that changing the rules about paddle boats would be a good thing. Rep. Rob Bishop indicated that the rules had originally been intended to stop overfishing years ago. Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) argued that \\"recreational activities like paddling are a terrific, low-impact way to enjoy the outdoors.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2954 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2954 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2954 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2954 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2954 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Public Access and Lands Improvement Act"},{"id":"41863356","text":"Park Chung-il (Î∞ïÏ†ïÏùº, born November 19, 1959) is a South Korean footballer.

Design and development The Poppenhausen was an enlarged, tandem two-seat version of the single seat Schleicher Hols der Teufel. It was developed by Alexander Schleicher for production in his factory in the Wasserkuppe valley, though it is likely that Hans Jacobs, joint chief designer with Alexander Lippisch of the single seater was involved. The Poppenhausen first flew in 1928. The Poppenhausen had a simple, constant-chord wing much like that of the Hols der Teufel though of 16% greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. Its broad, constant chord ailerons were longer than those of the Hols der Teufel, ending at the blunt, rounded tips. The wing was supported over the fuselage by two vertical cabane struts, one on each side of the forward cockpit and a single, vertical strut centrally behind the rear cockpit. Two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about 40% of the span. The Poppenhausen had a light nacelle fuselage extending well behind the wing trailing edge and ending at a forward leaning vertical knife edge. The forward cockpit was largely ahead of the leading edge and the rear one under the wing. Behind the wing the fuselage had the same flat, cross braced girder form as the Hols der Teufel, with a horizontal upper beam, its first diagonal brace within the nacelle. The tailplane was mounted on top of the horizontal beam, its leading edge straight and strongly swept. Cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, balanced, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Poppenhausen landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts. Operational history thumb After its first flight in 1928 Schleicher used the Poppenhausen to introduce passengers to soaring flight. It then appeared in the company catalogue, significantly modified for production; it could be fitted with dual controls and used as an advanced trainer. In the early 1930s the idea that a two- seater, though over twice the price of a single seat primary glider like the Z√∂gling, could still train pilots from the beginning sufficiently faster to be economically competitive, and safer, lay in the future. Production numbers are hard to establish; one appeared in the UK on the BGA register, used by the London Gliding Club from 1930 to at least 1933. One was exported to Australia in 1931, though it may have been destroyed in a hangar fire before flying.

It stars Ryan Reynolds, Ben Mendelsohn, Sienna Miller, Analeigh Tipton, Robin Weigert, and Alfre Woodard. The film was released by A24 on September 25, 2015. Plot Gerry, a struggling gambler and real estate agent, meets Curtis, an itinerant younger gambler, at a casino in Dubuque, Iowa. Curtis buys Gerry a drink; at a bar hours later, Gerry sees Curtis and returns the favor, leading to a night of heavy drinking. After an unsuccessful real estate showing, Gerry goes to a dog track with Curtis. They win a large bet, which Gerry gambles away. At a bar, they drunkenly attempt to bet $1,000 on a game of pool and are kicked out. Curtis explains to Gerry that \\"Machu Picchu time\\" is approaching ‚Äì a phrase he uses whenever he leaves town. In the parking lot, Gerry is stabbed in an attempted mugging. Gerry‚Äôs loan shark, Sam, threatens him to pay the money he owes her. Running into Curtis, Gerry proposes a gambling trip down the Mississippi River culminating in a New Orleans poker game with a $25,000 buy-in. Curtis agrees, spotting Gerry $2,000. Before hitting the road, Gerry steals the petty cash from his office. They arrive in St. Louis, where Curtis reunites with Simone, a prostitute. After Gerry‚Äôs successful poker session on a riverboat casino, he and Curtis spend the night with Simone and fellow prostitute Vanessa. While Gerry bonds with Vanessa, Simone reminds Curtis she has been taken advantage of by a gambler before, and remains unwilling to run away with him. In Memphis, Gerry plays well at Texas Hold 'em but loses everything on the final \\"river\\" card. He lies to Curtis that he won $7,000, and asks to go to Little Rock to see his ex-wife Dorothy and estranged daughter. Gerry finds his daughter is at school; Dorothy catches him trying to steal money, and asks him to leave. Curtis and Gerry visit a casino in Tunica, Mississippi, where Curtis' VIP card is rejected; asking Gerry for money, Curtis discovers his lie. Disappointed in him, Curtis provokes strangers in the bathroom into assaulting Gerry, who admits to his problems with money, and his belief that Curtis is his good luck charm. Reaching New Orleans, they sell Gerry‚Äôs car and go to a horse race, losing almost all their money on a longshot. Curtis sends Gerry away with money for a bus ticket home, then collects his winnings, having bet on a different horse instead. Gerry fails to talk his way into the high-stakes poker game and is punched in the nose, as is Curtis for antagonizing strangers in a pickup basketball game. Curtis visits his mother Cherry, a cabaret performer, leaving her his winnings. At a casino, Gerry bets the last of his money on roulette and wins. Curtis arrives at Gerry‚Äôs blackjack table and loses his remaining money, but Gerry shares his chips. Their winnings continue to grow as they play craps, and Simone calls Curtis, who proclaims his love for her. Convinced they cannot lose, Gerry and Curtis bet their entire $285,000. Over an expensive dinner, Gerry and Curtis discuss their plans, having won a half-million dollars. In the morning, Curtis finds Gerry has gone, leaving Curtis‚Äô half of the money with a note: \\"It‚Äôs Machu Picchu time\\". Curtis flirts with the hotel clerk; asked if he is going anywhere special, Curtis replies, \\"Peru\\". In the final scene, Gerry re-purchases his car from the dealer he sold it to, telling the man he ‚Äúgot lucky.‚Äù Sitting in his own car again, he turns it on and hears the gambling tips CD he left in the stereo. As the tape describes the tell of a confident player (sitting back, relaxed shoulders), Gerry slouches as an American flag can be seen reflected upside down in the windshield.

Architecture  520x520px Fully deployed, Druid runs as a cluster of specialized processes (called nodes in Druid) to support a fault-tolerant architectureDruid Project Documentation where data is stored redundantly, and there is no single point of failure.Yang, Fangjin; Tschetter, Eric; L√©aut√©, Xavier; Ray, Nelson; Merlino, Gian; Ganguli, Deep. \\"Druid: A Real-time Analytical Data Store\\", Metamarkets, retrieved 6 February 2014 The cluster includes external dependencies for coordination (Apache ZooKeeper), metadata storage (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Derby), and a deep storage facility (e.g. HDFS, or Amazon S3) for permanent data backup.  Query management  Client queries first hit broker nodes, which forward them to the appropriate data nodes (either historical or real-time). Since Druid segments may be partitioned, an incoming query can require data from multiple segments and partitions (or shards) stored on different nodes in the cluster. Brokers are able to learn which nodes have the required data, and also merge partial results before returning the aggregated result.  Cluster management  Operations relating to data management in historical nodes are overseen by coordinator nodes. Apache ZooKeeper is used to register all nodes, manage certain aspects of internode communications, and provide for leader elections.

He was previously nominated to serve as the United States Assistant Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The Senate ultimately failed to confirm his nomination. The Fraternal Order of Police objected vehemently to a brief he filed arguing that there was racial discrimination in jury selection for the trial of Mumia Abu- Jamal, who was convicted of the murder of a law enforcement officer. Adegbile also worked for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and as a senior counsel on the staff of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. On December 15, 2016, the White House nominated Adegbile to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. This position does not require senate confirmation.  Early life and education  Born Adebowale Patrick Akande Adegbile in New York City, Adegbile is the son of a Nigerian father and an Irish immigrant mother. He was raised by his single mother. He also was a child actor on the children's TV show Sesame Street during the 1970s, playing the character Debo and performing in episodes for nine years. Adegbile studied at Lehman College in 1986 and 1987 and earned a bachelor's degree in 1991 from Connecticut College. He then earned a J.D. degree from New York University School of Law in 1994.  Professional career  During law school, Adegbile served as a legal assistant in the summer of 1991 for the New York law firm Solin & Breindel and then was a summer associate during the summer of 1992 for Morrison & Foerster. In the summer of 1993, Adegbile served as a summer associate for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. He then joined the firm full-time as an associate in the firm's litigation department in 1994, holding that position until 2001. In 2001, Adegbile joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, where he served as assistant counsel from 2001 until 2004, associate director of litigation from 2004 until 2007, director of litigation from 2007 until 2010, associate director-counsel/director of litigation from 2010 until 2014, acting president and director counsel from 2012 until 2013, and special counsel in 2013. Adegbile argued his first case before the United States Supreme Court in 2008, making a defense of the Voting Rights Act.  Consideration for the D.C. Circuit  In October 2011, blogger Ed Whelan reported that the White House was considering nominating Adegbile to one of three vacancies at the time on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Shortly thereafter, The Washington Post reported that President Obama had asked the American Bar Association to evaluate Adegbile's credentials, but the White House did not submit his name.  Nomination to be Assistant Attorney General  In 2013, Adegbile joined the staff of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary as a senior counsel with a focus on legislative matters. On November 18, 2013, President Obama nominated Adegbile to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, to succeed Thomas Perez, who had left the position to serve as United States Secretary of Labor. U.S Senators from both parties objected to Adegbile's signing of an appeal for Black Panther member Mumia Abu-Jamal who was convicted in 1982 for the first-degree murder of Daniel Faulkner, a Philadelphia police officer, on December 9, 1981. Mumia Abu-Jamal was sentenced to death, although the death sentence later was vacated because of problems with jury instructions. Adegbile and other lawyers filed an unsuccessful amicus curiae brief with the United States Supreme Court in 2009, arguing that the conviction was invalid because of racial discrimination in jury selection. In January 2014, Adegbile's nomination was returned to Obama, who renominated Adegbile within days. On February 6, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary reported Adegbile's nomination to the full Senate in a 10‚Äì8, party-line vote. On February 27, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on Adegbile's nomination, in an effort to cut off a filibuster by Republican senators. On March 5, 2014, the U.S. Senate failed to advance Adegbile's nomination in a 47‚Äì52 vote blocking his confirmation. Senate Republicans unanimously voted against him, particularly because of his appeal for Abu-Jamal, along with seven Democratic Senators, including Abu-Jamal's home state senator, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. On September 15, 2014, Adegbile announced his withdrawal as a nominee to be assistant attorney general, and that he would be going into private practice, joining the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.  Appointment to be a Commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights  On December 15, 2016, President Barack Obama announced his appointment of Debo P. Adegbile to the United States Commission on Civil Rights.  Personal life  Adegbile's first name \\"Adebowale\\" means \\"crown comes home\\" in Yoruba. He is married to Susan Haskell-Adegbile, and they live in New York City with their two daughters, Sela and Devan.

Although much of his work was destroyed in the war, the facade of the post office building next to the station still stands. He is also remembered for his work on the Bremer Marktplatz, traces of which remain in the Rathscaf√©.  Biography  Born in Elberfeld, after completing his studies as an architect he moved to Bremen at the beginning of the 20th century when, thanks to the city's prosperity, many new buildings were being planned. In 1905, Jacobs won a competition for the construction of a building on the market place, now known as the Rathscaf√©. It was successfully completed in 1911 in the Reform architecture style.

It is a Category A listed building.  History  Bannockburn House was built in the late 17th Century, with slight alterations added in the 19th Century. The house was most probably commissioned by Sir Hugh Paterson in 1675, whose son and grandson were made Baronets of that house. Hugh Paterson, the builder of the house, was a lawyer and a factor for the Earl of Moray. He had coal mines near Bannockburn, managed by William Rob, known as the \\"coal- grieve\\". Rob was dismissed for fraud and in 1677 made two attempts to sabotage the works in revenge. The Privy Council ordered the Earl of Mar and Lord Elphinstone to investigate.HMC Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), p. 208. In the year of 1746, prior to the Battle of Culloden, Hugh Paterson 2nd Baronet entertained Charles Edward Stuart in Bannockburn House, where he met the Baronet's niece, Clementina Walkinshaw, who would later become his lover and mother of his child.Kybert, Susan Maclean (1988), Bonnie Prince Charlie: An Autobiography, London: Unwin. p. 186 When the house passed to the 2nd Baronet's daughter, Mary, in 1787, she sold the property to William Ramsey of Barnton and Sauchie. The house stayed in the Ramsey Family until it came to Sir James Ramsey Gibson-Maitland, who sold it to Alexander Wilson in 1883. Alexander was a member of the famous Bannockburn weaving family of Wilson. Alexander made many additions and changes to the house, including a new porch entrance and extension to the library and office, and above the main doorway a recess to accommodate a coat of arms which now is empty. Bannockburn House Doocot In 1910 Bannockburn House was sold to the Sheriff Substitute of Stirling at the time, James Mitchell. In 1962 Mitchell's daughter sold the house, after living in it for 32 years. She sold the house to the multi- property owning millionaire A.E Pickard. The house was formerly owned by Peter Drake. It was placed on the market for sale in February 2016. A local charitable Community Trust was formed to try and purchase the house for the community and for the people of Scotland. Their aim is to safeguard the property for future generations. It was announced in April 2017 that the Trust had secured an exclusive right to buy the property and were actively fundraising to raise the required funds. This was achieved in November 2017 with a mixture of public money and grants. The house and estate have been used as a filming location for Susan Hill's Ghost Story, an adaptation of her novel, The Small Hand, shown on Channel 5 on Boxing Day 2019. The film stars Douglas Henshall and Louise Lombard. Events In August 2018 the Trust planned to hold an excavation in the grounds. Dr Murray Cook was due to lead the survey.

Most of his works are lost. He advocated for the view that the House of Stuart would found the Last World Empire of prophetic tradition.Arthur H. Williamson, George Buchanan, Civic Virtue and Commerce: European Imperialism and Its Sixteenth-Century Critics, The Scottish Historical Review Vol. 75, No. 199, Part 1 (Apr. 1996) , pp. 20‚Äì37, at p. 34. Published by: Edinburgh University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25530707 Life He was the only son of William Maxwell of Little Airds, and grandson of William Maxwell of Kirkconnell, Kirkcudbrightshire, man-at-arms to James V of Scotland, and also in the service of his queen, Mary of Guise, and of his daughter, Mary Queen of Scots. He was educated at Edinburgh University, where he graduated M.A. 29 July 1600. In his Edinburgh time he was a follower of John Napier. He then went abroad. Maxwell lived in London for a period, and renounced Calvinism in 1607, adopting a conservative religious viewpoint. He spent time in the Tower of London from the middle of 1620 to February 1621, after publishing a pamphlet against the claim of the Elector Palatine to Bohemia. This slant towards the House of Habsburg, at the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, put paid to Maxwell's hopes of advancement in England, and in particular of a post he coveted, historian in Chelsea College. He then returned to the continent of Europe. Around 1630 Maxwell had been working as genealogist to Philip IV of Spain. On 30 April 1631 he wrote from Brussels to Archbishop William Laud, complaining of threats of assassination because he would not forsake Protestantism. Emperor Ferdinand II had, he declared, commanded his presence at court, and offered him spiritual preferment, with the office of imperial antiquary and genealogist, and a pension of a thousand crowns after the death of Sebastian Tegnangel. (Tegnangel in fact died in 1636.) In recompense for his books written in defence of the Church of England against the Puritans, and towards finishing one on the king's genealogy, he asked for a lay prebend. Gilbert Blackhall commented on Scots of this period who had spurned offers from the Spanish king, and their lack of Habsburg prospects (and may have had Maxwell in mind). Court patronage generally dried up in Brussels after 1633. Works Maxwell dealt in his publications with religion, history, genealogy, and antiquarian research, as well as poetry. His style has been compared to that of Sir Thomas Urquhart, and earned from Laud the nickname \\"Mountebank Maxwell\\". He identified with a neo-Platonic tradition, against Aristotelianism: Plato and Hermes Trismegistus, but also Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino, and Franciscus Patricius. Admirable and Notable Prophecies Admirable and Notable PropheciesAdmirable and Notable Prophecies, vttered in former time by 24. famous Romain-Catholickes, concerning the Church of Romes defection, Tribulation, and reformation. Written first in Latine, & now published in the English tongue, both by James Maxwell, a Researcher of Antiquities, London, by Ed. Allde, 1615. (1615) has been called Maxwell's \\"most substantial\\" publication, and touches on a wide range of prophetic material. He had been evolving, since the death of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, a prophetic future around Prince Charles, Henry's brother. In his 1612 memorial work for Prince Henry, Maxwell also flattered Prince Charles with a far-fetched comparison to Skanderbeg, relying on the equation of Albania with Albany. The following year, as Charles's sister Elizabeth married, he put a flattering turn on a well-known prophecy of Johann Carion about Emperor Charles V, for the benefit of Prince Charles. Carion by misprision had revived an older prophecy of Alexander of Roes (c.1280), intended to apply to Charles of Anjou and his claim to become Emperor. Admirable and Notable Prophecies of 1615 shifted ground somewhat. It is a history of prophecy from Hildegard of Bingen to Nostradamus, with emphasis on Joachim of Fiore. Supporting the House of Stuart's imperial claim, Maxwell cites here a shortened form of the Second Charlemagne prophecy, in the form given to it by Telesphorus of Cosenza, which was originally a pro-French slant on the Last Emperor. In this work he correspondingly places less emphasis on the Magdeburg (Carion) prophecy as applied to Prince Charles; but it was later picked up and reinforced by the Anglo-Saxon scholar William Retchford. After Charles I's execution, William Lilly, who knew the prophecy as given currency by Maxwell's work, was concerned in Monarchy or No Monarchy (1651) to argue that it did not apply to \\"Charles II of Scotland\\". Maxwell argues that the apostasy of the Catholic Church can be read from Catholic authors. He also goes back to Carion, through a Latin version of Hermann Bonus, to pick up a related Magdeburg prophecy on the reformation of the Roman Catholic Church. He believed that this change could be non-violent; and that Charles was a fit person to retake Constantinople, restoring the Eastern Roman Empire. Opposing the Ottoman Empire as he did, he supported also the House of Habsburg. Maxwell found both a popular audience for verse summaries of his ideas, and some learned sympathy with Henry Spelman, Matthew Sutcliffe, and Patrick Young. Other works While in France in 1600 Maxwell wrote in Latin Tyrannidi- graphia Ecclesi√¶ militantis secundum Danielis Prophetiam. It was dedicated to Edinburgh University and sent, but was lost on the way, by John Welsh of Ayr. Among his productions is a poem entitled Carolanna, for the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619;Carolanna, That is to say, a Poeme in honovr of ovr King Charles ‚Äì James, Qveene Anne, And Prince Charles: But principally in honour of the immortall memory of our late noble & good Queene of Albion and Vnion, London, by Ed.

The main campus is located in Accra. UPSA is the first university in Ghana to provide both academic and business professional education. The University of Professional Studies Act, 2012 (Act 850) changed the name of the Institute of Professional Studies to University of Professional Studies. UPSA is nationally and internationally accredited by the National Accreditation Board (Ghana) and the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) respectively. It introduced the dual qualification scheme for its students ahead of the 2019/20 academic year. With this new system, the students will be required to complete a chartered program such as the ACCA, ICAG, CIM, CIMA, ICSA and others, by the end of their degree study to better enhance their chances of employment in the job market. History The university was founded in 1965 as a private professional business education tuition provider and was taken over by government in 1978 by the Institute of Professional Studies Decree, 1978 (SMCD 200). It was subsequently established as a tertiary institution with a mandate to provide tertiary and professional education in Accountancy, Management and other related areas of study by the Institute of Professional Studies Act, (Act 566), 1999. Front view of UPS Administration Block The then IPS had been offering tuition for business professional programmes. In September 2005, the then institute introduced bachelor's degree programmes to give meaning to the IPS Act 566. It received a Presidential Charter in September 2008, conferring on it the status of a fully-fledged public university. The University offers undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in several programmes. The development of the programmes coupled with trends in tertiary education at both local and international levels called for an amendment of the existing Act 566 of 1999. Subsequently, the University of Professional Studies Act, 2012 (ACT 850) was enacted to rename the institute as University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA). UPSA has recently introduced ‚Äúdual qualification scheme‚Äù for student for the 2019/2020 academic year. The policy is to make students who enroll in a degree programme to simultaneously and compulsorily pursue a corresponding professional programme such as ACCA, ICAG, CIM, CIMA, ICSA among others as an additional course thus graduating with both a degree and a chartered certificate. Vice-Chancellor, Professor Abednego Feehi Okoe Amartey explained the new policy at the 11th Congregation of the University . In September 2020, President Nana Akufo-Addo commissioned a 500-seat capacity artificial stadium (AstroTurf) in UPSA. The sod for the stadium was cut in July 2019 and constructed by Wembley Sports Construction Company Limited. Aside the artificial football pitch, the facility houses spectator stands with a VIP area, changing rooms, washrooms, storage spaces, flood lighting and Sports Directorate offices for the University. The Vice-Chancellor indicated that the facility is accessible for use by the community.

He later included in his definition methods and techniques which are designed to automatically measure and track health information \\"demand\\" (e.g., by analyzing search queries) as well as \\"supply\\" (e.g., by analyzing postings on webpages, in blogs, and news articles, for example through GPHIN) on the Internet with the overarching goal of informing public health policy and practice.

She lived in a small home near the Monumento a La Raza in Mexico City. She died on March 13, 2017 at the age of 90.Fallece artista mexicana Sarah Jim√©nez Vern√≠s Career Although she studied sculpture during her time at La Esmeralda, her artistic career was mostly focused on engraving with some drawing and painting. In 1954 she participated in the creation of a mural at the Escuela Belisario Dominguez, with her section dealing with the dead soldier of the Mexican Revolution. During this time her father died but she completed her work before heading to C√≥rdoba to pay her respects. Jim√©nez Vern√≠s began exhibiting her work in 1957. She joined the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular (TGP) in 1963, when that organization was at its height, entering with friend Adolfo Quintero. What she liked about the TGP was the contact with workers, farmers and students that the artists had. Much of her work with the organization was related to making flyers and other announcements for political events and for unions. She left the organization four years later in 1967, shortly before the death of Leopoldo M√©ndez, because of internal conflicts. However, she still believes that it or something like it is still needed in Mexico to speak for poor workers. After leaving the Taller, Jim√©nez Vern√≠s began a teaching career, first at the Escuela de Iniciaci√≥n Art√≠stica N√∫m 1 run by INBA and then at the Casa del Lago in Chapultepec Park, from which she retired in 1989. Her work has been shown in both Mexico and abroad with major exhibitions at the Biennial of Liubliana, Yugoslavia in 1957, the Casa de las Am√©ricas in Havana in 1960, the Biennial of Chile in 1965, the Second Triennial in Contemporary Dry Point in P√≠o de Capri, Italy in 1972 and a collective tribute to Leopoldo M√©ndez. She received grants for her work from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes for four years. The artist‚Äôs work can be found in public and private collections in both Mexico and abroad, especially in the United States and Europe. She sold most of her works in Texas to raise money for the medical bills of one of her sisters. For this reason a number of important pieces, are in this state, for example her famous portrait of Emiliano Zapata, which is at the Marion Koogler McNay Museum in San Antonio. The National Museum of Mexican Art also holds work of hers. The Museo Nacional de la Estampa in Mexico City holds a series of works she did in the 1960s in Havana on the Cuban Revolution. Although she was admitted to the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, along with various other artists of the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular, her work became forgotten in the latter 20th century. There have been efforts to revive interest in it. In 2008, her work was featured at the Museo Mural Diego Rivera to help promote women artists of Frida Kahlo‚Äôs generation. In 2014, the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana held a retrospective of her work of over fifty works, which was then sent to tour in her native state of Coahuila. Artistry Jim√©nez Vern√≠s has mostly specialized in graphic works, as part of her political activity. In her youth, her work was very confrontational. She never belonged to a political party but her graphic work reflects the ideals of the left. Her work focuses on social, political and economic issues especially those related to farmers and workers. She traveled Mexico extensively to capture images related to the daily life of the country. Jim√©nez Vern√≠s believed that the work of organizations like the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular is necessary, but says most artists are no longer interested in social and political work.

He ruled during the Late Classic Period, from 767‚Äì780 AD. Ha º K ºin Xook was a son of Itzam K ºan Ahk II, and he ascended the throne following the death of his brother, Yo ºnal Ahk III. Ha º K ºin Xook's reign ended with either his death or his abdication in favor of his brother K ºinich Yat Ahk II; archaeologists and Mayanists have not arrived at a clear consensus. Ha º K ºin Xook left behind several monuments, including stelae at Piedras Negras and a stone fragment from El Porvenir. In addition, a stone seat known as Throne 1 and erected by K ºinich Yat Ahk II records either the death or abdication of Ha º K ºin Xook. Biography=Reign of Piedras Negras 250px Ha º K ºin Xook, who has also been referred to as Ruler 6,Clancy (2009), pp. 140‚Äì141. was likely the son of Itzam K ºan Ahk II, based on a translation of Stela 23.Pitts (2011), pp. 157‚Äì161. According to both Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube, as well as Scott Johnson, Ha º K ºin Xook's name translates to \\"Water Sun Shark\\". (His name notably does not feature a turtle glyph, a feature found in all the previous rulers of Piedras Negras, as well as his successor.)Clancy (2009), p. 141. He ascended the throne on February 14, 767 AD (9.16.16.0.4, 7 K ºan 17 Pop in the Long Count), following the death of his brother Yo ºnal Ahk III.Sharer & Traxler (2005), p. 428. The Mayanist Tatiana Proskouriakoff had initially overlooked Ha º K ºin Xook's reign, as she mistakenly assigned the title Ruler 6 to a sajal (or lesser Maya leader) of La Mar, based on a misreading of Stela 16. Not much is known about either Ha º K ºin Xook or his predecessor Yo ºnal Ahk III, which led Flora Clancy to refer to both their reigns as \\"shadowy\\".Clancy (2009), p. 135. James L. Fitzsimmons argues that, politically, Ha º K ºin Xook was a weak leader, who like Yo ºnal Ahk III before him erected only a handful of monuments and did not enforce his power beyond the existing Piedras Negras hegemony.Fitzsimmons (2010), p. 154. According to the stone monuments that he did raise, Ha º K ºin Xook's reign was comparatively quiet, as the only notable event recorded was the burial of a contemporary sajal at San Ignacio, Belize (El Cayo). According to Zachary Nathan Nelson, the reign of Ha º K ºin Xook was also relatively free from war, as none of his extant stelae show representation of captives, and records do not indicate any sort of \\"bellicose action\\" in the region during his reign.Nelson (2005), p. 35. Death or abdication Ha º K ºin Xook's reign ended on March 24, 780 AD (9.17.9.5.11 10 Chuwen 19 Sip), but the reason why it ended has been a topic of debate. Throne 1, when translated, notes that Ha º K ºin Xook \\"abandoned/transferred rulership\\" (yaktaaj ajawlel),Martin & Grube (2000), p. 151. which American Mayanist Stephen D. Houston interprets to mean that he abdicated so that his brother, K ºinich Yat Ahk II, could take the throne. Mayanist David Stuart also noted that the wording on the throne \\"implies a more active event on the ruler's part\\", but that \\"'lose' might be more neutral as far as an interpretation goes.\\"Zender (n.d.). However, yaktaaj ajawlel is the same wording found on a monument, Zoomorph G, at Quirigu√°, Guatemala, which details the death of the ajaw K ºak º Tiliw Chan Yopaat in AD 785.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 222. This is possible evidence that, rather than abdicating, Ha º K ºin Xook died in 780 AD, and K ºinich Yat Ahk II took up rule later. Adding to this hypothesis is the testimony on Throne 1, which notes that K ºinich Yat Ahk II later \\"remembered\\" Ha º K ºin Xook in some way, and that the new king may have even wept at Ha º K ºin Xook's memory, according to anthropologist Oswaldo Chinchilla Mazariegos.Clancy (2009), p. 152. Regardless, K ºinich Yat Ahk II took up the throne on May 31, 781 AD (9.17.10.9.4 1 K ºan 7 Yaxk ºin), almost a year after Ha º K ºin Xook's reign officially ended. Despite this lengthy gap, there is no evidence that anyone ruled Piedras Negras in the interim. Monuments=Stelae Ha º K ºin Xook raised up several stelae, including Stelae 13, 18, and 23. Stela 23, erected in AD 767, was the first to be raised, and it served as the king's accession monument.Clancy (2009), pp. 145‚Äì146. This stela details a puluuy utz ºitil (\\"passing of the torch\\")Fitzsimmons (2009), p. 152. ceremony for Itzam K ºan Ahk II, and, when translated, reads \\"Ruler 6 [Ha º K ºin Xook], child of Ruler 4 [Itzam K ºan Ahk II] ‚Ä¶ acceded to the rulership\\", seemingly proving that Ha º K ºin Xook was indeed the offspring of Itzam K ºan Ahk II. This stela originally featured carvings on all four of its sides, but at some point in the past, it tipped over and crumbled. Mostly only the stela's base and parts of a panel featuring the feet of two individuals remain today. Erected in AD 771, Stela 13 was Ha º K ºin Xook's second monument and features the only extant carving of the ajaw. According to O'Neil, it \\"captures the essence of the period-ending celebration.\\" This tall stela retains elements of other \\"niche\\" stelae, but it also shows innovations and differences from the standard style.O'Neil (2014), p. 142. It depicts the king dispersing incense, similar to iconography found on Piedras Negras Stelae 2 and 32. Clancy has argued that the iconography on the stela revolves around three motifs: \\"divination, the quest, and accession\\". Divinationa motif that had been introduced in the iconography of Piedras Negras by K ºinich Yo ºnal Ahk IIis shown via the act of Ha º K ºin Xook dispersing the incense. The stela also features Ha º K ºin Xook wearing a headdress composed of \\"three knots and forehead scrolls, the projecting Water Lily Jaguar ... and the flexible rectangular emblem made of a thick net and a jaguar pelt\\". It has been postulated that this headdress was inspired by a similar headdress featured on Stela 5.Clancy (2009), p. 143. Clancy argues that this headdress is a representation of \\"the royal theme of quest\\", due to its iconographic similarity to other stelae at Piedras Negras.Clancy (2009), p. 144. Not much remains of the king's final monument, Stela 18, which was raised in AD 775. The stela is heavily eroded, but archaeologist Sylvanus Morley claimed that it expressed a Calendar Round date of 6 Ahaw 13 K ºayab (corresponding to a Long Count date of 9.17.5.0.0 or Dec. 27, 775), which is within Ha º K ºin Xook's reign. Stelae 13 and 18 were discovered by Teoberto Maler in 1901 near Pyramid O-13. Stela 13 was possibly erected on a terrace reached by the pyramid's main stairway, and Stela 18 lies in a row on the plaza in front of the aforementioned stairway.Weeks et al. (2005), p. 23. Pyramid O-13 was most likely the burial place for Itzam K ºan Ahk II, and was revered by Ha º K ºin Xook, Yo ºnal Ahk III, and K ºinich Yat Ahk II as \\"a dynastic shrine\\".Martin & Grube (2000), p. 150. Stela 23, unlike the others, was erected at the very base of Pyramid O-12. Other As mentioned before, Throne 1 details either the death or abdication of Ha º K ºin Xook. After the fall of Piedras Negras, the thronewhich was not constructed by the king himself, but rather by his successor, K ºinich Yat Ahk IIwas smashed, likely by Piedras Negras's enemies (although it has since been reconstructed). In addition to on-site remains and relics, an artifact known as the \\"El Porvenir Fragment\\" was discoveredas its name suggestsat El Porvenir and bears the name of Ha º K ºin Xook.Teufel (2004), p. 215.

The film, produced by Basil Wright and directed by Max Anderson, was well received. Production The Harvest Shall Come was entirely filmed on location, including the interior scenes. The film was mostly shot at Hill House Farm, Needham Market in Suffolk. Other scenes were filmed at Badley Hall and in Willisham. Many of the extras were local people. The 33-minute documentary, with music by William Alwyn, was sponsored by the Ministry of Information. The Harvest Shall Come was made for Imperial Chemical Industries, and makes the case for fertilizing the soil to improve productivity. Synopsis The opening titles appear over scenes of farm workers stacking hay. The film opens in 1900 when Tom Grimwood as a boy leaves his family cottage carrying his trunk to take a job on a farm for a weekly wage of 2/6 plus keep. The commentary notes that farm workers receive the lowest pay and worst housing of all workers, but that there had been improvements since 1870. Tom is taught to work the plough, the harrow and other horse-drawn machinery, and learns skills such as milking and scything. At the age of 21 Tom gets a new job, which pays 14/- a week and comes with a run-down cottage, so he can afford to marry his sweetheart. The film moves forward to a scene where the couple have three small children, but still have no sink in the cottage. In World War I (1914‚Äì18) farm workers manage to gain better wages. After the war, despite the promises of politicians, wages sink to just 30/- per week. Although Tom wants to leave for a better job, he cannot afford to move from the cottage. The film shows that in the interwar period standards of living in the country generally improved, but agricultural wages declined when imported corn depressed prices. Tom is laid off for a while and forced to dig ditches \\"on relief\\". His son decides to move to the town, where there are better opportunities. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 imports are restricted and as much land as possible must be brought under cultivation. Agricultural labor conditions improve again and wages rise to 60/- a week, although prices also rise. A radio announcer says that the government will look after farm workers. Tom's wife is skeptical, saying \\"They said all that in the last war\\". The film ends with scenes illustrating the importance of agriculture around the world. Reception The Spectator said the film was \\"an excellent piece of work, notable for its effective and truthful presentation of the vital subject of life in this country on the land.\\" The Harvest Shall Come was named \\"Documentary of the Month\\" by Documentary News Letter, which called it \\"the first genuine story film made with the documentary purpose and by documentary method.\\" It praised Max Anderson as one of the best documentary makers to appear for many years and called John Slater \\"an outstanding interpreter of working class character.\\" Sir Arthur Elton of the films division of the Ministry of Information said in 1943 that the film was one of the best documentary films that had been produced.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in February 2014. A director's cut of the game, self-published by Necrophone Games, was released for the PlayStation 4 in September 2016, and for personal computer platforms in June 2017.  Gameplay  Jazzpunk is a single-player, first-person adventure game, focusing on exploration and comedy over puzzle-solving. Each mission has one central objective, but the player is free to explore the game world at their own pace, which is populated with a large number of interactive NPCs, each with their own action or gag. Mini- games, including mini-golf, a Frogger clone, and a version of Duck Hunt in which the player pelts cardboard ducks with slices of bread from a toaster, also feature prominently in the game's storyline. The game also features a minigame, titled \\"Wedding Qake\\", in which players try to shoot AI-controlled enemies with wedding-themed weaponry, including wedding cake, roses, and champagne corks, in a Quake deathmatch-style contest.  Plot  The game is centered on a top-secret espionage agency operating out of an abandoned subway station in a fictional place called Japanada in the late 1950s in an retro- futuristic, alternate reality where Japan conquered most of North America. The player takes the role of Polyblank, a silent protagonist. The game begins when Polyblank is mailed to the espionage agency in a human-shaped suitcase. He is then given several missions by the head of the organization, all of which begin by ingesting a dose of prescription medicine. The missions assigned to Polyblank are almost always bizarre and nonsensical, relying heavily on free association and references to older movies and video games. Tasks include degaussing and smuggling pigeons, assassinating cowboys, cross-dressing, killing a pig with a ukulele, and photocopying Polyblank's buttocks to fool a security scanner, this also can be done by taking a photo off of the wall. The first mission begins with Polyblank having to infiltrate a Soviet consulate to recover a data cartridge, the second to go to a sushi restaurant to steal a cowboy's artificial kidney. On the way back from the sushi restaurant, Polyblank is intercepted by agents telling him to 'hand over the wetware', but he escapes. The Director then states that Polyblank should take a holiday while they wait for things to die down. When Polyblank gets to Kai Tak Resort for his holiday, he receives a phone call telling him he has to find the syndicate man (The Editor) on site and switch briefcases with him. Polyblank succeeds, but then passes out after drinking a cocktail. Polyblank wakes up in a hotel room at night with a message telling him to come to the rear pool. In the empty rear pool, Polyblank talks to a man who tells him the resort is a simulation, and to get out he must find, kill and cook the mechanical pig. After doing this, and navigating an electric maze, Polyblank finds himself back in the subway station, only to find the Director and his secretary are cardboard cutouts. He then finds an audio message from the Editor telling him if he wants to see them again he should come to his house. Polyblank goes there, and he is told he must beat the Editor in a game of sport for the Director to be freed. Polyblank loses, and so must find prizes for the Editor. Polyblank does this, inflating the Editor's ego (which inflates the Editor physically), then he pops the Editor with a needle. Polyblank then finds the Director, where to free him he must either press one of two buttons. No matter which Polyblank presses, the Director turns into a crocodile and eats Polyblank. The credits take place in the Director's intestines, and then Polyblank is given special tablets to help him get out. The game ends after Polyblank takes the pills.  Development  In an interview with Kotaku, developers Luis Hernandez and Jess Brouse stated that the game was originally intended to be a serious game with moments of comic relief thrown in, but that the team liked the comic aspects so much that they changed the entire game into a comedy. The game was originally created as a prototype in 2007, running on a standalone engine. The project was then transferred to Torque3D before being transferred to the Unity game engine, on which the final build was created. Most voices are performed by Hernandez; additional voice acting is provided by Zo√´ Quinn, Olivia Catroppa, Jim Sterling and Chris Huth. Alongside the Director's Cut on PC in 2017, a DLC was also released, titled Flavour Nexus, which includes a \\"lost chapter\\".  Influences  According to interviews with staff at Necrophone Games, Jazzpunk is a combination of the creators' favourite literature, movies, and music from the spy, cyberpunk, and film noir genres. The game makes many references to older movies, including Blade Runner, Alien, and Evil Dead II. In early 2014, the authors appeared in an interview conducted by Rock, Paper, Shotgun in which they stated that their idea for a short-form comedy game was partially influenced by the success of the original Portal. During this interview, the staff also mentioned that much of the game's writing was influenced by 1980's cyberpunk literature. The game's unique, cartoony art style was influenced by the work of Saul Bass, Josef Albers, and Gerd Arntz, while the music was composed using audio production methods common in the 1950s and 1960s. The game's visual elements are also quite similar to Thirty Flights of Loving, whose developer Brendon Chung is thanked in the end credits.  Reception  Jazzpunk received favourable reviews from critics on launch, earning a 9/10 from Eurogamer, a 7/10 from Destructoid, and a Metacritic score of 75/100.

He belonged to the first generation of Indian Modernists closely associated with Chandigarh and the developmentalist practices of postcolonial India under Jawaharlal Nehru. He designed over 60 buildings all in north India. His paintings are held in private collections worldwide. His architecture and art adhered strictly to modernist principles. As an academic, he was one of the earliest Indian champions of sustainable urbanism. He published two booksPrakash, Aditya Reflections on Chandigarh Navyug Traders, New Delhi, 1983, and Prakash, Aditya Chandigarh ‚Äì a presentation in free verse Marg Publications, Bombay, 1975 and several papers on this topic. Early life Prakash began studying architecture at the Delhi Polytechnic (now School of Planning and Architecture) in 1945. In the middle of his course, India's independence forced the English faculty leading the Polytechnic to return to England. At their suggestion, Prakash also moved to London in August 1947 and began to attend evening classes in architecture at the London Polytechnic (now Bartlett), while working with W. W. Woods. After becoming an A.R.I.B.A. in 1951, Prakash moved to Glasgow where he briefly worked and studied art at the Glasgow School of Art, before joining the Chandigarh Capital Project team as Junior Architect on 1 November 1952. The Chandigarh Capital Project Team The Chandigarh team was headed by Pierre Jeanneret, Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, under Le Corbusier's overall leadership. The European were supported by an Indian staff of about 60 people. Jeanneret, Fry and Drew were the 'Senior Architects', and Le Corbusier had the title of 'Architectural Advisor'. There were nine Indian 'Junior Architects' and 'Junior Town Planners'. These were M. N. Sharma, A.R. Prabhawalkar, B. P Mathur, Piloo Moody, U.E.Chowdhary, J. L. Malhotra, J.S. Dethe, N.S. Lamba, MS. Randhawa, R.R.Handa and Aditya Prakash.Prakash, Vikramaditya Chandigarh's Le Corbusier ‚Äì The Struggle for Modernity in Postcolonial India University of Washington Press, Seattle, 2002 P.L. Verma was the Chief Engineer, and P.N. Thapar (ICS) was the Chief Administrator of the Project. According to Aditya Prakash the Capital Project Office was strictly hierarchical, but one in which there was an \\"open environment\\" where projects were \\"explored in their own right\\". There was a steady atmosphere of research which allowed Prakash to make his own observations which were welcomed by Le Corbusier, even if they stood to potentially challenge him. Prakash explained: \\"Le Corbusier wanted to show a modern democratic India, and he succeeds by using equal elements to create a rippling, beautiful rhythm. He was rather brash and impatient ‚Äì he treated us like uninitiated children ‚Äì but he helped us to realize our own country.\\" Working with Le Corbusier Initially Prakash worked under Jane Drew on the design of the General Hospital and some of the housing of Chandigarh. After that he was given his own design jobs beginning with the District Courts in Sector 17. Conducted under the supervision of Pierre Jeanneret, this project transformed Prakash's design approach prompting him to rethinking architecture and urbanism as a \\"system\\". On the design of the Tagore Theatre, Pierre Jeanneret preferred Prakash's design over his own. Prakash felt indebted to Jeanneret for his large-heartedness and humility.Khan, Hassan- Uddin, Bienart, Julian, Charles, Chorrea Le Corbusier ‚Äì Chandigarh and the Modern City, Mapin Publishing, Ahmedabad, 2009 In 1952 Aditya Prakash was assigned to work with Le Corbusier on the design of the School of Art. The process of designing this building with Le Corbusier, especially the rhythm of the piers and the section, was a formative experience in Aditya Prakash's career.Prakash, Aditya Working with the Master Inside Outside, Apr/May 1985 Death Prakash died on a train in Ratlam, India, on his way to perform in a play called Zindagi Retire Nahi Hoti. Personal life Aditya Prakash is survived by his wife Savitri Prakash and three children. His son, Vikramaditya Prakash is a notable architectural historian and a scholar at the University of Washington, Seattle. The Aditya Prakash Foundation is based in Chandigarh with a central focus on advancing the understanding of the heritage of Modern Architecture. It is maintained and run by the family and has also been involved in many academic projects related to Chandigarh. Career Prakash worked in the Chandigarh Capital Project Office from 1952 to 1963. During this time he designed several public buildings in Chandigarh, including the District Courts Building in Sector 17, the Jang Garh (Marriage Hall) in Sector 23, the Indo Swiss Training Centre in Sector 30, the Government of India Textbook Press in Industrial Area Phase ‚Äì 1, The Central Craft Institute in Sector 11, The Tagore Theatre in Sector 18, the Chandigarh College of Architecture in Sector 12, the Architecture \\"Corbu\\" Hostel in Sector 12 and the Behl House in Sector 18. He was also responsible for creating the Frame Control of Chandigarh.Prakash, Aditya Living Architectural Controls Vol 15. Issue No.1; December 1961. p.39-41 One of Aditya Prakash's key designs was that of the Chandigarh College of Architecture (CCA) which was based on the design of Le Corbusier's Chandigarh College of Art. The budget allocated to CCA was smaller than that for the College of Art. To meet the reduced budget, Prakash decided to scale down the whole building. To do this he had to study Le Corbusier's Modulor, and he created a new 'Indian Modulor' adjusting the original dimensions to fit the Indian brick size.Chalana, Manish, and Tyler S. Sprague. Beyond Le Corbusier and the modernist city: reframing Chandigarh's ‚ÄòWorld Heritage‚Äôlegacy. Planning Perspectives 28, no. 2 (2013): 199‚Äì222. Prakash was closely associated with the design of theatres in Chandigarh. He designed the basic forms of Chandigarh‚Äôs KC Theatre, Neelam Theatre and Jagat Cinema. His most significant project in Chandigarh was the Tagore Theatre which he designed in 1961 for the centenary of an Indian poet and philosopher Dr. Rabindranath Tagore. This building was designed on strict functionalist lines focused on the interior spaces and their acoustic and visual order. The Tagore Theatre became involved in controversy when it was completely gutted and made into an auditorium by another local architect.Not'Tagore Theatre', Please The Hindustan Times (newspaper), Chandigarh, India, September 2008 From 1963 Aditya Prakash moved to Ludhiana to design the new Punjab Agricultural University. Agricultural universities \\"that formed the academic core of this transnational transfer of knowledge\\". During this time he became very interested in architectural photography and acquired a Rolliflex TLR and an Argus C3 to photograph his buildings under construction. Here the square frame of the Rolliflex frames the views and the rectangle of the Argus directs the eye out towards the landscape. In 1968, Aditya Prakash returned to Chandigarh as the Principal of the Chandigarh College of Architecture. Early in the 1970s Prakash became an ardent champion of sustainable architecture and urbanism, as what he called 'self-sustaining settlements'. He published several articles and wrote a critique of Chandigarh planning under this title. He also studied the villages surrounding ChandigarhPrakash, Aditya, Rakesh, Sharma Improving the Chandigarh's Peripheral Villages Ekistics ‚Äì the Problem and Science of Human Settlements, Community And Home, Vol 39, Number 235, June 1975 and the informal sector of the city, particularly the 'rehris' or mobile carts.Prakash, Aditya. 1974.

This \\"strategy manifests itself through the 'frame' as the organizing element of the city, producing an intersection of gridlines that are superimposed onto the various scales that comprise the public realm\\". \\"The building frame scale is regulated by Chandigarh's architectural controls, which are broken into four main categories. Along the V2 streets and in the commercial city center, a system of architectural and construction controls were placed on all buildings. Residential and commercial structures along the V4 market streets are regulated by full architectural controls. Residential plots up to 10 marla in size are governed by frame controls concerning the fa√ßade. Schematic controls are applied to special purpose buildings like petrol pumps and cinemas that do not fall under other categories.\\"Prakash, Vikramaditya Commercialization, Globalization and the Modernist City: The Chandigarh Experience. University of Washington Chandigarh Urban lab, 2011. *Self-Sustaining Urbanism ‚Äì Aditya Prakash described the planning in Chandigarh as ‚Äúescapist‚Äù and championed the idea of self-sustaining cities with ‚Äúextensive recycling, mixed-use developments, stimulation of the informal sector, integration of agriculture and animal husbandry into the urban system, and rigorous separation of motorised and all forms of non-motorised traffic.‚Äù *Rehris or the Mobile Shops ‚Äì These are informal markets and mobile shops that Prakash strongly advocated to be included in the design of the city. *Linear city ‚Äì The design proposal for Haryana was one where Prakash sought to empower the pedestrians by proposing to raise the vehicular transit by about 10 to 12 feet above the main road network. In his opinion, that would give the pedestrian and the non-motorized vehicles the necessary relief in an otherwise vehicle intense route. The central part of the sector was important to him as he envisioned a completely self-sustaining city. He commented: ‚ÄúIt is important for a city to be self-sustaining in terms of free air, water and the basic necessities like food. All the waste materials of the city can come to this particular area to get recycled, even excess water for that matter‚Ä¶. The informal sector can also be utilized for animal husbandry to a lesser degree.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Texts and Buildings by Aditya Prakash on Architexturez South Asia * The Aditya Prakash Foundation Website *Finding aid for the Aditya Prakash fonds, Canadian Centre for Architecture (digitized items) Category:1924 births Category:2008 deaths Category:20th-century Indian architects Category:People from Muzaffarnagar district Category:Alumni of The Bartlett Category:Artists from Uttar Pradesh ","title":"Aditya Prakash (architect)"},{"id":"41864066","text":"Christy Prior (born 28 November 1988) is a snowboarder from New Zealand.

Description  Initiated in 2006 and currently funded by NIH Grant number: 1R24EB029173 ,NIH To Build Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources ClearinghouseNIH Contracts With TCG To Build The Neuroinformatics Tools And Resources Clearinghouse NITRC's mission is to provide a user-friendly knowledge environment that enables the distribution, enhancement, and adoption of neuroimaging tools and resources and has expanded from MR to Imaging Genomics, EEG/MEG, PET/SPECT, CT, optical imaging, clinical neuroinformatics, and computational neuroscience. Supporting 143,000 page views per month, NITRC's 1,000+ tools and resources have been downloaded over 11.4 million times by 1.4 million users. NITRC's goal is to support researchers dedicated to enhancing, adopting, distributing, and contributing to the evolution of previously funded neuroimaging analysis tools and resources for broader community use. Promoting software tools, workflows, resources, vocabularies, test data, and pre-processed, community-generated images through its Image Repository (NITRC-IR), NITRC gives researchers greater and more efficient access to the tools and resources they need; better categorizing and organizing existing tools and resources via a controlled vocabulary; facilitating interactions between researchers and developers through forums, direct email contact, ratings and reviews; and promoting better use through enhanced documentation.  Approach  To meet the disparate needs of neuroimaging informatics developers and researchers, NITRC offers collaborative functionality like that found in platforms such as GitHub and SourceForge. To provide such functionality, we customized the open-source GForge project. Thus, within NITRC, each tool or resource has the option to offer descriptive content as well as use MediaWiki, CVS/SVN, bug tracking, news, and forums to distribute information and downloads. Housed on NITRC servers and linked out to existing Web sites, NITRC is the source for neuroimaging informatics tools and resources. Launched in 2007 with an agile programming schedule, the NITRC team continues to prioritize and implement functional and design enhancements to make the Web site even more accessible. While the scientific scope expands so do NITRC's Enhanced Services, which include its Image Repository to support image data sharing and its Computational Environment service on Amazon Marketplace to support the execution of complex computational analysis of image data.  Services  The Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) suite of services include: thumb NITRC Resource Repository (NITRC-R) is the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù collaboration environment that enables the worldwide distribution, enhancement, and adoption of neuroinformatics tools and resources. NITRC-R's scientific scope includes MR, PET/SPECT, CT, EEG/MEG, optical imaging, clinical neuroinformatics, imaging genomics, and most recently, computational neuroscience. thumb NITRC Image Repository (NITRC-IR), built on XNAT, is a curated repository of DICOM and NIfTI scanned images searchable by metadata such as diagnosis, handedness, gender, or group. NITRC-IR datasets include: Functional Connectomes, Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), Sample, ADHD-200, Beijing Eyes Open Eyes Shut. thumb NITRC Computational Environment (NITRC-CE) is a virtual big data compute service pre-configured with popular neuroimaging software analysis tools allowing pay-as-you-go compute time. Using AWS EC2, and leveraging NeuroDebian, NITRC-CENITRC Computational Environment and NITRC-CE for Cluster Compute InstancesNITRC Computational Environment for Cluster Compute Instances are available via the AWS Marketplace. A public Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) is also available.  Results  NITRC's triad of services serve the global neuroinformatics research community with 64% of its users coming from the United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, and Canada. With over 3.2 million page views and 747,000 visits by 335,200 unique visitors, NITRC-R facilitates access to an ever growing number of neuroinformatics tools and resources (630). NITRC-IR offers 4,800 Subjects searchable across 9 projects to promote re-use and integration of these valuable shared data. Averaging 20,900 visits and 76,200 pageviews per month, software and data from NITRC-R and NITRC-IR have been downloaded over 1.3 million times. NITRC-CE provides simplified deployment of cloud-based computation that supports FreeSurfer, FSL, AFNI, and many other software resources. In real-world processing tests, a representative computation that would have taken 24 hours on a high-powered desktop took 25% of the time (8 hours) at a cost of only $4.

Characteristics Crabs in this genus have a carapace that is about as long as it is wide, with well-developed rostral and anterolateral teeth. The carapace has a covering of coarse hairs and some shaggy bristles near the margins. The chelipeds bear epipods (small lateral extension from the base). The pereopods (walking legs) are smooth. The fourth pereopod has a propodus (penultimate segment) with spines on its inner and outer margins and a larger spine opposing the dactylus (tip segment), which is spineless. The fifth pereopod is shorter than the third and has a propodus with one or two spines opposing the dactylus and three further spines on its outer margin. The dactylus on this leg has one spine or is unarmed. The uropods are visible externally. On the female the sternal grooves are separate and set on large tubes behind the chelipeds.

He was curate of Saint Andrew-the-less in Cambridge from 1886 to 1890, then between 1890 and 1896 was curate of Trowbridge in Wiltshire. His last curacy was at Barnet in Hertfordshire from 1895 to 1898. When his father died Laurence was appointed Vicar of St. Mark's church in Colney Heath, near St. Albans in Hertfordshire, where he remained for twenty years between 1898 and 1918http://thepeerage.com/p34069.htm#i340687 until his retirement from the church. Artist Laurence Bomford was an accomplished artist, actively painting between 1873 and 1920. His works are mainly in watercolour and often plein-air sketches with only a small number of oil paintings being known. He was clearly professionally taught, and was a pupil of Nathaniel Everett Green, who would become his father-in-law. Green's influence can be seen, particularly in Bomford's early work. His landscape paintings are characterised by delicate brushwork in a semi-impressionist fashion with excellent perspective and composition, and good contrasts between light and shade. Several still life studies of flowers are known and the odd seascape is also recorded, again primarily in watercolour. He travelled widely to paint, with works depicting locations throughout England and Wales, with a particular love for South Devon, and North Wales which are represented in many of his works. There exists a smaller number of pieces from Scotland, and from an overseas excursion to Switzerland and northern Italy in 1906. Bomford was a respected artist during his lifetime. His pictures were widely appreciated, being offered for auction, for example, in Melbourne, Australia in 1876.The Argus (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.) 16 Dec 1876 He was exhibited at the Christchurch Exhibition, New Zealand, alongside other English and Italian artists in 1882.The Star (Christchurch, New Zealand), Issue 4334, Page 3, 15 March 1882The West Coast Times (New Zealand), Issue 4041, Page 2, 25 March 1882 In recent times his works have occasionally come onto the open market, being offered by major auction houses in Europe, America and South Africa.

It often carries a piece of sponge on its back by way of camouflage, and one individual was found carrying a sea anemone in a similar manner. Description Lauridromia intermedia is a small crab with a maximum carapace width of for males and for females. The carapace is covered in short hair and there are shaggy bristles round the margins. It is nearly circular in shape and the rostrum has three teeth, the central one being smaller than the other two. This crab has robust chelipeds bearing a number of tubercles. The second and third legs are much longer than the fourth and fifth. These latter have three or four spines on the dactylus, two or three small ones and a single opposable large one. The carapace is orangish or yellowish-brown with a small dark red patch near the front. The tips of the chelipeds are pink. Distribution Lauridromia intermedia is found in shallow water in the western Indo-Pacific. Its range includes the East African coast, Madagascar, the Seychelles, Australia, New Caledonia, the Philippines, Japan and Taiwan. Its depth range is but it is seldom found deeper than . Ecology Crabs in the family Dromiidae are often known as \\"sponge crabs\\" due to their habit of carrying bits of sponge on their carapace, clipping them to size and shape. Sometimes instead they carry colonial ascidians and occasionally other objects. Lauridromia intermedia usually carries a piece of sponge, holding it in place with the claw-like spines on the end of its fourth and fifth pairs of legs. After a scientific trawl along the sandy seabed off the coast of Kenya, an individual Lauridromia intermedia was brought to the surface carrying a specimen of the sea anemone Nemanthus annamensis on its back. It was holding the sea anemone in place with its two hind legs, the spines being sunk into the gelatinous column. The sea anemone was not attached to the crab's shell and appeared not to be distressed by being carried around in this way. It would seem that the crab was using the anemone as camouflage, or taking advantage of the anemone's nematocysts as a defence against predators.

At his death he was the last surviving charter member of the Mycological Society of America.  Career  George Baker Cummins was affectionately known as \\"Mr. Rust\\" and he was recognized throughout the world as the authority on the rust fungi, the Puccinales, which are the largest order of disease-causing organisms of plants. Cummins professional specialty for almost his entire career was the taxonomy, biology and geographic distribution of the rust fungi. His investigations of the rusts took him to the Philippines, New Guinea, continental China, the Himalaya, central and western Africa, and North and South America. Cummins began his mycological career at the age of 23 as a graduate student at the University of Michigan in 1927, meaning he was a mycologist for 80 years. He published his first journal paper in 1930 at the age of 26 and his last publication was the Illustrated Genera of Rust Fungi in 2003 at the age of 99. Cummins studied the rust fungi at the internationally renowned Arthur Herbarium (Fungarium) at Purdue University, a collection dedicated to preserved specimens of rust fungi. He first came to Purdue University in 1930, as a research assistant under J. C. Arthur (another noted urediniologist to which the Arthur Fungarium owes its namesake) and worked with Arthur on Arthur's rust fungi monograph, published in 1934. Cummins was never a student of Arthur's although he gained a wealth of knowledge of rust fungi while working with him on the manual. He completed his PhD program at Purdue, working with several advisors, in 1935. Cummins was staff or faculty in the college of Agriculture, and the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue, for 40 years. He served as curator of the Arthur from 1938 - 1971 and built it to be one of the largest working collections of plant rust fungi in the world. The collection is especially rich in grasses, partly due to the interest of Cummins in collecting hosts for grass rusts. Cummins named over 600 new taxa or combinations in his 33-year career as curator. He was appointed professor in 1947 and was head of the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology from 1966 to 1970, when he retired. Cummins was active in teaching and instructed courses in general plant sciences and mycology. In collaboration with other departmental faculty he authored a textbook and laboratory manuals in plant sciences. He also served as major professor for graduate students in master's and doctoral programs. His students included J. W. Baxter, Y. Hiratsuka and J. F. Hennen. After retirement from Purdue Cummins moved to Tucson, Arizona where he was appointed visiting research professor by the Department of Plant Pathology of the University of Arizona and was provided working facilities and microscopic equipment in the mycological herbarium. For the next 20 years he was a valued and highly productive faculty member.  Memberships and awards  Cummins held all of the offices of the Mycological Society of America; secretary treasurer (1942‚Äì1944), vice president (1945), president (1946) and councilor (1947‚Äì1948). He was also active in the American Phytopathological Society of America, the Mycological Society of Mexico, the Torrey Botanical Club, American Society of Plant Taxonomists, the Southwestern Association of Naturalists, the Indiana Academy of Science, and the International Association for Plant Taxonomy. He was made a Life Member of the Mycological Society of America in 1967 and was the longest surviving charter member. His achievements were recognized by Montana State University (where he received a B.S. degree) when they conferred upon him an Honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1963. He became an Emeritus Professor at Purdue in 1971 and in recognition as the foremost authority on the rust fungi, Purdue University awarded him an honorary doctoral degree in 1981. Several other universities also awarded him honorary degrees including the Banco Nacional of Mexico which named him \\"Mencion honorifica\\" in 1982.  Contributions and literary works  Outstanding contributions by Cummins include a study of the phylogenetic significance of the pores in rust urediniospores, a monograph of the genus Prospodium, an illustrated manual of rust genera, and studies of major groups of grass rusts, some cooperatively with H. C. Greene and J. F. Hennen (Baxter, 1962). During his tenure at Purdue, and at the University of Arizona since his retirement, he published 120 refereed papers and 9 books. The books published include Rust Fungi on Legumes and Composites in North America (1978), The Rust Fungi of Cereals, Grasses and Bamboos (1971), three books on rust fungi of Mexico with Hector M. Gallegos and three editions of the Illustrated Genera of Rust Fungi with Yasuyuki Hiratsuka. Cummins was also a talented scientific illustrator and J.C. Arthur's 1934 Manual of the Rust Fungi contains his illustrations. There are hundreds of original illustrations by Cummins throughout the collection in the Arthur Fungarium.  Personal life and character  Cummins was born in Tecumseh, Nebraska, 29 August 1904 to Nellie Baker Cummins and George Wilson Cummins. He had a sister, Ruth, who was three years older. In 1906 his family moved to western Montana. Cummins' father had purchased a 100-acre farm on the edge of the village of Darby at the south end of the Bitterroot Valley, on which his father built a two-level log house. This building now acts as the administration building for the Darby School system on the aptly named Cummins street. Cummins attended Montana state college (Now Montana State University) in Bozeman. He began his career as an engineering major but after a year changed his major to botany and bacteriology. In the summers during his college years Cummins and a classmate friend from Darby worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the barberry eradication program for control of stem rust of wheat. This was Cummins' first rust-related employment. Cummins was awarded a bachelor of science in Botany and Bacteriology from MSC in 1927. One of the botany professors at MSC was Frank B. Cotner, a student of the mycologist C. H. Kauffman at the University of Michigan. Cotner was impressed by Cummins and urged him to consider graduate work in mycology and helped him get an assistantship with Kauffman at Michigan. Cummins started a graduate program there in fall 1927. About the time Cummins finished his MS, E.B. Mains, then a faculty member at Purdue University, contacted his former mentor, Kauffman, at Michigan to ask whether anyone there was qualified and interested in working at Purdue with the noted rust specialist J.C. Arthur in preparing a manual of the rust fungi of North America. Kauffman recommended Cummins and Cummins decided to take the job. He went to Purdue in January 1930 to assume a position on the Agricultural Experiment Station staff as a research assistant. In the fall of 1930 Cummins married Margaret Sempill and together they had two children, Richard in 1934 and Elaine in 1936. Sadly Margaret died shortly after Elaine was born. In 1938 Cummins married Mildred Shriver, a Purdue alumna, who became the loving mother of two small children and Cummins' devoted wife for the next 69 years. In summer 1957 Cummins spent several weeks collecting rust fungi in the Chiricahua Mountains and adjacent areas in southeastern Arizona, working out of the Southwestern Research Station of the American Museum of Natural History. In 1960 he spent a sabbatical year in Tucson doing field research on rusts in southern Arizona and northern Mexico. These experiences led to a permanent move by Cummins and Mildred to Tucson in 1971 after his retirement from Purdue. Cummins has been noted as the best softball pitcher in the Purdue University School of Agriculture and a man of dry wit, who signed his letters \\"the burned-out botanist\\" (Mccain & Hennen, 1993). Below is a quote from Cummins from the Purdue University Retiree Newsletter: \\"... The abbreviation of Purdue University Retirees (PUR) is antedated by some years by PUR, the official international designation for the Arthur. The two PUR's have something in common. The PUR (Arthur Herbarium) is a repository of about 80,000 specimens, many quite old. Purdue University Retirees probably do not number so many, but the rest of the comparison has some validity. And I am in a position to know.\\" Dr. George Baker Cummins died on March 30, 2007 at the age of 102. \\"Dr. George B. Cummins is a scholar, a gentlemen, and a scientist of international fame. His contributions to Purdue University, Indiana, the United States, and the world have been enormous.\\" - Dr. Markus Scholler (former curator of the Arthur Fungarium) Mildred died 22 August 2008 at the age of 101.

There are about 20 accepted species, including the newly discovered B. coralliformis. Many species emit an odour which possibly attracts pollinators in the same way that pollinators are attracted to Rafflesia. Balanophora species are used in folk medicine in many Asian cultures. For example, in China, Balanophora is known as she-gu (stone-fungus) and in Thailand as hoh-ra-tao-su-nak. In both cases, the plant is used to treat a variety of ailments and has various ritual purposes. The tubers of Balanophora are rich in a wax-like substance which is used in Java as a fuel for torches.

She is the founder of the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels, hosted at the University of Washington, and dedicated to the study of sential species as early warning systems of natural or human caused environmental change.  Early Life and Education  She grew up in Michigan. She graduated from Central Michigan University in 1969 and later completed her Ph.D. in Zoology from Ohio State University in 1974. Her dissertation was on Galapagos penguins and titled \\"The Galapagos Penguin: A Study of Adaptations for Life in an Unpredictable Environment.\\"  Career  Boersma began teaching at the University of Washington in 1974. Over multiple decades, her career has focused on protecting penguins from oil spills, habitat loss, and road construction plans that would disrupt nesting sites. Boersma and a team of researchers banded more than 44,300 Magellanic penguin chicks at Punta Tombo from 1983 to 2010, finding 3,296 of those chicks made it back to the breeding colony where they were born. Overall, they found that fewer female penguins survived. Her research in Argentina has demonstrated climate-induced change that forced penguins to swim about 25 miles farther each day in search of food, which reduced their chance of survival. In 1983, she began finding penguins dead on the beaches covered in oil, which caused her and her team to bring the evidence to the attention of the government's and ultimately led to tanker lanes being shifted further offshore. This shift protected the penguins from the effects of commercial petroleum dumping in the ocean. She has received multiple awards for teaching and her contributions to science, including a Distinguished Service Award from the Society for Conservation Biology in 2006 and the 15th Heinz Environmental Award.

Does 1‚Äì1,495, Civil Action No. 11-1741 (JDB/JMF), was a United States District Court for the District of Columbia case in which the court held that anonymous users of the peer-to-peer file sharing service BitTorrent could not remain anonymous after charges of copyright infringement were brought against them. The court ultimately dismissed the case, but the identities of defendants were publicly exposed.  Background  Hard Drive Productions, Inc., is an adult film studio with a history of suing anonymous \\"John Doe\\" defendants for copyright infringement. On September 27, 2011, Hard Drive Productions sued 1,495 anonymous defendants for copyright infringement in Hard Drive Productions, Inc. v. Does 1‚Äì1,495. Hard Drive Productions claimed that the defendants had used BitTorrent to illegally download and distribute its movie \\"Amateur Alleur‚ÄîMaeLynn.\\" A prominent feature of this case the defendants' right to anonymous speech. Hard Drive Productions knew the IP addresses assigned to each defendant by their Internet service provider (ISP), however the plaintiff had no information about the true identities of these individuals. Hard Drive Productions moved to compel the ISPs by subpoena to disclose the true identities of the defendants. The court granted the motion, which would force the ISPs to disclose the defendants' identities. The defendants moved to quash this subpoena. For administrative reasons, some of the defendants submitted their name and address with their motions to quash. These were filed under seal to protect their identities from the public. Subsequently, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an organization that advocates internet users' anonymity and other rights in the digital world, sent an amicus curiae and requested an emergency stay‚Äîa motion that would halt action so that the order could be reconsidered. The EFF mainly argued that the order did not consider the defendants' First Amendment right to anonymous speech. The court eventually denied the EFF's motion for emergency stay and reconsideration and ordered unsealing of all sealed motions to quash. Thus, the identities of the defendants were disclosed to the public.  Opinion of the Court =On Hard Drive Productions's motion to compel On August 13, 2012, the court held that the defendants could not proceed anonymously. The court noted that there was no privilege recognized by law that would protect the identity of the Does from being disclosed to the plaintiff for the purposes sought, and that without the ability to obtain the Does' identities, the copyright holders would have been left without a means of identifying the individuals who violated its rights. The plaintiff was seeking subscriber information for particular IP addresses, and the use of that information had already been restricted by the court: \\"Any information disclosed to Hard Drive in response to the Rule 45 subpoenas may be used by Hard Drive solely for the purpose of protecting its rights as set forth in the Complaint, and Hard Drive may not publicly disclose the names of the defendants.\\" The defendants filed motions to quash the subpoena, but they were denied for multiple reasons. First, because the defendants moved anonymously, their motions could not officially become part of the Court file. According to Rule 5.1 of the court's local rules, \\"The first filing by or on behalf of a party shall have in the caption the name and full residence address of the party.\\" Second, since the subpoena was for the defendants' ISPs and not the defendants themselves, the defendants had no standing to quash the subpoena. Third, the court argued that, at the time, the movants were not yet considered as defendants. On the EFF's stay motion The court released a memorandum regarding the EFF's amicus curiae and denied its stay motion on September 26, 2012. In this opinion, court applied the 5-part balancing test adopted in Sony Music Entertainment, Inc. v. Does 1‚Äì40, 326 F. Supp. 2d 556 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) and found that all five factors supported the disclosure of the defendants' identities: # Plaintiff's concrete showing of a prima facie claim of copyright infringement‚ÄîHard Drive Productions made a concrete showing of a prima facie claim of copyright infringement. # Specificity of the plaintiff's discovery request‚ÄîHard Drive Productions's discovery request was sufficiently specific to gain only the information needed to identify the defendants and nothing more. # Absence of alternative means to gain the information plaintiff seeks‚Äîsubpoenaing the ISPs appeared to be the only way for the plaintiff to obtain the defendants' identities because only the ISPs have records of the IP addresses assigned to users on the date and at the time of each allegedly infringing act. # Plaintiff's need for the information to advance its claim‚Äîwithout the defendants' identifying information, the plaintiff could not name or serve process on the defendants and hence cannot advance its claims of copyright infringement. # Defendants' expectation of privacy‚Äîdefendants had little expectation of privacy in the subscriber information that they had already given to their ISPs. Because all of the five Sony factors supported disclosure of the defendants' identities, the court found that the plaintiff's need for the defendants' identities in pursuit its claims outweighed the defendants' First Amendment interest in anonymity.  Subsequent developments  On December 21, 2012 the case was dismissed in its entirety without prejudice, but the plaintiff could still file a new lawsuit in other jurisdictions until the statute of limitation has expired. Eric Goldman criticized the court for allowing copyright plaintiffs to unmask the identities of the defendants too easily. As a result of the disclosure, the defendants lost their essential due process rights. In practice, once the plaintiff knew the identities of defendants, it could take advantage of substantial extrajudicial remedies such as public humiliation in porn copyright cases. Goldman claimed that this ruling unfairly favored the plaintiff over the anonymous defendants. After the case was dismissed, Hard Drive Productions was involved in another lawsuit related to this case. On February 16, 2013, Nathan Abshire, one of the defendants in Hard Drive Productions, Inc. v. Does 1‚Äì1,495, filed a new lawsuit (MND 13-cv-00380) against Hard Drive Productions. Abshire alleged that after the disclosing of the Does' identities in September 2012, Hard Drive Productions, Inc. began harassing Nathan over the phone and continued to propose various unacceptable settlement proposals. The complaint primarily requested that the court issue an order declaring that Abshire not be liable for copyright infringement, that Hard Drive Productions's purported copyright on its work was unenforceable or invalid. It also requested that Abshire be awarded costs, disbursements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees.  See also  *McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission *Apple v.

Formed in 2013, the band was a supergroup composed of bassist and vocalist Glenn Hughes, guitarist Andrew Watt, and drummer Jason Bonham. Following the breakup of his previous band Black Country Communion, Hughes was introduced to Watt in 2013 and the two quickly formed California Breed, with Black Country Communion drummer Bonham completing the lineup shortly after. The band recorded its self-titled debut album with producer Dave Cobb in late 2013, which was released through Frontiers Records in May 2014 and reached number 78 on the US Billboard 200. Following the release of the album, Bonham left California Breed due to other commitments preventing him from touring; he was replaced by former Queens of the Stone Age and Eagles of Death Metal drummer Joey Castillo. The band toured in support of the band Alter Bridge, and later on five UK dates with Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. It was later revealed that Bonham's departure was likely to be permanent, and in January 2015 the band announced that it would no longer continue. History=2013‚Äì14: Formation and debut album Hughes was first introduced to Watt by friend and fellow musician Julian Lennon on February 9, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. After the guitarist emailed Hughes some of his music, Hughes recalls that he \\"heard a good writer, a good guitar player, and a good singer, three things that are important\\", at which point he decided to enlist him in his new band. A few days after meeting, Hughes and Watt quickly wrote two songs together ‚Äì \\"Chemical Rain\\" and \\"Solo\\" ‚Äì both of which were later included on the band's debut album. Speaking about this meeting, Hughes recalls that he \\"was so moved by the music, I said, 'We've got to record this!'\\", at which point he called Bonham to finalise the group's lineup. Citing bands such as Rush and Cream, the two decided against adding a keyboardist to their band, and instead progress as a power trio. Throughout the rest of 2013, the three-piece recorded 12 songs for its debut album, all of which were credited equally among all three members. On February 6, 2014, the announcement of the formation of California Breed was made, as well as the news of first single \\"Midnight Oil\\". In March, it was announced that the band would release its debut album, California Breed, in May. Upon release, the album reached number 78 on the Billboard 200, number 22 on Top Rock Albums, and topped the Top Hard Rock Albums chart. Outside of the US, it reached number 26 on the UK Albums Chart, topped the UK Rock Albums Chart, and charted in a number of European territories. The band's debut live performance took place on May 28 at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California. The setlist included all 13 songs from the album, plus cover versions of Led Zeppelin's \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" and \\"Immigrant Song\\", and songs by Hughes's previous bands Trapeze (\\"Medusa\\") and Deep Purple (\\"Burn\\"). 2014‚Äì15: Lineup change and breakup In August 2014, it was announced that Bonham had left the group prior to the band's upcoming UK tour, with the announcement citing \\"professional commitments\\" as the reason preventing his continued involvement. He was replaced by Joey Castillo, and Bonham later added to the news by stating that, \\"I love those guys ‚Äì but it wasn't going to work out for me. I will support them as I love the band I helped create, and Joey is great.\\" Hughes later confirmed that Bonham's departure was permanent, explaining that, \\"his other commitments were getting in the way of his California Breed schedule. I have no disrespect for Jason, only tonnes of love. It's just that he chose to work with other people when in fact he should be working with California Breed.\\" On January 15, 2015, it was announced that California Breed had split up, with the band announcing on its Twitter page that \\"We are no more‚Ä¶ another thing we couldn't keep together.\\" Watt later added his own thoughts on the announcement, adding \\"I put everything I had into this band. All I can say is I was in it for the long haul.

Style, songwriting, and influences Talking about the group's style upon the announcement of its formation, Hughes summarised California Breed as \\"proper rock\\", describing the band as a mixture between traditional and modern elements of the genre. Watt identifies The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin as influences on his style, while Bonham has compared the guitarist to Jimi Hendrix. The band's debut album was written equally by its three members, and has been described as a mix between \\"the classic rock elements of Black Country Communion ‚Äì big, meat-cleaver riffs and heart-rending vocals ‚Äì but with a 21st-century gloss\\".

During the same century the church was remade internally and equipped with brick vaulting, decorated with murals in the style of painter Albertus Pictor (ca.1440-1509).

During this time the paintings were also covered with whitewash but rediscovered and laid bare again in 1911. New windows were added and old ones enlarged during the 19th century.

He was also a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich  Life  Cows (from his third phase) Braith was born in Biberach an der Ri√ü. His father was a day-laborer who later became a farm manager. As a child, Braith helped herd the cattle. In 1851, he won a scholarship to attend the Royal Art School in Stuttgart where he studied under Bernhard von Neher and Heinrich von Rustige. Later, in 1860, he and his classmate Albert Kappis moved to Munich, where they made the acquaintance of Christian Mali and became involved in several local \\"art colonies\\". In 1867, he travelled to Paris, together with Kappis and Mali. Several exhibitions there, in Vienna and in Munich were very successful. By 1875, Braith was able to buy a villa in Biberach. He undertook his first trip to Italy in 1884 and returned there in 1889. During the Munich Secession in 1892, Braith remained loyal to the Academy. He was diagnosed with liver disease in 1903 and, in 1904, went to Bolzano seeking a cure. Six months before his death, he returned to his home town. As he had never married, he left his estate to the city of Biberach, which used part of his legacy to create a museum. His friend Mali died shortly thereafter and also bequeathed his estate to the city. The two are buried side by side in the Old Catholic Cemetery. The Braith-Mali Museum is now part of an expanded museum complex that also has a large collection of works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.  Work  Braith was a member of the Munich School and, after the death of Friedrich Voltz, was considered the greatest painter of animals in Germany. His primary subject was livestock, but he occasionally also painted poultry. He was the first to portray animals in large format, studio pictures. His success as a painter is often attributed to a sense of nostalgia induced by Germany's rapidly industrializing culture. His work is divided into four phases: * 1851‚Äì1860: Idyllic landscape scenes after the manner of the Dutch. * 1860‚Äì1873: Animals in the context of genre scenes (e.g. with shepherds). * 1874‚Äì1894: Increasingly dramatic portrayals of animals in dynamic situations. * 1894‚Äì1904: Quieter scenes, essentially still- lifes, of animals on pastures.
