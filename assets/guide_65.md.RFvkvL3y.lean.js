Life and career Known as John Edwin the younger, he was the son of the English actor John Edwin. An early mention of Edwin's name comes in a 1777 correspondence between his father and George Colman the Elder in which the elder Edwin offers the theatre manager the use of his wife and son Jack in return for a salary advancement. On 30 July 1778, Edwin debuted as Hengo at London's Haymarket Theatre in a revival of Bonduca, written by Beaumont and Fletcher. Over his early years, Edwin often appeared with his father at the Haymarket or the Old Orchard Street Theatre in Bath, Somerset. His first known adult role as Dick in The Apprentice of Murphy, came in a benefit performance for his ailing father at London's Covent Garden Theatre on 26 March 1788. Edwin later befriended Richard Barry, 7th Earl of Barrymore, and for some years performed in amateur theatre productions staged at a theatre Barry had built near his home in Wargrave, Berkshire.Robinson, John Robert (1894). The Last Earls of Barrymore. pp. 111-113\\\\. Retrieved 13 October 2012. In 1791, Edwin married actress Elizabeth Rebecca Richards, the daughter of actor William Talbot Richards (died 1813). Edwin soon brought his bride to Wargrave, where her extended stay eventually caused friction between his wife and Tate Wilkinson, manager of the York circuit. On 20 June 1792, the two appeared together at the Haymarket in The Virgin Unmasked taken from An Old Man Taught Wisdom. The play was a ballad farce written by Henry Fielding in which Edwin played Blister to his wife's Lucy. Edwin escorted his wife to Dublin and Doncaster in 1794, and traveled with her on most of her provincial tours over the remainder of their marriage. Death Edwin drank himself to death one night in Dublin on 22 February 1805 after a satirical poem, ascribed to John Wilson Croker, called Edwin, the \\"lubbard spouse of Mrs. Edwin\\", and \\"the degenerate son of a man 'high on the rolls of comic fame\\". A tombstone, erected by Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin in St. Werburgh's churchyard, Dublin, attributes her husband's death to the acuteness of his sensibility. > Edwin was best known at Bath, where he was held in some parts equal or > superior to his father, he was an excellent country actor, and would > probably, but for his irregular life, have made a high reputation. Tate > Wilkinson praises his Lenitive in \\"The Prize\\" and his Nipperkin in \\"The > Sprigs of Laurel,\\" and says that as Mr. Tag in \\"The Spoil'd Child\\" he is > better than any comedian he (Wilkinson) has hitherto seen. He adds that Mr. > Edwin dresses his characters better and more characteristic than any comic > actor I recollect on the York stage' (Wandering Patentee, iv. 204). > Dictionary of National Biography, 1908.

One easy to observe example is milk: place some milk in a teaspoon and observe the surface in direct sunlight. There will be a visible \\"dancing\\" pattern of coloured points. Where the milk dries on the spoon at the edge, the speckle is seen to be static. This is direct evidence of the thermal motion of atoms, which cause the Brownian motion of the colloidal particles in the milk, which in turn results in the dynamic speckle visible to the naked eye. Biospeckle laser image sequence of a maize seed.  Information content  The dynamic pattern shows then the changes that, if they are analyzed along time, represent the activity of the illuminated material. The visual effect is that of a boiling liquid or the image in a TV set far from tuning. It can be analyzed by means of several mathematical and statistical tools and provide numeric or visual information on its magnitude, the not well defined idea of activity. Because the number of scattering centers is very high the collective phenomenon is hard to interpret and their individual contributions to the final result can not be inferred. The measurements that are obtained by means of the analysis tools present the activity level as a sum of the contributions of phenomena due to Doppler effect of the scattered light as well as other phenomena eventually present (time variations of the refractive index of the sample, etc.) Light scattered with small Doppler shifts in its frequency beats on the detector (eventually the eye) giving rise to the slow intensity variations that constitute the dynamic of the speckle pattern. A biological sample, for example, that is a material that contains a huge number of mobile scattering centers, presents refractive index variations in the materials that compose it with power changes as well as many other effects increasing the complexity in the identification and isolation of these phenomena. Then, the complete interpretation of the activity of a sample, by means of dynamic speckle, presents itself big challenges. Figure 1 shows a sequence of speckle patterns in a corn seed in the start of its germination process where the dynamic effect is higher in the areas where the scattering centers are expected to be more active as is the case of the embryo and in a break in the endosperm region of the seed. The embryo is in the lower left side and the break is a river-like region in the center. In the crack, the activity is due to intensive inner water evaporation while in the embryo activity is higher due to metabolism of the alive tissue together with the activity caused by water evaporation. In the endosperm, the high right region of the image represents that the relatively low activity is due only to water evaporation.  Applications  Biological tissue is one of the most complex that can be found in nature. Besides it is worsened by the intrinsic variability present between one sample and another. These facts make even more difficult the comparison of results between different samples even in presence of the same stimulus. In this context, speckle patterns have been applied to study bacteria,Murialdo, S; et al. \\"Analysis of bacterial chemotactic response using dynamic laser speckle\\". J. Biomed. Opt. 14(6) (2009) 064015.Ramírez-Miquet, EE; et al. \\"Escherichia coli activity characterization using a laser dynamic speckle technique\\". Rev. Cub.

Several mathematical and statistical tools have been proposed for the characterization of the activity of a dynamic speckle pattern. Some of them are: ;Inertia Moment of the Co-Occurrence matrix (MOC) MI = \\\\sum { MOC (i,j) * (i-j)^2 }\\\\,! ;Fujii Fujii(x,y) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\\\frac{ I_k (x,y) - I_{k+1} (x,y) }{ I_k (x,y) + I_{k+1} (x,y) }\\\\,! ;Generalized differences DG(x,y) = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\sum_{l}{ I_k (x,y) - I_{k+l} (x,y) }\\\\,! ;Temporal difference D(k) = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{ E (m,n,k+1) - E (m,n,k) }\\\\,!

The term \\"birth injury\\" may be used in two different ways: #the ICD-10 uses \\"birth injury\\" and \\"birth trauma\\" interchangeably to refer to mechanical injuries sustained during delivery; # the legal community uses \\"birth injury\\" to refer to any damage or injury sustained during pregnancy, during delivery, or just after delivery, including injuries caused by trauma. Birth injuries must be distinguished from birth defects. \\"Birth defect\\" refers to damage that occurs while the fetus is in the womb, which may be caused by genetic mutations, infections, or exposure to toxins. There are more than 4,000 types of birth defects. Causes= Difficult labor (dystocia)  Difficult labor, also known as dystocia or obstructed labor, occurs when the child cannot easily pass through the birth canal. This can result in fetal distress or physical trauma to the child, especially broken clavicles and damage to the brachial plexus nerves. It can also deprive the child of oxygen as the umbilical cord is pinched, potentially causing brain damage or death. Difficult labor may occur because the baby is abnormally large (macrosomia), because the mother’s pelvis or birth canal is small or deformed, or because the baby is in an abnormal presentation for the birth (such as breech or transverse presentation).  External causes  Fetal malformations and birth injuries may occur as a result of exposure to environmental toxins such as mercury or lead. Many medications can also affect the development of the fetus, as can alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. See Environmental toxins and fetal development. See Drugs in pregnancy.  Genetic mutations  Genetic mutations can cause a wide variety of fetal malformations, ranging from relatively mild cleft lips to severe and even fatal deformities.  Infection  Maternal infection may be transmitted to the fetus; this is called a vertically transmitted infection. The fetus has a weak immune system, so infections that are relatively minor in adults can be very serious in a developing fetus. In addition, some studies suggest that maternal infections increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, in the child.  Intrauterine hypoxia  Intrauterine hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation in the womb, can cause serious brain damage in the fetus. It most commonly occurs because of damage to or malformation of the umbilical cord or placenta. Intrauterine hypoxia can cause brain damage, including cerebral palsy and other neurological and psychiatric disorders.  Maternal health issues  Certain maternal health issues can cause birth injuries. Gestational diabetes can cause premature birth, macrosomia, or stillbirth.  Pregnancy complications  Complications such as placenta previa, placental abruption, anemia, and preeclampsia can limit the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, increasing the risk of birth defects. Severe cases may be fatal to the fetus. Common types of birth injury= Brachial plexus injury  The brachial plexus is the bundle of nerves that runs from the neck to the hand and controls the motion of the arm and hand. The brachial plexus may be stretched and damaged during a difficult delivery. In minor cases, the nerves heal and full use of the hand and arm is recovered. In more severe cases, the child may suffer permanent nerve damage and may not have full use of the shoulder, arm, or hand. Brachial plexus injuries occur in 1-3 children per 1,000 live births. See Erb's palsy and Klumpke's palsy.  Brain damage  Brain damage may be caused by a number of factors, including fetal malformation due to genetic mutation or exposure to toxins, intrauterine hypoxia, or physical trauma during delivery. Cerebral palsy is one example of brain damage incurred before or during delivery; about 10,000 children are diagnosed with cerebral palsy every year.  Bruising  A difficult delivery may lead to bruising, especially on the head and face, from pressure against the mother’s pelvis or pressure caused by forceps or a vacuum device (see ventouse) used in delivery.  Bone fractures  Bone fractures can occur during a difficult delivery. Fracture of the clavicle is the most common birth injury.  Meconium aspiration syndrome  Meconium is a sticky substance that usually makes up the child’s first bowel movement. If the fetus is stressed before or during delivery, the meconium may be released and may mix with the amniotic fluid. If it gets into the child's airways or lungs, it can cause meconium aspiration syndrome. Serious cases may result in pneumonia or a collapsed lung.http://newsmomsneed.marchofdimes.org/?p=8190 Legal issues Birth injuries may be unavoidable or they may be attributable to medical malpractice. When a legal claim results, birth injury cases are a subset of medical malpractice cases. Legal claims from birth injury cases typically seek compensation for the medical costs associated with the injury, including ongoing therapeutic and medical support for the child. In order to prevail in a birth injury malpractice case, the plaintiff must show (1) that the medical care provider owed a duty to the child, (2) that the medical care provider breached that duty by failing to meet the accepted standard of care, (3) that the child sustained an injury that was caused by the medical care provider’s breach of duty to the child, and (4) the child suffered damages as a result of the injury. All four elements must be present in order for the plaintiff to win.

Career Born in Ehime Prefecture, Itō joined the actors school at Shōchiku in 1920, but soon began writing screenplays under the recommendation of Kaoru Osanai. He made his directorial debut in 1924 at Teikoku Kinema with Shuchū nikki. After trying to start his own production company, he settled at Nikkatsu and established his name in 1927 with the three-part Chūji tabi nikki, which is considered one of the masterpieces of jidaigeki. Especially in the silent era, he was known for a very mobile camera style that earned him the nickname \\"Idō daisuki\\" (Loves Motion), which is a pun on his name. The heroes of his films, such as Tange Sazen and Kunisada Chūji, were often disaffected, nihilistic loners and thus Itō's early films were sometimes considered tendency films. He was criticized, however, for being more of a stylist than a thematically committed filmmaker. While being a director who was less successful after the coming of sound, Itō worked with many great jidaigeki stars, especially Denjirō Ōkōchi, Yorozuya Kinnosuke, Raizō Ichikawa, and Tsumasaburō Bandō at studios such as Nikkatsu and Daiei, in a career that spanned nearly half a century. In 1991, a partial print of Chūji tabi nikki, long considered a lost film, was discovered and screened for the public.

It is an Indian adaptation of Mark Twain's 1881 novel, The Prince and the Pauper and a remake of the Telugu film Raju Peda (1954). Synopsis Raja Aur Runk is the story of a prince and a pauper. Two children, born on the same day at the same time: one to the king, Raja Sahib, and one to a poor man, Hariya (Ajit). The king is thrilled at the birth of Yuvraj, the heir to the throne, while Hariya is cynical about the birth of his son, Raja. The children grow up looking identical, but there is a constant contrast in their lives and upbringing. One day, Raja runs away from home and somehow ends up in the palace, where he meets Yuvraj. The boys discover how different their lives are. Being tempted to see the world outside, Yuvraj changes identities with Raja and leaves the palace. They now struggle in vain to adjust to their new identities. Raja's mother (Nirupa Roy) and sister Sujjo (Nazima) are miserable with his changed behavior and the king is very distressed about Yuvraj. Sudhir (Sanjeev Kumar) comes in as a pivotal player in this saga of gripping twists and turns. This Prasad Productions' costume drama has effective performances by Sanjeev Kumar, Nazima and child artiste Mahesh Kothare.

Cruz, Manila, Philippines where its main campus is located. PMI Colleges is considered as the second oldest and the largest among over one hundred private maritime schools in the country. At present, it is the biggest nautical school in the country, averaging nearly 3500 nautical and marine engineering graduates every year. History The Philippine Maritime Institute was founded on September 18, 1948 by Atty. Tomas Cloma, also a Self-Styled Admiral and his father Tomas Cloma Sr., discoverer of the Kalayaan Group of Islands. It was the first private maritime school in the Philippines with nineteen (19) students enrolled in the Associate in Nautical Science course in a classroom on a floating barge moored in Pasig River at Plaza Lawton. The first quarterly enrolment was fifty-four. The school provided a one-year Nautical course in three separate session-morning, afternoon and evening. It was housed in two buildings in David Street, now Burke Street, near Escolta, Manila. The first graduates successfully passed the Civil Service examination given by the Board of Marine Engineers for Deck Officers. The school had two training ships: the motor launched \\"Victoria\\" and the \\"S/S Clavecillia\\" which were used as training ships during weekends. It was granted recognition by the Secretary of Department of Education in January 1950. The Graduates had the same status as those of the government nautical school. Legislation had favored graduates of the school by exempting them from taking the Third Mate’s technical examination given by the board of marine Examiners for Deck Officers until 1954. The Nautical curriculum was lengthened to two years after PMI petitioned the Department of Education through the private Schools to offer a two-year course in Nautical Science leading to the title of Associate in Nautical Science (ANS), which was granted on February 13, 1953. On June 14, 1983 the four-year course in Nautical Science was granted recognition by the then Ministry of Education and Culture. PMI currently has three campuses in the country – Manila, Quezon City, and Tagbilaran City. College Academic Departments *Department of Marine Transportation. The Department of Marine Transportation is the PMI's first flagship program that started as the Associate in Marine Transportation (AMT) in 1948 with twenty five students. *Department of Marine Engineering. The Department of Marine Engineering was opened in 1953. In the school year 1953-1954, the Bureau of Private Schools approved the two-year curriculum presented by the PMI to offer the Marine Engineering with the title of Associate in Marine Engineering (AME). *Department of Customs Administration. The Department of Customs Administration was born on 1954. In 1960 the PMI offered for the first time a four-year course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Customs Administration, minor in Tariff (BSCA). The curriculum of this course was prepared with the advice of leading customs authorities and tariff specialists who also formed the nucleus of its teaching staff. The curriculum was approved by the Department of Education. *Department of Naval Science and Tactics. The school also has its Department of Naval Science and Tactics under the control and supervision of the Naval Reserve Command (NavResCom) of Philippine Navy. This department handles the compulsory military training of all enrolled cadets except those duly exempted. The two- year advanced training leads to a commission ship in the Philippine Navy. **The 244th Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) Unit is located in PMI Colleges Manila. **The 514th Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) Unit is located in PMI Colleges Bohol.

PMI Colleges was awarded an ISO 9001:2000 Certification for its maritime education, customs administration, and postgraduate studies in customs administration in 2005. The ISO 9001:2000 Certification is an assurance to its students of quality management system leading to effective school governance and policies towards relevant and quality learning. It also runs parallel to the vision and mission of PMI Colleges to be a center of excellence in maritime and customs education in the Philippines as well as in the Southeast Asian region to be able to continuously produce the best marine and customs officers in the world. PMI Colleges’ quality management system for its maritime education was previously accredited and certified by Det Norske Veritas (DNV). Present day Today, the PMI Colleges is the biggest nautical school in the Philippines. The present standard of the school is shown in the results of examination with almost of the graduates passing the Board Examinations for Deck Officers, Marine Engineers, and Customs Brokers. Effective second semester of school year 2011-2012, the BS Marine Transportation (BSMT) and BS Marine Engineering (BSMarE) programs of PMI Colleges in its Manila and Quezon City campuses were ordered closed. This is due to the failure of the school to comply with the standards of the programs, in accordance with the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW), and CHED requirements. \\"On January 26, 2012, PMI Colleges, through its lawyers, received an Order from the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City granting PMI's application for Injunction prohibiting CHED from enforcing its Closure Orders, and ordering CHED to allow PMI Colleges to continue offering its BSMT and BSMarE programs.\\" Enrollment Requirements For incoming junior one students * 6 pieces of 2X2 Picture (White Background) * Entrance Exam * Medical Certificate * Copy of original Good Moral Character in highschool * Birth Certificate/NSO * DepEd Form 138 * Highschool Card Note: Only incoming maritime students can allow to test the medical exam Flagship Courses PMI Colleges currently offers the following courses: Post-Graduate Course *Master in Customs Administration (MCA).

The Council was concerned that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a humanitarian crisis, particularly due to recent fighting, loss of life, many refugees and displaced persons and suffering amongst the civilian population as a result of military actions. It also deplored the casualties suffered by the Danish peacekeepers and sent condolences to the families of those who had died. In this regard all parties were urged to cease hostilities and observe a ceasefire. Member States involved in promoting an overall peaceful settlement in the region were called upon to intensify their efforts in conjunction with humanitarian aid agencies, noting that there could be no military solution to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The temple is also known as \\"Thiên Phúc Tự\\" (, \\"Temple of Heavenly Blessings\\"). The temple was established in the 11th century during the reign of Emperor Nhân Tông of the Lý dynasty. It is dedicated to Vietnamese Thiền master Từ Đạo Hạnh (, 1072-1116). It is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Vietnam, It is well maintained by the monks. The temple is a center of pilgrimage during Tết. Geography The temple is located in Sài Sơn village, from Hanoi. It sits on the banks of an artificial lake, at the foot of the Sài Sơn Mountain, near Thăng Long Boulevard. History Từ Đạo Hạnh, the monk Từ Đạo Hạnh (also known as Minh Không) was a famous monk. He was the chief monk at the temple, a choreographer of traditional water puppetry, an inventor, and also a medical man and mystic in his village. The mystic acts associated with the monk include him burning his finger to usher in rain and curing local people of disease by blessing them, in addition to performing many other miracles. He presented water puppetry (which is unique to Vietnam) at the small lake pavilion which he built in the middle of the lake, in front of the main hall. According to the local belief he had incarnated thrice, once as Buddha in the form of Sakhyamuni, then as the son of King Lý Nhân Tông who later became the King Lý Thần Tông and then as a monk who saved the King Thần Tông also. He created his own brand of Từ Đạo Hạnh cult. Features The temple is divided into three parts. The entrance hall is the prayer hall. The middle chamber has images of Buddhas surrounded by demons, made of lacquer and garbed in red- coloured attire. The back chamber has statues of the monk. The temple has been refurbished many times. The temple has three dedications: to King Lý Thần Tông (1127 to 1138), to Gautama Buddha and his eighteen arhats and to the Buddhist monk and Thiền master Từ Đạo Hạnh. It is built in a typical Vietnamese architectural style. The main prayer hall of the temple has nearly 100 colourful images of different period. At the entrance to the shrine there are two large clay mixed papier-mâché images of the 7th century, each weighing about a ton; these are considered the largest such images in Vietnam. The main hall contains the temple's oldest image, dating from the temple's foundation: a triptych of Buddha and disciples dating from the 16th century on a high pedestal. There is a 13th-century statue of a bodhisattva seated on a lotus throne, which is a wooden statue draped in yellow. It was made in the likeness of the master Đạo Hạnh in a pensive mood. The statues of Từ Đạo Hạnh and his reincarnation in the form of Lý Thánh Tông are located in the hall next to each other. Within the same temple complex there is a small shrine referred to as the \\"old temple\\" (). It was founded by King Lý Thái Tổ in 1132 and has been renovated several times. There are two arched bridges connecting to the temple. Built in 1602, they are named Sun and Moon. One of these bridges leads to a small island, home to a small Taoist temple representing the elements of earth, air, and water. The second bridge leads to a limestone hill. Đạo Hạnh, during the last stage of his life, had walked up to this place and disappeared in a cave. This cave is located in the middle of roots of banyans and is hemmed between a small temple built in honour of the monk's parents and a small temple. Both these are religious places from where there are lovely vistas of the entire valley. There is also a limestone grotto known as the hang Cắc Cớ, \\"the Mischievous\\". Festival A colourful festival, known as the Thầy temple festival, is held in honour of the monk Từ Đạo Hạnh. It is held from the 5th to 7th days of the third Lunar month. During the festival puppet groups present water puppetry stage shows at the open air theater in the lake. A pageant of tableaux are also taken out on the occasion. Participants in the festivities come from four villages. The sandalwood statue of the master, located in the temple, is moved with intertwined strings during the puppet festival. During other festivals held here, poems written by Từ Đạo Hạnh and King Lý Nhân Tông are recited.

The Security Council recalled the criteria regarding voter eligibility and the compromise proposal of the Secretary-General. According to the report by Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, only 2 out of 8 identification centres were currently in operation. To move forward, both parties had to have a vision for the period after the referendum on self-determination. The Council regretted the vetting of Morocco that 100,000 applicants not living in the Western Sahara territory was contributing to the delays in the schedule of MINURSO. It also regretted the refusal of the Polisario Front to participate in this process. The resolution reiterated the commitment of the Council to hold a referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. Since the adoption of Resolution 1002, the concerned parties had made insufficient progress towards the fulfilment of the Settlement Plan with regards to the identification process, the code of conduct, the release of political prisoners, the confinement of Polisario troops and arrangements for a reduction in Moroccan troops. The parties were asked to co-operate with the United Nations plan and the Secretary-General was requested to make proposals to solve such problems. While the mandate of MINURSO was extended until 31 January 1996, the Council noted the possibility of withdrawing the peacekeeping operation if the conditions necessary for the beginning of the transitional period (a presumed date of 31 May 1996) were not met. The Secretary-General was asked to report by 15 January 1996 on progress made towards implementing the Settlement Plan. He was also asked to consider ways of reducing the operational costs of MINURSO, including the possible establishment of a trust fund to which Member States would voluntarily contribute.

The main event of the show was a Steel Cage match, in which reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart defended the championship against Diesel. With the launch of the WWE Network in 2014 this show became available on demand, but does not include the three dark matches held after the main show. Storylines The professional wrestling matches at In Your House 6 featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre- determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Storylines between the characters played out on WWF's primary television programs, Monday Night Raw. At the 1995 Survivor Series Bret Hart defeated Diesel to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Diesel, who had been a face throughout his time as champion, began showing more and more heel tendencies both in his wrestling style and comments towards other wrestlers; at the 1996 Royal Rumble he attacked referee Earl Hebner during Hart's title match against The Undertaker, costing the latter his opportunity for the championship. After this, Bret Hart was scheduled to defend the championship against Diesel on In Your House 6. To prevent any outside interferences this match was placed inside a Steel cage. Another rivalry leading into the event was between Shawn Michaels and Owen Hart. In autumn 1995, Michaels took a hiatus from wrestling due to an injury sustained in a real-life attack. Michaels teased retirement but returned in January 1996 to win the 1996 Royal Rumble match, earning him a title opportunity at Wrestlemania XII. However, Owen Hart taunted Michaels, claiming credit for the injury, leading to a match at the event, in which Michaels put his title opportunity on the line. Event During the main event Steel Cage match The Undertaker emerged inside the steel cage by breaking through the floor of the wrestling ring and attacked Diesel, dragging him through the hole in the floor to allow Bret Hart to climb over the top of the cage to win the match. After the matches shown live on pay-per-view, three untelevised dark matches were contested at the venue. Aftermath As a result of his victory against Owen Hart, Shawn Michaels challenged Bret Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of WrestleMania XII in an Iron Man match. Michaels won the match and his first WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Bret Hart took a six- month hiatus from wrestling. Following the Undertaker's interference in the Steel Cage match, he wrestled and defeated Diesel at WrestleMania XII.

She may have been a daughter of king Menkaure, the wife of both king Shepseskaf and king Userkaf (the founder of the Fifth Dynasty), the mother of king Sahure.Michael Rice: Who is who in Ancient Egypt, Routledge London & New York 1999, , see p. 96 Some suggest that she was the regent for one of her sons. Perhaps, in her own right, she may have been the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, which aspects of her burial suggests.Robinson, Andrew, Archaeology: The wonder of the pyramids, Nature, 550, 330-331(2017), October 17, 2017 Her mastaba at Giza – tomb LG100 – is located very close to Menkaure's pyramid complex. This close connection may point to a family relationship. Although the relationship is not clear, the proximity of the pyramid complex of Khentkaus to that of king Menkaure has led to the conjecture that she may have been his daughter. Life Khentkaus's burial complex confirms her royal status. Some of her titles are ambiguous and open to interpretation. She appears to have served as regent and may have taken the title of king. On a granite doorway leading into her tomb, Khentkaus I is given titles that may be read either as mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt, as mother of the king of upper and lower Egypt and the king of upper and lower Egypt, or, as one scholar reads it, the king of upper and lower Egypt and the mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt. Furthermore, her depiction on this doorway also gives her the full trappings of kingship, including the false beard of the king. This depiction and the title given have led some Egyptologists to suggest that she reigned as king near the end of the fourth dynasty. That she was the daughter of Menkaure is speculated widely. Much evidence supports the idea. Khentkaus may have been married to king Userkaf and may have been the mother of Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai. Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has stated that it is more likely, however, that Sahure was a son of Userkaf and his wife Neferhetepes. He also suggested that Khentkaus was the mother and regent for her son Thamphthis and the mother of Neferirkare Kakai.Verner, Miroslav. \\"Further Thoughts on the Khentkaus Problem.\\" Discussions in Egyptology 38 (1997), pp. 109, 113-114. Manetho's King List has Menkaure and Thampthis reigning in the Fourth Dynasty, which ties Khentkaus to the end of the Fourth Dynasty,http://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/manetho.html The suggestions of her marriage to Userkaf and having been the mother of Sahure, tie her to the Fifth Dynasty as well.  Titles  *King’s Mother (mwt-niswt) *Mother of Two Dual Kings (mwt-nswy-bitwy) or Dual King and Mother of a Dual King (nsw-bity mwt-nsw-bity) (Dodson and Hilton)Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), pg 68Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens – a hieroglyphic dictionary, London, 2005 *King of Upper and Lower Egypt (Junker) Theories regarding Khentkaus I The \\"Khentkaus Problem\\" has a long history. In the 1930s Selim Hassan proposed that Khentkaus was a daughter of Menkaure, and that she was married first to Shepseskaf and later to Userkaf. Ventikiev was the first to suggest that the title mwt nswt bity nswt bity should be read as, \\"The Mother of two Kings of Upper and Lower Egypt\\". Hermann Junker believed that the existence of the pyramid town that is part of her burial temple complex, suggested that Khentkaus was a very important person and that her title should be read as, \\"the King of Upper and Lower Egypt and the Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt\\", indicating that she served as king. He suggested that she was the daughter of Menkaure and the sister of Shepseskaf. Ludwig Borchardt suggested that Shepseskaf was a commoner who married the king’s daughter, Khentkaus. He further thought that Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were sons of Shepseskaf and Khentkaus. Borchardt conjectured that Userkaf was an outsider who was able to take the throne because Sahure and Neferirkare were too young to ascend the throne when Shepseskaf died. Bernhard Grdseloff proposed that Shepseskaf and Khentkaus were the son and daughter of Menkaure, and that Userkaf was a prince form a collateral branch of the royal family who came to the throne when he married the royal widow and mother of the heirs to the throne, Khentkaus. Hartwig Altenmüller suggested that Khentkaus was none other than the lady, Rededjet, mentioned in the Westcar Papyrus. He suggested that Khentkaus was the mother of Userkaf, Sahure, and Neferirkare Kakai. Arielle Kozloff theorized that Shepseskaf was the son of Menkaure with a minor wife who came to the throne after the death of the king’s son, Khuenre. He also theorized that Shepseskaf married Menkaure’s daughter, Khentkaus, and suggested that upon the premature death of Shepseskaf, Khentkaus married the High Priest of Re to secure the throne for her two sons. Vivienne Callender asserted that since the name of Khentkaus did not appear in a cartouche she never ruled Egypt. Instead, Callender preferred to read the mwt nswt bity nswt bity title as, the Mother of Two Kings of Upper and Lower Egypt. She thought Khentkaus had to be a daughter of Menkaure and the wife of either Shepseskaf or Thampthis. She pointed to Userkaf and Neferirkare as the two sons referred to in Khentkaus's title.M. Verner, Abusir III: The Pyramid Complex of Khentkaus, Czech Institute of Egyptology, Praha, 1995 Tomb Khentkaus was buried in Giza. Her tomb is known as LG 100 and G 8400 and is located in the Central Field that is part of the Giza Necropolis. The pyramid complex of Khentkaus includes her pyramid, a boat pit, a valley temple, and a pyramid town.http://gizapyramids.org/code G 8400 page The pyramid complex of Khentkaus I Tomb of Khentkaus I in Giza The pyramid complex of Khentkaus consists of the pyramid, a chapel, a solar boat, the pyramid city, a water tank, and granaries.Porter, Bertha, and Rosalind L.B. Moss. Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs, and Paintings 3: Memphis (Abû Rawâsh to Dahshûr). Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1931. 2nd edition. 3: Memphis, Part 1 (Abû Rawâsh to Abûsîr), revised and augmented by Jaromír Málek. Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1974, pp. 288-289, plans 20, 22, 23. The pyramid originally was described in the nineteenth century as an unfinished pyramid and it had been conjectured that it belonged to king Shepseskaf. The pyramid was excavated by Selim Hassan starting in 1932. The tomb was given the number LG 100 by Lepsius. The chapel consisted of a main hall and an inner chapel. A passage cut in the floor of the inner chapel leads to the burial chamber. The floor of the chapel was covered in Tura limestone. The walls were covered in relief, but the scenes are very badly damaged. Relief fragments were found in the debris when the tomb was excavated by Selim Hassan. The passage to the burial chamber and the chamber itself were lined with red granite. The passageway is 5.6 m long and descends below the main structure of the pyramid. The burial chamber is large and most closely resembles the burial chamber of king Shepseskaf in Saqqara. The burial chamber possibly housed an alabaster sarcophagus; many pieces were found in the sand and debris that filled the chamber. The chamber also contained a small scarab made of a brown limestone. Its craftsmanship appears to connect the scarab to the Twelfth Dynasty.http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/hassan_giza_4.pdf The presence of the scarab leads some to believe that her tomb was reused for later burials. Her solar boat is located to the southwest of the pyramid. A pit measuring some 30.25 m long and 4.25 m deep was cut into the rock. The prow and stern of the boat were upraised and the boat appears to have had a roof. It may represent the night-boat of the sun-god Ra. If so, there may be an accompanying day-boat, yet to be found. Immediately to the east of the pyramid lies a pyramid city. The city is laid out along several streets that divide the city into groups of houses. These houses had their own magazines and granaries. The city was constructed from unbaked mud-brick, and surfaces were covered in a yellow plaster. The city was probably the home of the priests and servants of the pyramid complex. The pyramid city was constructed toward the end of the Fourth Dynasty or beginning of the Fifth Dynasty and seems to have been functioning well into the Sixth Dynasty.Hassan, Selim. Excavations at Gîza IV. 1932–1933. Cairo: Government Press, Bulâq, 1930. pp 18-62 The valley temple of Khentkaus I A causeway connects the pyramid chapel to the valley temple of Khentkaus. The temple lies close to the valley temple of Menkaure, which suggests a close relationship between Khentkaus and Menkaure. In front of the temple a small structure referred to as the \\"washing tent\\" of Khentkaus was discovered. This structure was the location where her body would have been taken to be purified before being embalmed. The debris filling this chamber contained many fragments of stone vessels, potsherds, and flint instruments. The floor is the opening of a limestone drain which runs downward under the ground for a distance of 7–20 m., emptying into a large, rectangular basin.Hassan, Selim. Excavations at Gîza IV. 1932–1933. Cairo: Government Press, Bulâq, 1930. pp 53 The drain is covered by arched sections of the same material, the whole forming an almost circular stone pipe. Although by no means the oldest subterranean water-channel known in Egyptian funerary architecture, according to Hassan, it is the earliest of this particular type and construction. The valley temples of Khentkaus and Menkaure were both partially constructed of mud-brick and finished with white limestone and alabaster. The main entrance is located on the northern side, which is a departure form the more common situation where the main entrance is located to the east. Entering the valley temple from the main entrance, one would walk up a “wide brick-paved causeway which runs up from the valley in a westerly direction.” The doorway was embellished with a portico held up by two columns. Once one enters the doorway, “The doorway opens into a vestibule, the roof of which was supported upon four columns. Near the doorway a statue of king Khafra (father of Menkaure) once stood. Remains of a statue of a king (possibly Khafra) and the body of a sphinx statue were found in the vestibule of the temple. The vestibule opens up to a court which in turn led to the magazines.\\" References Category:Princesses of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Queens consort of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt Category:26th-century BC Egyptian people Category:25th-century BC Egyptian people Category:26th-century BC women Category:25th-century BC women rulers Category:3rd-millennium BC births Category:3rd-millennium BC deaths Category:Menkaure ","title":"Khentkaus I"},{"id":"26921682","text":"Planet is a populated place on the north bank of the Bill Williams River in La Paz County, Arizona. The town was known as a travelers' stopping place, and had a post office from 1902 to 1921. The name was collected between 1976 and 1980 by the United States Geological Survey, and entered into the Geographic Names Information System on February 8, 1980.USGS GNIS Feature Detail Report: Planet Mining The geology of the Planet area is ancient, estimated to be Precambrian, the bedrock being made up mostly of pinkish gneiss and absorbed limestone and amphibolite, which contained hematite-copper. Gold and the copper were discovered in La Paz County in the early 1860s. The Planet area began producing ore around 1868, making it likely the first copper mine in Arizona. Prospectors received trouble from Apaches in the area until 1874, when they were placed on reserves. Smelting and bullion production, assaying at about 5% copper, began in the 1880s. By 1884, the mine had sent more than 6,000 tons of high-quality copper to San Francisco. Transporting freight 28 miles to Planet cost $10 to $18 a ton. There was for a while limited access to Planet, a stage going between the town and Bouse (21.5 miles to the south) three times a week. With 31 lode claims, the mine was noted as a good example of the state's abundant natural resources.Paige, Sidney. Mining Resources of the Llano-Burnet Region, Texas.

In 1981 he graduated from the Hoogeschool voor de Kunsten (currently called ArtEZ) in Arnhem. He taught typography at the Breda academy AKV St. Joost and at ArtEZ. Inspiration During his time in Arnhem, Bloemsma became fascinated by 'Swiss typography' (which is also referred to as the International Typographic Style internationally and 'functionalist' in The Netherlands). First typeface Because of this interest, it was no surprise that his first typeface was a sans serif. According to him, there was no place for serifs in the era of new technologies. However, his interest did not go to the typefaces that were characteristic of the International Typographic Style, Univers and Helvetica. Instead, he admired more non-conformist work of designers like Roger Excoffon, whose Antique Olive especially caught his eye. This typeface has two unusual features that Bloemsma also incorporated into his own typeface called Balance: it is heavy at the top – sturdier at the top than at the base – and it has an 'inverted stress', the horizontal strokes are heavier than the vertical strokes. This 'inverted stress' has the function of leading the eye along the lines of text, in a similar way as serifs do in serif typefaces. Bloemsma tried to sell the first version of Balance to several different type foundries, like Berthold, Linotype and Monotype. In 1986 he digitized the typeface with Ikarus M, a software system developed by his then employer URW in Hamburg. In 1992, the PostScript version of the typeface was finished and published as part of the FontFont library (FSI FontShop International) as FF Balance. Second typeface For his second typeface, FF Cocon, he set out to eliminate every trace of handwriting, as he saw that even Helvetica and Univers contain traces of writing in their stems and terminals. Bloemsma soon realised that removing these elements was more complicated than he expected, as the results often looked unconvincing and unnatural. Finally, he allowed a calligraphic element into the typeface; he gave the terminals of the stems and extenders an asymmetric rounding. He thought that this treatment also had a practical function, similar to that of FF Balance's top-heavy letterforms; leading the eye forward along the line of text. Third typeface His third typeface, FF Avance, was quite a step for Bloemsma, as it was a serif typeface. He realised that serifs could help a typeface read more easily and thus enhance functionality. In this way, FF Avance was another effort into creating a typeface that leads the eye in a forward direction, this time realised by sturdy serifs that point to the left at the top, and to the right at the base of the characters. Fourth typeface His last typeface, FF Legato, is an examination of the traditional notion of diagonal contrast or stress, in this case removing the connection of writing with a broad-nib pen. In effect, Bloemsma made the shapes of the counters almost contradict the outside curves, resulting in more interesting and lively letterforms. Typeface commonality Balance and Legato consist both from curved forms – none of the lines are straight – which can be seen as a tribute to his teacher Jan Vermeulen, whose adage ‘a straight line is a dead line’ was a guideline for Bloemsma throughout his type design career.

The margin is unthickened, simple, and entire. The pedal muscular impression is horseshoe- shaped and interrupted in front. The radula has a large simple rhachidian tooth with, on each side, two large, simple transverse laterals, followed by two minute ones, and a large outer lateral with a strong tridentate cusp, outside of which is a single scale-like flat uncinus, bearing an elongated thickened ridge, but no cusp. Soft parts : the head is provided with two tentacles without eyes or eye tubercles. The muzzle is plain and simple. The foot is thin, orbicular, without lateral or posterior tubercles, processes or fringes. The mantle edge is simple and thickened. The gill is composed of leaflets as in Patella, the series starting on the right behind the head and continued within the mantle edge backward. The body of the animal is asymmetrically placed with regard to the aperture of the shell to afford room for the enormous series of branchial leaflets. The anus opening is behind and above the head slightly to the right of the median line, and indicated by a small papilla.G.W.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=137780 on 2020-08-11 Description (Original description by Bush) This genus is proposed for species of small shells of few convex whorls forming a flattened, little elevated spire with a minute, scarcely raised, nuclear whorl and a large body whorl. The suture is very deep, and somewhat channeled. The umbilicus is small, round, deep, showing some of the whorls with rounded walls. The oblique aperture is nearly circular. The peristome is simple, continuous, slightly attached to the body whorl, and reflected over the umbilicus. The operculum of the type species is thin, roundly ovate. it has a delicate horn color, of few abruptly enlarging whorls indistinctly defined by a spiral thread and showing sinuous transverse lines of growth. The nucleus is slightly excentric. The animal has a broad emarginate head with one pair of long slender tentacles. It has a rather broad, short, tapered, ciliated verge just beneath the base of the right one. There are no eyes. The gill is attached to the left side lying across the top of the body just within the mantle edge. The jaw plates are thin, delicate horn-color with a broad band of very dark brown along the strongly serrate, cutting edges. The inner surface is strongly reticulated, as in species of Velutina. The form of these plates is quite irregular. The cutting edge is oblique, forming an angle of about 135° with the inner or middle, straight edge. The distal outline is very strongly sinuously curved, forming a wide, shallow upper portion and a much narrower basal portion. The radula consists of numerous rows of delicate colored, rather stout, non- serrate teeth, each row having a series of thirteen: —a very small central or median tooth with rather long, strongly curved tip, placed a little above and alternating somewhat with the rest of the series. On either side, one broad strongly hooked lateral, and a much broader second lateral one with correspondingly broad, more pointed hook. Beyond, three, about equal, much narrower, somewhat sickle-shaped, marginal ones with a small triangular, scarcely perceptible, platelike one on the outer edge. The form of the shell and operculum strongly resemble a Choristes elegans var. tenera Verrill of medium size, but the radula shows marked and interesting differences. In that species, or rather variety, there are but eleven teeth in each series, the second or outer lateral tooth having a double or bilobed tip (these.Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, vol. 10, 1899-1900 Species Species within the genus Choristella include: * Choristella hickmanae McLean, 1992 * Choristella leptalea Bush, 1897 * Choristella marshalli McLean, 1992 * Choristella nofronii McLean, 1992 * Choristella ponderi McLean, 1992 * Choristella tenera (A.

Six matches aired as part of the PPV broadcast and three additional matches were held only seen by the people in attendance on the night. With the launch of the WWE Network in 2014 this show became available on demand, but does not include the three dark matches held before and after the main show. The main event was a rematch from the 1992 SummerSlam show as WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart defended the championship against his brother-in-law The British Bulldog. On the undercard the Undertaker faced off against King Mabel in a Casket match. Another match on the show could only end when either Hunter Hearst Helmsley or Henry O. Godwinn was thrown into a hog pen that was erected in the arena. Storylines In Your House 5 featured professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on Monday Night Raw and other World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. Event Following the first match on the broadcast, Jerry Lawler introduced the returning Jeff Jarrett and presented him with a storyline gold record for supposedly selling 500,000 copies of his country music album, Ain't I Great. Lawler then invited Jarrett to do commentary with himself and Vince McMahon for the next match. In the second match Ahmed Johnson was originally supposed to face Dean Douglas, but Douglas claimed that he could not compete due to a back injury.

At the peak of his career in the 1960s and 1970s, his work was widely shown in museums. He had four solo shows at Betty Parsons Gallery, was regularly featured in art journals and is in museum collections. Biography=Early years Thomas Sills was born and raised in Castalia, North Carolina. Before he got involved with painting, he worked in a greenhouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, where the color around him made a strong impression on him. Once in New York, he worked on the docks, as a janitor, and as a deliveryman.L.S. Sims, \\"Thomas A. Sills: A Eulogy\\" in Thomas Albert Sills (1914–2000): A Retrospective of the Work. Cleveland, OH: Corcoran Fine Arts Limited, 2000. Career Sills spent most of his creative life in New York City, deeply rooted in the artistic trends as well as cultural issues from the early 1950s to 1970s. He knew Willem de Kooning who visited his studio and told him not to throw anything away before anyone had seen it. Others in the NY circle gave him advice. At the time of his first solo show, Barnett Newman sent him a letter of congratulations.L. Campbell,\\"The Flowering of Thomas Sills\\" in Art News, March 1972. His friendships with Newman and Mark Rothko placed him at the intellectual center of the Abstract Expressionist movement, but like de Kooning, Arshile Gorky and Franz Kline, Sills believed that it was not necessary to explain his art; he painted what he felt and it came from within. Sills began his work as a fine artist when he was in his mid-thirties, about the time he married the mosaicist and art collector Jeanne Reynal, who was an important member of the surrealist movement in the United States. Essentially self-taught and inspired by Reynal's collection of abstract art, he began working with the materials he found in her mosaic studio, but soon branched out to oil on wood as well as canvas. Through his exploratory approach to materials, Sills was able to release phantasmical abstract paintings. Intrigued by the light quality of mosaics, a similar luminosity emerged in Sill's bright oil compositions. His provocative handling of color and innovative use of media attracted the attention of the New York avant-garde. Sills's regular presence in the art world of the 1950s through the early 1970s as an African-American painter situated him as an integral element of the mainstream and African-American art. Thomas Sills perceived his art to be beyond the political. He found in Art a form of expression for the dynamism that escapes any formal constraints. Sills' work was highly intuitive and he too sought inspiration from indigenous art—in the 1950s he made frequent trips to Mexico to study the sculptures, frescos and architecture of Chiapas and the Yucatan. At the peak of his career in the 1960s and 1970s, his work was widely shown in museums. He had four solo shows at Betty Parsons Gallery, was regularly featured in art journals and is in museum collections. Today, there is a renaissance of the popularity of his works. He is being exhibited in many shows, most recently African American Abstract Masters at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery, New York and Abstraction Plus Abstraction at Wilmer Jennings Gallery at Kenkeleba, and Encore, Five Abstract Expressionists at Sidney Mishkin Gallery of Baruch College, The City University of New York in 2006. His work has been acquired by over 30 museums, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum Modern of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the High Museum of Art, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the Newark Museum.M.A. Rose, African American Abstract Artists, New York: Anita Shapolsky Gallery, 2010.S.

Since its foundation in 1992, the foundation has grown from one residential treatment centre for adolescents to a broad range of initiatives, from four residential treatment centres for adolescents with drug and alcohol problems (PALM: Programme for Adolescent Life Management), to adolescent life management aftercare, family and adolescent counselling on an 'outclient' basis, schools counselling, indigenous counselling, an outreach/educational project called 'Street University' and a number of Social Enterprise endeavors such as fashion- oriented op-shops and 'Gideon's Shoes,' dealing in design, manufacture and retailing. History The organisation was born out of its predecessor, The Wayside Foundation, which was established by the Rev.Ted Noffs in 1970 and renamed The Ted Noffs Foundation in 1992 to recognise the work of its founder. As early as 1969 Noffs had written, 'To the traditional hazards that adolescents have to face- in terms of adjustment to members of the opposite sex, separation from the family unit, finding a job, seeking a new area of accommodation, finding meaning and purpose in life- there must be added the new one of overcoming the trauma of exposure to drugs.'The Wayside Chapel, Ted Noffs Pp. 154-155, Collins, 1969 Since that time the organisation has expanded considerably, establishing a leading role in drug and alcohol services in NSW and the ACT. Services The following are the programs run by the Organization. PALM (Programme for Adolescent Life Management). This programme now comprises four residential programmes in Sydney, Coffs Harbour and Dubbo in NSW and in Watson, ACT. These programmes are run on the basis of the therapeutic community model, augmented for the treatment of adolescents suffering the effects of drug and/or alcohol misuse and the many socio- psychological determinants and consequences of this problem PALM residences are 'client-centred' insofar as the clinical and therapeutic aspects of the programme are tailored to meet the needs of the individual, which are not homogeneous. A spectrum of therapeutic strategies exists in the residences including individual counselling, group counselling, vocational/educational modules and recreation. CO-OP (Community Outreach and Outclient Programme). This project commenced operation in 2005 in the ACT to provide a suite of flexible community-based services to assist young people aged 12 to 18 years of age who are experiencing the effects of problematic drug/alcohol use. This is a non-residential, 'outclient' initiative. Overall, the aims are to provide information on, and refer clients to, available services; to advocate on behalf of clients, provide them with counselling and, wherever appropriate, their families, and to reduce or eliminate substance abuse and related difficulties amongst young people. An outclient project run from its offices in Mt Druitt, NSW, this entity provides a number of schools programmes, individual and family counselling, and takes counselling services and schools programmes to indigenous communities in the surrounding areas. Outclient counselling services An 'outclient' and 'outreach' project working from its offices at Mt Druitt, this entity provides a number of schools programmes and individual and family counselling locally and to surrounding areas, including indigenous communities. For the latter an indigenous family and schools counsellor is employed. The aim of the Outclients Counselling Services is to effect a strategy of early intervention in drug and alcohol abuse problems amongst young people aged between 12-25yrs. Schools counselling provides education and skills to enhance students' ability to adopt a discerning point of view in relation to such activities and, if affected, to reduce or stop their intake altogether. A by-product is a decrease in school dropout rates. Individual and family counselling provides support and advice on a more personal level in the instances when this is desired. Street University Situated in Liverpool, NSW, this is a recently begun initiative, having opened in 2008. It represents an engagement of the community in situ. Created in a renovated warehouse, the premises now include a multimedia room, a recording studio, counselling rooms, class/lecture rooms, offices, a multi-purpose sports court, a library and a cafe. The combination of leisure and educational activities is designed for socially, educationally and economically marginalised young people who are vulnerable to drug/alcohol abuse, crime and other anti-social phenomena. The range of components that Street University provides includes numeracy and literacy classes, homework help, educational courses and lectures, music and art facilities, sports and social activities and counselling when desired. The project is attended by increasing numbers of young people from many cultural/ethnic backgrounds in Sydney's West. ADWU (Adolescent Drug Withdrawal Unit) Operating in Watson, ACT, this is a two-week residential detoxification unit for adolescents. It can function either as a withdrawal unit for young people suffering the effects of prolonged use of highly addictive substances such as opioids, or simply a professionally supervised two-week drug-free break from more intermittent but nonetheless problematic drug/alcohol use. ASK! This is a free legal service providing advice to young people between the ages of 14–21 years. The project functions in conjunction with King & Wood Mallesons. Partnerships Ted Noffs Foundation partners with Caretakers Cottage, a South Eastern Sydney-based youth homelessness non-governmental organisation.

At the same time, for the Confucian School of Thought, Interactions between Heaven and Mankind provided a set of checks and balances on a reigning monarch. This ganying in the title is a Chinese cultural keyword meaning \\"correlative resonance; stimulus and response; moral retribution\\". History Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind is said to originate from The Great Plan [of Jizi], the 24th Scroll of the Book of Documents. Dong Zhongshu based his doctrines on this theoretical framework, believing that heaven (天) had its own consciousness and controlled everything through the “100 Lords of Heaven” with all natural laws and variations in human affairs decided by them. Moreover, he believed that human physiological structure, thought, emotions and moral character are all modelled according to heaven’s will and thus that mankind is the incarnation of heaven. Furthermore, Dong Zhongshu believed that a monarch was ordained by heaven as its representative. Auspicious heaven honoured the ruler; calamitous heaven condemned his thinking with all calamity caused by political errors. If a calamity such as an earthquake or prolonged drought occurred, the Emperor was obliged to issue an edict of self-criticism (罪己詔/罪己召) admitting his lack of ability and virtue, leave the royal palace, enter a period of fasting, profess his guilt or pardon some prisoners. This edict should be frank and not hide anything so as to make up for the error. Statistics compiled by the Chinese academic Xiao Han (蕭瀚) show that from the time of the fifteenth Han emperor onwards edicts of self-criticism were issued 8 times by Emperor Xuan, 13 times by Emperor Yuan and 12 times by Emperor Cheng. Xiao Han’s research on the Twenty-Four Dynastic Histories shows that in total 79 edicts of self- criticism were issued. For example, in June 221 CE during the Three Kingdoms period an eclipse occurred and Cao Pi, first emperor of Cao Wei, issued an edict of self-criticism. In 1213 CE, Emperor Ningzong of Song issued an edict of self-criticism during thunderstorms that occurred in September. During Emperor Zhangzong of Jin’s reign during a widespread drought in 1190 CE, he commanded the people to pray for rain and the prime minister and senior officials to show their guilt. The emperor further asked Hanlin Academy Dang Huaiying (党怀英) to draft a suitable edict of self-criticism for him. During a critical period in the final years of the Northern Song dynasty (960 – 1127 CE), when Jin or Jurchen troops were at the wall of his capital, Emperor Huizong also issued an edict of self-criticism: > Words conceal the roadway pass, flatter the sun’s reputation, flatter lucky > autocracy and allow corrupt officials to enjoy success. Taxation exhausts > the wealth of the people and saps the strength of garrisoned troops. Much is > done in a wasteful manner which is not beneficial.History of the Song > dynasty, Huizong Biographical Sketch Chinese academic Hu Shih believed that the doctrine of Interactions Between Heaven and Earth was the origin of the ideas of Mohism.

It was a direct-to-video film, although at the same time after its release, it was sometimes aired on The Disney Channel. Plot The movie starts off with art supplies and dramatic music. The art supplies draw an EC Comics knockoff that the camera zooms into, showing a family on vacation. The family sees a \\"No Hunting\\" sign that seemingly says you can only hunt monsters called \\"tropopkins\\", and the kid of the family, Todd (Billy Corben), just happens to have a comic detailing what a tropopkin is. Todd's mom Abby (Molly Cheek) has a weird sense of humor and suggests that the sign could mean only tropopkins are allowed to hunt. Almost instantly the roar of a tropopkin is heard. Todd doesn't see the tropopkin, but he does find a giant chicken-like footprint, which matches the tropopkin footprint in his comic. Just then a beautiful woman appears and seems to be flirting with Todd's dad George (Alan Thicke), who acts like a seemingly generic grumpy 1950s dad - humorless, irritating, and super-serious. Sometime later, a monster appears one night in the woods and chases Abby until catching her, and wrapping her in a cocoon. 6 months later, Todd is sadly living with his grandparents Shirley and Norman (Alice Hirson and George Gaynes) after the incident, with all, except Todd, believing the mother to be dead. George arrives and reveals that he will marry Denise Gore (Robin Riker), the suspicious beautiful woman from earlier, and has been dating her for the entire six months following Abby's disappearance and the time Todd got left with his grandparents. Todd has been unaware of this, and even the grandparents call out George for it. There is a short little heartwarming scene between Todd and his grandpa Norman, filled with random sports metaphors, in the style of Sisko from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, on how everything is like baseball, or how everything ties into baseball. Todd begins to get suspicious of Denise after her sees her gnawing on a bone, just like how he saw a tropopkin do the same thing in a comic book that details various things. Denise also has some tiny creature in a box that she talks to, and feeds it a live goldfish. George enters, notices a missing fish automatically, and blames Todd for it. The scene cuts to Todd being a peeping tom and watching his neighbor Wendy (Ami Dolenz) strip down. This ties into the plot, because Todd catches Denise eyeing a jogger at night. She flirts with some fat, bald, middle-aged jogger (Mark Barbolak) who follows her, steps in a gooey dog mess leftover from a pet dog she seemingly ate, doesn't find this suspicious at all, and continues following her. The jogger seemingly finds a half eaten dog with her shoe, and he doesn't find this at all suspicious, and off-camera, Denise eats the jogger. The next morning, the newspaper headline states \\"Jogger Found Dead\\", presumed to have been eaten by a dog. That night, George and Denise decide to go out and hire a babysitter for Todd, which happened to be Wendy, the neighbor that Todd was peeping on earlier. Wendy's boyfriend \\"Phlegm\\" (Corey Feldman) comes in, and he and Wendy have a date, much to Todd's dismay. Phlegm turns out to be smart, as he explains about how Denise is waiting on the summer solstice to eat George, and reveals that he knows this because he also reads comic books. It just happens that the summer solstice is on the same day as the wedding. The next night, Denise is following a young paperboy (Eric Mettner) around, but this time Todd is there to watch her become her monstrous form. Todd watches her eat the little kid alive, tries to take photos for evidence that he wasn't just reading too many comic books about monsters, and runs off. Todd gets the photos developed and shows them to his neighbor/babysitter without looking at them. However, they all seem to be photos from when he was peeping on her, as the ones of Denise in her real form instead came out in nothing but fuzz. Later that day, Todd found out the thing Denise keeps in her box is a giant bat-like monster. Todd goes after it with a baseball bat, breaks a bunch of things in the process, and ends up reprimanded by his dad. Todd tries to tell George that the bat-like thing is called a harpy, and that harpies help tropopkins, but a disbelieving George grounds Todd and throws away his comics. George goes off to leave Todd alone with Denise. Due to this, Todd runs off to tell his grandfather all about tropopkins, but his grandfather doesn't believe him. With no one believing Todd, the evil monster forces Todd to do chores, during which Todd gets the idea to make a big trap to catch Denise in her monster form. Predictably, she turns back into a human the second George comes back. Todd gets taken to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Emmerson (Edie McClurg). He tells Dr. Emmerson the whole truth and nothing but, and she predictably ignores it all and assumes that he's just exaggerating things and that the two would get along if Todd gave her a chance. Denise is then sent to go see Dr. Emmerson, and predictably, she turns into her tropopkin form and eats her, destroying evidence that Todd knew what he was talking about. Todd's grandpa takes him out to a comic shop run by a flamboyant, cleanfreak Spock-like guy (Sean Whalen), and they look for a comic book on tropopkins so Todd can find out how to defeat them. Sadly, the comic book is $500, being a collector's copy. Todd then seemingly goes to peep on Wendy again, but sees Denise going after her. He goes to warn her, and instead sees her in her underwear. As Wendy freaks out, the monster bursts through her door. The monster instead freaks out when it's covered by a blanket, and then flees. This convinces Wendy what Todd had been saying. Todd then comes up with a plan: to get a loan on his violin to buy the $500 comic book—simply to gain the defeating information and then return the comic book and pay the pawnbroker right back, but Todd's dad George catches Todd in the act and threatens to throw the comic book away. Upon finding out that Todd got a loan on the violin, George angrily and rashly ripped up the $500 comic book into shreds. Todd and Wendy search through the garbage that night for the comic pieces and find all but the one piece of the comic book that reveals the monster's one weakness—just what Todd needed. The wedding day arrives, and there is a shot of Denise, in monster form, in her wedding dress, using a deep voice—her real voice, which George doesn't find suspicious for more than a split second. Todd waxes the steps in the hopes Denise will fall and reveal her true form. Denise falls down the steps as expected but turns out completely fine. The minister (John Astin) then pronounces George and Denise man and wife. By coincidence, Todd manages to find the last piece of the comic book hidden under the couch that reveals the weakness: Violin music, which explains Denise's hatred of the violin. Todd gets out his cassette recording of violin music, and Phlegm brings a bunch of Marshall amps to make the music loud to defeat the monster. Now believing Todd, Norman arrives to help blare the violin music to defeat the monster. They carry out their attack when George and Denise are alone in their bedroom that night, and George finally witnesses his wife transform. She doesn't kill him though, simply knocking him out with a wine bottle before running outside and being incapacitated by the violin music. It turns out to be a trick, as the monster soon gets back up and goes after Todd, while her harpy arrives to destroy the cords that connect the amps, stopping the violin music and wrecking the cassette. Just then George, having recovered, comes out with a violin (George had paid the loan back), and plays it at the monster—a Deus ex machina. The grandfather's non-sequitor baseball reference from earlier turns out to be useful, as the kid ends up killing the harpy with it. The violin music kills Denise, and she disintegrates into nothingness. Todd and his dad reconcile. The next day, as part of the reconciliation, Todd and George go hiking in the area from the beginning of the film. They find Denise's cave, complete with cocoons where Denise stored food for the winter. Todd and his dad free the victims from the cocoons, and the 3rd and final cocoon turns out to be Todd's mom Abby, who is alive! The film ends with the family happily walking away together while the camera pans down to reveal the comic book shown throughout the film, depicting the ending scene in panel-form.

The location of the settlement was initially not entirely successful. The first buildings were situated too close to the mine workings and so as the village began to grow new buildings were constructed further up the slope. there were also difficulties getting fresh water to the settlement. In the summer, tankers delivered water to the settlement from a nearby creek. In winter, water had to be brought from the Anyuy river some 40 km away. When neither of these options was feasible, water had to be used that had collected in reservoirs formed by the waste pits from mining activities. Post-Soviet period The settlement was abandoned when the extraction of gold was no longer economically viable.deadcities.ru - Vesenny The mines were declared unprofitable and that there was no possibility of developing any other form of economy in 1999 and the settlement was closed along with a number of others in Chukotka.Постановление Правительства РФ от 2 февраля 1998 г.

Pedro Fernandez de Castro was Lord (Señor) of Lemos and Sarria and served as mayordomo mayor (lord steward) of Alfonso XI of Castile, adelantado de la frontera (governor) of Andalusia, Galicia and Murcia and pertiguero mayor (a title similar to the French Vidame) of the lands of Santiago. He was the father of Fernando Ruiz de Castro (toda la lealtad de España), Queen Juana de Castro (wife of Peter of Castile), the controversial Inês de Castro (consort King Peter I of Portugal) and Álvaro Pires de Castro. Family Origins Pedro Fernandez de Castro (el de la Guerra) was the son of Fernando Rodríguez de Castro and his wife Violante Sánchez of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Sancho IV, King of Castile and Leon. He was the paternal grandson of Esteban Fernández de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria, and his wife, Aldonza Rodríguez de León, granddaughter of Alfonso IX of Leon. On his mother's side, he was a grandson of Sancho IV of Castile, King of Castile and León, and his mistress María Alfonso Téllez de Meneses. Biography His father, Fernando Rodríguez de Castro, was killed in battle in 1304, while fighting against Infante Philip of Castile, son of Sancho IV of Castile. On the death of his father, Pedro was sent by his mother to the Kingdom of Portugal, where he was raised and educated along with Infante D. Pedro, Count of Barcelos, an illegitimate son of King Denis of Portugal. Around the year 1319, Pedro Fernandez de Castro returned to Galicia and Alfonso XI of Castile gave him his ancestral manor of Lemos and Sarria and appointed him Lord Steward of the realm. In 1330, Pedro accompanied King Alfonso on his campaign into Granada and led the Christian attack at the Battle of Teba In 1334, Afonso IV of Portugal invaded the kingdom of Castile and León, entering through the lands of Galicia. However, Pedro Fernandez de Castro refused to fight against him, due to the favors he received in the past at the court of Portugal. Alfonso XI gave him the County of Trastámara, which the sovereign had intended to give his son Henry. Due to his military skills, Alfonso XI sent Pedro Fernandez to fight Muslims in Andalusia, where he fought at the Battle of Salado in 1340, where tradition refers to Pedro Fernandez de Castro grabbed his spurs of gold from the Marinid sultan of Morocco, Abu Al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman. He participated in the siege of Algeciras in 1342, which he led his retinue in the company of Martín Fernández de Gres, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela. Pedro Fernandez de Castro died in 1342, being a victim of an epidemic during the siege of Algeciras. Marriage and offspring His first wife was, Beatrice of Portugal, Lady of Lemos, youngest daughter of Afonso of Portugal, Lord of Portalegre and Violante Manuel, granddaughter of King Ferdinand III of Castile and León. There were no children from this marriage. His second wife was, Isabel Ponce de Leon, daughter of Pedro Ponce de Leon, Lord of Cangas and Tineo, and his wife, Sancha Gil de Braganza. Their children were: * Fernando Ruiz de Castro toda la lealtad de España (\\"all the loyalty of Spain\\")(1377), Count of Lemos, Sarria and Trastamara, standard-bearer and steward of King Peter of Castile. * Juana de Castro (died 1374), first married Diego López de Haro, Lord of Orduña and Valmaseda, son of Fernando Díaz de Haro and Maria of Portugal and, after her husband's death, married King Peter of Castile in 1354.

The Sins of Dorian Gray is a 1970 film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray starring Helmut Berger. Directed by Massimo Dallamano and produced by Harry Alan Towers, the film stresses the decadence and eroticism of the story and changes the setting to early 1970s London. The sexual liberation of the late 1960s and early 1970s provides a fitting backdrop for Dorian's escapades in this version, and also the general clothing and fashion style of the era is extrapolated into a 1970s version of the aesthetic, decadent world of the 1890s novel. Critical opinion of the film is decidedly mixed. On the one hand, some consider the film trash and sexploitation, while others point out that the film was shot at a unique time in the 20th century when a new openness about sexuality and its depiction on film allowed showing scenes only vaguely hinted at in the novel and earlier (and also later) movie adaptations. A marked difference between this version and the novel is the final scene. Instead of Dorian slicing the painting with the knife (thereby inadvertently killing himself), he is seen committing suicide with the knife deliberately.

However, Chinese troops occupied an area of , which was disputed land controlled by Vietnam before hostilities broke out.O’Dowd, p. 91. In some places such as the area around Friendship Gate near the city of Lạng Sơn, Chinese troops occupied territories which had little military value but important symbolic value. Elsewhere, Chinese troops occupied the strategic positions of military importance as springboards to attack Vietnam.Nayan Chanda, p. 10. The most symbolic part was a 300-meter section of railroad track between the Friendship Gate and the Vietnamese border post. The Chinese occupation of border territory angered Vietnam, and this ushered in a series of border conflicts between Vietnam and China to gain control of the area. These conflicts continued until 1988, peaking in the years 1984–1985.Joyaux, p. 242. By the early 1990s, along with the withdrawal of Vietnam from Cambodia and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the relationship between the two countries gradually returned to normality. By 1991 the two countries officially proclaimed the normalization of their diplomatic relations, thereby ending the border conflicts. Background After 1979, there were at least six clashes on the Sino-Vietnamese border in June and October 1980, May 1981, April 1983, April 1984, June 1985, and from October 1986 to January 1987. According to Western observers, all were initiated or provoked by the Chinese to serve political objectives.Carlyle A. Thayer, \\"Security Issues in Southeast Asia: The Third Indochina War\\", Conference on Security and Arms Control in the North Pacific, Australian National University, Canberra, August 1987. The imminent threat of another invasion by the northern neighbor impelled Vietnam to build up an enormous defending force. During the 1980s, around 600,000–800,000 Vietnamese regulars and paramilitaries were estimated to have been deployed in frontier areas, confronted by some 200,000Li, p. 259.–400,000 Chinese troops. Throughout the conflict, the Vietnamese Vị Xuyên District was the most violent front. According to cursory examination, seven divisions (the 313th, 314th, 325th, 328th, 354th, 356th, and 411th) and one separate regiment (the 266th/341st) of Vietnamese forces were involved on this battlefield in the mid-1980s. On the Chinese side, armies from seven military regions were rotated through this area to \\"touch the tiger's butt\\", a euphemism for obtaining combat experiences given by Chinese paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. From 1984 to 1989, at least 14 Chinese armies had been substitutionally committed to the fight in the area (1st, 12th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 20th, 23rd, 26th, 27th, 38th, 41st, 42nd, 47th, and 67th). Besides the use of regular forces, China also armed and trained ethnic resistance groups (especially from the Hmong people) to wage unconventional warfare against the governments of Vietnam and Laos.O'Dowd, p. 70. From 1985, Chinese support for these insurgents began to shrink, as the Laotian government initiated normalization of relations with China.Quincy, p. 441. 1980: Shelling of Cao Bằng Since early 1980, Vietnam had orchestrated military operations during the dry season to sweep Khmer Rouge forces over the Cambodia-Thailand border. To put pressure on Vietnam to withdraw military forces from Cambodia, China had garrisoned several armies along the China-Vietnam border. China also provided military training for some 5,000 anti-Laotian Hmong insurgents in Yunnan Province and used this force to sabotage the Muang Sing area in northwestern Laos near the Sino-Laotian border.John McBeth, \\"Squeezing the Vietnamese\\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 19 December 1980, p. 9. Vietnam responded by increasing forces stationed at the Sino-Vietnamese border, and China no longer had the overwhelming numerical superiority as it did in its campaign in February 1979.O'Dowd, p. 92. In June 1980, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) crossed the Thai–Cambodian border during the pursuit of the defeated Khmer Rouge. Despite swift Vietnamese withdrawal from Thai territory, the Vietnamese incursion made China feel that it had to act to support its allies, Thailand and the Khmer Rouge. From 28 June to 6 July, in addition to outspoken criticism of Vietnam in diplomatic announcements, the Chinese continuously shelled the Vietnamese Cao Bằng Province.O'Dowd, p. 93. Small-scale skirmishes also took place along the border later in the year, with seven incidents occurring in the first half of October. China accused Vietnam of conducting cross-border raids against Chinese positions in the Luojiaping area, Maguan County, Yunnan Province on 30 September and 1 October, killing at least 5 Chinese.\\"Armed skirmishes on the border between China and Vietnam...\\", UPI, 16 October 1980. The Chinese then replied by an assault against Vietnamese positions in the same area on 15 October, in which they claimed to have killed 42 Vietnamese troops.Zhang, p. 146. The Chinese shelling did not aim at any strategic military target or create any substantial damage in Vietnam. Vietnam felt that the conduct of military operations on a larger scale was beyond Chinese capabilities, and that this gave them a free hand to conduct military operations in Cambodia. The Chinese shelling was indicative of the type of conflict the Sino-Vietnamese border would see for the next 10 years. 1981: Battle of Hill 400 (Battle of Fakashan) On 2 January 1981, the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a ceasefire during the Lunar New Year festival. While this proposal was rejected by China on 20 January, the two sides continued the exchange of prisoners of war. The situation was relatively calm for the next few months. In May 1981, ferocious fighting suddenly erupted in Cao Lộc District, Lạng Sơn Province, when the PLA launched a regiment-sized attack against a height known as Fakashan () to the Chinese and Hill 400 to the Vietnamese. In Hà Tuyên Province (now Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang Provinces), Chinese forces stormed the strategic peak designated as Hill 1688, or named Koulinshan () by the Chinese, and several other positions in its vicinity. Bloody engagements claimed hundreds of lives on each side.O'Dowd, p. 94. The two battles began on 5 and 7 May respectively; the one at Hill 400 persisted until 7 June with a succession of Vietnamese counter-attacks to reclaim the hill.Zhang, p. 147. To justify this military operation, China announced that the attacks were in response to acts of aggression by Vietnam during the first quarter of that year. In retaliation, Vietnamese forces carried out raids against Guangxi Province on 5 and 6 May. A Vietnamese infantry company also struck the Mengdong co-operative commune in Malipo County, Yunnan Province. The Chinese claimed to have fought off these attacks and killed hundreds of Vietnamese soldiers in Guangxi. On 22 May, they reportedly killed 85 Vietnamese soldiers in Koulin, Yunnan. In total, China claimed the deaths of about 300 Vietnamese soldiers during these border clashes. These numbers did not include losses in the battles at Fakashan and Koulinshan, in which Chinese reports accounted over 1,700 Vietnamese personnel killed or wounded. Although the conflict raged on, China did not want to escalate and only deployed border guard units instead of regular troops into the battles. Western observers assessed that China was unlikely to teach Vietnam a \\"lesson\\" like in 1979, especially when Vietnam had strengthened its regular forces in border areas and had a clear advantage in terms of equipment.Michael Weisskopf and Howard Simmons, \\"A Slow Burn on the Sino-Vietnam Border\\", Asiaweek, 22 May 1981, p. 24. Other analysts pointed out that the upcoming rainy season and the recent cuts in its military budget would preclude China's carrying out a large-scale invasion.Michael Weisskopf (from Beijing), International Herald Tribune, 25 May 1981. 1984: Battle of Vị Xuyên (Battle of Laoshan) From 2 to 27 April 1984, in support of Cambodian rebel forces whose bases were being overrun by the Vietnamese Army during the K5 dry season offensive, China had conducted the heaviest artillery barrage since 1979 against the Vietnamese border region, with 60,000 shells pounding 16 districts in Lang Son, Cao Bang, Ha Tuyen, and Hoang Lien Son Provinces. This was accompanied by a wave of infantry battalion-sized attacks on 6 April. The largest of them took place in Tràng Định District, Lạng Sơn Province, with several Chinese battalions assaulting Hills 820 and 636 near the routes taken during the 1979 invasion at the Friendship Gate. Despite mobilizing a large force, the Chinese were either beaten back or forced to abandon captured positions by the next day.O’Dowd, p. 98. Chinese documents later revealed that the ground attacks primarily served the diversionary objective, with their scales much lower than that reported by Western sources.Zhang, p. 151-152. In Ha Tuyen from April to July 1984, Chinese forces struck a strip of hills in Vi Xuyen District, named Laoshan () by the Chinese. Laoshan is a string of mountains running from the western Hill 1800 to another hill at the elevation of 1,200 m in the east. This easternmost hill has been referred to by the Chinese as either Dongshan () or Zheyinshan (), and was also the only position on the eastern bank of the Lô River where fighting occurred.O’Dowd, p. 100. The PLA launched their assault at 05:00 on 28 April after intense artillery bombardment. The PLA 40th Division of the 14th Army crossed the border section to the west of the Lô River, while the 49th Division (probably from the 16th Army) took Hill 1200 on the eastern bank.O'Dowd, p. 100, citing from Ziwei Huanji (Counter-Attack in Self-Defence against Vietnam). According to B. P. Mahony, at least three Chinese divisions participated in the attack (B. P. Mahony, \\"Sino-Vietnamese Security Issues: Second Lesson Versus Stalemate\\", meeting of the Asian Studies Association of Australia, University of Sydney, 12–16 May 1986). Other sources have identified the PLA 31st Division of the 11th Army as the unit that assaulted Hill 1200. It is possible both divisions were involved. Even if only two Chinese divisions had been present, they would still have outnumbered Vietnamese forces, with about 24,000 Chinese troops against probably 10,000 soldiers of the PAVN 313th Division. The Vietnamese defenders, including the PAVN 313th Division and 168th Artillery Brigade, were forced to retreat from the hills. PLA troops captured the hamlet of Na La, as well as Hills 233, 685 and 468, creating a salient of 2.5 km thrusting into Vietnam. These positions were shielded by steep cliffs covered by dense forests along the Thanh Thuy River, and could only be accessed by crossing through the exposed eastern side of the Lo River valley.B. P. Mahony, \\"Sino-Vietnamese Security Issues: Second Lesson Versus Stalemate\\", p. 14. After 28 April, fighting remained continued in other places such as Hills 1509 (Laoshan), 772, 233, 1200 (Zheyinshan) and 1030, over which control constantly changed hands. The battle paused on 15 May, as Chinese forces had virtually secured these hills, but resumed on 12 June and again on 12 July as the PAVN mounted counter-attacks in an attempt to recapture the lost positions. Afterwards, fighting was gradually reduced to sporadic artillery duels and skirmishes. According to U.S. intelligence reports, Vietnamese forces had failed to retake the eight hills.\\"Intelligence\\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 2 August 1984. As the result, the PLA occupied 29 points within Vietnamese territory, including Hills 1509 and 772 west of Lo River, as well as Hills 1250 and 1030 and Mount Si-La-Ca in the east. Along the 11-kilometer border segment, the deepest Chinese intrusion was made at Hills 685 and 468 located approximately 2 km to the south. However, the Chinese failed to advance any further than 5 km southward, despite their outnumbering force. The heights continued to be contested in a string of later engagements, which lasted until 1986. To defend the captured area, the PLA stationed two armies in Vi Xuyen region, consisting of four infantry divisions, two artillery divisions, and several tank regiments. Chinese artillery positioned on the hills included 130 mm field guns, 152 mm howitzers, and 40-barrel multiple rocket launchers, while infantry regiments were equipped with 85 mm guns and 100-D mortars. The PLA used tanks in some of the battles. In June, the Vietnamese claimed to have annihilated one regiment and eight battalions of the PLA, equivalent to about 5,500 Chinese casualties.Paul Quinn-Judge, \\"Borderline Cases\\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 21 June 1984, p. 26 They raised the number to 7,500 by August.The Nation Review, 7 August 1984. Referenced from the Hanoi Radio. In contrast, the Chinese reported they had inflicted approximately 2,000 casualties on Vietnamese forces, while losing 939 soldiers and 64 laborers killed during the five-week offensive campaign in Laoshan.Li, p. 260. 1,080–3,000 Vietnamese deaths was additionally claimed by the Chinese after the action on 12 July.Zhang, p. 156. The Vietnamese admitted that the PAVN 356th Division alone suffered 600 killed on that day. \\"Hàng nghìn chiến sĩ thương vong ngày cao điểm trận chiến Vị Xuyên\\", VnExpress, 25 July 2014. 1986–87: \\"Phony war\\" In 1985, the Chinese fired more than 800,000 shells into Vi Xuyen among about 1 million shells targeted on Vietnamese border regions; this number, however, had significantly dropped in the period from 1986 to early 1987, with only several tens of thousands of rounds per month. In 1986, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev called for the normalization of relations between Vietnam and China in a speech in Vladivostok. In October 1986, China also succeeded in persuading the Soviet Union to conduct negotiations on the Cambodia affairs in the ninth round of negotiations between the USSR and China.The Canberra Times, 6 October 1986. Referenced from the AFP in Beijing. However, amid positive diplomatic signals, the situation at the frontier suddenly intensified. On 14 October 1986, Vietnam accused China of firing 35,000 shells into Vi Xuyen and making territorial encroachment. The Vietnamese also claimed to have repelled three Chinese charges against Hill 1100 and the Thanh Thuy Bridge. This development was presumably Chinese reaction either to the Soviet Union's refusal to raise pressure on Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia,\\"A Crescendo for Withdrawal\\", Asiaweek, 2 November 1986, p. 11. or to Vietnamese plans of military activities in Cambodia during the dry season. In January 1987, China had fired some tens of thousands of shells (60,000 shells on 7 January alone) and launched 15 division-sized attacks against Vietnamese positions on Hills 233, 685, 1509, and 1100. Vietnamese claims put the number of Chinese soldiers killed in these attacks at 1,500. China, on the other hand, claimed to have inflicted 500 casualties on the Vietnamese. The Chinese government denied the Vietnamese claim of 1,500 Chinese soldiers killed, but admitted that Chinese forces had suffered \\"considerable losses\\".Brecher and Wilkenfield, p. 161. On 5 October 1987, a MiG-21 fighter jet of the Vietnam People's Air Force was shot down over the Chinese Longzhou County, Guangxi Province.O'Dowd, p. 105-106. According to Carlyle A. Thayer, this wave of fighting had the nature of a \\"phony war\\". Despite heavy clashes in Vi Xuyen, the situation in other border provinces was relatively calm, and the Chinese did not deploy any of their regular units into the fight. The order of battle of both sides remained unchanged during this period of the conflict. 1988: Johnson South Reef Skirmish On 14 March 1988, a naval battle was fought between the Vietnam People's Navy and the People's Liberation Army Navy within the Spratly Islands. The battle saw at least 64 Vietnamese soldiers killed and 3 Vietnamese naval vessels lost, while only one Chinese soldier was wounded in return. The battle resulted in Chinese control over the Johnson South Reef. Five other reefs in the Spratly Islands were also occupied by China in the same year. Aftermath During the 5-year period from 1984 to 1989, the Chinese had fired over 2 million artillery rounds in Ha Giang Province, mainly in the area of of Thanh Thuy and Thanh Duc Communes. The situation was quiet at the town of Hà Giang, 10 miles south of the battle sites, without any considerable barrage. From April 1987, the PLA began to scale down their military operations, yet still routinely patrolled the Laoshan and Zheyinshan areas. From April 1987 to October 1989, they conducted only 11 attacks, mostly artillery strikes. By 1992, China had formally pulled out its troops from Laoshan and Zheyinshan.Li, p. 263. The withdrawal had been gradually carried out since 1989. Atop Laoshan, the Chinese built concrete bunkers and a memorial after the conflict. Only earthen structures remained on the Vietnamese sector, which has been delineated and returned to Vietnam under the 2009 Border Agreement between the two countries. China and Vietnam negotiated the normalization of their relations in a secretive summit in Chengdu in September 1990 and officially normalized ties in November 1991. Thousands of people from both sides were killed in these border clashes. At the military cemetery in Vị Xuyên, there are more than 1,600 graves of Vietnamese soldiers killed during the conflict.Zhou Yu, \\"The Sino-Vietnamese War: A Scar on the Tropic of Cancer\\", Phoenix Weekly, 5 April 2009, p. 34. Retrieved 6 May 2016.O'Dowd, p. 101. Vietnam acknowledged 4,000 killed and 9,000 wounded in the area between 1984 and 1989. \\"Hơn 4.000 chiến sĩ hy sinh bảo vệ biên giới Vị Xuyên\\", VnExpress, 14 July 2016. The Chinese confirmed their corresponding casualty figure as 4,100, including over 2,000 war dead.Zhang, p. 161.

It was the fourth pay-per- view of the In Your House series and the first WWF pay-per-view to take place in Canada since WrestleMania VI in 1990. Seven professional wrestling matches were featured on the PPV portion of the show and four additional matches were held exclusively for the people in attendance at the Winnipeg Arena. The main event of the show featured WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel defending the championship against The British Bulldog. The show was supposed to feature Shawn Michaels defending the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Dean Douglas but Michaels was physically not able to compete on the show and had to forfeit the championship. In its place Douglas defended, and lost the Intercontinental Championship against Razor Ramon. With the launch of the WWE Network in 2014, this show became available on demand, but does not include the dark matches held before and after the main show. Storylines The professional wrestling matches at In Your House 4 featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Storylines between the characters played out on WWF's primary television program, Monday Night Raw. On August 21, 1995 WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel teamed up with Davey Boy Smith to take on the team known as Men on a Mission (King Mabel and Sir Mo) in the main event of the WWF's Monday Night Raw show. Up until that day Davey Boy Smith had always been a face in the WWF, but turned on Diesel that night, attacking him and then leaving him alone to fight off King Mabel and Sir Mo. The storyline was picked up against at In Your House 3 when The British Bulldog (Smith was billed exclusively as the British Bulldog by then) teamed up with Yokozuna to take on Diesel and Shawn Michaels in the main event. On September 25 the British Bulldog lost a match to the Undertaker by disqualification as he kept attacking his opponent, which led to Diesel running to the ring to chase the British Bulldog off. Two weeks later the Bulldog pinned Diesel during a six-man tag team match, earning a title match in the process. In the weeks leading up to In Your House 4 the WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels had been targeted by the heel Dean Douglas, who claimed to be both intellectually and physically superior to Michaels. In the days before the In Your House show Shawn Michaels was beaten up by a number of Marines outside of a bar, which meant that he was unable to compete at the In Your House show against Dean Douglas. Event In the third match of the night the reigning WWF Tag Team Champions The Smoking Gunns (Billy Gunn and Bart Gunn) successfully defended the championship against the team of The 1-2-3 Kid and Razor Ramon when the Kid and Ramon were not able to work together as a cohesive unit. Following the match the 1-2-3 Kid turned on his partner, finally taking the next step in the storyline between the two. The fourth match of the night was the debut of Goldust (Dustin Rhodes) in the WWF and the first time the audience saw the character live and not via pre- taped segments. On this night, Goldust defeated Marty Jannetty. The sixth match was supposed to feature Shawn Michaels defending the Intercontinental championship against Dean Douglas, but when Michaels was unable to compete Douglas was awarded the championship by forfeit. Gorilla Monsoon the then interim WWF President announced that while he won the championship without a match he would have to defend the championship in a surprise match against Razor Ramon. Playing up the storyline that Dean Douglas was not prepared for Razor Ramon, Ramon defeated Douglas to win the championship, making Douglas the shortest reigning Intercontinental champion, with his reign only lasting the length of the match. Bret Hart joined the commentary team for the main event between Diesel and the British Bulldog to push the fact that Bret Hart was next in line for the championship. In the end Bret Hart ended up hitting the British Bulldog, causing the champion to be disqualified, losing the match but not the title. Afterwards Diesel attacked Bret in retaliation for costing Diesel the match. Aftermath Bret Hart ended up defeating Diesel to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship a month later in the main event of the 1995 Survivor Series. The title loss led to Diesel's character gaining more of an edge and attitude, teasing his eventual heel turn. After his disqualification victory over Diesel the British Bulldog got the first title match against the new champion, losing to Bret Hart at In Your House 5. After his brief run with the Intercontinental championship Dean Douglas was moved out of the championship picture, relegating him to mid-card storylines before he left the WWF by the end of 1995. The night after the event was the Debut of Ninja Ranger Avatar. The Diesel vs British Bulldog main event was very poorly received, it also angered Vince McMahon (who was doing commentary) to the point that he reportedly threw his headset off after the match and the pay- per-view had finished and yelled \\"horrible, f**king horrible!\\" at Diesel in the ring and stormed to the back and launched a verbal tirade at producer Bruce Prichard. Bulldog as soon as he got backstage after the match immediately apologised to agents and producers for how bad the match was. Years later Kevin Nash said that this was a sign his time in the company was coming to an end.https://whatculture.com/wwe/10-wwe-matches-that-made-vince- mcmahon-angry?page=8 ResultsOther on-screen personnel {border=\\"0\\" valign=\\"top\\" ;Commentators *Vince McMahon *Jerry Lawler *Jim Ross valign=\\"top\\" ;Referees *Jack Doan *Tim White *Earl Hebner } See also *Professional wrestling in Canada References 04 Category:Events in Manitoba Category:1995 in Manitoba Category:Professional wrestling in Manitoba Category:1995 WWF pay-per-view events Category:October 1995 events in Canada Category:WWE in Canada ","title":"In Your House 4"},{"id":"26922341","text":"Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) or investment court system (ICS) is a system through which investors can sue countries for discriminatory practices. ISDS is an instrument of public international law, and it contains a number of bilateral investment treaties, in certain international trade treaties, such as the USMCA. A version of it also appeared in the older NAFTA (chapter 11), and the CPTPP (through incorporation of TPP chapter 9) and CETA (sections 3 and 4) agreements. ISDS is also found in international investment agreements, such as the Energy Charter Treaty. If an investor from one country (the \\"home state\\") invests in another country (the \\"host state\\"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an arbitral tribunal. While ISDS is often associated with international arbitration under the rules of ICSID (the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes of the World Bank), it often takes place under international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIA), or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.  Foreign investment protection = Historical development  Under customary international law, an investor state can vindicate injury caused by the host state by exercising diplomatic protection, which may include retorsion and/or reprisals. In addition to diplomatic protection, states can and do establish ad hoc commissions and arbitral tribunals to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the host state (\\"state-state-dispute-settlement\\", SSDS), which can help avoid coercive resolutions. Notable examples of this practice are the Jay Treaty commissions, the Iran–United States Claims Tribunal and the American-Mexican Claims Commission. However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.  Modern practice  Currently, the legal protection of Foreign Direct Investment under public international law is guaranteed by a network of more than 2,750 bilateral investment treaties (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the Energy Charter Treaty and number of Free Trade Agreements such as NAFTA containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed in the late 1980s and early 1990s before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s. The majority of the treaties provides foreign investors with substantive legal protection (including the right to \\"fair and equitable treatment\\", \\"full protection and security\\", \\"free transfer of means\\" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against host states for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favor of the host state and approximately 31% in favor of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court. Chapter 11 of NAFTA includes an Investor-State provision. Notably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under the treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favor of the state means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it received any compensation from the investor (although costs can be awarded against the investor). A state cannot \\"win\\" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty. ISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the World Trade Organization) which violate trade agreements, but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, ISDS requires specific treaty violations and does not allow corporations to sue solely for \\"lost profits\\". However, violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a chilling effect which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection). Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is by definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS. = NAFTA Chapter 11 = A notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international arbitral tribunal. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the 'local remedies' rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several steps of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where reasonably available, may have been a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid-2000s. Investors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\\"UNCITRAL Rules\\") or under the Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\\"ICSID Rules\\"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the Methanex case.  TTIP  Resistance from the EU side to the US proposal to include an ISDS clause in the draft Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership treaty was such as to cause this element to be abandoned in September 2015. In its place, the European Commission proposed an investment court system (ICS). Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates, though the Commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding. For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated. According to a 2019 study, opposition to ISDS is the single most important factor motivating opposition to TTIP among Germans.  Debates and criticism = Regulatory capacity  Much debate and criticismM.Waibel et.al., The Backlash against Investment Arbitration - Perceptions and Reality, Wolters Kluwer: Austin et.al, 2010 has arisen concerning the impact of ISDS on the capacity of governments to implement reforms and legislative programs related to public health, environmental protection, and human rights.Dupuy, P.M., Petersmann, E.U., Francioni, F., eds. (February 2010). \\"Human Rights in International Investment Law and Arbitration\\", Oxford Scholarship Online. Opponents argue that ISDS threatens Democracy and the Rule of Law, in part because investor state claims (or the threat of them) inhibit the ability of domestic governments to pass legislation addressing perfectly legitimate public concerns, such as health and environmental protection, labor rights or human rights.Why the TPP Is Too Flawed for a 'Yes' Vote in Congress J. Sachs, The Huffington Post, 11 November 2015The real danger in TPP L. Johnson, L. Sachs and J. Sachs, CNN, 19 February 2016 Proponents of ISDS argue that governments retain their regulatory ability if the agreements in question specify that regulations protecting health, the environment, labor rights, and human rights are allowed. The Office of the United States Trade Representative challenges the notion that ISDS challenges \\"the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare\\". The International Bar Association (IBA) mirrors these sentiments, noting that \\"while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly safeguard) a state’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner.\\" The White House notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration. The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case. In a February 2016 op-ed against the TPP, Senator Elizabeth Warren used the example of a French company suing Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage as an argument against the ISDS provisions of the TPP. The editorial board of The Washington Post has, however, challenged this characterization of the case, noting that \\"Veolia of France, a waste management company, invoked ISDS to enforce a contract with the government of Alexandria, Egypt, that it says required compensation if costs increased; the company maintains that the wage increases triggered this provision. The case — which would result, at most, in a monetary award to Veolia, not the overthrow of the minimum wage — remains in litigation.\\" According to the International Bar Association (IBA), states have won a higher percentage of ISDS cases than investors, and that around one-third of all cases end in settlement. Claimant investors, when successful, recover on average less than half of the amounts claimed. IBA notes that \\"only 8 per cent of ISDS proceedings are commenced by very large multinational corporations.\\" IBA challenges the notion that ISDS is biased against developing countries, noting that there is \\"no correlation between the success rates of claims against states and their income levels or development status.\\" IBA notes that ISDS is necessary even in countries with sophisticated domestic legal systems because those domestic courts rule according to domestic laws, not international law. IBA notes that \\"increasingly, awards require the losing party to pay arbitration costs and legal fees to the winning party\\", which deters investors from initiating unmeritorious cases. A 2017 study found that the success rate of investors in investor-state disputes has sharply fallen over time because most legal challenges today seek compensation for regulation implemented by democracies, not expropriation by non-democracies. The author of the study argues that the likely goal of investors is not to obtain compensation through ISDS, but to impose costs on governments contemplating regulations and therefore deter the regulatory ambitions of governments.  Economic impact  The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) claims that ISDS provisions are necessary, as they boost investment: \\"empirical evidence has shown that treaties including these provisions have a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between signatory countries.\\". On the other hand, Hallward-Driemeier (2003) analyzed the impact of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and, after conducting several tests with different dependent variables – absolute amount of FDI, the ratio of FDI to host country’s GDP and the share of host country’s FDI in total FDI outflows of a home country – concluded that BITs do not serve to attract additional FDI. Additionally, Emma Aisbett (2007) found \\"no evidence for the claim that BITs signal a safe investment climate\\". Yackee also concluded that \\"the apparently positive effect of BITs on FDI largely (and in some cases entirely) falls from significance\\", which is consistent with the empirical findings that \\"potential investors seem to have little awareness or appreciation of specific BITs\\". The impact of FDI on the GDP of developing economies is, itself, a matter of research. While some research (Olofsdotter, 1998; Reisen and Soto, 2001) finds a positive impact on developing countries, other authors (Mencinger, 2003; Carkovic and Levine, 2005; Johnson, 2006; Türkcan, Duman, and Yetkiner, 2008; Herzer, 2012) find a negative impact, and some (De Mello, 1999) find the data to be inconclusive. A fourth conclusion was proposed by others (Alfaro et al., 2004; Li and Liu, 2005; Batten and Vo, 2009): FDI may have a positive or negative impact on the GDP of developing economies depending on the existence of adequate policies to \\"filter\\" speculative or predatory investment. Thus, opponents of ISDS warn that these systems may harm the government's ability to filter FDI more favorable to development, and therefore harm GDP. The Cato institute warns that the creation of a two-tier justice system, by which foreign investors are subject to a set of rules different from domestic investors, apart from being contrary to the principle of the Rule of Law, is itself a market distortion prone to inefficiencies that are bound to harm GDP. Finally, opponents of ISDS also argue that these systems increase inequalities, harm public services, threaten labor and consumer protections, threaten financial stability and the environment, all of which have perilous economic consequences.  Conflicts of Interests  PIIE challenges the claim that ISDS \\"arbitrators lack integrity\\", noting that arbitrators take an oath of impartiality and both sides of a case choose arbitrators. Opponents of ISDS argue that, although the system lacks safeguards regarding individual abuse, the most important problem is systemic. Opponents of ISDS note that arbitrators are paid on a case-by- case basis, and therefore they are personally benefited with an increase in claims. Because governments may not use the ISDS system to sue investors, if arbitrators have any bias toward companies of investors, they will encourage further claims and be personally benefited by that increase. The vague terms of most BITs ease this kind of \\"drift\\" on the interpretation of treaties by arbitrators. This drift, fueled by the conflict of interest in the core of the system (that need not assume any lack of integrity on a personal level on the arbitrators side, but solely the cognitive difficulty in overcoming a bias when one's personal interest is at stake) may help explain the explosive growth on the number of known ISDS cases in the last few decades.  Transparency  Opponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms.Van Harten, Gus. \\"OECD Document Discusses Investor State Dispute Settlement\\". Accessed: 7 July 2011. The Peterson Institute for International Economics agrees \\"that secrecy has gone too far\\" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS. Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all arbitration and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case. It is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that \\"public accountability of judges\\" may not be considered a standard of public international law. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges. In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides. While ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other arbitration, the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system. Under Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and amicus curiae briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain standing in the adjudicative process. Under the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor- state arbitration by submitting amicus curiae petitions. The World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding. It also publishes the vast majority of awards with the consent of the parties. If the parties do not consent, ICSID publishes excerpts showing the tribunal's reasoning. The ICSID website has published awards for most completed arbitrations, and decisions in investor-state arbitrations outside of ICSID are also publicly available online. On 1 April 2014, the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration entered into force. Article 3 foresees a general duty to publish all documents pertaining to an ISDS-procedure under UNCITRAL Rules, where the treaty establishing the ISDS-mechanism has been concluded after 1 April 2014 or where the parties so consent, subject to certain overwhelming confidentiality interests listed in Article 7. Original proposals to make all UNCITRAL arbitration under investment treaties public were not adopted after opposition by some states and by representatives of the arbitration industry who participated in the UNCITRAL working group negotiations as state representatives. On 17 March 2015, the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor- State Arbitration ('Mauritius Convention') was opened for signatures in Port Louis, Mauritius. The Mauritius Convention will render the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor State Arbitration also applicable to disputes arising out of investment treaties that were concluded prior to 1 April 2014 if both parties to the investment treaty are also party to the Mauritius Convention. The Convention has not yet entered into force since the three required ratifications have not yet been submitted. 10 States have signed the Mauritius Convention so far.  Tribunals  Investment disputes can be initiated by corporations and natural persons and in almost all cases, investment tribunals are composed of three arbitrators (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). As in most arbitrations, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce. Other individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor- state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the \\"haves\\" over the \\"have nots\\" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.  Examples  According to a 2011 paper, \\"In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country. U.S. investors have won 15 cases, lost 22 cases and settled 14 cases. In terms of performance with respect to developing countries, U.S. investors have won 14 cases and lost 17.\\"  Cases lost by government  ; S.D. Myers v. Canada : Between 1995 and 1997 the Canadian government banned the export of toxic PCB waste, in order to comply with its obligations under the Basel Convention, of which the United States is not a party. Waste treatment company S.D. Myers then sued the Canadian government under NAFTA Chapter 11 for $20 million in damages. The claim was upheld by a NAFTA Tribunal in 2000. ; Occidental v. Ecuador : In October 2012, an ICSID tribunal awarded a judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum against the government of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest and half of the costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm on the grounds that it violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company. ; Ethyl Corporation v. Canada : In April 1997 the Canadian parliament banned the import and transport of MMT, a gasoline additive, over concerns that it poses a significant public health risk. Ethyl Corporation, the additive's manufacturer, sued the Canadian Government under NAFTA Chapter 11 for $251 million, to cover losses resulting from the \\"expropriation\\" of both its MMT production plant and its \\"good reputation\\". : A similar challenge was launched by three Canadian provinces, under the Agreement on Internal Trade, and was upheld by a Canadian dispute settlement panel. Consequently, the Canadian government repealed the ban and paid Ethyl Corporation $15 million as compensation. ; Dow AgroSciences v. Canada : On 25 August 2008, Dow AgroSciences LLC, a U.S. corporation, served a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, for losses allegedly caused by a Quebec ban on the sale and certain uses of lawn pesticides containing the active ingredient 2,4-D.\\"Dow AgroSciences LLC v. Government of Canada\\", US Department of State. Accessed: 12 April 2010. The tribunal issued a consent award as the parties to the dispute reached a settlement.  Cases won by government  ; Apotex v. the United States : Under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, Apotex Inc., a Canadian pharmaceuticals corporation, has alleged that U.S. courts committed errors in interpreting federal law, and that such errors were in violation of NAFTA Article 1102 (national treatment) and Article 1105 (minimum standard of treatment under international law). Apotex also alleged that the challenged U.S. court decision in favor of the Pfizer drug company expropriated Apotex’s investments in generic versions of the antidepressant Zoloft under NAFTA Article 1110 as was manifestly unjust.\\"Apotex Inc v USA\\", US Department of State. Accessed: 12 April 2010. : Apotex relied on the doctrine that a manifestly unjust domestic legal decision breaches international law and can be viewed as a substantive denial of justice.McFadden, M. 1995. \\"Provincialism in US Courts\\", Cornell Law Review 81:31 at 32. Apotex has also brought a similar claim involving U.S. regulatory provisions concerning an abbreviated new drug development application for Pravastatin and patents allegedly held by Bristol Myers Squibb. Apotex has two claims involving different generic products. On 14 June 2013, the Tribunal issued an Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, dismissing all of the claims and ordering Apotex to pay the United States' legal fees and arbitral expenses.\\"Apotex Inc. v. United States of America\\", US Department of State. Accessed: 18 April 2014 ; Chemtura Corporation v. Canada : Chemtura Corporation, a United States agricultural pesticide products manufacturer, alleged that the Canadian government's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) wrongfully terminated its pesticide business in lindane-based products, which are used on canola, rapeseed, mustard seed and cole crops to control flea beetle infestations, and on cereal crops to control wireworm. Chemtura alleged NAFTA violations of Article 1105 (on minimum standards of treatment) and Article 1110 (on expropriation). All claims were dismissed by the Tribunal, given that the measure did not amount to a substantial deprivation of the Claimant's investment and was taken legitimately and without bad faith.\\"Chemtura Corp. v. Government of Canada\\", US Department of State. Accessed: 12 April 2010. ; Philip Morris v. Uruguay : The Philip Morris v. Uruguay case (Spanish: :es:Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International filed a complaint against Uruguay seeking $25 million in damages. The company complained that Uruguay's anti-smoking legislation devalued its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and based its lawsuit on the bilateral investment treaty between Switzerland and Uruguay. The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a part of the World Bank decided it had jurisdiction on 2 July 2013, and three years later ruled in favor of Uruguay, ordering Philip Morris to pay Uruguay $7 million, in addition to all court costs.  Dismissed cases  ; KT Asia Investment Group v. Kazakhstan : The claimant (company incorporated in Holland) was a shell company owned by Kazakh national (Mr. Ablyazov). It owned shares in BTA Bank, which the claimant alleged were nationalized by the respondent (Kazakhstan). The state position was that as owned by a Kazakh national the claimant was not eligible for investment protection under the Dutch-Kazakh BIT. This argument was dismissed by the Arbitrage. The Kazakh state then alleged that it didn’t nationalize the bank, but it bailed it out (wiping out the shares’ value in the process). The latter was due to the embezzlement of depositors’ trust (and funds) by Mr. Ablyazov. Investigating the matter the Arbitrage reached the conclusion that the investment doesn’t meet the Salini test, thus it is not protected under the BIT. As a result the Arbitrage decided it has no jurisdiction to decide the dispute.  Prospects for ISDS  After ISDS claims by investors sharply increased starting in the late 1990s, ISDS came under greater public attention and criticism. This was true for the NAFTA claims against the United States in the late 1990s, for Germany in the wake of the Vattenfall claims in the late 2000s and also for Australia in 2011, when confronted with the Philip Morris claim. In 2011, the Australian government announced that it would discontinue the practice of seeking inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements with developing countries. It stated that it: > \\"...supports the principle of national treatment — that foreign and domestic > businesses are treated equally under the law. However, the Government does > not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign > businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the > Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian > governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in > circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and > foreign businesses.

This statement is a reaction to Philip Morris' ISDS claim under UNCITRAL rules to challenge Australian tobacco Advertising Restrictions. By 2013, Australia had not terminated any bilateral investment treaties allowing for ISDS. Even if it were to do so, most such treaties foresee post-termination-protection for many years after the termination has become effective. In any event, since the election of the conservative Coalition Government in 2013, the Government has entered into free trade agreements (such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Ch 9 section B) that include ISDS. An alternative way ahead may be the preservation of investor protection under public international law, including ISDS, but with more concern for transparency and the balancing of economic and non-economic interests. As noted above, the European Commission proposed September 2015) an 'Investment Court System' to replace ISDS clauses (notably in the draft TTIP), with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with 'highly skilled judges' rather than arbitrators used to determine cases. In this vein, Karel De Gucht, the EU commissioner in charge of negotiating International Investment Agreements declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall \\"fully enshrine democratic prerogatives\\" and \\"explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions – on issues such as the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or \\"the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine\\" – cannot be over-ridden\\". He announced to \\"crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments\\", to \\"open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny – documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, will be able to make submissions\\". Also, he said, the EU \\"will eliminate any conflicts of interest – the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion\\". However, insisting equally on the advantages of such investment protection agreements, he states along that [they] \\"protect job-creating investment from discrimination and unfair treatment\\" and that \\"the task here is to find the right balance between preventing abuse and protecting investments\\". Current controversies over ISDS appear driven by attempts to expand its scope to new countries and, especially, to relations between developed countries with mature court systems and democratic governments. In 2014, several members of the United States House of Representatives expressed opposition to the inclusion of ISDS in the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. In 2015, faced with opposition to ISDS in several European countries, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requiring any new dispute settlement scheme included in TTIP \\"must be replaced by a new public and transparent system of investment protection, in which private interests cannot undermine public policy and which is subject to public law\\". (The Commission's 2015 proposal in response is noted above). South Africa has stated it will withdraw from treaties with ISDS clauses, and India is also considering such a position. Indonesia plans to let treaties with ISDS clauses lapse when they need renewal. Brazil has refused any treaty with ISDS clauses. In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that \\"The arbitration clause in the Agreement between the Netherlands and Slovakia on the protection of investments is not compatible with EU law\\". This ruling could imply that any similar arbitration tribunal considering corporate sovereignty cases would also be illegal under EU law. The process of the UK leaving the EU (known as Brexit) may generate ISDS cases against the UK. For example non-EU financial firms, that based themselves in the City of London in the expectation of continued participation in the European Single Market and subsequently having suffered adverse consequences of the loss of such access under different arrangements, may have an actionable case against the UK Government.

The show aired two pilot episodes and a twenty- episode limited run through late 2010, and aired its final episode on December 30, 2010. Broadcast history=Season 1 TNA Reaction aired its pilot episode on a Monday night on April 12, 2010 at 7pm ET/6C. On May 3, 2010, TNA announced that Spike had picked up Reaction and that the program would start airing every Thursday, prior to that week's edition of Impact!, starting June 24 at 8pm ET/7C. The premiere date was later pushed back to July 15, when it would start airing after Impact! at 11pm ET/10C instead of before it. However, in late June Reaction was pulled from Spike's schedule. On August 3, 2010, TNA announced that Reaction would premiere on August 12 and air every Thursday following Impact! on 11pm ET/10C. After an initial run of ten episodes, it was announced that Spike had picked up the show for ten more episodes. On December 27, 2010, it was confirmed that Spike had canceled the show and its final episode would be airing on December 30, 2010. Format The show was composed largely of segments mimicking a cinéma-vérité documentary, catching wrestlers unawares backstage preparing for their matches, or expressing their emotions immediately following their matches. Some were \\"on-the-spot\\" sit-down interviews regarding the current happenings within the company's storylines. Most of the high-volume, intense yelling typical of wrestling interviews was removed with this format, giving it a feeling of spontaneity, candidness and verisimilitude. After the pilot episode, this style of segment largely replaced the typical structured interview segment (with an interviewer and a set) on the company's flagship show Impact. TNA superstars featured include A.J. Styles, Hulk Hogan, Jeff Hardy, Kurt Angle, and Mr. Anderson and many more. Other segments included the Impact Player of the Week, which highlighted a wrestler with sit-down interviews and source footage from their life, akin to similar segments from WWE Confidential. The show began with an extension of the final scene from that week's Impact, with commentary from Mike Tenay and Taz. The last three months of the show's existence, Impact! main events continued into Reaction time slot, effectively giving Impact! a third broadcast hour. On the November 18, 2010, broadcast of Reaction, an \\"unofficial\\" Empty Arena grudge match was shown, held between Generation Me and The Motor City Machine Guns. It was filmed in the similar candid manner of other Reaction segments, with minimal commentary overdubbed.

Susan played a foundational role in making mindfulness practices developmentally appropriate for young people, and with her first book The Mindful Child she helped pioneer activity-based mindfulness. This technique is now practiced in American schools throughout the country to help children learn how to reduce and alleviate their stress levels. Biography Susan Kaiser Greenland was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1956. She attended Paw Paw High School and Kalamazoo College, and from Brooklyn Law School. She is a retired corporate lawyer admitted to practice in New York and California. In 1993, a family crisis prompted her to seek alternative methods of reducing stress, which resulted in her meditation studies with teachers from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition since 1997. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband. They have two grown children. Career Kaiser Greenland represented ABC network-owned radio and television stations from 1988 to 1993, and CBS network-owned radio and television stations from 1994 to 2005. While working as a lawyer she volunteered in schools teaching secular mindfulness. During her volunteer work she developed the Inner Kids program, a hybrid of classical mindfulness and meditation practices that she adapted for children and families. Kaiser Greenland eventually left her law practice to teach mindfulness and meditation full- time. Kaiser Greenland and her husband, Seth Greenland, founded The InnerKids Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that taught secular mindfulness in schools and community-based programs in the greater Los Angeles area from 2001 through 2009. She currently works in the United States and abroad as an author, public speaker, and educator on the subject of sharing secular mindfulness and meditation with children and families. She has served on the clinical team of the Pediatric Pain Clinic at UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital; the Garrison Institute for Contemplation and Education Leadership Council; as an advisor at the UCLA Family Commons; and has contributed to the online news periodical, The Huffington Post.

Biography Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, to mother Mattie P. Gilbert, and father Reverend Arthur Williams on March 20, 1948. Top honors in a school-sponsored singing competition followed. Marva graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1965 and attended Southern University of Baton Rouge. Wright has four children from two previous marriages: Gerry (Martin) McKey, Elizabeth (Martin) Gainey, James Kelly Jr., and Jeanne (Kelly) Harris. Marva has twelve grandchildren: Sean McKey Jr., Lawrence Martin, Mattie Martin, Stephanie Martin, Richelle Martin, Richard Martin, James Kelly III, Samuel Kelly, Halle' McKey, Olivia Kelly, Dillon Kelly and Jamya Kelly. Wright's first public singing efforts were heard in church at the age of 9, with her mother Mattie Gilbert, a piano player and gospel singer as her accompanist in which they recorded \\"I Walk With The King.\\" Top honors in a school-sponsored singing competition followed. Mahalia Jackson, the esteemed gospel singer, was an early friend of the family. When Wright was discovered she was working as a secretary at Eleanor McMain Junior High in New Orleans. Wright did not turn professional until 1987, when she was almost forty years old. Even then, she only began singing as a way to support her family with a second job, the song that got attention was \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" by Aretha Franklin. Early in 1989 during a live set at Tipitina's in New Orleans, Wright made her first recording, \\"Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean\\". She made her debut on national television in 1991, when her hometown was the setting for a special that revolved around the Super Bowl where she met CBS news anchorman Ed Bradley, who thought at that time that she only sang Gospel. Later that same year he rediscovered her at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and from that day on encouraged her career and introduced her every Jazz Fest. Heartbreakin' Woman, Wright's first full-length release, appeared later that year. Wright's 1993 album Born With The Blues was originally released in France, then three years later the major-label imprint Virgin picked it up for the rest of the world. Her 2007 album, After The Levees Broke, addressed the devastation of Hurricane Katrina - which destroyed her house and all her belongings - by repurposing songs like Willie Nelson's \\"Crazy\\", Sam Cooke's \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", and Bruce Hornsby's \\"The Way It Is\\".. In August 2008, she performed with the Louisiana Wetlands All Stars at both the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado and the Republican National Convention in Minnesota. She also sang backup for such artists as Allen Toussaint, Glen Campbell, Joe Cocker, Cyril Neville, Harry Connick, Jr., Bobby McFerrin, Aaron Neville, Fats Domino, Lou Rawls, and Marcia Ball. In May and June 2009, Wright suffered a pair of strokes from which she never fully recovered. She died on March 23, 2010, a few days after her 62nd birthday at her eldest daughter's home in New Orleans.

Along with works of pure literary criticism on Chaucer, he has published much in a category he calls “criticism of language”, beginning with The Survival of English, which includes comments on the language of the media, of religion, of politics. He thinks that judgement is always a refinement of a sense held in common, and in 2008 published Holding the Centre, trying to demonstrate that a number of the Arts subjects have become incoherent by losing their place in the common language. Robinson has been politically active as secretary of a constituency association of the UK Independence Party. He differs from his mentor Leavis by holding the view that judgement in literature cannot do without Christianity, and has been a trustee of the Prayer Book Society.

It is based on RTMP.86.61.1, a skull, partial lower jaws, and partial postcranial skeleton discovered in the late Campanian–early Maastrichtian-age Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Stangerochampsa was described in 1996 by Wu and colleagues. The type species is S. mccabei. The generic name honors the Stanger family, the owners of the ranch where the specimen was found, and the species name honors James Ross McCabe, who discovered, collected, and prepared it. Stangerochampsa is described as \\"small to medium–sized\\"; the type skull is long from the tip of the snout to the occipital condyle, and is wide at its greatest, while the thigh bone is long. It had heterodont dentition, with large crushing teeth at the rear of the jaws. Classification Wu and colleagues, using phylogenetic analyses, found their new genus to be closest to Brachychampsa, and then Albertochampsa and Hylaeochampsa successively, as part of a clade within Alligatorinae that also included Allognathosuchus, Ceratosuchus, and Wannaganosuchus. This arrangement also unites most Mesozoic and Paleogene alligatorines. Brochu (1999), in an analysis of all alligatoroids, found Stangerochampsa and Brachychampsa to be just outside Alligatoridae, and suggested that Stangerochampsa and Albertochampsa were synonymous. Brochu (2004) and Hill and Lucas (2006) also found Stangerochampsa to be outside of Alligatorinae; Hill and Lucas found Albertochampsa to its sister taxon. On the other hand, in the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Bona et al. (2018) Stangerochampsa was recovered as an alligatorid, specifically as a stem-caiman.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. Synopsis 1990 saw some unusual and powerful tornadoes and tornado outbreaks. On March 13 not one, but two F5 tornadoes struck Kansas, both coming from the same supercell. This was the only day since the 1974 Super Outbreak to have more than one F5 on the same day until the 2011 Super Outbreak, when four EF5 tornadoes touched down on April 27. In June, a strong outbreak struck the upper midwest United States and in late August a powerful F5 tornado struck the city of Plainfield, Illinois, resulting in significant loss of life and damage. Events Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1990 in the United States. January There were 11 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. February There were 57 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. March There were 86 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. March 11–13 This destructive tornado outbreak produced at least 64 tornadoes across the region including four violent tornadoes. Two F5 tornadoes touched down north and east of Wichita, Kansas, including the most publicized tornado, which struck Hesston. In Nebraska, several strong tornadoes touched down across the southern and central portion of the state including an F4 that traveled for over 125 miles. Two people were killed in the outbreak in Kansas, both from the F5 tornadoes. April There were 108 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April. May There were 243 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May. May 14 An outbreak of 17 tornadoes injured nine people in Texas and Kansas, with the strongest being an F3 tornado in Anson, Texas. June There were 329 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. June 2–3 This outbreak occurred in southern Illinois, central and southern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northern Kentucky on June 2 and June 3. 66 tornadoes struck the Ohio River Valley, including seven F4 twisters, resulting in nine deaths. One F4 tornado trekked from southeastern Illinois into southern Indiana, killing one person. 37 tornadoes occurred in Indiana, eclipsing the previous record of 21 set during the 1974 Super Outbreak. In addition, 12 tornadoes struck Illinois. July There were 106 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July. August There were 60 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in August. August 28 A storm system spawned numerous tornadoes on August 28th, including the devastating F5 Plainfield, Illinois tornado. The violent, rain wrapped tornado killed 29 people and injured 350. It is the only F5 tornado ever recorded in August and is the only F5 tornado on record to ever strike the Chicago area. Other tornadoes were also reported in parts of Canada, Michigan, and New York as well. An F3 tornado occurred near Elgin, Manitoba as well. August 31 A tornado occurred in a suburb of Shanghai in association with Typhoon Abe. September There were 45 tornadoes confirmed in the US in September. October There were 35 tornadoes confirmed in the US in October. October 18 A large tornado outbreak in the Eastern United States produced 16 tornadoes, including four F3 tornadoes in Union County, North Carolina, King William County, Virginia, Orange County, Virginia and Somerset County, New Jersey. There was one fatality and 76 injuries from the outbreak. November There were 18 tornadoes confirmed in the US in November. December There were 35 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December. December 20–23 A large, late-season outbreak of tornadoes affected Mississippi and Louisiana on December 20–22. Two tornadoes killed one person each in Mississippi on December 21. An F1 tornado touched down in Ohio on December 23 before the outbreak ended. In all, the outbreak killed two and injured 23.

Habitat This species is found in shallow water on open/exposed coast from low intertidal to at least 30 feet (9 m) and perhaps as deep as 60 feet (18 m). Individuals are found in rock crevices, under rocks and other cryptic cavities. Like all abalone, green abalone are herbivores. They feed mostly on drift algae and prefer fleshy red algae. Predators Predators of this species include sea otters, starfish, large fishes, octopuses, and humans. Diseases Green abalones are subject to a chronic, progressive and lethal disease: withering abalone syndrome or abalone wasting disease, leading to mass mortality. Reproduction Green abalone have separate sexes and broadcast spawn from early summer through early fall. Maturity is reached at 2.4 to 5 inches (61–128 mm) length or 5 to 7 years. Lifespan is up to 30 years or more. Threats and conservation Sun dried meat of the green abalone on San Clemente Island in 1913. Green abalone are threatened by overharvesting and the withering abalone syndrome disease. California has a Abalone Recovery Management Plan to guide conservation efforts. They are a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service species of concern. Species of concern are those species about which the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

This Abalone's shell is iridescent and creamy-white on the inside. It can be found mainly in East Polynesia. It is edible as with most abalones. \\"The small, flattened shell has a rounded-oval shape. The distance of the apex from the margin is about one- fourth the length of the shell. The surface is finely corrugated by radiating deep folds. The generally eight perforations are small, round and tubular. The row is bordered on each side by a shallow channel. This little shell is straighter on the right than on the left margin. The color is whitish or flesh-colored with broad oblique red rays. The surface is finely corrugated. The folds are strong, close and numerous, not extending quite to the row of holes. Their summits are crenulated by inconspicuous spiral striae. Outside of the row of holes the surface slopes flatly to the strong angle or carina at the columellar margin. And the descending folds on this portion are cut into granules by spiral striae. The spire is somewhat elevated. Inside it is silvery. The columellar shelf is flat and rather wide.\\"H.A.

The concept of open and closed discourse is associated with the overlay of open and closed discourse communities and open and closed communication events. Keys to determining whether a discourse is open or closed include access to information, equity of access, open access, quality of discourse and mechanisms and modalities of discourse control: overt, covert, implicit and incidental. As a conceptual filter and cultural construct, ideology is a function and mechanism of discourse control. Channel and signal of a communication event and register of communication together control discourse and therefore, determine the degree of social inclusion and social exclusion and, by extension, the relative efficiency of that communication event. Open and closed discourse operate along a continuum where absolute closure and complete openness are theoretically untenable due to noise in the channel. The nature of the channel, signal, code, replicability, recording, transmissibility, cataloguing, recall or other variable of a communication event and its information control and context of transmission-as-event, impact its relative position along the continuum between open and closed discourse. In all cases, open discourse is assumed to be sustained discourse. Van Dijk (c.2003: p. 357) holds that: > \\"Although most discourse control is contextual or global, even local details > of meaning, form, or style may be controlled, e.g. the details of an answer > in class or court, or choice of lexical items or jargon in courtrooms, > classrooms or newsrooms (Martin Rojo 1994).Van Dijk, Teun A.

See New Book of Tang, vol. 148.), courtesy name Jingci (), formally the Duke of Fufeng (), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, most well known for his failures against Dali incursions but successes against the rebel Pang Xun (with the assistance of the Shatuo chieftain Zhuye Chixin).  Background  Kang Chengxun might have been born in 808. His grandfather was the general Kang Rizhi (), who served under Emperor Dezong and carried the title of Prince of Kuaiji. Kang Chengxun's father Kang Zhimu () also served as an imperial general and carried the title of Duke of Kuaiji.New Book of Tang, vol. 148. Because of his heritage, Kang Chengxun became a general in the imperial guards. During the reign of Emperor Dezong's great-great-grandson Emperor Xuānzong, he was made the defender of the northern border base of Tiande (天德, in modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia). It was said that the army at Tiande lacked horses at that time and therefore was repeatedly suffering defeats when non-Han Chinese incursions occurred. Kang reduced the budgets in areas that he felt were unnecessary in order to bolster the number of horses the base could afford, and it was said that after he did so, the Tiande army had more successes. Dangxiang tribespeople had previously captured the nearby bases of Shediao () and Luoyuan () and taken captives, but when they heard of Kang's strengthening of the forces, they did not dare to attack Tiande and returned the previously-captured people to Kang. Kang was thus given an honorary ministerial title and created the Baron of Kuaiji. He was thereafter made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei).  Campaign against Dali  In 863, a major Dali attack against Tang's Annan District (安南, headquartered in modern Hanoi, Vietnam) captured Annan, and the Tang protector general for Annan, Cai Xi (), died while fighting the Dali forces. They then approached Yong Prefecture (邕州, in modern Nanning, Guangxi), the capital for Lingnan West Circuit (). The military governor of Lingnan West Circuit, Zheng Yu (), who was a career civilian, was fearful of Dali forces and submitted a petition requesting to be replaced by a general. Then-reigning Emperor Yizong (Emperor Xuānzong's son) recalled Kang to the capital Chang'an, intending to have him replace Zheng, and allowed him to bring several hundred officers and soldiers from Yiwu Circuit. Upon Kang's arrival in Chang'an, Emperor Yizong commissioned him the military governor of Lingnan West, and also mobilized about 10,000 soldiers from Jingnan (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), Shannan East (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), Eyue (鄂岳, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), and Jiangxi (江西, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) Circuits to accompany him to Lingnan West.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. After Kang arrived at Yong Prefecture, the Dali attack was intensifying, so Emperor Yizong further mobilized troops from eight other circuits — Zhongwu (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), Yicheng (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), Xuanwu (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), Yanhai (兗海, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong), Tianping (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), Xuanshe (宣歙, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), and Zhenhai (鎮海, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) — to reinforce him. Kang, however, did not set up a proper scouting system. As Dali forces approached Yong Prefecture, Kang sent the troops from six circuits to engage them, using the local Liao () tribesmen as guides; the Liao led the Tang forces into an ambush by Dali forces, and the troops of five circuits were annihilated, with only the Tianping forces, because they were late by one day, escaping the ambush. In the aftermaths, Kang was gripped by fear, and the defenses for Yong Prefecture were actually built by his deputy Li Xingsu (). As soon as Li completed the defenses, Dali forces arrived and put Yong Prefecture after siege. For four days, Yong Prefecture was under attack, and it almost fell. A number of officers suggested counterattacking, but Kang initially refused, relenting only after repeated pleas by a low-level officer from Tianping. At night, that Tianping officer took 300 volunteers and made a surprise attack on the Dali camp, setting it on fire and killing some 500 Dali soldiers. In shock, the Dali forces withdrew. Only then did Kang launch his main forces to try to chase down the Dali forces, but was unable to; they killed only some 300 Liao who were forced to cooperate with the Dali forces. Kang nevertheless submitted a report claiming a great victory. Emperor Yizong, in response, bestowed on Kang the honorific title of acting You Pushe (). However, all of the soldiers who received rewards based on Kang's report were Kang's relatives or soldiers close to him, and the soldiers who participated in the surprise raid were not awarded. This brought much resentment. Subsequently, the military governor of neighboring Lingnan East Circuit (嶺南東道, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), found out what happened, and reported this to the chancellors. Kang himself was fearful as well that his deception would be discovered, so he claimed to be ill and offered to resign. He was recalled to serve as a general of the imperial guards, but with his office at the eastern capital Luoyang.  Campaign against Pang Xun  In 868, soldiers from Xusi Circuit (徐泗, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) who had been sent to Lingnan West Circuit to defend against a potential Dali attack were incensed when they were informed that they were to stay another year at the border. They mutinied and headed toward Xusi's capital Xu Prefecture, under the leadership of the officer Pang Xun. After defeating troops sent by the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) Cui Yanzeng (), Pang captured Xu Prefecture and put Cui under arrest. He demanded official imperial sanction in taking over Xusi, threatening to attack the imperial capital Chang'an if Emperor Yizong refused. Emperor Yizong reacted by commissioning Kang Chengxun as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit and the overall commander of the operation against Pang, while commissioning fellow imperial guard generals Wang Yanquan () and Dai Keshi () as the commanders of the northern and southern wings, respectively. Kang requested his troops to be supplemented with the tribesmen under the Shatuo chief Zhuye Chixin, as well as the chieftains of Tuyuhun, Tatar, and Qibi () tribes, and his request was approved.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 251. As part of Kang's commission, Emperor Yizong also created him the Duke of Fufeng.Book of Tang, vol. 19, part 1. In winter 868, Kang arrived at Xinxing (新興, in modern Bozhou, Anhui), but at that time, he had only a little more than 10,000 men, and when Pang's follower Yao Zhou (), who was then at nearby Liuzi (柳子, in modern Suzhou, Anhui), challenged him, he did not dare to engage Yao and withdrew to Song Prefecture (宋州, in modern Shangqiu, Henan). Meanwhile, the rebels continued to expand their territory, largely unchecked. By spring 869, however, Kang had gathered over 70,000 soldiers and stationed his army just west of Liuzi, and only then did the rebels begin to become fearful. When one rebel commander who did not fear him, Wang Hongli (), attacked him, he, together with Zhuye, defeated Wang, and it was said that starting from that point on, those in the rebel army who did not wholeheartedly support the rebel effort would surrender immediately upon engaging the imperial army. Kang then attacked and captured Liuzi, causing Yao to flee, and Yao was subsequently killed by the fellow rebel commander Liang Pi (). Yao's death shocked and dismayed Pang, who, under the suggestion of his strategist Zhou Chong (), tried to show resolve by officially declaring independence from the imperial government and killing Cui and his top staff members, as well as cutting off the limbs of the Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) officer Li Xiang () and the eunuch monitor Guo Houben () and delivering them to Kang's army to try to strike terror into Kang's soldiers. Pang subsequently launched a surprise attack on the Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), stationed to Xu Prefecture's north, and then turned west, ready to engage Kang. He ordered the rebels to converge on Kang's army, but when Huainan soldiers that he had captured previously fled to Kang and informed Kang of the date that the rebels would attack, the rebel initiative was lost. Kang crushed the rebels who arrived before Pang did, and then, when he engaged Pang, Pang's own forces, in fear, collapsed. Kang captured a number of cities that had fallen into rebel control, and then headed to Su Prefecture (宿州, in modern Suzhou), which was then under the command of Pang's followers Zhang Ru () and Zhang Shi (). Kang launched an initial siege on Su Prefecture but could not capture it quickly. He, however, then persuaded the rebel officer Zhang Xuanren (), who had not joined the rebellion willingly, into killing Zhang Ru and Zhang Shi and surrendering the city. Zhang Xuanren then suggested to Kang that he pretend to be still leading a rebel army and use trickery — pretending that Su Prefecture had fallen and that he was fleeing — to capture the nearby rebel base of Fuli () as well, and Zhang Xuanren's strategy succeeded, allowing the imperial forces to capture Fuli. When Zhang Xuanren tried to use the same trickery to capture Xu Prefecture, which was then defended by Pang's father Pang Juzhi () and ally Xu Ji () (Pang Xun himself having left the city to try to launch a surprise attack on Song and Bo (亳州, in modern Bozhou) Prefectures), the rebels at Xu Prefecture realized what Zhang was up to and tried to defend against his attack. Zhang, however, was able to persuade the populace to abandon the rebels in droves, and quickly, Xu Prefecture fell. Meanwhile, Kang chased Pang, and Pang, after failing to capture Song Prefecture quickly, headed for Bo Prefecture. Kang intercepted him there, and, in a final battle in which the Shatuo soldiers led the charge, crushed the remaining rebels. Pang was killed in battle, and the rebellion was over.  After campaign against Pang Xun  To reward Kang Chengxun for his contributions, Emperor Yizong commissioned him as the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and gave him the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). However, in 870, the chancellors Lu Yan and Wei Baoheng (Emperor Yizong's son-in-law) submitted accusations that Kang was too tentative against Pang Xun, failed to wipe out all of the rebels, and was too anxious to seize the spoils of war. As a result, Kang was demoted to be the teacher of Emperor Yizong's son Li Ji () the Prince of Shu, but with his office at Luoyang. Soon thereafter, he was further demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of En Prefecture (恩州, in modern Jiangmen, Guangdong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. In 873, Emperor Yizong died. His son Emperor Xizong recalled Kang to again serve as a general of the imperial guards. Kang died soon thereafter.

The community's main roads are East Hwy 72, which connects from US 119, and travels to an end at Old RB Mines, however, 72 runs to Harlan via gravel road,and Ky 2005 an old gravel road that leads to Smith/Brownies Creek, south of Harlan, Kentucky. Overview The community used to rely heavily on coal mining. But many coal mines now have been shut down causing a reduction in the production of coal. The recent recession in the coal market brought about by over regulation of the E.P.A., and the cheaper cost of natural gas, has caused high unemployment rates in this small community as well as Harlan County, Kentucky and throughout the United States. A small community park, known as Coal Miner's Memorial Park, was created to honor the community's ties to coal mining. There are four churches in the community: Insull Holiness, Pathfork Holiness Church, Pathfork Baptist and Blackstar Pentecostal Church.

Biography Raised in Chicago, Cole first entered the pop music scene as one of The Champs along with Glen Campbell. Campbell and Cole formed the Gee Cee's after they left the Champs and released one single called \\"Buzzsaw Twist\\". Cole increased his income and recordings by playing for various budget albums with a variety of credits. In an interview with Psychotronic Video issue #31, Cole explained his dealings with Crown Records. Crown would request five surf albums, five country and western albums and five easy listening albums. Cole would write nine different songs for each album to back one cover version of a hit of the time, organize a band, arrange and record the music for master tapes that he would deliver to Crown in about three weeks time; doing an album or two in a day. Impressed by his playing as a session musician, Bobby Darin recommended him to Capitol Records where he led an instrumental surf guitar group called \\"Jerry Cole and his Spacemen\\". Capitol tried Cole as a vocalist but found his voice wasn't strong enough. Among his records for Capitol as a vocalist was the original version of \\"Midnight Mary\\" (spelled as \\"Midnite Mary\\" on the record), a top 10 hit for Joey Powers. Throughout the 1960s, Cole was a highly sought-after session player, working with The Byrds (\\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" / \\"I Knew I'd Want You\\"), Nancy Sinatra (\\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\"), The Beach Boys (Pet Sounds LP) and Paul Revere & the Raiders (\\"Kicks\\") among others. He recorded as one of \\"The Wrecking Crew\\" and as a writer, arranger and conductor for numerous pop groups and performers and performed on many American television shows of the time. He led the pit bands of the teenage music shows Hullabaloo and Shindig!. His bandleader abilities were also tapped by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Roger Miller, and Ricky Nelson and he was a first-call guitarist on TV show bands for Andy Williams, Sonny & Cher, The Smothers Brothers, Laugh In, and Dick Van Dyke. Cole pulled together some L.A. session colleagues and cut his own psychedelic album: The Inner Sounds of the Id by 'The Id', recorded between 1965 and 1966 according to drummer Don Dexter. The musicians were: Jerry Cole (lead guitar, lead vocals, sitar), Don Dexter (drums, backing vocals), Glenn Cass (bass, backing vocals) and his brother Norman Cass (rhythm guitar, backing vocals). A massive collection of tracks were pared down to ten tracks and those ten tracks were released by RCA in January 1967. The Animated Egg's self-titled album was released on the Alshire label in 1967 under the auspices of producer-manager Paul Arnold, who reportedly absconded with the unreleased Id material. However, shortly before his death, Cole determined that the Animated Egg tracks were probably recorded at a different session, and may have involved different musicians working with Cole. Either way, the Id and Animated Egg tapes were both subsequently recycled by Arnold for a series of releases including the 101 Strings' orchestral-overdubbed Astro- Sounds From Beyond the Year 2000. Cashing in on Jimi Hendrix's untimely death, many of the same tracks were also given new titles and released as a tribute album credited to The Black Diamonds.The Animated Egg – Guitar Freakout liner notes, Mike Vernon. Sundazed CD (2008) On October 15, 2006, Cole performed, as a lead guitarist, with his friend Dick Burns, of the original Dartells, as a \\"New Dartell\\" in the KVEN \\"Boomer Blast\\" oldies concert at the Oxnard Performing Arts Plaza, though he was not included in the then still uncompleted album Mo' Pastrami, which did include Freddy Cannon, Donny Brooks and Jewel Akens. Jerry Cole started Happy Tiger Records with producer-manager Ray Ruff in 1969. As one of Ruff's acts – a post-Van Morrison line-up of Them – had just broken up, Cole joined the band for their self-titled 1970 hard rock album for the label, credited as lead vocalist, guitarist and drummer alongside uncredited musicians Ry Cooder, Johnny Stark, Jack Nitzsche and Billy Preston. Cole teamed up with Roger McGuinn again in 1972 for McGuinn's debut solo record, while session work with Roger Miller, Chuck Howard and Susie Allanson sent him in a country-rock direction. The list of names Cole worked with as guitarist, vocalist, writer, arranger, producer, or bandleader includes: Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Aretha Franklin, The Righteous Brothers, Little Richard, Dean Martin, Merle Haggard, Ray Charles, Tony Orlando & Dawn, Lou Rawls, Johnny Rivers, Gregg Allman, Lee Hazlewood, Blood Sweat & Tears, Kenny Rogers, Neil Diamond, Steely Dan, and Isaac Hayes. Cole died of a heart attack at his Corona, California, home at the age of 68.

Description The shell grows to a length of 2.5 mm. The thin, white shell has a globose shape. It is transparent and strongly sculptured. It has a tumid base, a small umbilical chink. It has a short subscalar spire (on which the old canal slit forms the edge of the successive whorls), and a smallish somewhat prominent rounded tip. Its sculpture shows frequent, strongish, rounded, longitudinals. The curved riblets radiate out from the sutures. They are of much the same strength on the base as above. The spirals are located at about one-third of its height from the suture. The body whorl is somewhat feebly carinated by the old canal scar, which is depressed and finely scored across between the narrow slightly projecting edges of the lip. On the upper surface a few very obsolete spirals may be seen. The whole base is reticulated by spiral threads, which are closer set, but almost as strong as the radiating riblets. The conical spire is rather depressed and rises regularly to the extreme tip. The apex is round and prominent. The five whorls are flat and sloping above. They are carinated below the carina towards the mouth slightly openly constricted and then tumid on the base. The suture is impressed. The aperture is round. The outer lip is freely curved. The thin inner lip is concave at the base of the columella, straight, rounded, and very much expanded on the columella with an angulated and very patulous junction to the outer lip in front. There is a small umbilical furrow and chink half hidden behind it. (original description by Watson) G.W. Tryon (1890), Manual of Conchology vol.

The sculpture was the first contemporary sculpture to be permanently installed in downtown Indianapolis., Description It is a black, painted steel sculpture consisting of nine rectangular solids attached to each other at various angles. Before the artwork was installed, the former director of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Carl J. Reinhard, declared that he thought the artwork was a \\"very strong and challenging work of art that would add some excitement to the City County Building complex.\\" Historical information The creation of the sculpture was led by the artist who raised the $20,000 needed to create the sculpture, which he began in August 1974. The sculpture was accepted as a gift to the Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority on August 5, 1975 from Jerry Sanders. Sanders created the sculpture from donated materials, which was finally painted by Indiana Waterproofing and Protective Coating Company. The base for the sculpture was poured by Irwin Materials Company and the uplighting completed by the Commonwealth Electric Company. Sanders first offered to donate the sculpture to the Indiana Convention Center, but this offer was declined after another artist, Stephen Wooldridge, also offered his sculpture \\"I\\" for the site. American Fletcher National Bank offered to install the artwork on their property, however the Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority ultimately accepted the gift. Artist Sanders was an art instructor at Warren Central High School when his artwork was installed. Born in Decatur, Illinois on September 9, 1949, Sanders attended Vincennes University and then transferred to Indiana University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Art Education in 1974. In 1978 Sanders moved to Fort Worth, Texas.

Description The white, minute shell forms a depressed sphere which is equally raised above and below. It is rather thin, semitransparent and somewhat glossy. It has no sculpture except a very fine and close set, but indistinct, lines of growth. The spire is slightly raised. The 4-5 whorls are flattened above and sloping outwards. They rapidly enlarge, so that the body whorl considerably exceeds in size the rest of the shell. The slit is long and central, equal in width, with upturned edges. The aperture is nearly circular, but somewhat angulated where it is united to the body whorl below the peripheral keel. The peristome is continuous, although not free in consequence of the inner lip being attached to the shell. The outer lip is thin and sharp. The inner lip spreads on the lower part of the body whorl. The umbilicus is rather large, funnel-shaped, and deep. The operculum is not observed, the specimens now described being dead.G.W. Tryon (1890), Manual of Conchology vol.

They are fine hair- like filaments distributed throughout the surface of the body, both unique to and ubiquitous among cestodes, giving the body surface a smooth and silky appearance. They are different from typical microvilli in that they contain conspicuous electron dense materials at the tip. Due to their morphological variation they make up unique defining structures in cestodes. Since cestodes are devoid of any digestive and excretory systems, the tegument with its microtriches is the principal site of absorption and secretion. In fact the tegument highly resembles the gut of animals turned inside out.Smyth JD, McManus DP (1989). The Physiology and Biochemistry of Cestodes. Academic Press, pp. 5-8. Structure The microtriches are fine cylindrical tubular filaments, with smooth rounded ends, and arranged in rows corresponding to the regular ridges of the tegument. Microtriches are documented to exhibit wide range of morphology in different species of tapeworms, and serve as an identifying character among the members of Eucestoda.Lumsden RD, Hildreth MB (1983). The fine structure of adult tapeworms. In: Biology of the Eucestoda Vol.1 (C Arme & PW Pappas, eds). Academic Press, New York, USA, pp. 177-233. They are also of special interest in pharmacology as they are the basic interface of the tapeworm with its surrounding, thus serve as the primary site of absorption of nutrients and the target site of anthelmintics.Mansour TE, mansour JM (2002). Chemotherapeutic Targets in Parasites. Cambridge University Press, UK, pp. 192-297. Though microtriches have been described for several decades, the consensus terminology for the structure was made only at the turn of the 21st century. Standardised terms were resolved based on discussions that occurred at the International Workshops on Cestode Systematics in Storrs, Connecticut, United States in 2002, in Ceské Budejovice, Czech Republic in 2005 and in Smolenice, Slovakia in 2008. The following terms were endorsed for the components of each microtrix: the distal, electron-dense portion is the \\"cap\\", the proximal more electron-lucent region is the \\"base\\", and these two parts are separated from one another by the \\"baseplate\\". The base is composed of, among other elements, microfilaments, while the cap is composed of cap tubules. The electron-lucent central portion of the base is referred to as the \\"core\\". The core may be surrounded by an electron-dense tunic. The entire microthrix is enveloped by a plasma membrane, the external layer of which is referred to as the glycocalyx. Two distinct sizes of microtriches are recognised: those < or = 200 nm in basal width, termed \\"filitriches\\", and those >200 nm in basal width, termed \\"spinitriches\\". Filitriches are considered to occur in three lengths: papilliform (< or = 2 times as long as wide), acicular (2-6 times as long as wide), and capilliform (>6 times as long as wide). Spinitriches are much more variable in form. Functions All cestodes lack digestive and excretory systems, therefore, the tegument with its microtriches constitute the principal site of absorption of nutrients and elimination of waste materials. Moreover, the microtriches are the primary structures for host-parasite interface, and are metabolically active performing all the vital activities such as sensory, absorptive and secretory functions. Thus their structural significance is clearly to amplify the total surface area of the tegument. The surface carbohydrate complex called glycocalyx is responsible for inhibition of the host digestive enzymes, absorption of cations and bile salts, and enhancement of the host amylase activity.Cheng TC (1986). General Parasitology, 2nd edn. Academic Press, Division of Hardcourt Brace & Company, USA, pp. 253-2546. The acidic glycosaminoglycans of the glycocalyx are specific for inhibiting a number of digestive enzymes of the host.Bogitsh BJ, Carter CE, Oeltman TN (2005). Human Parasitology, 3rd Edition. Academic Press, pp. 177-179. The microtriches in cestodes, and pits and spines in trematodes increase the surface area of the teguments for enhanced absorption of nutrients. In addition, they act as sensory organs for detecting the surrounding environmental cues and primary target site of anthelmintic drugs. The capacity of the tegument to absorb exogenous materials is proportional to the number and extent of pits or microtriches and the number of mitochondria in the distal cytoplasm.Smyth JD, Halton DW (1983).

The ovate aperture is narrower above.G.W. Tryon (1890), Manual of Conchology vol. XII Distribution This marine species has a wide distribution.

Constructed between 1908 and 1910, it was designed to house commercial space on the ground floor and a meeting hall for a local Masonic lodge on the second floor. The Masons stayed until around 1985. History The Masonic Lodge in Hilo was founded in 1896 at the home of William W. Goodale. On October 15, 1897 Kilauea Lodge #330 was officially chartered. Named for the nearby active Kīlauea volcano, it was the first Masonic lodge on Hawaii Island. John Troup Moir (1859–1933) manager of the Onomea sugarcane plantation in Papaikou, Hawaii, was master of the lodge. He was also the first chairman of the board of supervisors for the County of Hawaii. A delegation from the Grand Lodge of California officially presented Kīlauea lodge with its charter in February 1898. The lodge met in a room of a building owned by Frederick S. Lyman, son of early Hilo missionaries Sarah Joiner and David Belden Lyman. The Lyman building was on leased land, so an association (with Moir as president) was formed to purchase a lot uphill from the town, assuming urban Hilo would grow in that direction. The association raised most of what they thought a building would cost by October 1900. When a federal building was being planned in Hilo around the same time, the lodge proposed swapping their land for a corner of the federal lot, but public protests prevented the deal at first. By January 1906 they were successful in arranging a deal with Territorial Governor George R. Carter to swap their land (desired for a school) for a more central parcel, paying the difference in value. Based on a sketch by freemason William McKay (1841–1909), architects were interviewed in Honolulu and the mainland. Henry F. Starbuck of Oakland, California was selected to design the building. He was a freemason and had designed several other lodges and churches. Harold Vaughan Patten was given as \\"architect\\" in one account, but he probably served to supervise the financial aspects of the project since he was an accountant. Plans were ready to be finalized at the end of March 1906. Construction was scheduled to begin in July when leases expired on the land which they were purchasing from the territory. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck less than a month later, before construction could begin. Rebuilding of San Francisco after the resulting fire caused building materials to become scarce and more expensive, causing delays and cost over-runs on the Hilo project. Finally ground was broken in May 1908. In June Starbuck traveled to Hilo to oversee construction with workers he had selected. After a few months Starbuck and the workers were dismissed; Fred Harrison from Honolulu became construction contractor. The cornerstone was laid February 18, 1909. The dedication ceremony was held on February 24, 1910. Construction cost ended up being double what had been planned. At the ceremony Moir said \\"nothing but the best would satisfy the boys\\" and called it \\"a substantial, fireproof, earthquakeproof, up-to-date building, first class in every respect, a credit to the town of Hilo and the Territory of Hawaii.\\" It was completed about the same time as the Volcano Block Building and S. Hata Buildings within a few blocks in downtown Hilo. Just to the south, Kalakaua Park serves as the town square, flanked by the historic District Courthouse and Police Station and Hilo Federal Building finished a few years later. The building was built of reinforced concrete in the Renaissance Revival style. It had three floors and a full basement. From the lobby, an elaborate granite stairway with an ornate oak balustrade leads to the second and third floors. The roof formerly held a garden. The second floor consisted of a foyer, a ceremonial temple room of about by , and a banquet room about the same size. The temple included high ceilings with cast brass suspended lighting fixtures and an organ gallery. The Masonic order used the second and third floors as a temple until about 1985, when they were forced out: the Masonic order's rules did not allow them to share occupancy with a liquor establishment, but a liquor license was issued to the ground floor tenant. Restoration The building was purchased by Toyama Hawaii, Inc. in 1992. It was added to the state registry of historic places on June 28, 1993 as site 10-35-7508, and added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on April 21, 1994 as site 94000383. The building's ground floor has had various tenants. Bishop Bank (now First Hawaiian Bank) used the ground floor before moving to their own building. A 1990s restoration effort rebuilt modern restrooms and added an elevator, using some original and salvaged materials. Howard and Mary Ann Rogers (as the Kaikodo Building, LLC) bought the building in 2001 and opened the Kaikodo restaurant in the ground floor in 2003. Their plans were to open an Asian art gallery on the second floor after a further remodel. The Rogers were former art researchers who had previously opened a gallery in New York City. After a struggle to be profitable, it was closed for four months and reorganized in 2005. Kaikodo closed in August 2007 and the building was put up for sale. A restaurant on the first floor was re-opened in 2009 as \\"Uncle Don's Ohana Grill\\" but closed less than a year later. The building is located on the northwest corner of Keawe (originally known as Bridge Street) and Waianuenue Streets in Hilo, Hawaii, (address 60 Keawe Street). The Kilauea lodge is one of two on the island today.

During his career, he has worked with Van Halen, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Slash, Hall & Oates and has managed The Black Crowes since the release of their 1989 multi-platinum debut album, 'Shake Your Money Maker.' Early years He first made his name in the business when he designed and directed a light show for Van Halen in 1980 for their first world tour as a headline act, which at the time was the most elaborate music light show ever designed and implemented, requiring 7 tractor-trailers for the lights alone. In addition to light and stage design, Angelus forayed into art direction for the band, influencing Van Halen's logo and early album covers, as well as designing much of the band's merchandise from 1979 to their breakup with Roth in 1985. Angelus became such a creative influence the members of the band, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, David Lee Roth, and Michael Anthony referred to him as \\"the fifth member of Van Halen.\\" Many of David Lee Roth's quips came from the tongue of Angelus (Note the opening of California Girls: \\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls, Maurice Chevalier, 1958\\" \\"And some of the other sizes, too Pete and Dave, 1985\\"). Roth, with whom Angelus had a falling out after managing his solo career for six years, failed to acknowledge Angelus' work and partnership in his memoir. As MTV became all the rage, his interest turned to video production, and he went on to direct some of the most well- known and most-played music videos of all-time. Five times, the videos he directed were nominated for MTV \\"Video of the Year\\" status.

He was instrumental in creating the “Jimmy Page/ The Black Crowes: Live From The Greek” record and the “Tour of Brotherly Love” with The Black Crowes and Oasis. Angelus’ business distinction is equally as strong as his creative reputation. Billboard Magazine referred to him as a “visionary.” A feature in The Album Network commented, “Angelus is a magician when it comes to artist development and the media…his creativity and success warrant the status he has earned as a legendary manager.” References Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American music managers Category:American music video directors Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Pete Angelus"},{"id":"26923218","text":"The Historiography of Argentina is composed of the works of the authors that have written about the History of Argentina. The first historiographical works are usually considered to be those by Bartolomé Mitre and other authors from the middle 19th century.Devoto, p. 14 History Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina, one of the first books about the History of Argentina The pre-Columbian indigenous populations of Argentina did not develop writing, and had no written records of events. There have been written records of events since the time of the first European arrivals to Argentine territory, but most of them were referred to ongoing events or very close ones and are not considered to be real historiographical works. The first authors to write about events long past were the members of the \\"'37 Generation\\", romantic authors born by the time of the May Revolution, who were educated in the time of the unitarian government of Bernardino Rivadavia. By that time they received a secular education and shared studies with students from other provinces, which promoted in them a national view over a localist one. At first they tried to act as an enlightened influence beyond the unitarian- federalist dichotomy, but the increased strengthening of the policies of Juan Manuel de Rosas made most of them flee into exile to foreign countries. Thus, those authors are considered with care, as they were distant enough from the events of the Argentine War of Independence but still contemporary of the Argentine Civil War and the government of Rosas, making their opinions about the later to be of a political nature. Those authors tried to adapt the European Romantic nationalism to the Argentine context, and develop a national identity. As they despised both Rosas and the Spanish heritage, they aimed their efforts in glorifying the events and peoples of the Revolution. One of the first works done for this purpose was Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina (), by Bartolomé Mitre. This book was criticized by Vicente Fidel López, Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield or Juan Bautista Alberdi, who would wrote other books in answer, and Mitre would reply with more books strengthening his perspectives. Rómulo Carbia described this dispute in 1925 as a dispute between \\"philosophists\\" and \\"erudits\\", with Vicente López, Lucio López and José Manuel Estrada in the first group and Mitre, Luis Domínguez, Paul Groussac the new historical school and Carbia himself.Devoto, p. 14 Such book was used for self-affiliation and legitimization, but became canonical afterwards.Devoto, p. 14-15 1910 The first centennial of the May Revolution was a period of transition. Three new concerns were added to the historiographical view: the social, political and national issue: * Social issues were motivated by the massive immigration wave of the time and the rise of leftist, socialist and anarchist movements; and influenced a bigger concern about the role of society itself in the events of history, which so far had been described around key figures. * The national issue was the need to define, in a time when the majority of the population was foreign immigrants, the identity of the country and its role in the world. * The political concern derives from the fact that none of the historians from this periods works exclusively in the historiographical fields, and had steady political works at the same time. Despite keeping a rigorous scientific approach, their works were marked by their political views: when Ramos Mejía rote about the popular participation and how it led to either the May Revolution or the tyranny of Rosas, he was indirectly pointing his opinions about popular participation in his own context. This period ends by 1920, with the creation of the New Historical School. Historiography would take two main divergent paths since then. On one side, the state would sponsor Ricardo Levene and the National Academy of History into writing a definitive and unquestionable version of national history, which follows the most important basic features of the one designed by Mitre and was deemed as \\"official history\\" because of its state- sponsored nature. The opposing viewpoint was held by a number of revisionist authors, who wrote the history of Argentina from an anti-imperialist perspective. Those authors restored the image of Juan Manuel de Rosas, rejected by previous authors, considering him an example of defense of national sovereignty. Former national heroes like Bernardino Rivadavia, Justo José de Urquiza, Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento were accused instead of favoring foreign imperialism. The concepts about the revolutionary period, on the other hand, weren't modified very much, and José de San Martín was exalted as strongly as by their historiographical adversaries.

It was published by Philomel Books in New York, NY. This book deals with the issue of racism and can be used as a tool to introduce diversity and tolerance in a classroom setting. It tells the story of a principal of an elementary school, Mr. Lincoln, helping the school bully overcome his feelings of hatred. Polacco did all of the watercolor illustrations. SUMMARY: Mr. Lincoln is the principal of an elementary school and is admired by all of the students, except one. Eugene “Mean Gene” Esterhouse terrorizes other students on the playground and says offensive remarks. He then invites Eugene into his office and gives him a book about different types of birds. Eugene tells Mr. Lincoln that his grandpa taught him a lot about birds when he lived on his grandpa’s farm. Mr. Lincoln decides to create a bird atrium at the school to help Eugene change his behavior. The atrium attracts all different kinds of birds, and Eugene is fascinated by all of them. Eugene took the bird book with him everywhere and began to be nicer to the other students. A couple of days later, a teacher reports to Mr. Lincoln that Eugene had made racial comments to two students in the lunch line. Mr. Lincoln calls Eugene into his office, where he learns that Eugene’s dad was mad that Eugene had been spending so much time with Mr. Lincoln because he’s African American. Mr. Lincoln shows Eugene that he cares for all of the birds the same, regardless of color, and Eugene promises to never use racist comments again. A couple of days later, the mallard eggs in the atrium begin to hatch. The ducks need to live near the pond, so Mr. Lincoln and Eugene come up with a plan and start to lure them to the river. After the ducks make it to the water safely, Eugene hears his name. His grandpa had come to see the ducks make it to safety. Eugene asks his grandpa if he can live with him again, to which grandpa replies, “We’ll see, son. We’ll sure see.” Polacco, P: \\"Mr. Lincoln's Way\\". Philomel Books, 2001. Characters Mr. Lincoln – Mr. Lincoln is an African American principal of the elementary school. All of the students really admire him, except for Eugene. He teaches Eugene about different kinds of birds and teaches him not to terrorize the other students and use racial comments. Eugene “Mean Gene” Esterhouse – Eugene terrorizes his peers on the playground. He gets in fights and calls the other students mean or racial names. He becomes fascinated by birds after he visits with his grampa. Grampa - Eugene loves his grampa and wants to visit him again. Grampa was the one who got Eugene interested in birds. Eugene’s Dad – Eugene’s dad becomes angry when Eugene begins spending a lot of time with Mr. Lincoln because he is not of the same race. He is an intolerant and uses racial slurs for anyone who is not of the same race he is.Polacco, P: \\"Mr. Lincoln's Way\\". Philomel Books, 2001. Reviews According to the publisher of the book, Philomel Books, “With Patricia Polacco's trademark illustrations and gentle text, Mr. Lincoln's Way celebrates the unforgettable school principal who touches the lives of his students and truly empowers them.”http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Mr-Lincolns-Way/Patricia- Polacco/e/9780399237546 According to Booklist, “This story is vintage Polacco --a multicultural neighborhood setting, a cast of believable characters (some larger than life), and a satisfying ending guaranteed to bring tears to even hard-boiled cynics. Polacco's signature watercolor illustrations take on springtime hues here; they're especially apparent in Mr. Lincoln's bright pink shirts and ties. An excellent choice for storyhours, this should prompt some interesting discussions about bullies and their motivations.” According to The Horn Book Magazine, “Although the illustrations are engaging, the story of the bully's transformation is both sanctimonious and unconvincing. Eugene is too self-aware for his age, and Mr. Lincoln is too flawless to be interesting.” Inspiration Patricia Polacco uses many of the schools she travels to as inspiration for the schools in her stories. The elementary school in Mr. Lincoln’s Way is based around Murphy Elementary School in Haslett, Michigan. This school is home to mallard duck nests, and every year the principal leads the ducks through the school to the local pond.Polacco, P: \\"Mr. Lincoln's Way\\", back cover. Philomel Books, 2001.

After playing in the punk and alternative rock bands SNFU and The Wheat Chiefs between 1981 and 1998, Belke began a career composing music for film and television. Career=SNFU and the Wheat Chiefs (1981–1998) Belke formed Live Sex Shows with his twin brother Marc, also a guitarist, and singer Ken Chinn in 1981 after they met through the skateboarding subculture in Edmonton, Alberta.Chris Walter. ...What No One Else Wanted to Say. Vancouver: GFY Press, 2012 The band was short-lived, but the three founded a new group called Society's No Fucking Use (better known by the acronym SNFU) later that year. With a rotating rhythm section, SNFU released four LPs and served as catalysts for the skate punk movement in addition to influencing the punk rock scene at large before disbanding temporarily in 1989. After the group's first breakup, Marc and Brent founded the Wheat Chiefs, whose sound reflected power pop and melodic hardcore influences not immediately apparent in SNFU's material. In 1991, offers for touring and significant record deals helped lead to SNFU's reformation, and the two bands, now located in Vancouver, British Columbia, operated in tandem for the next seven years. SNFU signed to Epitaph Records, released three further studio and one live album, and toured extensively; the Wheat Chiefs were less active, releasing only the Redeemer album in 1996. Belke left rock music in 1998 to focus on scoring in film and television, accruing university degrees in jazz and classical composition. SNFU continued in his absence, while the Wheat Chiefs permanently disbanded. Work in composition, recent activity (1998–present) Belke has composed music for the films Cries in the Dark and The Accidental Witness, the television shows Road Hockey Rumble (for which he received a Leo Award nomination in 2008), So Weird, The Stagers, and numerous other works. He performed a one-off concert with SNFU in 2001, and also played on one track on SNFU's 2004 album In the Meantime and In Between Time, their only release after his departure. His newest project is Existential Angst Party, an experimental avant-garde group. They released a full-length album in 2005.

Early life Edmundson was born in Little Musgrave, Westmorland, England in 1627. His parents died when he was young, and so he was raised by an uncle. He was apprenticed as a carpenter at York, and after completion, he joined the Parliamentary Army during the English Civil War. He went to Scotland in 1650. He also took part in the Battle of Worcester. While serving in the military, he was first introduced to Quakerism while stationed at Chesterfield. He was discharged and eventually went to live in County Antrim, Ireland. Quakerism He established the first Meeting House in Lurgan, Ireland in 1654. He was imprisoned several times, but was released thereafter. After this first establishment, Edmundson spent the rest of his life building the Society of Friends in Ireland. He lived most of his life in the once Quaker village of Rosenallis, Co Laois (aka County Leix, aka Queen's County), where he had a residence at Tineal House. Edmundson also visited America and debated the Protestant theologian Roger Williams in Rhode Island (New England) in 1672 with several other Quakers, and Williams was particularly offended by Edmunson's perceived rudeness.Roger Williams, George Fox Digg’d out of his Burrowes or an offer of Disputation on fourteen Proposals made this last Summer of 1672 unto G.

The movie stars Prithviraj Sukumaran, Sheela, Geetu Mohandas and Tom George Kolath in lead roles. Plot The film starts with Neil(Prithviraj Sukumaran), a writer bidding farewell to his partner Kamala, who wishes him luck with his writing. He intends to write about Rose, his sister as promised to a publisher. However, Kamala plans on leaving Neil, complaining of his selfishness all along and preference to his own life. He even blames their daughter leaving them on him. She asks him to dedicate his time for Rose now, though it is meaningless to her. Neil admits that he always hated himself. As he leaves, he sees a familiar face and then is struck by the pangs of realization. The very sight provokes a sudden outflow of memories and the story goes back into a flashback. Neil and his Anglo-Indian family lives in Kerala. He is a disturbed youth working as a clerk in a factory for low wages. His intention is to become a writer. He lives with his mother Margaret (Sheela) and sister Rosemary(Geetu Mohandas). His father was a Portuguese sailor who left the family when the children were very young. Rose, his sister is slightly handicapped and because of this, she is always in her shell. She is bound to inferiority complex and mental fragility. She is very much interested in glass figurines that adorn her showcase. She simply gazes at the iridescent beauty of the figurines in her loneliness. Margret, Neil's mother hates his care-free attitude towards life and his late-night movies. She is a very possessive mother and she is always worried about the future of her daughter. She doesn't allow her daughter to do household chores and talks about the tenderness of Rose's age, which must not be doomed by working at home. One day, Margaret goes to the typewriting class where she had previously sent Rose. She finds out that Rose had quit the class very early and had even fainted while taking a speed test. Margaret confronts Rose and learns that she had been spending her spare time at the church and the museum. As Rose feels sorry for her crippled stage, Margaret advises her to develop her other skills and that girls with no such duty must be sent off in marriage. They gaze at the portrait of their father as Margaret explains how handsome he was. The next day, Margaret finds some adult novels with Neil. She angrily scolds him and this later turns into a violent fit of rage. Neil ends up calling his mother an \\" old chattering witch\\" and storms out. As he is leaving, breaks one of Rose's figurines, and Rose watches this with pity. Neil returns drunk at night and says to Rose that he had been to a Magic Show. He gives Rose a magic scarf that he got from the show in order to make up for her broken figurine. He convinces that this scarf will impart life to her glass animals and Rose is instantly mesmerized by it. Her isolated world is symbolized by her glass animals who are in a similar way much like Rose herself. The next day, Neil and Margaret reconcile and Margaret expresses her deep fears about her children, at the same time admitting of their talents. That night, Margaret makes Rose wish for everything, while looking up at the crescent moon though Rose is not sure what to wish for. Margaret asks Neil to bring a fine young man for dinner one day for Rose to get acquainted with that man. So Neil invites his co-worker Freddy (Tom George Kolath) for a dinner at his home. Margaret plans a light supper and digs up her old gown and reminisces about her tender teens. She dramatically slips into talking of her old days, how they had many servants while living in Goa and her fate of having reached a pathetic situation now. Neil's mother thinks that Freddy will get interested in Rose and they can marry her off. Margaret dresses up in the gown and compels Rose to do so. At this point, she says that all pretty girls are a trap in which handsome men must fall into. Rose reluctantly agrees to cooperate. Later, on hearing that the man about to come is her former senior schoolmate, Freddy, she refuses to sit for dinner. She had a crush on him for her was very artistic and athletic. As the dinner is about to start, Rose faints and Neil takes her to lay her down on the sofa. Later, Freddy and Rose get to talking and realizes their past connection. A flashback shows a young Rose who lives a pitiful time deprived of friends. Freddy remembers the time when he nicknamed her \\"Blue Rose\\" when Rose said that she had Pleurisy. Rose introduces her glass figurines to Freddy and particularly displays a unicorn figure, which was her favorite one and furthermore a reflection of her own life. She explains that the unicorn is odd due to its difference from all the others. Freddy enlightens Rose's spirit by saying that her difference from all the similar people of the world is her greatest peculiarity, just like the magical unicorn. People tend to like the oddness among the evenness. He even encourages her to be more smart at times and to think better of herself. Then both of them quietly dance to the beautiful song heard from the community dance hall outside. Rose is able to overcome her stereotypes and is able to keep up with the dance moves. Rose is lifted both physically and mentally. As the dance concludes, Freddy accidentally brushes against the table, knocking off the unicorn from the table. It falls and breaks the horn. But Rose is happy that with this incident, he can join the others as a normal one, for he had just undergone an operation to rectify his painful oddness. By these words, Rose indirectly refers to her own state of mind at that time for she becomes totally rejuvenated. But her hopes get crushed when she comes to know that Freddy is already engaged to a girl named Betty. She is heartbroken, but bids farewell to Freddy as she gifts her unicorn to him. Margaret brings in Lime juice for them, but is so stuck on hearing from Freddy that he is engaged. She feels so humiliated but tries to keep up a smiling face. She blames this on Neil and taunts him verbally for cheating them. Neil, however, was unaware of the fact that Freddy was engaged. An argument arises as Margaret calls him selfish and deprived of feelings. With this, Neil storms out of the house, leaving them all alone forever. Margaret and Rose watch as their hope goes away. The story returns to the present. Having recognized the man he saw at the ferry as Freddy, he decides to pay him a visit. He then takes him along with his family to see an aged and timid Margaret. She instantly recognizes Freddy and Betty. She is consoled by their presence as Freddy's little daughters gift her a bouquet of flowers. She explains that after Neil left them, Rose was admitted to a Mental Asylum near Madurai and that she lived a completely withdrawn life there. After a slight improvement, she suffered from an unexpected Nervous Breakdown and had died. Neil feels no guilt or sympathy, but only pain for Rose. He pens down her story to immortalize her as he imagines her spirit showing him light from the beyond. Later they all sit down for dinner as Rose's picture is shown at a distance ( Signifying the title), over which the magic scarf flies gently, giving life to her memories.

The grant encompassed present day Lake Mathews. At the time of the US patent, Rancho San Jacinto Sobrante was a part of San Bernardino County. The County of Riverside was created by the California Legislature in 1893 by taking land from both San Diego and San Bernardino Counties. Diseño del Rancho San Jacinto Sobrante History María del Rosario Estudillo was the daughter of José Antonio Estudillo, grantee of Rancho San Jacinto Viejo. José Antonio Estudillo was appointed administrator and majordomo at Mission San Luis Rey in 1840. Three grants, comprising over of the former Mission San Luis Rey lands in the San Jacinto area were made to the Estudillo family: Rancho San Jacinto Viejo to José Antonio Estudillo in 1842; Rancho San Jacinto Nuevo y Potrero to his son-in-law, Miguel Pedrorena, in 1846; and the five square league Rancho San Jacinto Sobrante to his daughter, María del Rosario Estudillo, in 1846.John W. Robinson, \\"Rancho San Jacinto Viejo and the Estudillo Family\\", in Rancho Days in Southern California, (Los Angeles: Los Angeles Corral of the Westerners, 1997), pp 143-161 María del Rosario Estudillo was married to José Antonio Aguirre (1799-1860). Before she died, Aguirre had been married to María del Rosario's sister, Francisca Estudillo, eldest daughter of José Antonio Estudillo. José Antonio Aguirre owned one-half of Rancho El Tejon.Mary H. Haggland, Don José Antonio Aguirre: Spanish Merchant and Ranchero,The Journal of San Diego History, Winter 1983, Volume 29, Number 1 In 1853, José Antonio Aguirre bought Rancho San Jacinto Nuevo y Potrero from the estate of Aguirre's brother-in-law Miguel Pedrorena. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho San Jacinto Sobrante was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852.United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 80 SD In 1854, the Commission found that María del Rosario Estudillo de Aguirre was entitled to five square leagues of land. The US District Court in 1855, however, held that the claimant was entitled to eleven square leagues, if so much should be found within the sobrante, and to all that was found therein if it were less than that amount. An appeal taken to the US Supreme Court in 1863, affirmed the eleven square leagues, United States v.

Typically it involves establishing four elements: correlation, sequence in time (that is, causes must occur before their proposed effect), a plausible physical or information-theoretical mechanism for an observed effect to follow from a possible cause, and eliminating the possibility of common and alternative (\\"special\\") causes. Such analysis usually involves one or more artificial or natural experiments. Motivation Data analysis is primarily concerned with causal questions. For example, did the fertilizer cause the crops to grow? Or, can a given sickness be prevented? Or, why is my friend depressed? The potential outcomes and regression analysis techniques handle such queries when data is collected using designed experiments. Data collected in observational studies require different techniques for causal inference (because, for example, of issues such as confounding). Causal inference techniques used with experimental data require additional assumptions to produce reasonable inferences with observation data. The difficulty of causal inference under such circumstances is often summed up as \\"correlation does not imply causation\\". In philosophy and physics The nature of causality is systematically investigated in several academic disciplines, including philosophy and physics. In academia, there are a significant number of theories on causality; The Oxford Handbook of Causation encompasses 770 pages. Among the more influential theories within philosophy are Aristotle's Four causes and Al-Ghazali's occasionalism. David Hume argued that beliefs about causality are based on experience, and experience similarly based on the assumption that the future models the past, which in turn can only be based on experience – leading to circular logic. In conclusion, he asserted that causality is not based on actual reasoning: only correlation can actually be perceived. Immanuel Kant, according to , held that \\"a causal principle according to which every event has a cause, or follows according to a causal law, cannot be established through induction as a purely empirical claim, since it would then lack strict universality, or necessity\\". Outside the field of philosophy, theories of causation can be identified in classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, spacetime theories, biology, social sciences, and law. To establish a correlation as causal within physics, it is normally understood that the cause and the effect must connect through a local mechanism (cf. for instance the concept of impact) or a nonlocal mechanism (cf. the concept of field), in accordance with known laws of nature. From the point of view of thermodynamics, universal properties of causes as compared to effects have been identified through the Second law of thermodynamics, confirming the ancient, medieval and Cartesian view that \\"the cause is greater than the effect\\" for the particular case of thermodynamic free energy. This, in turn, is challenged by popular interpretations of the concepts of nonlinear systems and the butterfly effect, in which small events cause large effects due to, respectively, unpredictability and an unlikely triggering of large amounts of potential energy. Causality construed from counterfactual states Intuitively, causation seems to require not just a correlation, but a counterfactual dependence. Suppose that a student performed poorly on a test and guesses that the cause was his not studying. To prove this, one thinks of the counterfactual – the same student writing the same test under the same circumstances but having studied the night before. If one could rewind history, and change only one small thing (making the student study for the exam), then causation could be observed (by comparing version 1 to version 2). Because one cannot rewind history and replay events after making small controlled changes, causation can only be inferred, never exactly known. This is referred to as the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference – it is impossible to directly observe causal effects. A major goal of scientific experiments and statistical methods is to approximate as best possible the counterfactual state of the world. For example, one could run an experiment on identical twins who were known to consistently get the same grades on their tests. One twin is sent to study for six hours while the other is sent to the amusement park. If their test scores suddenly diverged by a large degree, this would be strong evidence that studying (or going to the amusement park) had a causal effect on test scores. In this case, correlation between studying and test scores would almost certainly imply causation. Well-designed experimental studies replace equality of individuals as in the previous example by equality of groups. The objective is to construct two groups that are similar except for the treatment that the groups receive. This is achieved by selecting subjects from a single population and randomly assigning them to two or more groups. The likelihood of the groups behaving similarly to one another (on average) rises with the number of subjects in each group. If the groups are essentially equivalent except for the treatment they receive, and a difference in the outcome for the groups is observed, then this constitutes evidence that the treatment is responsible for the outcome, or in other words the treatment causes the observed effect. However, an observed effect could also be caused \\"by chance\\", for example as a result of random perturbations in the population. Statistical tests exist to quantify the likelihood of erroneously concluding that an observed difference exists when in fact it does not (for example see P-value). Operational definitions of causality Clive Granger created the first operational definition of causality in 1969. Granger made the definition of probabilistic causality proposed by Norbert Wiener operational as a comparison of variances. Verification by \\"truth\\" Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines introduced the idea of explicitly not providing a definition of causality . Spirtes and Glymour introduced the PC algorithm for causal discovery in 1990. Many recent causal discovery algorithms follow the Spirtes-Glymour approach to verification.  Exploratory  Exploratory causal analysis, also known as \\"data causality\\" or \\"causal discovery\\" is the use of statistical algorithms to infer associations in observed data sets that are potentially causal under strict assumptions. ECA is a type of causal inference distinct from causal modeling and treatment effects in randomized controlled trials. It is exploratory research usually preceding more formal causal research in the same way exploratory data analysis often precedes statistical hypothesis testing in data analysis  Computer programs for measuring \\"Granger causality\\"  * R package * Python package  External links  * Causality Workbench team tools and data * University of Pittsburgh CCD team tools  References =Bibliography * * ","title":"Causal analysis"},{"id":"26923758","text":"KFXT (Keeping Him Close By 90.7 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a gospel music format.

He is best known as an interpreter and advocate of the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, and has come to prominence as the architect and organizer of an overlapping array of international scholarly societies and publication projects devoted to Whitehead and the global relevance of process philosophy. Weber criticizes contemporary academic philosophy for losing touch with its early Greek roots. Philosophy has a practical mission (rooted in Socratic discourse) to restore personal and social well being, but it cannot do this, he argues, if it renounces its traditional metaphysical obligation (rooted in pre-Socratic speculation) to understand the cosmos. Weber believes that process philosophy is uniquely qualified to fulfill this double function in the post-modern world. Weber was educated in Belgium and the United States. The primary languages of his publications are English and French. Education Michel Weber studied applied economics at the Saint-Louis University, Brussels (candidat ingénieur commercial, 1986) and philosophy at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve (licencié en philosophie, 1991; docteur en philosophie, 1997). His master's thesis, written under the supervision of Jean Ladrière, dealt with the epistemological status of the \\"anthropic principle\\" in cosmology in light of the concepts of teleology (or \\"finality\\") found in Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Kant. From 1993 to 1995, he was Visiting Scholar at the Center for Process Studies of the Claremont School of Theology and at Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California (USA), where he worked under the supervision of John B. Cobb Jr. and David Ray Griffin. In 1997, he defended his doctoral thesis, Intuition pré-systématique et intuition ontologique chez Alfred North Whitehead. Euristique du pancréativisme de l’époque de Harvard (Pre-systematic Intuition and Ontological Intuition According to Alfred North Whitehead: The Heuristics of Pan-creativism in the Harvard Era), written under the supervision of Marcel Crabbé.An abstract can be found in the \\"Chronique de l’Institut supérieur de Philosophie,\\" Revue philosophique de Louvain, November 1997, pp. 793-794. Career From 1997 to 2002 he was Research Fellow at the Centre de Logique de l’Institut supérieur de Philosophie of the UCLouvain. From 2001 to 2002 he taught philosophy at the École européenne Bruxellensis II (European Baccalaureate, Anglophone Section, 6th and 7th years). From 2002 to 2007, he was Research Fellow at the Centre for Philosophical Anthropology of the UCLouvain Higher Institute of Philosophy. In 2000, Weber created, with the support of François Beets and Paul Gochet (University of Liège), the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes and the Whitehead Psychology Nexus,See \\"The Whitehead Psychology Nexus, Retrospect and Prospect,\\" Process Perspectives , 26:3 (Fall 2003), pp. 3-4. two scholarly societies intended to federate research on different aspects, nuances, and implications of the thought of A. N. Whitehead. In 2001, he created the European William James Project with Jack Barbalet (University of Leicester), Jaime Nubiola (University of Navarra) and the late Timothy L. S. Sprigge (Emeritus Edinburgh). In 2002, he created the research seminars \\"Chromatiques whiteheadiennes\\" with the cooperation of the \\"Philosophies of Experience\\" research center at the Université de Nantes Department of Philosophy and the Center for the Study of Pragmatism and Analytic Philosophy at the Sorbonne (le Centre d'Études sur le Pragmatisme et la Philosophie Analytique or CEPPA, but renamed since as EXeCO; Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne-École Doctorale).EXeCO [Expérience et connaissance (Philosophies contemporaines); Chromatiques whiteheadiennes Séminaire coordonné par Michel WEBER, UFR de Philosophie, Université Paris 1]. Since 2004, he has been the Editorial Director of the series Chromatiques whiteheadiennes for the academic publisher Ontos Verlag (Frankfurt) and Editorial Co-director, along with Nicholas Rescher (Pittsburgh) and Johanna Seibt (Aarhus & Konstanz), of the Process Thought series, also with Ontos Verlag (Advisory Board: Mark Bickhard, Lehigh; Jaime Nubiola, Navarra; and Roberto Poli, Trento).Ontos Verlag Since 2005, he has co-edited the Chromatikon: Annuaire de la philosophie en procès — Yearbook of Philosophy in Process at the Presses universitaires de Louvain, first with Diane d'Eprémesnil (UCLouvain), then with Pierfrancesco Basile (University of Bern), and now with Ronny Desmet (Vrije Universiteit Brussel). In 2006, he created the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes \\"Centre for Philosophical Practice,\\" a non- profit organization.See Moniteur belge, 08.11.2006. The Center now federates the three networks mentioned above (the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes, the Whitehead Psychology Nexus, and the European William James Project) and provides an institutional base for two new activities: first, the publication of a scholarly book series appearing under the label Les Éditions Chromatika (Chromatika Editions) and, second, the opening in Brussels of Belgium's first philosophical counseling service or \\"philosophical praxis.\\"Centre de philosophie pratique \\"Chromatiques whiteheadiennes.\\" See also \\"The Chromatiques whiteheadiennes Centre for Philosophical Practice,\\" Process Perspectives , 30:1 (Summer 2007), pp. 17-18. Since 2007, he has been a member of the \\"Contemporary Ontological Visions\\" network of the Institute for Philosophical Research of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 2008–9, he was Visiting Professor at the New Bulgarian University, Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology & Department of Philosophy and Sociology. Since 2009, Weber is also a trained hypnotherapist (Institut Milton Erickson, Brussels). Philosophical work As a principal source of inspiration, Weber promotes the ideas of a group of loosely associated thinkers from the early 20th century who applied evolutionary thinking to psychology, epistemology, cosmology, metaphysics, and theology, giving rise to the school of thought now known as \\"process philosophy.\\" Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), along with C. S. Peirce (1839–1914), Henri Bergson (1859–1941), and William James (1842–1910), is regarded as one of the fathers of process philosophy.See Nicholas Rescher, Process Metaphysics (Albany: SUNY Press), 1996. This mostly Anglo-American school of thought still finds only minority endorsement in academic philosophy departments. Nevertheless, despite its limited reception in the United States and Great Britain, process philosophy has begun to interest a small but growing number of scholars worldwide. By organizing a global network of like-minded scholars and fostering the publication of their ideas in Europe, Weber has contributed significantly to the visibility of process philosophy in Europe. There also appears to be a shift of focus. Until recently, interest in Whitehead, especially in the United States, tended to focus on process theology. Whitehead's brief but provocative theological speculations, added almost as an afterthought at the end of his major philosophical opus Process and RealityAlfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality, Corrected Edition (New York: The Free Press), 1978, pp. 337-351. (1929), were elaborated into an excitingly new natural theology that seemed particularly attractive to Christian theologians because it made naturalistic sense of God's personal love for creatures. This theological emphasis, however, along with a sometimes evangelical tone adopted by Whitehead's more ardent devotees, may be the reason for the marginalization of process philosophy in mainstream academic philosophy. With his 1996 book Process Metaphysics, the eminent and prolific American philosopher Nicholas Rescher began a campaign to rehabilitate a broadly secular style of process thinking. He defended it as the optimal matrix for any systematic theorizing about the nature of things.Nicholas Rescher, Process Metaphysics (Albany: SUNY Press), 1996. Like Rescher in the United States, Weber cultivates a critical and largely secular appreciation for process philosophy. He translated Rescher's Process Metaphysics into French in 2006.Nicholas Rescher, Essais sur les fondements de l'ontologie du procès (Process Metaphysics); translation and preface by Michel Weber, translation reviewed by the author (Frankfurt/Paris/Lancaster: Ontos Verlag), 2006. In 2000, his monograph La dialectique de l’intuition chez A. N. Whitehead. Sensation pure, pancréativité et onto-logisme (The Dialectic of Intuition in the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead: Pure Sensation, Pancreativity, and Onto-logism) was awarded a prize by the Belgian Royal Academy (Classe des Lettres de l’Académie Royale de Belgique).See Jean Ladrière, Marc Richir, Jacques Taminiaux, \\"Rapports des Commissaires,\\" Académie Royale de Belgique, Bulletin de la Classe des Lettres et des Sciences Morales et Politiques, 6e série, Tome XI, Bruxelles, 2000, pp. 122-126. Weber argues that the term pancreativism constitutes the more appropriate qualification of Whitehead's metaphysics, which is neither a pantheism or a panentheism. Professional activities Weber is the author of 10 monographs and 80 scholarly articles and encyclopedia entries. His monograph La Dialectique de l’intuition chez A. N. Whitehead: sensation pure, pancréativité et contiguïsme (The Dialectic of Intuition in the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead: Pure Sensation, Pancreativity, and Onto-logism) was awarded the Prix du Concours annuel 2000 by the Royal Academy of Belgium. He is also the motive force behind numerous international and intercultural collaborations. He strives to coordinate his professional activities toward the creation of a new, visionary philosophical culture conceived as cooperative, intellectually adventurous, ethically self-aware, and global in reach. :*He has founded three international scholarly societies: :::*Chromatiques whiteheadiennes,For a report on their Fifth International Conference, see \\"Politics, Science, and Religion Converge in Belgium,\\" Process Perspectives , 29:1 (Summer 2006), p. 16. :::*the Whitehead Psychology Nexus,See \\"The Whitehead Psychology Nexus, Retrospect and Prospect,\\" Process Perspectives , 26:3 (Summer/Fall 2003), pp. 3-4. and :::*the European William James Project. :*He manages a non-profit publishing house, :::*Éditions Chromatika. :*And, he oversees (in conjunction with various colleagues) the publication of four book series :::*the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes, :::*the Ontos Verlag Series in Process Thought, :::*the Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies, and :::*the Chromatika editions, ::as well as a philosophical annual, :::*Chromatikon: Annuaire de la philosophie en procès — Yearbook of Philosophy in Process. Using process philosophy as a matrix to foster synergies, Weber follows the work of hundreds of scholars worldwide and with each of his projects defines a locus where he thinks creative energies are poised to intersect. Collaborating with some 150 scholars representing all continents, he has to date edited or co-edited 30 collections, bringing together hundreds of original papers on themes relating to process philosophy in an interdisciplinary and multicultural context. :*Most ambitious in scope is the two-volume Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought, edited by Weber and Will Desmond: \\"Gathering 115 entries written by 101 internationally renowned experts in their fields, the Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought aims at interpreting Whitehead secundum Whitehead, at canvassing the current state of knowledge in Whiteheadian scholarship and at identifying promising directions for future investigations through (internal) cross-elucidation and (external) interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary development.\\" :*Also noteworthy is the recent interdisciplinary volume edited by Weber and Anderson Weekes, Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind, which \\"opens a dialogue between process philosophy and [the burgeoning field of] contemporary consciousness studies.\\"Weber and Weekes, Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Albany: SUNY), 2009. It is too early to judge how this book will be received by those who approach the study of consciousness from more mainstream backgrounds in Anglo-American Analytic philosophy or in Continental Phenomenology and Existentialism, but the contributors to this volume make a point of establishing what they believe to be fertile common ground between process thought and both its mainstream rivals. Weber is also the founder of the Centre for Philosophical Practice in Brussels.Centre de philosophie pratique \\"Chromatiques whiteheadiennes.\\" See also \\"The Chromatiques whiteheadiennes Centre for Philosophical Practice,\\" Process Perspectives , 30:1 (Summer 2007), pp. 17-18. Philosophical Counseling is a recent movement, probably begun in the United States, employing Socratic methods of dialog for the purpose of short-term counseling that, without seeking to replace more traditional psychotherapies, nevertheless offers an alternative to them. In July 2010, he organized an Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute in Paris, at the Cité universitaire's Fondation Biermans Lapôtre. The second Institute has taken place in July 2011. In May 2014, the philosophical counselling service moved to the Centre Kinos, now Tonaki, of the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve. Dr Weber is also currently Adjunct Professor, Department of Educational Foundations, University of Saskatchewan. Bibliography (selection) ;Authored monographs # La Dialectique de l’intuition chez A.

The MGEC was established in 2002 to fight the growing crime of human trafficking. In Mongolia, human trafficking is primarily a gendered crime. Young women and girls are trafficked into brothels for illegal and often unpaid prostitution against their consent. The center has provided support to hundreds of victims of trafficking from countries around the world. The MGEC has worked with authorities to improve legislation against the crime, runs prevention, awareness and advocacy programs and provides legal advocacy, shelter, counseling services and vocational training for repatriated victims of trafficking (VOTs). Over the last 17 years the MGEC has expanded its work to secure equal rights for men and women in Mongolian society. The center fights discrimination against women because this discrimination lies at the root of gender-based crimes and violence. It has developed a range of educational materials and publications for social workers, teachers, students, police and other officials. Recently, the MGEC has been developing educational tools for parents and teachers on child safety to help prevent sexual abuse of children.  Human trafficking in Mongolia  Human trafficking - the recruitment of individuals by deception or force for the purpose of exploitation arose in Mongolia during the 1990s. The transition of government from socialism to democracy resulted in rapid privatization of state-owned enterprises. As a result, many Mongolians, especially the young, have faced ongoing difficulties in finding employment making them vulnerable to traffickers offering attractive opportunities to work or study abroad. In addition, after the transition, Mongolians for the first time were able to freely travel in and out of their country. For many years the majority of Mongolians were trafficked into nearby countries including The People's Republic of China, Macau, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and The Republic of Korea. However, in recent years Mongolian trafficking victims have been found in a greater number of destinations, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. Mongolians have been trafficked for a variety of purposes, including sexual exploitation, forced labour, and arranged (false) marriage. Anti-trafficking work in Mongolia has been spearheaded by NGOs.United States Department of State The Mongolian Gender Equality Center was the first organisation fighting trafficking in Mongolia and continues to be the only organisation providing victim care and rehabilitation. Legislative changes have been made by government due to significant lobbying by NGOs. The law is now compliant with the Palermo Protocol, although government funding for implementation is not provided. Victims of trafficking are most often girls and women; the most frequent purpose of trafficking is for sexual exploitation. Increasingly, traffickers are targeting poor families from rural areas and trafficking them internally into cities of Mongolia. The shame and stigma associated with sexual abuse often keeps the women silent about their experiences long after they have been identified and returned home.  Goals  The goals of the MGEC are: * To fight against human trafficking * To lobby for improvements in the legal environment for victims of trafficking, gender- based violence and rape * To lobby for improvements in the provision of social services to victims of trafficking, gender-based violence and rape * To promote gender equality throughout all levels of society  Areas of work = Gender Equality  MGEC has developed and published a handbook on gender equality (in partnership with the National Pedagogical University and the Science and Technology University of Mongolia). In addition, the organization runs educational programs from primary school to university, and is also currently a member of a lobby group that drafts laws on gender equality.  Victim protection  In 2007 MGEC initiated the “Direct Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking Program” with assistance from the International Organization for Migration. Since then the program has provided 679 VOTs with assistance from the MGEC including repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration into the Mongolian community.[5] Nearly one thousand victims of sexual violence have also been assisted. Between 2016-17, 63 victims of trafficking were identified and provided with complete reintegration assistance. The program has assisted victims in the following ways:Mongolian Gender Equality Centre NGO General Information Publication. (2010) Repatriation of VOTs from abroad, co-operating with NGOs, government police departments, and international organizations. Between 2007 and March 2010, 155 Mongolian trafficked nationals aged between 8 and 49 were successfully repatriated with the help of various government bodies. Shelter for victims of trafficking and sexual violence in Ulaanbaatar, and Zamiin-Uud (on the border to China which is the most common overland route for international trafficking) with assistance from the Swiss Agency for Development and cooperation (SDC). The shelter supplies food, clothing and health checks, and training in various practical skills. Legal assistance and advice. The MGEC provides legal aid to victims of trafficking at no cost to any client who wishes to pursue justice in the courts. The MGEC has provided legal assistance to over a hundred victims. In addition to VoTs, assistance has been given to women who wished to divorce from Korean nationals and victims of sexual abuse not related to trafficking. It remains challenging to convict perpetrators due to loop holes in the law, and the reticence of victims to prosecute. The stigma associated with sexual violence means victims typically do not want their family or public to know of the crimes committed against them, This leaves traffickers able to target additional victims without facing justice. Vocational training, providing VOTs with the skills to ensure financial independence to prevent recurrence of trafficking. Advice on job seeking and starting a small business is also provided. Accommodation Provision of a fully furnished ger (Mongolian traditional housing) for victims who need ongoing accommodation.  Trafficking prevention  MGEC’s trafficking prevention program aims to develop public understanding through training, research and the distribution of educational materials: Research: MGEC has conducted national reports into victim’s experiences, the identification of trafficking networks and public opinion. Training: training sessions to lawyers, police, and government departments on current issues surrounding human trafficking and the legal status of VOTs. Training occurs throughout Mongolia. Publications: The organization produces and distributes handbooks and educational materials. Campaigns: the organization has produced a documentary film based on victim testimonies for the purposes of instruction and training. Public awareness is further raised through newspaper articles and TV programs. Hotline – +976 1903: Since November 2007, MGEC has provided a 24-hour trafficking hotline, this free line provides information and assistance as well as the contact details for international organisations that provide support to VOTS. The hotline provides direct information and counseling, receives information from third parties identifying potential trafficked persons, and provides advice for those who are going abroad for work and study. Campaigns: MGEC organizes general public awareness campaigns, and campaigns targeting at-risk groups based on the findings from MGEC surveys.Mongolian Gender Equality Centre NGO General Information Publication. (2010)  Foreign marriage  Between 2000 and 2008 the number of marriages of Mongolian women to foreign nationals increased from 79 to 3,485, and 67.8% of these were to Korean nationals. In July 2008, MGEC, together with the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Mongolian Ministry of Social Welfare & Labour, provided a one-day training program for Mongolian brides. The program focused on Korean culture, language and society, the legal regulations regarding marriage and divorce in Korea, and gave extensive advice on trafficking, domestic violence and abuse.Pre- Departure Orientation Programme Report. E. Khishigbayar, MGEC Human Trafficking Project Coordinator.(2008) As a result of this intervention the number of Mongolian women who became trapped in false marriages with Korean nationals has become almost negligible.  Education  The MGEC has provided training in sexual violence and trafficking to police, judiciary, immigration officials. civil society organisations and government in an ongoing basis for over 15 years. The MGEC is currently working to provide resources around reproductive and sexual rights to young girls and women in Mongolia. Mongolia a high rate of underage abortion and pregnancy. Lack of autonomy and understanding of sexual rights and health mean many Mongolian young women undertake unsafe sexual practices at a young age. There is also a high rate of sexual assault against children. Such events are often unreported because of the high stigmatization against victims of sexual abuse. Hospital records of assaults that led to injury indicate levels of such behaviour are not decreasing. The MGEC is developing tools and resources to help young people understand safe touch and their rights for safety. They are also targeting parents to empower them to talk with their children about safety. Education is being provided to journalists to improve the report of rape and sexual violence in the media. The goal is to move from victim blaming to acknowledgement that responsibility lies with the perpetrator of sexual assault and gender based violence. Lawyers are being provided with specialist training to improve their ability to work with and represent victims of sexual violence in court.  Trafficking under Mongolian law  In 1996, amendments to the Criminal Code (1986) introduced the first provisions addressing trafficking-related offences in Mongolia. As a result, the first case of trafficking was successfully prosecuted, involving a Russian national trafficked two Mongolian girls, aged 18, and 19. A revised criminal code including laws prohibiting trafficking came into effect in 2002, however articles remained vague and ill-defined. Under Article 113 (Sale and Purchase of Humans), the sale or purchase of human beings is punishable by a fine (51 to 250 times the minimum wage), obligatory labor for 300 to 500 hours, or by a prison sentence of up to 3 years. The MGEC lobbied the government to implement laws and procedures to protect victims and witnesses from prosecution resulting from their testimony given against traffickers. Continued campaigning by the MGEC has resulted in further improvements to Mongolian laws regarding human trafficking. 1\\\\. Mongolia signed the Palermo Protocol in May 2008 2\\\\.

The vessel had traveled to Clayoquot Sound off Vancouver Island to trade for furs. Following an argument begun during the bartering, the Tla-o-qui-aht captured the vessel and massacred most of the crew; one remaining sailor then scuttled her by detonating the powder magazine. Background On March 22, 1811, the Tonquin, a 290-ton barque commanded by Lieutenant Jonathan Thorn, reached the Columbia River with the intention of trading with the natives of the northern Pacific coast. To do this a trading post was necessary. After sailing around the mouth of the river for a while, the traders established Fort Astoria, the first American claim on the Pacific coast. The Tonquin had departed New York the previous September, with brief stops in the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic and the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands in the mid-Pacific. Thorn had previous disputes with his crew on the journey, including marooning sailors on the Falkland Islands, only bringing them back after being threatened by other crew members. After establishing a base of operations, the traders were free to explore the region in pursuit of fine furs. The Tonquin was crewed by twenty-three men at the time of the battle, and carried ten cannons. Though the vessel was American-flagged and commanded by a United States Navy officer, most of her crew were British subjects. On June 5, the Tonquin left Fort Astoria and sailed north to trade with the Nuu-chah-nulth around Nootka Sound. About two weeks later, off Vancouver Island, at a place named Woody Point, the Tonquin began trading with the Tla-o-qui-aht Nuu-chah-nulth. Battle A map of Vancouver Island with an inset of Clayoquot Sound On June 14, a Tla-o-qui- aht chief came aboard the Tonquin. Lieutenant Thorn hoped to purchase sea otter pelts which were offered by the natives. Unsatisfied with the price of the pelts, the lieutenant waved or tossed the pelt he was inspecting back at the chief. Apparently insulted, the chief left the vessel and later that night, a native woman came aboard the ship and warned the lieutenant that the Nuu-chah-nulth were planning to attack the ship the following day. Thorn failed to believe the woman until the next day when large numbers of native warriors were spotted on the coast. Since Thorn was unconvinced the Nuu-chah- nulth were hostile, a large canoe with over twenty native men was allowed to come to the ship to trade, and another canoe of some twenty men followed behind. The first twenty boarded with their weapons concealed under their clothing, pretending to trade furs and selling them cheaply. Thorn violated orders not to let very many natives onboard at once. Lieutenant Thorn, happy with the prices he was getting for the furs, realized too late the danger the ship was in and gave the orders to hoist the anchor and sails. At this moment the Nuu-chah-nulth chief gave a signal to attack. Alexander McKay, James Lewis, Thorn and most of the crew were killed quickly since they were generally unarmed; Thorn had kept the guns below deck. The Nuu-chah-nulth were armed with clubs and knives. A few surviving crew members began to resist from below deck where the store of rifles and powder was located. The Nuu-chah- nulth withdrew to shore as night fell. Five men remained alive, one seriously injured. They debated the options but saw no possibility of sailing the ship with so few hands. They decided that four would leave in one of the ship's skiffs (a small open boat) under the cover of darkness and try to make it back to Fort Astoria along the coast. The wounded man, possibly the ships armourer Weeks, stayed aboard the Tonquin. The Nuu-chah-nulth returned the next morning to plunder the ship. Once they were busy plundering, Weeks lit the ship's large black powder magazine. The massive explosion obliterated the ship, killing Weeks and many of the natives. The Nuu-chah-nulth acknowledged at least 100 dead and many more wounded, although other accounts say from sixty- one to over 200 natives were killed. The four sailors in the skiff were pushed ashore by a storm further down the coast and captured by the Nuu-chah-nulth. In revenge for the explosion they were slowly tortured to death. Of the thirty crew of the Tonquin, only one man survived, a half Chinook pilot and interpreter, named Lemazee by Washington Irving, George Ramsey by others, and more recently identified as Joseachal. During the initial battle he gave himself over to a Nuu-chah-nulth woman begging to be made a slave.Astoria (book), an 1836 account of the founding of Astoria, Oregon by Washington IrvingThe Identity of the Tonquin's Interpreter, by Robert F.

It is distinguished from teleology in that it does not focus on the purpose or goal of a given structure or process, merely the degree and complexity of the structure or process. History The term \\"eutaxiology\\" was first coined by geologist Lewis Ezra Hicks in his Critique of Design Arguments, in which he argued that one can appreciate the complexities of organic life on Earth without assuming and accepting an intelligent design theory.Hicks, Lewis Ezra, A Critique of Design Arguments. Boston: Franklin Press, 1883. Online at archive.org However, the concept had been around for centuries, most notably in the works of Aristotle, who offered in Physics the idea of natural design without a designer, stating that \\"It is absurd to suppose that ends are not present [in nature] because we do not see an agent deliberating\\".Aristotle. The Organon and Other Works. Opensource collection. Translated under the editorship of W.D. Ross. Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org). p. 649 in text. n647 in page field. https://archive.org/details/AristotleOrganon. Retrieved 2009-10-22. Lucretius, who was also a supporter of accidentalism, similarly stated in De Rerum Natura, \\"Nothing in the body is made in order that we may use it. What happens to exist is the cause of its use\\".Lucretius. On the Nature of Things: De rerum natura. Anthony M. Esolen, transl. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Univ. Pr., 1995. Teleology Eutaxiology is often mistaken for teleology, the study of purpose and design. However, it can be argued that eutaxiology and teleology are in fact complements to each other by stating that a good design and order necessarily implies the ability to achieve a goal or purpose. The two terms are also often used as arguments against each other, implying that eutaxiology is the observation of a process that occurs by chance, while teleology is always designed by some designer.Nagel, Ernest. Teleology. New York: Columbia University Press, 1979. Religion As a result, the eutaxiology is often used in religious arguments, particularly concerning the existence of God, though it is used in both sides of the argument. In complement with teleology, it can be argued that the basic principles of physics and chemistry are designed in a way that supports organic life. On the other hand, skeptics point to evolutionary biology, claiming that if the Earth were perfectly designed by a perfect creator, the long and sometimes unsuccessful process of evolution would not have had to have taken place. Critics of this theory claim that evolutionary biology is in fact evidence of intelligent design and therefore God, pointing to the eventual development of the human brain, which could engineer society.Corey, Michael Anthony. God and the New Cosmology. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 1993. Philosophy In this regard, eutaxiology can also be applied to ethics, especially concerning ends justifying means, and whether or not ends do in fact depend on means. On a larger scale, eutaxiology can be used to argue either for or against Anthropic Principle. On one hand, it can be stated that observations made about the physical and metaphysical Universe must be compatible with the life observed in it. For example, people believe that the Universe was especially designed for them because they cannot fathom other, completely different Universes, implying existential epistemic eutaxiology. Conversely, It can be said that due to Occam's Razor, the universe must be especially designed for humans because of the intricacies of the design that allows us to live where and how we do. Metaphysically, this can be traced back to causal arguments (i.e. do humans exist because of intricate biochemical processes, or do they exist because God created these biochemical processes?)

He had a distinguished career with the Bengal Civil Service, was later elected as the first Member of Parliament for the United Kingdom's Parliament constituency of Gravesend. Early years Wingfield was educated at Westminster School and Haileybury. Wingfield's father, William Wingfield (1772–1858), was a Master in Chancery and served as a member of parliament for Bodmin in 1806. William changed his surname to Wingfield-Baker in 1849 by Royal licensure after his inheritance of Orsett Hall in Essex. Several of William's children changed their surname as well. From William's first marriage to Lady Charlotte-Maria (died 1807), eldest daughter of Henry Digby, 1st Earl Digby, Wingfield had several older half siblings including: George-Digby, John-Digby, Mary, Caroline, Frances-Eliza, and Richard Baker Wingfield-Baker, a member of parliament for South Essex. By his father's marriage to Wingfield's mother, Elizabeth Mills, Wingfield had several additional siblings, including: William-Wriothesley-Digby, Frederick, Henry, Kenelm-Digby, Julia, and Lucy. Career Wingfield served in the Bengal Civil Service from 1840 to 1866. He was a proponent of Charles Canning's clemency policy during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. While in the BCS, he held several offices including Commissioner of Gorakhpur, which is the post he held when appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath on 18 May 1860, and Vice-Chairman of the East India Association's Council. From 15 February 1859 to 20 April 1860, he was the Chief Commissioner of Oude. On 24 May 1866, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India. A Liberal, Wingifled was elected to Parliament over Bedford Pim, serving served during the period of 18 November 1868 to 5 February 1874 when Wingfield was unseated by Pim. Personal life Wingfield never married. His residence was located first at 12 Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London, and at the time of his death on 27 January 1892 at 66 Portland Place, London. In his will (proved on 4 March 1892), Wingfield bequeathed money to at least two charities, including the London and the National Dental Hospitals.

The company is now part of Sony and no longer exists as stand-alone identity. The company was founded in 1979 by Hal Prewitt as a technology firm to develop, market and support computer related products and services. They were best known for supporting IBM's first business microcomputers such as the 5100, 5110 and 5120. With the introduction of the IBM PC and PC AT, the company provided an extensive line of disk drives, backup and personal computer products. Core became very well known as a leading industry developer of disk array and computer data storage. Many of Core's products were the first of their kind, had no direct competition and were widely regarded for their superior performance and reliability. Users and the computer press raved about Core's products. InfoWorld described Core's ATplus \\"is built like a Sherman tank, offering exceptional performance and reliability.\\" PC Magazine called them \\"Workhorses of Performance Computing\\" and \\"High-quality construction..breaks the speed barrier for access times\\" and asked \\"Will other manufactures follow suit?\\" Core was known for their advertising and perhaps produced a few of the PC Industry's greatest promotions. The 1985 and 1986 rebate and recall Ad for IBM PC AT hard disk drives. So successful and controversial, there was a rumor it was a topic at an IBM board of directors meeting. And the time where they gave away a free IBM PC AT when purchasing one of Core's ATplus 72 MB drives. Core remained a private company solely owned by Prewitt until 1993 when purchased by Aiwa, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony. History For business history pre-incorporation 1975–1980: Founding The company was built on the early work of Prewitt using his business and personal computer development experiences. This was the period during the creation of the first microcomputers, the launch of the Altair 8800 and founding of Microsoft. He was selling and programming Minicomputers and assembling these microcomputers, attaching computer peripherals, programming and building them into business computer systems. Core was created under a different business model. Initially, it was marketed as an association and structured as a for-profit organization specifically for users of the IBM 5100 Series and IBM System/23. The objective was to sell by mail-order computer supplies, pre-developed (off-the-shelf) programs and hardware maintenance service. Supplies included printer ribbons and paper, diskettes, tape cartridges. Software ranged from simple mortgage interest calculations, word processing, games and utilities to advanced payroll, accounting and industry specific applications. Users wanted readily available, simple to install and support for software that was also low in cost. Core was able to fill this niche because IBM had developed the machines with engineering and scientific applications in mind, while business programs such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing were not generally available. Computer maintenance was an insurance program that provided on-site repairs and replacement parts, all provided by IBM service but at a lower cost than available directly from IBM. The company was very successful attracting users of the IBM 5100 Series as many IBM Sales Representatives referred their customers to the organization. While Core grew, profits were used for the continuing development of computer data storage. 1981–1983: Hard disk drives, LAN and PC for IBM 5100 series These IBM machines had a closed architecture, with most the design information unpublished and held secret. Computer systems of this design are extremely or most likely impossible to have the ability to swap components, obtain support from other vendors or upgrade to better configuration/another model unless that option is available from the original manufacturer. The limitations make a customer dependent on one vendor for products and services for the software and hardware parts of the system. Core sensed an opportunity to provide greater and faster computer data storage. After a five-year effort, in September 1982 they announced the availability of the first hard disk drives and local area network (LAN) for the IBM 5100 Series. IBM systems as sold were storage limited and without a network option; the 5100 had tape with the 5110 and 5120 restricted to 1.2 MB floppy disks. Core drives were available starting at 10 MB and increased up to 160 MB in removable and fixed configurations. CoreNet, the LAN built into each Core storage system, allowed interconnection of up to eight IBM 5100 Series systems, providing the ability to share storage and data. This configuration pre-dated LANs of the period for the IBM PC and compatibles. In 1983, Core introduced two major solutions as IBM was withdrawing from marketing the IBM 5100 series. First, software called PC51 that would run allowed 5100 series computer programs written in BASIC to run unmodified on the IBM PC and compatibles under MS-DOS. And second, a LAN card for the IBM PC and compatibles that provided connection to the IBM 5100 Series network. These solutions allowed IBM 5110/5120 series users to add new technology and increase productivity while retaining their investment in equipment and software. Core's development of their storage systems, LAN and PC51 software was major technology engineering feat without rivals. Due to the complexity and the successful reverse engineering of the systems, resulted in captive market as they were the only organization able to provide an upgrade path for these IBM owners. 1984–1986: Educating the marketplace, IBM VAD, hard disk drives, PC and backup In 1984, CORE expanded its product focus and entered the personal computer (PC) marketplace. The company's first product introduced the year before, called PC-51, was a completely new operating system (and language) for the IBM PC and compatibles. It enabled a PC to function like an IBM 5110/5120 system, demonstrating the company's strong software development capabilities. Not only did this allow users to continue using the application software they had already developed, but it increased processing speed by a factor of two to ten times, and reduced maintenance cost up to 90%. This new product opened up an unexplored marketplace for CORE by allowing the company to become an IBM value-added dealer (VAD) and sell both the IBM PC and CORE products individually and as a combined package. IBM authorized and promoted this relationship because it provided an upgrade path for their customers that was previously unavailable. As a result of the early development effort for the IBM 5100 series, CORE released its own family of high-performance hard disk drives called the ATplus Series, with better capacity, reliability and performance than IBM's drives. A few weeks after the introduction of the new IBM AT in August 1984, CORE discovered problems in the factory-issued hard disk drive. As the media and marketplace learned of IBM's disk problems, CORE was once again in a unique position to capitalize on an opportunity, without any significant competition. For more than six months the IBM AT the model with the CMI was in short supply. Delays were attributed to lack of drives, technical problems with the machine or some other undisclosed issues. Core desired a major partner and selected Control Data Corporation (CDC) to assist with the introduction of the drives for the PC marketplace. The announcement was made in February 1985 and generated a significant amount of press coverage. Core discovered that a general lack of understanding existed among the news media and users regarding technology of different computer and mass storage systems. Few understood the value of different systems to the end-user or how to rate the many choices in the marketplace. In response, Core began placing considerable emphasis on user education, which resulted in a major contribution to computer industry. Directly from these efforts, the news media, computer magazines, product reviewers, dealers and computer manufactures started discussing, providing and promoting \\"seek time\\", \\"access time\\", \\"transfer time\\" and how to value or understand hard disk drives importance in a computer system. The company believed the more end-users learned about computers and the engineering behind Core products, the less these users wanted any other product. Purchasers of the IBM AT were reporting some dealers were installing inferior drives into the computer without disclosing the fact. To help buyers and for industry education, Core developed the DiskP program, later replaced by the COREtest (DOS based), to identify sub-standard products by providing a visual demonstration of the speed and comparative measurements of hard disk drives and controllers. Many computer publications, hardware manufacturers, distributors, dealersBorrett, Lloyd. \\"\\"Megabyte Tarnish,\\" PC Australia, September 1985; url accessed March 8, 2010 and independent evaluation firms relied on COREtest for product comparison, which made COREtest the industry standard and most often quoted benchmark. As these programs were provide without charge and freely available from BBS, computer magazines and dealers, it is believed there was an installed base of over million copies worldwide promoting Core technology and education. For more than two years, newspapers, magazines and computer publications ran stories on the IBM AT and Computer Memories Inc. (CMI) hard disk drives problems.

In July 2012, the ORG was merged with the AFP's Specialist Response and Security team (SRS) to create the Specialist Response Group. History In January 2005 Australian Federal Police created what was then known as the Operational Response Team (ORT), a unit of specialist tactical police able to respond and assist AFP officers engaged in overseas deployments as part of the International Deployment Groups response to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, Honiara. The ORT was soon expanded to fulfill further AFP domestic and international operations and included new roles (such as public order), and was renamed the Operational Response Group in 2006. Mission The Operational Response Group was AFP's permanent specialist tactical and stability and the policing capability able to rapidly respond to civil disorder and international crisis, both nationally and internationally within 24 hours. The Operational Response Group was defined as a police tactical group within the National Counter-Terrorism Committee arrangements providing the Commonwealth of Australia an offshore specialist and tactical policing response capability. The unit provided similar capabilities to the AFP's Specialist Response and Security Team but focused on national and international deployments outside of the Australian Capital Territory, where the SRS had responsibility.

Early life He was born at Bombay on 10 September 1818, was the only son of David Malcolm, a Bombay merchant, who was the brother of Admiral Sir Pulteney and General Sir John Malcolm. He was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton, the University of Edinburgh and at Addiscombe Military Seminary. Military career He was commissioned into the East India Company on 10 June 1836, and was posted to the 1st Bombay Native Infantry on 18 July 1837. He served in the First Anglo- Afghan War, as deputy-assistant commissary-general and baggage-master with the Bombay division, and was present at the battle of Ghazni and occupation of Kabul. In August 1840, at the head of a detachment of Sind Irregular Horse, he joined the force sent under Major Clibborn to relieve Kahan in Baluchistan, took part in the attempt to force the Nafusk pass, and was mentioned in despatches for his gallantry. He was also engaged in the operations against Nusseer Khan and the Brahoes, and the capture of their camp near Kanda on 1 December. He received the medal. He became lieutenant on 31 August 1840. He served under Colonel John Jacob during the subjugation of Sind, and was present at the battle of Shadadpur and the capture of Shahpur. In the Second Anglo-Sikh War, he commanded the 2nd Sind horse, and was present at the siege of Multan and the battle of Gujrat. He was mentioned in despatches, received the medal, and on becoming captain in his regiment (1st Bombay native infantry) he was given a brevet majority on 22 June 1849. He became lieutenant-colonel on 28 November 1854. He served in the Anglo-Persian War of 1856-7, and commanded a small field force during the Indian mutiny. On 29 November 1857, he stormed the fortified village of Halgalli. He took possession of Shorapur on 9 February 1858, and on 2 June he captured the fort of Nargund, the strongest in the South Maratha country. He was mentioned in despatches, received the medal, and was appointed CB on 21 March 1859. He became colonel in the army on 30 August 1860, and major-general on 15 December 1867. In the expedition to Abyssinia in 1868 he commanded the second division, which guarded the line of communications. He was included in the vote of thanks of parliament, was advanced to KCB on 14 August 1868, and received the medal. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 29 May 1875, and general on 1 October 1877, and was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list on 1 July 1881. He was advanced to GC on 29 May 1886. He died at Leamington on 6 April 1897. Family On 19 October 1852 he married Wilhelmina Charlotte, youngest daughter of the Rev. Henry Alright Hughes. She survived him. In 1868 he printed for private circulation at Karachi Remarks on the Indian Army (18 pages), in which he dwelled on the danger of relying on European troops and of neglecting and discrediting the native army, as had been the tendency since the mutiny.

Education and early career Butts attended Oberlin high school then Oberlin College in Ohio. He took a break from Oberlin from the summer of 1962 to 1964 to work as a journalist in Mississippi for the civil rights movement. He returned to Oberlin to finish college, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government in 1967. By then, he had married his wife, Alice (née Gould). Together, they had four children: John, Paul, Joanna, and Helen. Butts worked on the 1964 and 1967 election campaigns for Carl Stokes, who was in the Ohio House of Representatives and became the first black elected mayor of a major U.S. city. Political career Butts served in the 23rd District from 1975 until 1990. Butts originally defeated Republican Senator Anthony F. Novak in 1974 to take a seat in the Senate, which represented the near westside of Cleveland at the time, including parts of the Detroit-Shoreway and Ohio City neighborhoods. He was reelected in 1978, 1982, and 1986. After the 1980 elections, Butts was elected as minority whip, and was elected as assistant president pro-tempore in 1982. Butts served on the Ways and Means Committee, Energy and Public Utilities, and the Rules Committees. He was appointed Chairman of the Elections, Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee, as well as chairman of the Public Improvements Inspection Committee. Butts was generally known as a hard working legislator, but he also could antagonize opponents, once considered of the \\"worst\\" legislators by Cincinnati magazine. The 23rd Senate District would later be gerrymandered, expanding westward to include the eastern portions of Lakewood. In 1990, Butts was defeated for reelection by former Lakewood mayor Anthony Sinagra. 1979 mayoral campaign In April 1979, Butts announced that he would enter the 1979 Cleveland mayoral election, challenging fellow Democrat, the beleaguered incumbent Dennis Kucinich. Kuicinich was considered vulnerable, having narrowly survived a recall election the year before by just over 200 votes out of more than 120,000 votes. The field quickly grew in July with additions of city council majority leader Basil Russo and Republican George Voinovich, who was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. Also, Thabo L. Ntweng of the socialist worker's party would also join the race. One of Butts' top senate aides, A. Lamont Eanes, helped run the 1979 mayoral campaign. Eanes would eventually be nominated by President Barack Obama as deputy Social Security administrator in 2014 Butts would finish fourth in the nonpartisan primary in the crowded field, garnering a respectable 19,431 votes, or 15.28%, behind eventual winner Voinovich, Kuicinich, and Russo. After politics As of 2015, Butts was a managing director for a blog, Takingonthegiant.com, which chronicles the work of creative young people who want to change the world.

Because of the prevalence of Christian groups and institutions throughout the history of the United States, many of these symbols can be assumed to have come from Christian sources. However, teams deriving their image from symbols belonging to other systems of religious and pseudo-religious beliefs have also been included. Mascots as visual representation Sports clubs and teams select their image or mascot based on any number of factors, including choosing an image based on a desire to pick a symbol that will attempt to convey the assets the clubs and teams aim to display, such as strength, courage, aggression, and endurance. Scholars have drawn connections between desires such as these and the religious totems found in polytheism, where visual representations of animals serve as symbols to express the physical and spiritual qualities of community. Adoration of a mascot by a school or company can be seen as religiously significant. However, economic factors also come into play, as both schools and sports-franchise owners want to make money. Just as an appealing, marketable symbol can generate vast revenue, so can profits suffer if a potentially offensive symbol alienates some potential fans. This consideration as well can explain why sectarian religious symbols rarely appear in sports-team names and mascots. Most of the teams listed here belong to schools and not to professional franchises. The reasons for this are subject to debate. In schools administrators, teachers, and parents act as a community to give students education in local values, and in many places these values come from religious institutions like churches and synagogues. So schools often become de facto representatives of a community's religious ideals as well as visual representatives of that community at a state, national, and international level. These conditions combine to make school sports a place for religious symbols, after they get filtered through the secular values both of the nation at large and of sport itself. This filtering produces mixed-value mascots like \\"Demon Deacons\\" of Wake Forest University and the \\"Hustlin' Quakers\\" (formerly \\"Fightin' Quakers\\", subsequently simply \\"Quakers\\") of Earlham College. Despite the sensitive nature of religious issues in the United States of America, religious imagery in American sport has generated little controversy. Subtle spins on generic symbols like the crusader have come under attack for their insensitivity to non-Christian groups, but by and large religiously inspired team names and mascots have not been scrutinized. This contrasts with team names and mascots from Native American cultural sources. Catholic symbolism There seems to be a clustering of religiously inspired mascots and team symbols in the American Midwest. This area's population is predominantly Protestant or Calvinist and the culture of the Midwest tends to be conservative. This may be a reason for the preponderance of religion symbolism in even non-religious schools and institutions, but does not explain in any way why this symbolism would be Catholic in nature. The institutions listed below—some of which are Catholic—endorse religious symbolism either by the team name or individual mascots. Some are negative, menacing symbols such as the various Demons and Devils, but a majority of them take on positive connotations within Catholicism. These include the Saints, Angels and Friars.

The school decided that the name was \\"inappropriate for a Catholic institution with a multicultural mission.\\" Corlis McGee, president of Eastern Nazarene College, said, \\"There's a growing awareness that the connotation of the word has changed, and the Crusader no longer represents the positive message of Christian love we want to share with the world.\\" Other universities have decided to keep the mascot as a way to honor their histories and constantly remind students to \\"communicate our desire to bring the good news and cross into every situation we encountered.\\" Schools who have done away with the \\"Crusaders\\" mascot include Point Loma Nazarene University (now the Sea Lion), Eastern Nazarene College (now the Lions), Northwest Nazarene University (now the Nighthawks),Northwest Nazarene University, \\"NNU is excited to announce new university mascot\\". nnu.edu. 2017-10-16. Retrieved 2020-06-27. Northwest Christian University (now the Beacons), Susquehanna University, The University of the Incarnate Word (the new mascot, the Cardinals, was chosen by students), Clarke University (now the Pride), and Wheaton College. Other schools have retained the name \\"Crusaders\\" as their team name and mascot, including College of the Holy Cross, Valparaiso University, North Greenville University, and Evangel University,. Protestant symbolism Included here are team names and mascots associated with Protestantism. As the list suggests the visual vocabulary of non-Catholic Christianity, particularly in American sport, does not differ significantly from Catholic Christianity. What distinguishes this section has less to do with symbols themselves and more with context. Six of these schools are affiliated with the NCAA and one is affiliated with the NAIA. The majority of these schools are located in Southeastern coastal states like North Carolina or South Carolina. In this part of the country religiously affiliated colleges and universities have existed since colonial times, when the majority of European Americans living in North American colonies were Protestant Christians. The religiously inspired team names and mascots are a part of this legacy, and associations between school spirit and local religious belief are therefore more historically acceptable in this part of the country. In spite of this legacy, the teams at most Protestant affiliated colleges and schools do not identify with religious symbols. There are nearly 1,000 Protestant colleges and universities in the U.S. alone. But out of all of these, only 14 identify with religious names or mascots. That's less than 2%. This makes sense, because not all of these names and mascots were inspired by religion. The origin of the famous Duke Blue Devil mascot for instance can be traced back to the World War I era. Units of French soldiers called \\"les Diables Beus\\" marshalled won fame in America. They inspired the Duke student body to make the Blue Devil the school's official mascot in 1911. The name was much more unpopular with the Methodism than with anyone else. The inspiration for a name or mascot also comes from relationships and in particular, rivalries with other schools. Until 1937 Wake Forest's men's athletics teams were known as \\"the Deacons,\\" \\"the Baptists,\\" or \\"Old Gold and Black.\\" But after hiring a new coach and having way more success the school was looking for a way to show its prowess. They beat Duke in a game of football and the president praised them for \\"fighting like demons\\" to clinch the win, so the name stuck. So the process of inventing an image for a sports team comes from relationships. Clubs and teams can make their images visual reminders of a meaningful moment in school nhisotry. Again, the suggested correlation between sports team mascots and the totems comes into play as some Native American tribes mixed images of vanquished enemies with their own to assimilate their powers. Powerful images of demons, devils and knights remind us of the mascots of Catholic teams, but Protestant teams also draw on symbols from their own beliefs, generally involving religious leadership and including Deacons, Preachers, Evangels, Quakers and Fightin Christians. There are few professional teams that use religious symbolism in their mascots. This is probably driven by their desire to appeal to much larger and diverse fan bases than colleges and schools. Examples of this, where the name has no religious significance, include the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, whose name is simply alliterative and the New Orleans Saints, whose name is derived a well-known jazz song. Colleges and universities * Bloomfield College Deacons, Presbyterian (NJ) * Earlham College Hustlin' Quakers, Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Mascot Mr. Quaker.

Generic and/or ambiguous Most teams with mascots such as \\"Devils\\" or \\"Wizards\\" have little to no affiliation with any religious groups. They may choose their mascots for the purpose of intimidating their opponents. Mascots are usually depicted as mischievous or even cute and have no spiritual representation. Devils are one of the most common mascots throughout American sports. This can likely be attributed to Christian beliefs being the most common of religions in the U.S. The devil is normally used as a fierce, intimidating image to represent teams.

It opened in 1974 (as a drop-in centre) located on Bishop Street in Montreal. In 1975 it became incorporated and two years later it moved to a location in the Côte-des-Neiges district, before moving to its current location at 2001 Saint Laurent Boulevard in 1995. At first it did not receive financial support from the province or city, which both argued that Status Indians were a matter of federal jurisdiction. However, many aboriginal people served by the centre do not have status. In 1987 the Native Woman's Shelter of Montreal was established. In 1990 another social epidemic was addressed with the organization of the first Native AIDS/HIV Conference in Quebec. In 1993, the Urban Aboriginal Economic Development Department was established. The Native Friendship Centre does not endorse any particular world religious traditions but supports First Nations traditional spiritual practices. As well, visitors may participate if they choose to do so. Wellness sessions with elders who visit and provide individual guidance, lead healing circles and organize sweat lodges from time to time. Courses on drum making and native arts and crafts are also available. The concept of culture and identity are depicted through the Native American art work displayed in the centre by local artists to keep the focus of their journey through city life. The centre also distributes various newsletters and papers from many communities within the province and throughout Canada for those who are looking for a connection with their hometown and respective Nations. Mission statement The mission of the Native Friendship Centre of Montreal (NFCM) is to promote, develop and enhance the quality of life of Montreal's Urban Indigenous community. The Native Friendship Centre of Montreal is part of a regional and national initiative that bridges the gap between two cultures. Current activities To keep up with the growing demand for various activities among those who frequent the centre whether temporarily or long-term have become diverse and plentiful. These activities are aimed at keeping everyone occupied while visiting or living in the city. There are services such as translation services (from varying aboriginal tongues to English and French) and bilingual web media for a calendar of events. Social outings such as Laser Quest outings, bowling trips, movie outings give everyone a change in venue. Classes in bead work, arts and crafts, cooking and drum making are a vital tradition to pass down to everyone. Psychological and medical counseling services such as medical transportation arrangement services for those who are not from the area or province. This includes arranging transportation to and from medical appointments or travel terminals. More technical services also provided on certain days of the week including legal services for those who may have had an encounter with the law while visiting the areas of Montreal or for those who are new to the area and seek legal counsel for common questions and concerns. Health workshops activities include the Diabetes Prevention Project, Ka’wahse (Homeless Street Patrol), and Hep C HIV/AIDS Prevention and Outreach Project, and participation in academic studies. Job Search Workshops and Life skills Programs such as the Job Search and Human Relations or FNHRDCQ/EPOC Training Initiative. Youth and adult programs on two separate calendars of events such as daily activities and outings. Membership is given upon registration and entitles access to all featured in the facility. In 1997, it opened a Head Start child care program. Current organizational features The NFCM employs about 25 staff members with a full roster of volunteers who are given commendation for their efforts. Funding is mostly obtained by private donations, Band and Tribal Councils, Provincial and Federal Funding for Aboriginal Youth Programs, as most of the projects and campaigns are directly funded by the various organizations who welcome them such as the HIV/AIDS initiative as well as solidarity in movements against violence. The shortage of housing which plagues most First Nations communities has trickled into the Montreal community where those residents are seeking salvation and coming to the Native Friendship Centre for shelter, help and guidance. Many especially the Inuit are homeless and much has been done to help them through their hard times.

He served as head of the Byzantine Senate.  Background  According to Evagrius Scholasticus, Maurice and his family could trace their lineage from \\"elder Rome\\". The future Emperor had been born in Arabissus, Cappadocia. The family's hometown was in the vicinity of modern Elbistan. The town was relatively insignificant for centuries. Justinian I had increased its importance, turning it to a recruiting centre and staging area for his forces. It was part of a military route starting from Caesarea Mazaca (modern Kayseri) and proceeding to Comana and Melitene.Whitby (1988), pp. 4-5  Career  The primary source about Paul is the \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" of John of Ephesus. It reports: \\"At the beginning of his reign, the king sent for his father, an old man named Paul, and his mother, and his brother, whose name was Peter, and his two sisters, one of whom was a widow, and the other the wife of Philippicus. ... And next he made his father head of the senate, and chief of all the patricians, and gave him and his son Peter, the king's brother, the entire property of the great patrician Marcellus, brother of the late king Justin, which was not much less than the royal demesnes themselves, with his houses and landed estates, and gold and silver, and his wardrobe, and every thing that he had everywhere without exception.\\". And next he gave his father and mother another house near the church (of S. Sophia) and his own palace.John of Ephesus, John of Ephesus, Ecclesiastical History, Part 3, Book 5, Chapter 18. 1860 translation by R. Payne Smith John continues to detail the honours bestowed by Maurice to his extended family, placing special focus on Domitian, Bishop of Malatya. While mentioning Domitian as a kinsman of Maurice, John does not specify the exact relation of the Bishop to Maurice or to Paul.John of Ephesus, John of Ephesus, Ecclesiastical History, Part 3, Book 5, Chapters 18-19. 1860 translation by R. Payne Smith Theophanes the Confessor records the death of Paul in 593. In \\"Late antiquity: empire and successors, A.D. 425-600\\", Averil Cameron, Bryan Ward-Perkins, and Michael Whitby observe that Maurice's nepotism in such appointments was probably unpopular with his contemporaries. He had just succeeded Tiberius II Constantine, whose generosity had exhausted the Byzantine treasury. In contrast, Maurice promoted policies intended to \\"amass and store away\\" money for the state by decreasing government spending. The Byzantine army experienced decreases in payment and reduced funding, provoking several mutinies by various forces. Maurice soon gained a reputation for avarice and was even rumored to sell public grain for gold. By 602, the population was openly accusing Maurice of orchestrating an ongoing famine. In such a context, Maurice's obvious generosity to his own family was turning public opinion against him.Cameron, Ward-Perkins & Whitby (2000), pp. 99-100 John of Nikiû reports \\"Now Maurice, who became emperor in succession to the God-loving Tiberius was very avaricious,... [he] welcomed many false, turbulent persons owing to his greed for money. And he sold all the grain of Egypt and converted into gold, and likewise the grain for Byzantium (Constantinople) he sold for gold.\\" Theophylact Simocatta and Theophanes the Confessor report on the mob of Constantinople accusing Maurice of being a Marcianist. The reference being to a Christian sect which rejected almsgiving and apparently charity in general.Whitby (1988), pp. 19 The practice of bestowing titles and property to imperial relatives was rather common place by this point. Appointments to high-offices were also to be expected. It was part of the process of establishing a new dynasty. Justin II was only the latest emperor to have done so. Maurice, though, suffered in comparison to his immediate predecessor, Tiberius II Constantine, who had not spent lavishly to promote an extended clan to power. Though in this respect, Tiberius looked better by default. Primary sources do not mention him actually having many relatives.Cameron, Ward-Perkins & Whitby (2000), pp. 100  Family  Paul seems to have married twice, though the names of his wives are unknown. John of Ephesus mentions him still married to Maurice's mother c. 582. Theophanes mentions Maurice celebrating the marriage of his father at a later point, presumably the second marriage. Paul had at least four known childrenWhitby (1988), pp. 5 *Maurice, Byzantine Emperor. *Peter. *Gordia, wife of Philippicus. She reportedly constructed a monastery dedicated to Mammes of Caesarea.Whitby (1988), pp. 20 The report originates in the Patria of Constantinople and may be somewhat inaccurate. The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire considers it likelier that Gordia enlarged an older monastery of Saint Mammes, built by Pharasmanes.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 543 *Theoctista. Widowed prior to the elevation of Maurice to the throne in 582. A letter addressed to her, written by Pope Gregory I, survives. Damiana Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange (1610–1688) identified another sister of Maurice, mentioned in \\"Leimon\\" (Pratum spirituale, Spiritual Meadow) by Joannes Moschus. She was Damiana, mother of Athenogenes, the bishop of Petra in Arabia. She plays a significant part in various chapters. The information on her family is included in the following lines: \\"Amma (abbatissa) Damiana, a solitary, the mother of Athenogenus [Athenogenes], the bishop of Petra\\". ...Joannes Moscus, \\"Spiritual Meadow\\", Chapter CXXVII (127). Translation by Benedict Baker (1926 - 2004). \\"Here is another story amma Damiana told us: One Good Friday, before I was enclosed (as an anchoress), I went to (the church of) Saints Cosmas and Damian and spent the whole night there. Late during the night an old woman from Phrygian Galatia came in and gave everyone in the church two small coins (minuta). This was at the time when a niece of mine, and of the most faithful Emperor Mauritius [Maurice], had come to pray in the holy city and had stayed there for the whole year, and I had taken her with me to Saints Cosmas and Damian, so that we were in church together.\\" The passage identifies Damiana having a niece in common with Maurice. Making it likely they were siblings. \\"He told us that he had heard the following story being told by Athenogenus [Athenogenes], the bishop of Petra, the son of amma Damiana:My aunt (avia mea) Joanna had a brother called Adelphius, bishop of Arabessus.\\" Joannes Moscus, \\"Spiritual Meadow\\", Chapter CXXVIII (128). Translation by Benedict Baker (1926 - 2004). Avia in Latin literally means grandmother, the mother of someone’s parent, not aunt.Wiktionary:avia She herself was abbess of a monastery of women. This bishop went out one day to visit his sister in her monastery. As he went in to the courtyard (atrium) of the monastery he saw a sister possessed of a demon lying on the pavement. The bishop called out to his sister: \\"Doesn't it worry you that this sister is being troubled and besmirched like this? You surely must know that as abbess you have authority over all your sisters?\\" \\"What can I do against a demon?\\" she replied \\"What do you think you have been doing all these years?\\" replied the bishop, who then made a prayer and cleansed that sister of the demon. Since this Joanna was the grandmother of Athenogenes, du Cange identified her as the likely wife of Paul, mother of Damiana, Maurice and their siblings. There is some doubt on how old Joanna and Adelphius were supposed to be. Another tale by Moschus reports them having met John Chrysostom (c. 347 - 407) in person, during a brief stay of his in Cucusus (modern Göksun). Possible descendants The Prosopography notes that there is a 597 reference by Pope Gregory I of another Gordia in Constantinople, identified as wife of Marinus, mother of Theoctista and mother-in-law of Christodorus. The names \\"Gordia\\" and \\"Theoctista\\" common in the women of the two families might indicate a relation, though the Prosopography merely speculates on it. The Pope seems to have held this lady in some regard, calling her \\"excellentissima filia mea domna Gordia\\" (my excellent daughter mistress Gordia). He also points, this Gordia was among the few in Constantinople able to read his Latin texts with no need of a translation to Greek. A number of modern genealogies have speculated this Gordia could be a daughter of the widowed Theoctista, thus a granddaughter to Paul. The younger Theoctista could so be named after her maternal grandmother. Further speculation has the younger Theoctista and Christodorus as ancestors of Domnika, the wife of Bardanes Tourkos and mother of Thekla, a 9th-century Empress.Bernd Josef Jansen Genealogy: Descendants of Theoktista. Little is actually known about this Domnika and less about her ancestry. \\"Byzantine women: varieties of experience 800-1200\\" (2006) has a passage about her, written by Judith Herrin. The primary source about her is Theophanes Continuatus. Domnica was a wealthy lady of Constantinople. In 803, Bardanes led a failed revolt against Nikephoros I Logothetes. He was allowed to live and enter a monastery. While part of their family property was confiscated, Domnica was allowed to maintain at least enough to found a new monastery and retire there. An unmarried daughter and several stepdaughters followed her unto monastic life. Her subsequent fate and that of her monastery is unknown. Her story was part of a pattern developing through the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm. \\"Women of the political elite\\" were often at risk of falling out of favour along with their relatives, ending up relegated to a monastery. As a security measure, many of them founded monastic communities which were to serve as their \\"private retirement homes\\" in time of need. Their enemies could then remove them from the political scene without actually killing them. It is unclear how many of these monasteries survived the death of their respective founder or her immediate relatives.Garland (2006), Chapter \\"Changing Functions of Monasteries for Women during Byzantine Iconoclasm\\", pages 7-8  References  Sources  * * * * Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Justinian dynasty Category:Patricii ","title":"Paul (father of Maurice)"},{"id":"26924190","text":"The smallspot moray (Gymnothorax microstictus)Common names for Gymnothorax microstictus at www.fishbase.org. is a moray eel found in the western central Pacific Ocean around Papua New Guinea.Gymnothorax microstictus at www.fishbase.org.

The first Internet audiological test was accomplished in 2000 by Givens, Balch and Keller. The first Transatlantic teleaudiology test was performed in April 2009 when Dr James Hall tested a patient in South Africa from Dallas at the AAA conference. Since that historic event the interest in tele-audiology increased significantly. There are 2 types of teleaudiology tests: Store-and-forward (Asynchronous) tests Testing a patient and then transferring the results via emailing or the Internet to a professional that will look at the results Real- time (Synchronous) tests Testing a patient in real-time as if the patient is sitting in front of you. Audiologists are used to testing patients remotely because testing a patient in a sound booth while the audiologist sits outside the booth is virtually the same as testing a patient over the Internet. The window is not a real glass window but a teleconference window. The only real difference is that the physical distance changed.

He is best remembered as a past president of the New Zealand Veterinary Association. Biography=Early years Cunningham was born at Mangatainoka in the Wairarapa in New Zealand on 16 August 1905. He was dux of Dannevirke High School and later took a position as a cadet in the chemical laboratory of the Department of Agriculture in Wellington. While at the Department, Cunningham studied part-time at Victoria University College. In 1928, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree, and in 1929 with a Master's of Science with first-class honours in Chemistry. In 1929, Cunningham attended the Rowett Research Institute at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and this marked the beginning of his lifelong interest in trace element nutrition. He returned to New Zealand with a PhD in copper metabolism to become a research officer in animal nutrition at Wallaceville Veterinary Laboratory in Upper Hutt. Cunningham then attended the University of Sydney and gained a Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc). Career Upon his return to Wallaceville, he was appointed chief biochemist and section leader and concentrated on his main work of improving livestock production. In 1945, with the support of John Filmer, director of the Animal Research Division of the Department of Agriculture, Cunningham became superintendent of the Wallaceville station. He was in charge of Wallaceville from 1945 to 1958. The bacteriologist Sydney Josland worked under the direction of Cunningham at Wallaceville until he left to commence employment at the National Health Institute in Wellington in 1954. Cunningham became Assistant Director General of Agriculture in 1958 and his services to agriculture were recognised in 1959 when he was made a CBE. The degree of DSc was conferred upon Cunningham the same year by Victoria University of Wellington for his research on copper metabolism, and he received an honorary DVSc from the University of Melbourne in 1967. In 1962, Cunningham was appointed as foundation dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Massey Agricultural College in Palmerston North.

Armenia is one of the oldest wine producing regions of the world. In particular, the oldest known winery was found in Armenia's Areni region (see Areni-1 winery), which to this day is still known of its wine production and endemic grapes. History Areni-1 cave entrance Urartian wine pottery Since ancient days Armenia has been famous for its wine-making traditions which are still kept in practice to this day. The ancient winery found in the Areni cave dates back to 6100 BC (see Areni-1 winery), and is the oldest one in the world found to this date, with the grape seeds found shown by genetic analyses to be those of the already domesticated Vitis vinifera. The written recorded history of Armenian wine can trace its roots back to 401–400 BC, when the Greek armies led by Xenophon passed through Armenian lands and were reportedly treated with wine and beer. These beverages were prepared and stored in \\"karases\\" (clay pots). Archaeological excavations carried out by academic Pyatrovski in the 19th and 20th centuries have confirmed that in the 9th century BC, what is modern-day Yerevan was a wine-making centre. Archaeologists have also found wine storehouses with 480 karases in the Teishebaini fortress located in Yerevan. Each karas can reportedly hold up to 37,000 daL of wine. Excavation works in both the Karmir Blur and Erebuni sites uncovered a total of 10 wine storehouses holding 200 karases. These excavations proved Armenia's ancient wine-making culture. As part of the Soviet Union, wine production increased nine times between 1940 and 1985, while brandy production increased seventeen times, and from 1960 to 1986, the production of sparkling wines increased 10 times. In the 1980s Armenia annually processed an average of about 210 thousand tons of grapes from which it received 14–15 million decalitres of wine. Two million were used in producing brandy; the remaining part was used for wine making. During the 1980s Armenia provided 25% of brandy made in the entire Soviet Union. Three quarters of released production was exported mainly to Russia. Many people today still utilise the same methods used three millenniums ago, processing grapes and receive wine in special premises. Nowadays most factories in Armenia use oak barrels to store wine, however many villages and smaller producers still use the traditional karases. Karases are traditionally made out of Armenian oak, thus giving the karases a pinkish color and giving wines a natural taste of vanilla, chocolate and dried fruits. Wines from local Armenian grades of grapes adjoining to the surface of the barrels from the Armenian oak, give rise to unique a bouquet. This unique combination is very difficult to the point of being almost impossible to reproduce in any other country of the world. Armenian mosaic and inscription at Jerusalem The fertile valleys of the South Caucasus, which Armenia finds itself in, are believed by many archaeologists to be the source of the world's first cultivated grapevines and neolithic wine production, over 6000 years ago. Although not a large player in the world of wine today, Armenian wine played an important role in the history of wine, and it has been suggested that the domestication of the Eurasian grape first occurred in the mountainous regions of Armenia before moving to the south.Randolph E. Schmid, \\"Researchers Find Oldest Known Winery In Cave In Armenian Mountains\\", The Associated Press, January 10, 2011. During all this time they never stopped making wine. They were one of the main wine producers in the Soviet Union and have since started exporting their wine worldwide. Armenian wine spread to Africa. During the Armenian genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, some Armenians fled to Ethiopia, where they cultivated vineyards. Many Armenian reds are very sweet and rich, and Ethiopian wine has a similar quality. During periods of Islamic rule, Armenians were the suppliers of alcoholic beverages, such as wine, to the Muslims, who were not allowed to distill alcohol. Gandzak wine In 2011 archaeologists in Armenia announced the discovery of the world's oldest-known wine production facility. Located in the Areni cave complex, it consists of a shallow basin used to press grapes, a vat for storage, and fermentation jars. They also found grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, and dozens of dried vines. The seeds were from Vitis vinifera, a grape still used to make wine. The cave remains date to about 4000 BC – 900 years before the earliest comparable wine remains, found in Egyptian tombs. Archaeologist Gregory Areshian of UCLA says, \\"The site gives us a new insight into the earliest phase of horticulture—how they grew the first orchards and vineyards.\\" Gregory Areshian, co-director of the excavation and assistant director of the University of California Los Angeles's Cotsen Institute of Archaeology stated that \\"It's the oldest proven case of documented and dedicated wine production, stretching back the horizons of this important development by thousands of years,\\" Wine-making in Armenia=Wine production during the Soviet era During the Soviet Union, specifically during 1930 and 1970, winemaking studies were developed specifically for the sherry type. The production of sherry type wines had a significant role in the development of viticultural technologies of the Soviet Union. In the regions of the former USSR, sherry type wines were produced in Crimea, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Krasnodar, Rostov, and Armenia.Soviet sherries Many scientific sources indicate that during the Soviet Union the production of sherry type wines was mainly focused in Armenia.USSR Wine Production The production of sherry wine in Armenia was established by N.N. Prostoserdov and R.L. Afrikyan, two prominent Soviet oenologists. In 1931 Prostoserdov and Afrikyan discovered that non-hermetic karases (Armenian clay amphorae) produce pellicles. The reason for the formation of pellicles on the surface of the wine was found to be the Sacch.cheresiensis armeniensis yeast similar to those found in Spanish wines. This discovery thus proved that sherry yeast can be found not only in Spanish but also in wines of other countries. Armenian sherry type wines are made from the Voskehat (Kharji) and Chilar ingenious grape varieties. Armenian sherry was considered a high quality wine and was second in volume of production after Armenian brandy production. Ashtarak was the first sherry type wine produced in Soviet Armenia. It was produced by the Ashtarak Wine Factory, subdivisions of which were situated in Oshakan and village Voskevaz. Current status A large number wineries and vineyards are found throughout the provinces of Armenia. Here is a list of wineries/distilleries/producers of alcoholic drinks, classified by the provinces of Armenia: =Aragatsotn Province= ArmAs Winery The wine produced in Aragatsotn is mainly from the vineyards located to the south of the Aragats and Arteni mountains.

G. Jannaway (London 1859–1935) was an English Christadelphian writer on Jewish settlement in Palestine, and notable for his role in the conscientious objector tribunals of World War I. His reaction to controversy was to separate from others in the name of purity, and he was instrumental in the formation of minority factions, such as the Berean Christadelphians. However, this reasoning eventually caused him to separate even from his own brother, A.T. Jannaway.

JANNAWAY. \\"In 1874, a paragraph appeared in one of the London daily papers, satirically referring to Christadelphians as \\"Christian Dolphins.\\" Our late brother [A.T. Jannaway], with characteristic zeal, inserted an advertisement in the paper asking for information concerning the Christadelphians, to which the brethren then meeting at Islington (North London) replied; the result was the acceptance of the Truth by brother Jannaway and his brother, followed at intervals by all the remaining members of his family.\\"1901 Census: \\"A.T.

His debates were not just on doctrinal subjects (e.g. 1894), but also, more unusually for Christadelphians, on the subject of Christian Socialism (1908, 1909). * 1894 public debate with Rev.

Jewish Settlement in Palestine Christadelphians had taken an active interest in not just predicting, but actually assisting in a Jewish return to Palestine since 1891 when Roberts called on the Christadelphian community to support Laurence Oliphant's appeal for funds for the Rosh Pinna settlement at Al-Ja'una in Galilee. But even among Christadelphians F.G. Jannaway expressed exceptionally strong sympathy for the return of the Jews to Palestine. His two books which deal with this Palestine and the Jews (1914) and Palestine and the Powers (2nd Ed. 1918) were summarized and referenced in an overtly Zionist appeal Palestine and the world (1907, 1922): \\"F.G.

Jannaway visited Palestine six times, in 1901, 1902, 1912, 1914, 1922 and 1925.

The Birmingham \\"Temperance Hall\\" Ecclesia initially took the view that work as \\"non- combatants\\", for example stretcher bearers, was acceptable, but Jannaway strongly urged that this was still participating in the war.Botten John The captive conscience: an historical perspective of the Christadelphian Position Christadelphian Military Service Committee 2002 - 134 pages In 1914 Jannaway undertook the compilation of a register of all brethren likely to be affected by the draft, with the objective to keep the Christadelphian body entirely outside the Army. In doing so he succeeded in obtaining signatures from 154 Christadelphian \\"ecclesias\\" across Britain, with the notable exception of Temperance Hall, which had already drafted, its own petition of 1,000 members, leaving open the issue of non-combatants, but hesitated to submit it to Parliament. On 11 February 1915 Arnold Stephenson Rowntree, the Quaker Liberal M.P. for York presented Jannaway's petition to Parliament, which was accepted and made Birmingham's petition irrelevant.Bryan R. Wilson Sects and society: a sociological study of the Elim Tabernacle, Christian Science and Christadelphian churches 1961 p257 However the Birmingham brethren continued to have more flexible views than South London on the subject, leading to problems which were to extend beyond the war itself. The Christadelphian Divisions 1885–1923 In 1885, when F.G. Jannaway was 25, his older brother A.T. Jannaway, then 31, became involved in the first of a series of \\"controversies\\" which would mark, and hamper, the development of the Christadelphian movement in London. A.T. Jannaway strongly supported the position of Robert Roberts.AT Jannaway, The Inspiration Division 1884-1821 1921 In 1894–98 A.T and F.G. were directly involved in reaction to a second controversy which had originated in London, nominally over \\"resurrectional responsibility\\". Although the immediate problem had been resolved by the original source of the teaching, J.J. Andrew, having withdrawn himself in 1901, the Jannaway brothers were instrumental in persuading the influential Birmingham Central Ecclesia, who then met at Temperance Hall, and the then editor of The Christadelphian magazine, C.C. Walker, to take a stricter line over all those who failed to adopt the 1898 \\"Amendment\\" to their statements of faith, leading to the division of ecclesias in North America, and separation from the Unamended Christadelphians, led by Thomas Williams of Chicago.Charles H. Lippy The Christadelphians in North America 1989 p78 Then in 1923 F.G. Jannaway created further division when he broke with Walker, his former travelling companion in Palestine, when Birmingham failed to discipline two of their \\"Arranging Brethren\\" who had abstained on a vote to \\"disfellowship\\" two members serving as special constables.The Sociology of Religion: Sectarian religion 1966 p297 This new split led to the formation of the Berean Christadelphians with a majority of Christadelphians in London lining up behind the Jannaway brothers. This coincided with the Jannaway brothers' support for William Smallwood in North America who led the remaining Amended Christadelphians to separate for what would be a period of twenty-nine years (1923–1952). The 1923 division proved to be the last major division within the Christadelphian movement, and after the departure of Clapham the mood in the main \\"Central\\" grouping turned towards efforts for reunions, effected 1952–1957. However, in the Clapham group the doctrine of fellowship held by the Jannaway brothers, effectively guilt by association, led to further splintering.George Booker, Biblical Fellowship 1983 In 1926, when F.G. was 62, and his brother A.T. was 68, the brothers themselves divided over the question of the permissibility of divorce in cases of adultery. A.T., who took the more lenient view and had advanced that it was allowable, had to leave Clapham, and formed the Family Journal fellowship.Article: The Remnant of Christ's Ecclesia Magazine.

Oud (1927) Willem Hendrik Gispen (7 December 1890, in Amsterdam - 10 May 1981, in The Hague) was a Dutch industrial designer, best known for his Giso lamps and serially produced functionalist steel-tube furniture. He studied design at the Academy for Visual Arts and Technical Science in Rotterdam (Academie van Beeldende Kunsten en Technische Wetenschappen) at the architecture department. He started in 1913, but left the Academy in 1915 partly due to the outbreak of the First World War. In April 1918 he married Anna C.J. Gisolf in Rotterdam. In 1916 he purchased a small smithy, which he would develop and extend to the well-known Gispen’s Factory for Metalwork (Gispen’s fabriek voor metaalbewerking n.v.). The success of the company was to a great extent based upon the qualities of Willem Hendrik Gispen as an industrial designer, designing many artistically en technically qualitative lamps and furniture. Many of these serial produced designs, like armchair no. 412, still belong to the highlights of Dutch design. With his Giso lamp-designs from the 1920s and 1930s he was a part of the international avant-garde interested in light innovations. The same can be said of his steel-tube chairs and furniture, with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Mart Stam and Gerrit Rietveld among his inspirations. In 1949 W.H. Gispen left the firm, after which he worked for other furniture manufactories like Kembo. In 1981 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam organized the first exposition about W.H. Gispen, dedicated to his lamp-designs from the years 1916-1949. It was the same year W.H. Gispen died on the 10th of May.B. van der Laan en A. Koch (red.), Collectie Gispen. Meubels, lampen en archivalia in het NAi 1916-1980, NAi uitgevers Rotterdam (1996), pp. 154-155.  W.H. Gispen and the firm Willem Hendrik Gispen grew up in Amsterdam and Utrecht. He was educated to be a primary school teacher and also acquired a teaching certificate in French. He decided in 1913 to study design at the Academy for Visual Arts and Technical Science in Rotterdam. At the academy he became acquainted with a number of people who would cooperate with him at a later date, like architect L.C. van der Vlugt and designer Ch. Hoffmann. After dropping the course in 1915, he worked voluntarily for one of his previous teachers. In 1916 he purchased a small smithy at the Coolschestraat in Rotterdam, where he started his own workshop in September 1916. In the early years, Gispen’s designs were much in line with the expressionism of the Amsterdamse School and the Art Nouveau. Besides ornamental wrought-iron work, Gispen produced things like firesides, lamps, wooden furniture and clocks. Gispen also designed his own advertisements. In 1919 the workshop moved to the Voorhaven in Rotterdam Delfshaven. In the same year the new company name was introduced: Gispen’s fabriek voor metaalbewerking. In 1920 he co-founded architects’ circle Opbouw, whose discussions founded the base of Dutch functionalism. In the following years Gispen successfully experimented with quantity production of small cast brass lamps and bronze window and door profiles. From 1923 onwards Gispen comes into (in)direct contact with multiple inspirational sources: the ideas of the Bauhaus through architect J.J.P. Oud, the style of H. Muthesius of the Deutsche Werkbund and the principles of the artists of De Stijl. These inspirations became reality in several large commissions. In 1925, at the international exhibition of Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris, not only did Gispen receive a medal for his ornamental iron-work, he also became acquainted with Le Corbusier, Constructivism and other French modernists.J.M. Woodham, Twentieth-Century Design, Oxford University Press Oxford (1997). In 1926 Gispen put his Giso lamps on the market, which were designed on the basis of the demands of Scientific Lighting, aesthetics and economics. He placed himself in the designers’ vanguard by participating in the exhibition die Wohnung in Stuttgart, organized by the Deutsche Werkbund in 1927. Both in Oud’s dwelling-row in the Weissenhofsiedlung and in the exhibition-hall in Stuttgart there hung Giso lamps. Gispen became inspired by objects such as the cantilever chairs of Mart Stam and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In November 1927, Gispen presented his first tubular steel chair at De Rotterdamsche Kring. In 1928 the factory took the piano lamp designed for H.H. Kamerlingh Onnes by Gispen and Oud in serial production as the Giso 404, and achieved widespread recognition with it. Gispen opened showrooms in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Brussels and later in London, Paris and other cities abroad. Gispen’s wide reputation was also a result of active marketing. Leading representatives of the “New” Photography and Typography of the 1920s, such as Jan Kamman and Paul Schuitema, designed the product catalogs and other advertising material. Despite their success, the firm was threatened with bankruptcy as a consequence of the Wall Street Krach. The naval architect W. van Osselen was appointed as co-director during a reorganisation. Van Osselen steered the firm in producing steel office furniture (starting with the Stalachrome-series), while W.H. Gispen himself remained focused on the home, balancing between functionalism and a ‘weakened’, ‘cosy’ version of it. In the ‘30s, Thonet- Nederland summoned Gispen to court on account of breach of authorship of Mart Stam on the cantilever chair. According to the judge, because no patent was applied for, the ‘Stam’-chair enjoyed no legal protection. Gispen now tried to fight the patent granted to Mies van der Rohe on his well-known cantilever chair. The trial dragged itself on, which only stopped when Mies’s patent ran out. During the Second World War metalwork was prohibited outside the war industry, so the factory began producing parts for the aircraft-industry. Gispen himself was put in prison in Scheveningen because he had co-signed a letter of protest against the Kulturkammer. After the war, Gispen found himself on more artistic grounds with painting and tensions between him and co-director Van Osselen grew. In 1949 W.H. Gispen resigned. He remained active in the design related field, with several publications in the magazine Goed Wonen, lecturing at the Royal Academy in The Hague, co-founding the Kembo- factory in 1953 and so on. He also became more interested in designing architecture and at the age of seventy-nine he took up etching-lessons at the Royal Academy. He died on May 10, 1981.A. Koch, Industrieel ontwerper W.H. Gispen. Een modern eclecticus (1890-1981), Uitgeverij De Hef Rotterdam (1998). Gispen’s fabriek voor metaalbewerking still exists as Gispen International BV, producing mostly office furniture and high-end design furniture for the home, including some of the classics of W.H.

The Ograje hay field lies north of the village. The Graben area to the west contains many springs, and above this is Selan Crag () and the Matejec Clearing () with tilled fields and hay fields. To the south are the Zglavnice fields, and to the southeast meadows and terraced fields. To the east are hay fields in an area known as Lošca, with a road leading to Dednik and a trail through the woods offering a shortcut to Rob. The area also has a deep karst shaft surrounded by many depressions. The soil is sandy loam. Near the road there is an intermittent spring with a walled outlet. The farms in Rupe are small and there is little agricultural production because of the harsh climate; most of the villagers were tenant farmers in the past. The houses have pear and apple orchards. Economic activity was based on the production of wooden ware, especially wooden spoons, crates for fruit, and toothpicks. There was also some charcoal production, and mushrooms and blueberries were gathered and sold, especially in the Lošca area. Name The name Rupe is a plural form of the Slovene common noun rupa 'cave, sinkhole, depression', therefore referring to a local geographical feature. History During the Italian offensive in the summer of 1942, Italian forces burned some of the houses in the village. On 26 July 1942 one of the villagers was shot at Veliki Vrh.

Bisitun Cave is one of five caves situated at the base of The Rock of Bisitun, a 1300m high cliff within the Chamchamal Plain. It was first excavated in 1949 by Carlton Coon, and is notable for the discovery of Mousterian stone tools of the Middle Paleolithic, as well as the remains of 109 identifiable species of Pleistocene mammals, and hominid remains. Dibble described the stone tools as having strong Levallois components. All artefacts are apparently from the same period. It has not been possible to discern a geological age of the Middle Paleolithic levels at Bisitun Cave. However, the relative abundance of Cervus in the deposits suggests a nearby woodland, and such vegetation is indicative of a warmer later Pleistocene phase. In Southwestern Asia in general, the Middle Paleolithic falls between the Later Middle Pleistocene (Marine Isotope Stage 6/7) and the middle of the Last Glacial (mid Marine Isotope Stage-3). Therefore the age of Bisitun Cave is likely to fall within this period also.  Hominin remains  Coon described two hominid remains from the site, a maxilliary upper incisor and a radius shaft fragment, both from a Layer designated F+. These remains were listed by never described fully for the palaeontological community. When they were finally reexamined four decades later, and the incisor was found to be bovid in origin, rather than hominin. The radius fragment was found to show Neanderthal affinities, as it is mediolaterally expanded at the interosseus crest. Metrically, it is outside the range of variation of early anatomically modern humans, but in the range of Neanderthals and early Upper Paleolithic humans. The radius fragment also showed signs of scavenging carnivores or rodents, such as jackal and fox, the remains of which were also found at the site.

She also sang Tatiana (Eugene Onegin), Venus (Tannhäuser), Abigaille (Nabucco), Eboli (Don Carlos) Santuzza (Cavalleria rusticana) and many other roles. Her operatic career in Australia was relatively brief, lasting only from 1965 until 1983, with a final recital at the Sydney Opera House in 1983.Article 18 January 1983, The Sydney Morning Herald Background Today, Beaton's reputation rests largely on her appearances as Turandot (recorded in live performance and now on compact disc), and her performance as Cathy on the complete recording of Bernard Herrmann's only full-length opera Wuthering Heights.Unicorn – Kanchana, 1972\\"Dream role launched diva Morag Beaton on world stage\\", The Australian (1 April 2010)\\"Morag Beaton: operatic soprano\\", obituary in The Times Beaton's operatic career is also notable because she is the only singer in history successfully to have alternated the exacting soprano role of Turandot with the contralto role of Maddalena (Rigoletto) in one season, and, in later seasons, sung the contralto role of Ulrica (A Masked Ball) followed by more Turandots and another difficult soprano role – Abigaille in Nabucco. After Beaton's final recital at the Sydney Opera House in 1983, she occasionally sang for special events such as the 80th birthday gala for Sylvia Fisher, and mentored many aspiring singers. The warm reception for Beaton at the Sydney Opera House in 1996, when she attended the gala to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Australian Opera Company, was as much an acknowledgement of her past performances as it was a reminder of how much audiences had missed her on stage in the intervening years.\\"Interview\\", Lady Viola Tate interview 1996, Peter Wylllie Johnston Opera Archive In 2006, at a gala for one hundred guests in honour of Beaton's own 80th birthday, she sang two Scottish songs, accompanied by Geoffrey Tozer. \\"Still rich and glorious\\" declared the guest of honour, the renowned Australian opera star Lauris Elms, when she heard Beaton's singing on that occasion.On Stage, January 2007 Early life Beaton was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 2 July 1926. As a girl, Beaton studied music with her mother, Margaret. Feeling the need to contribute to the war effort, Beaton enlisted in the army in 1945 and devoted the next three years of her life to military service, singing as much as she could. Whenever the opportunity arose, Beaton would sing for the troops while fulfilling a variety of duties on different postings.\\"Interview with Morag Beaton\\", 5 January 2007, PWJ Archive\\"Morag Beaton\\" in From the Melburnian, Ellikon Publishing, 2010 Training In Edinburgh after World War II, Beaton studied singing initially with a renowned teacher, Joyce Fleming. At Fleming's suggestion, Beaton also began to attend the Collegium Musicum sessions of Dr Hans Gál which were a \\"unique feature of Edinburgh's musical life\\". Gál became an important influence in Beaton's development. He was a brilliant musician, a composer, pianist and scholar of great distinction. In March 1938, like other Jewish refugee families anxious to escape Hitler and the Nazis, Gál fled to England with his wife Hanna and their two sons. Later Gál was offered a position as lecturer in Music at the University of Edinburgh. In 1948, just as Beaton's prospects were moving in a positive direction, her life changed. Quite suddenly, in April, her mother died at the age of fifty. From then, until 1962, with the help of her aunt Barbara McGillivray, Beaton served a very long apprenticeship in singing in London. During the late 1950s she won a series of scholarships and prizes that enabled her, at last, to study singing full-time. Career In 1962, she made her debut in Berlin singing in Manuel de Falla's Atlantida. After singing in Germany and England, having been invited by Richard Bonynge, she toured Australia with the Sutherland-Williamson International Grand Opera Company in 1965. In 1966, she recorded the role of Cathy in the complete recording of Bernard Herrmann's Wuthering Heights, under the composer's direction. The same year, she made another recording, this time for Decca, with Joan Sutherland and another singer she also admired, the mezzo-soprano Margreta Elkins. Beaton sang with the Australian Opera from 1967 until early 1973, when she resigned and returned to London where she underwent surgery for a medical condition that had been troubling her for some time. She returned to Australia in 1976.\\"Ephemera Collection\\", National Library of AustraliaCargher, J., Opera and Ballet in Australia, Sydney, Cassell Aust., 1975Glennon, J. Understanding Music, Rigby, Adelaide, 1972Covell, R., Kippax, H., et al, Entertainment Arts in Australia, Paul Hamlyn, Sydney, 1968 On 16 January 1983, at the Sydney Opera House, Beaton returned to public performance with a recital of operatic arias including \\"Voi lo sapete\\" (Cavalleria rusticana) \\"Son pochi fiori\\" (L'amico Fritz), \\"O mio babbino caro\\" (Gianni Schicchi), \\"Io son l'umile\\" (Adriana Lecouvreur), \\"L'altre notte\\" (Mefistofele) and \\"Suicidio\\" (La Gioconda). With Elizabeth Allen she sang the duets \\"Songs My Mother Taught Me\\" (Dvořák) and the \\"Barcarolle\\" from Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. In three beautiful unaccompanied Hebridean songs with which she closed the recital, Beaton sang a homage to her late Aunt Barbara and in remembrance of her mother, Margaret. Dr Peter Wyllie Johnston, the Australian writer and composer, said that although Beaton lacked the support systems that are typically required for an operatic soprano, she made up for this by her strong character and resilience, and the focus of opera as her whole life. Turandot On 22 July 1967 Beaton sang her first Turandot to open the season at Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne. For five years between 1967 and 1971 Beaton sang Turandot many times in the Australian Opera's production, in most capital cities around the country. Listening to the live recording of one of those performances from Sydney, it is easy to understand why critics such as Felix Werder, James Glennon, Val Vallis, John Cargher and Kenneth Hince among many others were enormously impressed as Beaton's big, dramatic voice created vocal fireworks for the audience. She was vocally spectacular and visually resplendent in the heavily jewelled, padded costume and headdress designed for the production, with the enormous peacock train which was twenty-eight feet in length.Article, 24 July 1967, The Age Retirement In retirement in Sydney, Beaton was for many years a frequent guest of Opera Australia for performances at the Sydney Opera House.

Also known as \\"Albert the Poor\\", he inherited a land exhausted by the War of the Lüneburg Succession and Rudolf's long-time feud with the Archbishops of Magdeburg. With an empty state purse, he could scarcely afford any servants and led a very lonely life. In order to generate some income, he controversially imposed the right to charge stall taxes on markets in the town of Wittenberg in 1421. He got into such conflict with the citizens that it almost led to an armed clash, as this right had belonged to the town for generations. Finally the Hohenzollern elector Frederick of Brandenburg was called in to referee the dispute. He decided that the behaviour of the townsfolk to their lord was inappropriate, but supported their market rights on condition that an apology was tendered to Albert. In the third year of his reign the prince-elector died as a result of an accidental fire in a farmhouse on the Lochau Heath near Annaburg, where he was overnighting with his wife during a hunt. The fire came so close to them that he and his wife, dressed only in nightshirts had to be rescued through a window. Several of his servants died in the flames. The prince-elector was so shocked by this incident that he died a few days later in Wittenberg. He was buried in the Franciscan chapel there. With his death, the Ascanian rule in Saxe-Wittenberg came to an end.  Marriage  Albert married Euphemia of Oels, a daughter of the Piast duke Konrad III the Old on 14 January 1420. This marriage remained childless. In 1422 his widow was given Liebenwerda Castle as her wittum (Leibgedinge). In 1432, she secondly married Prince George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. She died in 1444.

Holland. In 1828 it was moved to IJlst, where it worked using wind power until 1920 and then by electric motor until 1950. The mill was bought by the town of IJlst in 1956 and restored in the mid-1960s. Further restoration in the mid-1970s returned the mill to full working order. De Rat is working for trade and is used as a training mill. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument (No. 39880). History De Rat was originally built in the seventeenth century in the Zaanstreek area of Noord Holland. It was known there as De Walrot () which was generally shortened to De Rot. Earlier it was thought the mill was in existence in 1683 but archival research, dendrochronology and an inscription in an old beam show the mill was actually built in 1711. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the mill fell out of use. At the same time, agriculture in Friesland was enjoying a boom, with many farms being built or having their old buildings replaced, creating a demand for sawn timber. In 1828, De Watterrot was bought at auction by William Ringnalda and Hessel Aten Vellinga. It was dismantled and shipped across the Zuiderzee to IJlst, where it was named De Rat. In 1852, the mill was in the joint ownership of Jan Janszoon Ringnalda and his wife Boukje Hessels; and Gerben Ringnalda and his wife Johanna Hartgerink. In 1854, the firm of H A Ringnalda & Co was formed. The Leeuwarden Courant reported that the mill was also a flour mill at this time. In 1859, the mill was purchased by Walle Melisz Oppendijk, who was related to the Ringnalda family via William Ringnalda's marriage to Richtje Oppendijk. This year saw the last mention of the mill also being a corn mill. By 1868, it had reverted to being solely a saw mill. Oppendijk now owned two sawmills. The other mill was burnt down in 1873 and rebuilt as a steam powered sawmill in 1874. In the second half of the 19th Century, De Rat was known for the high quality of timber produced. In 1918, a electric motor was installed. The cap, sails and stage were removed in 1920, and the mill was then worked entirely by electricity. The mill closed in 1950. On 5 December 1955, then-owners NV Houthandel asked for permission to demolish the mill. In April 1956 it was reported that the mill was not in bad condition. It was recommended that permission to demolish it be refused and that the town of IJlst take over the mill. On 17 September 1956, De Rat was purchased by the town for ƒ3,000. In 1966, the mill was restored by millwright J D Medendorp of Zuidlaren, Drenthe. The cap and brake wheel came from a drainage mill at Scheemderzwaag, Groningen, which had been demolished in 1959. The windshaft came from the Monnikenmolen, Sint Jansklooster, Overijssel. The mill was used to house a pottery and afterwards was used by a sailing school. Between 1976 and 1980, the mill was restored to working order. The work was done by millwrights Tacona BV of Stiens. The fully restored mill was officially reopened on 27 May 1978. Further restoration work was carried out in 1987 and 1996. In 2005, a new cap was made for the mill, replacing the one fitted in 1966 and replicating the original cap in appearance. The new cap was fitted on 19 April 2005. Ownership of the mill now lies with the Gemeente Wymbritseradiel, while the mill is operated by Stichting Houtzaagmolen De Rat (). The mill is used as a training mill by the Gild Fryske Mounders (). Description De Rat is what the Dutch describe as a \\"stellingmolen\\" . It is a three storey smock mill on a three-storey base. The stage is at second-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails, fitted with leading edges on the Fok System. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by Zallinda of Zwolle, Overijssel. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 59 cogs. This drives the wallower (29 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, a crown wheel with 43 cogs drives a crankshaft via a gear with 40 cogs. The crankshaft converts the circular motion into the reciprocal motion for three vertical frame saws. The mill can handle logs up to long.

A dialect of this language (Galilean Aramaic) was spoken by Jesus. The Son of God Text (4Q246), found in Qumran is written in this language as well. There were some differences in dialect between Judea and Galilee, and most surviving texts are in the Galilean dialect: Michael Sokoloff has published separate dictionaries of the two dialects. Overview After the defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, the center of Jewish learning in the land of Israel moved to Galilee. Following the Arab conquest of the country in the 7th century, Arabic gradually replaced this language. The most notable text in this dialect's corpus is the Jerusalem Talmud, which is still studied in Jewish religious schools and academically, although not as widely as the Babylonian Talmud, most of which is written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. There are some older texts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, notably the Megillat Taanit: the Babylonian Talmud contains occasional quotations from these. Many extant manuscripts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic have been corrupted over the years of their transmission by Eastern Aramaic-speaking scribes freely correcting \\"errors\\" they came across (these \\"errors\\" actually being genuine Jewish Palestinian Aramaic features). To date, all formal grammars of the dialect fall victim to these corruptions, and there is still no published syntax.

He was born in Ottoman Macedonia.Russian Electronic Library, Sergey Markov, КЛАДЫ «КОЛУМБОВ РОССИЙСКИХ» He was the first documented Greek explorer and merchant to arrive in Alaska.Long-Forgotten Greek Alaskan, Preservation of American Hellenic History  Biography  Delarov's career in Russian America dates to at least 1764, when he was in the Aleutian Islands on board the Petr i Pavel under Ivan Maksimovich Solov'ev. Delarov participated in Solov'ev's 1764 attacks on the Umnak-Unalaska Aleut alliance, which were carried out in revenge for the 1762 Fox Islands revolt--a coordinated Aleut attack on four Russian vessels and several shore parties, during which over 300 Russians were killed. While serving Panov brothers company, Delarov used the harbor on Unga Island as a base of operations, which for many years the harbor was known as Delarov Harbor or Greko-Delarovskoe, because Delarov was Greek. In 1781-1786 Delarov and two other captains made exploratory forays from Unga Island into Prince William Sound.European Exploration and Russian Settlement on the Lower Kenai Peninsula, National Park Service Over time Delarov gained a reputation as an excellent skipper. He became part owner of various fur-trading vessels. Grigory Shelikhov met Delarov in Irkutsk and persuaded him to become the chief manager of his establishment at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Delarov sailed to Kodiak in 1787 aboard the Three Saints, commanded by Gerasim Grigor'ievich Izmailov. From 1787 to 1791 he was Alexander Baranov's predecessor as chief manager of the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. He later became a partner in the Shelikhov enterprises and a major shareholders. In 1796 he directed the company's affairs in Irkutsk. In 1787 Delarov established an outpost at Karluk, on Kodiak Island facing the mainland across Shelikof Strait. Delarov also sent hunting parties into Resurrection Bay, where a post called Aleksandrovskaia was founded at modern-day Seldovia.Alaska: An American Colony, pp. 74-75 In 1788 the Spanish expedition of Gonzalo López de Haro and Esteban José Martínez sailed to Alaska to investigate Russian activity. A number of earlier Spanish voyages to Alaska had failed to find any Russians, but direct contact was made during the 1788 expedition. Haro found Shelikhov's settlement at Three Saints Bay and met with Delarov. Haro and Delarov conversed at length. Delarov informed Haro that there were seven Russian posts on the coast between Unalaska and Prince William Sound and that a Russian sloop traded south along the coast each year, as far as Nootka Sound. This latter piece of information was most likely a fabrication intended to intimidate the Spanish. That Delarov had exaggerated the strength of Russian America became clear to the Spaniards when they visited Unalaska. Delarov had told Haro that 120 Russians lived there, but the Spaniards discovered that Potap Zaikov was the only Russian there--the rest were Aleuts. When the Russian-American Company was founded in 1799 Delarov moved to Saint Petersburg and served on the company's board of directors until his death in 1806. Legacy A number of places are named after Delarov, including the Delarof Islands, Delarof Harbor, the U.S. Army transport ship Delarof, and the ghost town of Unga, Alaska was originally named Delarov.

Personal history Thambu was the third youngest of eight children from Malaysian Tamil heritage. He began his training in 1972, at the age of 11, training under his uncle, Thamby Rajah. Thamby Rajah is credited as the first Malaysian to grade to black belt in both Aikido and Judo.Malaysia Book of Records (2007) Internationally famous martial artists were frequent visitors to his uncle's school in Seremban, Malaysia. Among these were Donn F. Draeger, a prolific martial arts historian and researcher who wrote over 30 books on Eastern martial arts. Draeger was expert in Judo, Karate and Jōdō and was the first non-Japanese to be ranked Menkyo-Kaiden (teaching certificate) in the classical system of Shintō Musō-ryū Jodo. Other notable visitors included Junichiro Yagi Sensei (8th Dan), and former Yoshinkan Aikido Shihan (master title), as well as Kenji Shimizu Sensei, a past headmaster of Muso Shinto Ryu Jodo.History of the Shudokan, DVD Special Feature (2005), Aikido Shudokan, Australia In 1980, Thambu emigrated to Melbourne, Australia to undertake tertiary studies. After reportedly being unable to find an Aikido school with a training ethic to equal his experience in Malaysia, he began teaching Aikido. In 1983, Thambu first travelled to Japan to further his Aikido training. Whilst in Japan, he trained at the Yoshinkan Hombu dojo in Koganei. While living in Japan he received instruction from teachers including Gozo Shioda, Kyoichi Inoue, Takafumi Takeno, Tsutomu Chida, Hitoshi Nakano, and then assistants Jacques Payet and Tsuneo Ando. From this time onwards, Thambu focused on the modern Yoshinkan syllabus, including knowledge from his earlier training.History of Aikido in Australia Encyclopedia of Aikido, Stanley Pranin (online) Thambu was the first person to teach, and disseminate Yoshinkan Aikido in Australia. On his return to Australia from Japan in 1983, he established his first premises at 308 Saint Georges Road, Thornbury in Melbourne (Australia). This became the first of two permanent homes for his school. Thambu returned to Japan numerous times in the years from 1983–2000, generally training a few weeks at a time, testing and/or demonstrating at the annual All Japan Yoshinkan Aikido Demonstration. In 1993 Thambu became the last person to be graded by Yoshinkan founder Gozo Shioda, before his death in mid-1994. At only 32 years of age, he became the youngest non-Japanese to be awarded a 5th Dan in Yoshinkan Aikido. This record has since been passed onto Thambu's former student, Jon Marshall, who was awarded 5th Dan in 2006 at Yoshinkan Hombu.  Awards  In acknowledgment for his dedication to Aikido, Thambu was awarded his seventh dan by Shioda Yasuhisa, the former head of Yoshinkan Aikido in December 2007, and was promoted to the rank of \\"Shihan\\" in October 2008. On 8 July 2012, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Asia Pacific Open University for his lifelong commitment and contribution to the martial arts. Thambu was awarded his eighth dan by Kyoichi Inoue, former director of Yoshinkan Aikido in November 2015.  Current teaching  Since 2000, Thambu has taught widely outside of Australia, generally at the invitation of younger teachers in other countries. Thambu continues to teach from his school in Melbourne, Australia, frequently hosting students from overseas, of whom, many are aspiring teachers staying for extended periods, coming from countries such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Malaysia and Indonesia. Including annually at the Shudokan UK's Summer school with Robert Mustard and Ken Robson. Shudokan The words \\"Shudokan Aikido\\" have sometimes been misconstrued as a separate style to Yoshinkan Aikido. Thamby Rajah (Thambu's uncle and original teacher) has always taught a natural derivative of the techniques he learned at Yoshinkan Hombu Dojo. Rajah's technique is also influenced by extensive experience in Judo at the Kodokan, and his earlier Jujitsu training under Walter De Silva in Malaysia during the post war years.

The average altitude of the town is about . The population of the town was 2934 Turksat as of 2012.  Administration  Gülek is a part of Tarsus district, itself a part of Mersin province. Gülek was a village in the first half of the 20th century. It became the seat of its township in 1954.  History  Macedonian emperor Alexander the Great (reigned 336–323 BC) crossed Taurus mountains through the Cilician Gates during his campaign against Darius III (reigned 336–330 BC) of the Achaemenid Empire. Gülek citizens believe that the ancient inscriptions in the pass were erected by Alexander. But, actually, these inscriptions were erected much later by the Roman Emperor Caracalla (reigned 211–217) during his campaign against the Parthian Empire. Page of Çekul foundation The town (then known as Hins Bwls) was established during the Byzantine era. In 652 Ummayad armies annexed Gülek and surrounding territory. From 861, Gülek fell under many states, including the Byzantine Empire, the Sultanate of Rum, Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, and the Ramadanids. In 1517, sultan Selim I (reigned 1512–1520) of the Ottoman Empire annexed Gülek. In 1832, Gülek was briefly occupied by the forces of the rebellious Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt but was returned to Ottoman control after the convention of Kütahya. After the First World War, French forces tried to occupy Gülek,See Sykes–Picot Agreement but after the local militia forces from Gülek ambushed the French forces on 27 May 1920 at the pass of Karboğazı, the French army gave up this project. During the Turkish Republic era the name of the settlement was Panzinçukuru and Yaylaçukuru up to 1954. In 1954 the settlement was declared a seat of township and renamed as Gülek. Above the Cilician Gates and a few kilometers from the village is Gülek Kalesi (Armenian: Kuklak; Arab: Kawlāk), a large fortification of considerable antiquity which retains evidence of Byzantine and Arab periods of occupation, but is primarily a construction of the 12th and 13th centuries attached to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Its circuit walls and towers at the south and west cover a distance of over 450 meters. An extensive photographic survey and plan of Gülek Castle was made between 1973 and 1979.

He had married Annie Sheffield. He and his wife refused to use rickshaws because they thought it was degrading for the men. Instead, they walked and had shelters built for the rickshaw men so that they had a place to sleep and to get out of the rain. Annie was appointed a CBE in 1948 for welfare work.

He was the last British Governor of Sind and after the partition of India and Pakistan in August 1947, he continued to serve as Governor of the West Punjab. Education and early career=Education Robert Francis Mudie attended Seafield House in Broughty Ferry. George Cunningham and Rob Lockhart attended the same school and were to meet again in India. From Seafield house, he went on a scholarship to Fettes College, Edinburgh, and later on a mathematical scholarship to King's College, Cambridge. In 1911 he graduated as a wrangler. Early career After graduation Robert Francis Mudie spent a term as assistant master at Clifton College before commencing as assistant master at Eton College. After only four terms, he came to the conclusion that he had no interest in school mastering and after a six-month break he started studying for entrance examinations to join the Indian Civil Service (ICS). First World War ICS examinations started on 2 August 1914, two days before the war broke out. Robert Francis Mudie had previously been a sergeant in the Officer Training Corps at Cambridge, and immediately applied for a commission. He was gazetted on 26 August to the 6th (City of London) battalion, The London Regiment (Rifles), but was given permission to join two weeks later allowing him to complete the ICS entrance examinations.April 1915 Army List A number of successful ICS candidates had joined the army before the examination results came out, and the War Office decided that successful candidates should be sent to India as soldiers and could join the service provided that within a year they had passed health, riding and language examinations. Robert Francis Mudie, one of the successful candidates, was tasked with becoming proficient in Bengali. Mudie was transferred first to the Royal Welch Fusiliers, then to a territorial division before joining the 2/4th battalion Somerset Light Infantry which was sent to India. The battalion sailed on the troop ship Saturnia, arriving in Bombay in the first week of January 1915. From Bombay the battalion was posted to Bangalore, where Mudie's company was detached to Malappuram and Mudie was sent with a platoon to Calicut, under the command of Raibert McDougall. In India the first British official he met was Charles Innes who was at the time district collector in Calicut and later became Governor of Burma. Since he needed to learn Bengali, after two months he was reassigned to the 1/10th battalion Middlesex regiment in Calcutta. He did not fit in with the regiment and requested a transfer, so four months later he was assigned to 10th Gurkha Rifles in Maymao. Later he was reassigned to the 16th Rajputs (The Lucknow Regiment) in Calcutta. After a temporary assignment to the 89th Punjabis he returned to Calcutta to join the 127th Baluchis. In 1917 he was sent for musketry training at Satara where he remained on the musketry staff until the end of the war. By this point he had been commissioned into the Indian Army Reserve of Officers and held the rank of Captain January 1919 Indian Army List, page 501a Indian Civil Service=Acceptance into the Indian Civil Service To enter the ICS, Robert Francis Mudie had been required to pass a medical, learn Bengali and to ride a horse. At Saturna where there was no horse, he passed the equestrian proficiency test by answering the question \\"Would you jump that cactus hedge?\\" with the answer \\"no\\". However he failed a medical examination, so he wrote to John Kerr, the Chief Secretary of Bengal, saying \\"...all I had to do in the ICS is to live in the country, so I would like to know what I am to die of and how soon, and could I now go to the War.\\" John Kerr sent for him and after seeing that he was not immediately going to die, ordered a medical re-examination which he passed. Mudie had also failed to master Bengali, instead passing the proficiency test in Urdu, the preferred language for the army. Mudie's request for a transfer from Bengal to United Provinces was initially turned down as impossible. But Rudman, Additional Under-Secretary in the Home Department of the Government of India and a fellow student from King's college, took him to meet Sir Tennant Sloan, Under Secretary in the Home Department, who in turn took him to meet the Deputy Secretary, Mackworth Young. Two weeks later Mudie was transferred to United Provinces where he started his ICS career. District work Between 1919 and 1930 he served in various positions gaining a reputation for \\"vigorous personality and good sense\\". *Jhansi - Assistant Magistrate *Benares - Joint Magistrate *Dehra Dun - Income Tax Officer *Agra - Assistant District Magistrate and Collector *Sultanpur - Deputy Commissioner *Pratapgarh - Settlement Officer *Farrukhabad - Collector, 1926 *Agra - Settlement Officer, 1926–1929 Indian Round Table Conference in London 1930-1931 While on leave, Mudie was appointed as one of the secretaries to the first Indian Round Table Conference held in London.

Supporter of Pakistan movement The following episode is related by Naseer Ahmad Faruqui, an ICS officer, who was at one time secretary to Sir Francis Mudie as well as a close friend, and later rose in Pakistan to Cabinet Secretary (in effect, Head of the Civil Service of Pakistan) under President Ayub Khan. Mr Faruqui writes: :\\"In 1946 I was Deputy Commissioner of Karachi. The Governor of the Sindh was Sir Francis Mudie, one of the few British who, being fully aware of the machinations of the Hindus, was a great sympathiser of the Muslims and supporter of the Pakistan cause. As I had previously served as his secretary, he used to tell me his inner feelings, especially as he found me to agree with his views. Even after I became Deputy Commissioner of Karachi he used to have discussions with me in favour of the creation of Pakistan. His support of the Muslims being no secret, the Hindu press used to refer to his name sarcastically, from his initials F.M., as “Fateh Muhammad”, and send telegrams against him to the Viceroy Lord Wavell and the Secretary of State for India Lord Pethick-Lawrence. But Sir Francis Mudie, instead of being overawed or intimidated, was undeterred and used to fight these complaints. :A British cabinet mission came to India in 1946, headed by Lord Pethick-Lawrence, to discuss the question of Indian independence, and on their way from London to New Delhi they stayed in Karachi for one night as guests of the Governor of the Sindh. The following morning it was my official duty, as District Magistrate, to be present at Karachi airport for their departure. After they left, the Governor beckoned me to accompany him in his car. As soon as the car moved off, he said to me: “Faruqui, they are not going to give us Pakistan”. This appeared to be the final, irrevocable decision of the British government....\\" :(See: http://www.ahmadiyya.org/books/m-kabir/mjk4-4.htm under heading 'Prediction of creation of Pakistan').

Later career After resigning in 1949 from position of Governor of West Punjab, he returned to Britain and continued to be active in international affairs.

Accident At 9:03 local time (7:03 UTC), a two passenger coach Stadler GTW train, operated by STA Südtiroler, derailed in Kastelbell-Tschars after running into a landslide.The Guardian : 12 April 2010 : Passengers Killed as Italian Landslide Derails Train Retrieved 13 April 2010 Nine people died when the train derailed, and 28 others were injured, seven seriously. The landslide which reportedly derailed the train is believed to have been caused by a burst irrigation pipe, or by a valve inadvertently left open. The train was on a regional service, travelling between Mals and Merano, on the Vinschgau line, which reopened in 2005. Italy's ANSA news agency said one of the train's three carriages was filled with mud from the landslide, and rescuers were digging frantically with shovels and pickaxes to try to reach the victims. A reporter for Sky Italia television said smoke was rising from the wreckage and helicopters were flying overhead. The railway is equipped with advanced sensors to stop trains in case of landslides, but they couldn't operate because the mud fell at the moment that the train was passing.Corriere della Sera, 13 April 2010, p.2 An investigation is underway into why the irrigation pipe burst. The local aqueduct consortium denies the possibility that the landslide was caused by the pipe, as it is a small pipe (65 mm diameter), and was working perfectly until about 8:00 CEST.

Geography The ecoregion lies in northeastern Queensland and western Northern Territory, south of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It includes much of Queensland's Gulf Country, and a portion of the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory. The ecoregion includes the Wellesley Islands and Pellew Islands in the gulf. The Roper, Limmen Bight, McArthur, Calvert, Nicholson, Leichhardt, Flinders, Norman, Gilbert, Staaten, and Mitchell rivers drain into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Most have freshwater and brackish wetlands in near the gulf. It is bounded on the northeast by the Cape York Peninsula tropical savanna, on the east by the Einasleigh Uplands savanna, on the south by the Mitchell Grass Downs, on the west by the Victoria Plains tropical savanna and Kimberley tropical savanna, and on the northwest by the Arnhem Land tropical savanna. IBRA regions The ecoregion includes three IBRA regions – Gulf Coastal, Gulf Fall and Uplands, and Gulf Plains. Climate The ecoregion has a tropical savanna climate. Rainfall is strongly seasonal. The monsoon winds bring rainfall during the Southern Hemisphere summer from November to March, followed by a dry season during the rest of the year. Average annual rainfall generally decreases from north to south. It is highest (1000 mm to 1200 mm) in the northwestern portion of the ecoregion in the Northern Territory, and over 900 mm in the northeastern part of the ecoregion east of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Rainfall is approximately 750 mm along the southern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and decreases to less than 500 mm further south. Temperatures are generally warm year-round, with a wider range between maximium and minimum monthly temperatures as one moves further from the coast.Neldner, Victor & Fox, Ian & Wilson, Garry & Bannink, Peter. (2001). The Vegetation of the Australian Tropical Savannas. Flora The vegetation of the ecoregion includes grasslands, savanna, open woodlands, and small patches of forest. The Gulf Coastal region, which encompasses the coastal plains along the western Gulf of Carpentaria in Northern Territory, is covered mostly in woodlands of Darwin stringybark (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) with an understory of grasses, chiefly curly spinifex (Triodia pungens). The Gulf Fall and Uplands, which lies west and south of the gulf coastal plain, is mostly woodland and savanna of Darwin box (Eucalyptus tectifica) and long-fruited bloodwood (Corymbia polycarpa). curly spinfex is the most common grass, with areas of tall Sorghum grasses, like those typical of Arnhem Land's savannas, in more humid areas of the uplands. The Gulf Plains, which lie south and southeast of the Gulf, are mostly open grasslands of bluegrass (Dichanthium spp.). In the southwestern Gulf Plains, along the northern edge of the Mount Isa Inlier, there is a narrow belt of Eucalyptus and Melaleuca woodlands, with a grassy understory dominated by Chrysopogon fallax. In the southeastern Gulf Plains close to the Einasleigh Uplands, there are Eucalyptus woodlands, and low woodlands of Melaleuca with the grasses Aristida spp. and Chrysopogon fallax. On the higher plateau remnants in the southeast, there are woodlands of narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and bloodwood (Corymbia spp.), interspersed with stands of lancewood (Acacia shirleyi). The ecoregion's rivers form freshwater and saltwater wetlands as they approach the gulf. There are extensive mangroves along the coast. Fauna The Carpentarian rock rat (Zyzomys palatalis) is endemic to the ecoregion, and found only in patches of ravine forest and vine thickets on sandstone outcrops in Wollogorang Station. The station is located close to the gulf in the Northern Territory near the border with Queensland.Bowman, D. M. J. S., G. K. Brown, M. F. Braby, J. R. Brown, L. G. Cook, M. D. Crisp, F. Ford, S.

They are concentrated in the Xinjiang autonomous region of Northwest China. Students In December 2004, Pakistan concluded an agreement with the China Scholarship Council to send official scholarship students to China; the first batch of 300 were scheduled to enroll at 15 different universities in China in June 2005, with later batches of 500 each over the following five years. Their classes will use English as the medium of instruction, while they will study Chinese on the side as a foreign language. The total number of Pakistani students across China was estimated at 1,000 . Xinjiang is one of the major destinations for Pakistanis coming to China. , about 500 Pakistani international students were enrolled at universities in Xinjiang, the largest proportion--484--at Xinjiang Medical University. The desire to attract Pakistani students was a major driver behind the university's decision to move away from using Chinese as their medium of instruction, even though it has proven challenging for the professors there. They include about 120 students drawn from among the large migrant population of Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia. As of 2012, there are over 5,000 Pakistani students in China and most are studying medicine. In 2016, there were 19,000 Pakistani students studying at Chinese universities, making Pakistan the fourth largest source of international students in the country. The main disciplines of studies pursued included medicine, engineering, economics and management. Traders Due to the liberalisation of foreign exchange controls on renminbi in border areas, Kashgar, which is closer to Pakistan than other major cities of Xinjiang, was a popular destination for Pakistani traders as early as the 1990s. In accordance with a 1985 protocol agreement, the Khunjerab Pass border crossing between Pakistan and China on the Karakorum Highway closes between January and April. This has sometimes caused difficulties for Pakistan traders who enter Xinjiang on border passes, as in 2004 when 700 traders were expelled. Later on, a large community of Pakistani traders formed in Urumqi, estimated at between 1,000 and 2,000 people. They tend to live in Uyghur neighbourhoods, but at the same time, there is a certain level of tension between Uyghurs and Pakistanis, due to the two groups' relative economic positions, as well as cultural disagreements over alleged laxness in the Uyghurs' practise of Islam. In the past, Uyghurs were able to benefit economically by playing an intermediary role for Pakistani traders who came to Xinjiang, selling them goods shipped north from Guangdong where they were produced, or providing transport services; however, since the early 2000s, Pakistani traders have tended to go directly to Guangdong to purchase goods, and Han Chinese-owned trucking firms have taken over much of the land cargo market in Xinjiang. There have been some Chinese media reports suggesting that Pakistanis in Xinjiang are connected to drug trafficking problems; however, others claim that Afghans with false Pakistani documents are smuggling drugs and giving Pakistanis a bad name. Another popular destination for Pakistani businesspeople is Yiwu, Zhejiang. In 2006, 3,232 Pakistani nationals entered China at Yiwu, and 425 Pakistani nationals stayed in the city as residents.

Biography Joseph Williams Vance Jr. attended Southwestern College (now Rhodes College) in Memphis from 1936 to 1938 and later the University of Florida at Gainesville before he enlisted in the Naval Reserve on 26 July 1940 as an apprentice seaman. After serving at sea in Arkansas (BB-33) during the late summer and early fall, he was appointed midshipman on 22 November and reported to Prairie State (IX-15) for further training. Commissioned ensign on 28 February 1941, Vance drew Asiatic Fleet duty and joined Parrott (DD-218) in the Philippine Islands on 16 April. His ship conducted maneuvers and exercises in the Philippine Archipelago through the summer of the critical year, 1941; and, as the international situation continued to be \\"tense and unpredictable,\\" was dispatched on 24 November with her division—Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 58—to Tarakan, Borneo. Soon after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (8 December west of the date line), Parrott and her sister ships joined the American-British-Dutch- Australian (ABDA) effort to stem the Japanese tide sweeping down from the north. Parrott operated in the Netherlands East Indies archipelago until the fall of Java, participating in two major engagements—the Battle of Makassar Strait (24 January 1942) and the Battle of Badoeng Strait (20 February 1942). For his gallantry during the first action, Ens. Vance was awarded the Bronze Star. As the ship's torpedo officer, Vance had charge of the destroyer's 12-tube battery of 21-inch torpedo tubes—in effect the ship's \\"main battery.\\" On 23 January, DesDiv 58 began a final approach to the town of Balikpapan, Borneo, captured only that day by the Japanese. Dutch \\"scorched earth\\" policies and a Dutch air raid had set fire to most of the vital petroleum storage areas, starting blazes which clearly silhouetted the Japanese transports lying to offshore. On 24 January, in the initial phase of the Battle of Makassar Strait, Vance and his torpedo crews had bad luck. All eight torpedoes missed on the first run-in. The division turned and tried again—this time with success. Three \\"fish\\" ran straight and true from Parrott's tubes on the port battery, sinking 3,500-ton transport Sumanoura Maru. Within minutes, Parrott teamed up with Pope (DD-225) and Paul Jones (DD-230) in delivering a torpedo attack on Tatsukami Maru, holing her and sending her to the bottom shortly thereafter. Soon the American force retired in the confusion of the melee while the Japanese area commander sent his escorts on a wild goose chase after American submarines! Vance's bronze star citation took note that he had skillfully fired four salvoes in a battle at close range, in which a wide variety of target speeds and approaches had been used and had directed the fire by means of an old-fashioned open sight. By his \\"ability, resourcefulness, and devotion to duty,\\" Vance contributed substantially to Parrott's performance in the United States Navy's first surface action victory—a tactical one at best—in the war against Japan. Parrott then continued her operations in defense of the Malay barrier, taking part in the Battle of Badoeng Strait on 20 February—an action in which the ship was damaged. The destroyer ended up in Fremantle with the remnants of the Asiatic Fleet scattered by the Battle of the Java Sea from 27 February to 1 March. Vance remained in Parrott through the spring, when he received promotion to lieutenant (junior grade) on 15 June 1942. As Allied forces gathered for the assault on Japanese-held Guadalcanal, Vance received orders to HMAS Canberra, as liaison officer with the Australian Navy. Canberra, once the prewar flagship of the Australian squadron, departed Wellington, New Zealand, on 22 July, bound for Guadalcanal and what was to be her final action. On 8 August, the Australian cruiser helped to screen American transports off the landing beaches and then in the evening retired, in company with Chicago (CA-29), to a night screening position south of Savo Island. Unbeknownst to the Allied force, a Japanese cruiser formation steamed undetected down \\"the Slot\\" between Guadalcanal and Savo Islands. [Correction: the Japanese force was spotted by aerial surveillance and reported to Adm. Turner's forces during the afternoon of the 8th.] They soon opened fire with guns (8- and 5.5-inch) and the dreaded \\"long lance\\" torpedoes. Chicago took a torpedo forward, but Canberra took the worst punishment in the form of a veritable hail of shells which soon reduced her to a blazing wreck. During the engagement, Lt. (jg.) Vance was killed in action. Namesake The U.S. Navy destroyer , which saw duty in the latter part of World War II, was named in his honor and sponsored by Mrs. Joseph W. Vance, his mother.

Geography The ecoregion lies in Northwestern coastal Australia, including the Kimberley Region of Western Australia and extending into the Northern Territory. It is bounded on the north by the Timor Sea. The Arnhem Land tropical savanna ecoregion lies to the northeast, the Carpentaria tropical savanna lies to the east, and the Victoria Plains tropical savanna ecoregion lies to the southeast and south. The Great Sandy-Tanami desert ecoregion lies to the southeast. Much of the ecoregion has rugged terrain of Proterozoic sandstone. The Northern Kimberley coast is generally steep with many offshore islets. Rivers in the ecoregion include the Fitzroy, May, Drysdale, Durack, Ord, Victoria, and Daly. Rivers and streams often follow sandstone fault blocks, eroding dramatic gorges. Some coastal areas of Northern Kimberly are formed of basalt, and the Mitchell Plateau and Bougainville Peninsula are overlain by a layer of bauxitic duricrust. The southern Dampierland region, which includes the Dampier Peninsula and the coastal plain extending to the southwest, are on deposits of red sand. The topography of Dampierland is mostly gentle, with coastal dunes and lagoons. IBRA regions The ecoregion includes five IBRA regions – Central Kimberley, Daly Basin, Dampierland, Northern Kimberley, and Victoria Bonaparte. Climate The ecoregion has a tropical savanna climate. Temperatures are high throughout the year, and monthly maximum averages range from 25º to 35º C. Rainfall is highly seasonal, occurring with the summer monsoons from October to March, followed by a long dry season during the rest of the year. Rainfall is highest in the coastal north of the ecoregion, and lower in the south and towards the interior. The Mitchell Plateau in the north receives 1,400 mm annually, while Broome in the southwest receives around 600 mm. Flora A boab tree in February The vegetation is mostly savanna and open woodland, which vary in species composition with rainfall, underlying soils, and exposure to fires. Other vegetation types include wetlands and enclaves of monsoon rainforest. Woodlands and savannas Woodland of bloodwood eucalypts (Corymbia spp.) is widespread on sand and loam soils. Boab (Adansonia gregorii) is a distinctive woodland tree that favours sandy soils. Darwin stringybark (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) and Darwin woollybutt (E. miniata) predominate where soils are richer and rainfall is higher. The trees are evergreen and form an open canopy 5 to 15 metres high. The understory is mostly tall grass, with species of Sorghum, Heteropogon, Themeda, Chrysopogon, Aristida, and Eriachne. In parts of Northern Kimberly, the palm Livistona eastonii forms a dense sub-canopy in the woodlands. River valley lowlands with fine-textured clay and clay-loam soils are home to open woodlands characterized by trees of the genera Terminalia and Bauhinia, and grasslands of Chrysopogon, Aristida, and Dichanthium, with species of Xerochloa in wetter areas. Many of these woodlands and grasslands have been converted to farmland. Pindan Pindan is a plant community found on the Dampier Peninsula and elsewhere the southwestern portion of the ecoregion, typically in areas with red sandy soils. Pindan is a low-canopied open woodland with trees 3 to 8 meters high. The dominant species are wattle, including Acacia eriopoda, A. tumida, A. platycarpa, and A. colei. Occasional bloodwoods emerge above the wattle canopy. Monsoon rainforests Pockets of monsoon rainforest are found on scattered sites, generally within 150 km of the coast. There are approximately 1500 monsoon rainforest patches totaling 7,000 hectares (ha). The average patch is less than four hectares. Only 3% exceed 20 ha, an the largest is 200 ha. Monsoon rainforest is composed of semi-deciduous or deciduous trees which lose their leaves towards the end of the dry season (\\"raingreen\\"). Woody vines are common, and they climb into the tree canopies; lower-canopied monsoon rainforests are also known as monsoon vine thickets. Understory plants include low trees, shrubs and vines. Monsoon rainforest is generally fire-intolerant, in contrast to the surrounding savanna and woodlands which are adapted to frequent fires. Trees and shrubs of the monsoon rainforest often have fleshy fruits, which are eaten and dispersed by birds, bats, and mammals. Monsoon rainforests are found behind coastal dunes, on hillsides and scree slopes, at the edges of swamps and rivers, and in gorges and gullies. Rainforests have a distinct flora from the adjacent savannas and woodlands, with many ancient Gondwanian plants, along with plants characteristic of the Australasian and Indomalayan tropics.Kenneally, Kevin F. (2018). Kimberley Tropical Monsoon Rainforests of Western Australia: Perspectives on Biological Diversity. Journal of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas: 149 – 228. 2018. Little Mertens Falls on the Mitchell Plateau In Northern Kimberley, monsoon rainforests are common on scree slopes at the bottom of escarpments, and at the edges of freshwater swamps and mangroves. They are most extensive on basalt slopes at the foot of the laterite plateaus that top the Mitchell Plateau and Bougainville Peninsula. Mixed evergreen, semi-evergreen, and deciduous trees form a canopy 15–20 meters in height, crowned by emergent trees. Monsoon rainforest trees in the Northern Kimberley include Aglaia elaeagnoidea, Albizia lebbeck, Brachychiton diversifolius, Brachychiton xanthophyllus, Bombax ceiba, Dysoxylum latifolium, Ficus (F. congesta, F. geniculata var. insignis, F. hispida var. hispida, F. racemosa var. racemosa, and F. virens var. virens), Ganophyllum falcatum, Garuga floribunda, Grewia breviflora, Litsea glutinosa, Miliusa brahei, Mimusops elengi, Monoon australe, Myristica insipida, Sterculia quadrifida, Terminalia ferdinandiana, Terminalia microcarpa, Terminalia petiolaris, Wrightia pubescens, and Ziziphus quadrilocularis. Woody vines are profuse, and climb into the tree canopies. Small trees and shrubs make up the understory, and include Alectryon kimberleyanus, Denhamia obscura, Glycosmis microphylla, Glycosmis trifoliata, Grewia glabra, Micromelum minutum, Murraya paniculata, Strychnos lucida, and Trema tomentosa. Trees found at the edges of rainforest patches include Acacia holoserica, boab (Adansonia gregorii), helicopter tree (Gyrocarpus americanus), and Antidesma ghaesembilla. The monsoon vine forests of the northern Dampier Peninsula grow up to 12 meters in height. Common trees include Terminalia petiolaris, mangarr (Sersalisia sericea), banyan fig (Ficus virens var. virens), Ficus geniculata var. insignis, wild apple (Syzygium eucalyptoides subsp. bleeseri), with gubinge (Terminalia ferdinandiana) growing on the landward fringe. There are localized populations of Cupaniopsis anacardioides, Diospyros maritima, D. rugulosa, Pittosporum moluccanum, Trophis scandens, and Vitex glabrata. Coastal monsoon vine thickets extend from the Dampier Peninsula as far south as Broome, in areas with 600 mm or more of annual rainfall. They are found in small, usually linear patches along the leeward side of dunes, sustained by a shallow aquifer. The endemic Cable Beach bloodwood (Corymbia paractia) is a characteristic tree, along with Goonj (Celtis philippensis), Croton habrophyllus, broad-leaved ballart (Exocarpos latifolius), karnbor (Melaleuca dealbata), marool or blackberry tree (Terminalia petiolaris), and mamajen (Mimusops elengi). Vines include Capparis lasiantha, Gymnanthera oblonga, Parsonsia kimberleyensis, stinking passionflower (Passiflora foetida), snake vine (Tinospora smilacina), and Secamone elliptica. The vine thickets often transition to pindan further inland. Riparian forests Riparian forests line rivers and streams. Common riparian trees include river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), Terminalia platyphylla, Nauclea orientalis, Melaleuca leucadendra, and species of Ficus, Alphitonia, Calophyllum, Canarium, Cryptocarya, Myristica, and Syzygium. Understory shrubs include Pandanus aquaticus, P. spiralis, Antidesma, and Drypetes. Vines aren't as profuse as in the monsoon rainforests, but the non-native stinking passionflower is abundant in some areas. The riparian forests include many rainforest tree and shrub species with fleshy fruits. These are an important food source for wildlife, and the forests also provide habitat and shelter for many animals. Fauna Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) About 230 species of plants are endemic to the ecoregion, along with six endemic species of mammals, two endemic bird species, 31 endemic reptile species, and 16 endemic fish species. Native mammals include the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis), common wallaroo (Osphranter robustus), antilopine kangaroo (Osphranter antilopinus), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), bilby (Macrotis lagotis), short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), northern brushtail possum (Trichosurus arnhemensis), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), rock-haunting ringtail possum (Petropseudes dahli), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), and pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi). The golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus) and golden-backed tree-rat (Mesembriomys macrurus) were once widespread in the ecoregion, but are now limited to Northern Kimberley. The boodie or burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur), a formerly-native kangaroo, is now extinct from the ecoregion. The six endemic mammals are the Ningbing false antechinus (Pseudantechinus ningbing), scaly-tailed possum (Wyulda squamicaudata), monjon (Petrogale burbidgei), yellow-lipped bat (Vespadelus douglasorum), Kimberley mouse (Pseudomys laborifex), and Kimberley rock rat (Zyzomys woodwardi). Windjana Gorge, Tunnel Creek, and Geikie Gorge have extensive cave systems that support large bat colonies. The black grasswren (Amytornis housei) and white-quilled rock pigeon (Petrophassa albipennis) are endemic. The black grasswren lives in hummock grasslands in the sandstone hills of Northern Kimberley. The ecoregion is home to the near-threatened Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae). The purple-crowned fairywren (Malurus coronatus) is threatened by habitat loss, as its riparian habitat, particularly along the Ord and Fitzroy rivers, has been trampled by cattle and converted to agriculture. The ecoregion's wetlands are important habitats for migratory and resident water birds. Glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) and magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata) are the most abundant. The Ord River Floodplain and Parry Creek floodplain, Eighty Mile Beach, and Roebuck Bay are Ramsar sites. Lakes Argyle and Kununurra are artificial reservoirs on the Ord River which have become important dry-season refuges for birds. The rocky northern coast and offshore islands are home to colony breeding sites for herons, cormorants, and other seabirds. The endemic lizards include seven species of geckoes (Diplodactylus mcmillani, Gehyra occidentalis, G. xenopus, Oedura filicipoda, O. gracilis, Amalosia obscura and Pseudothecadactylus cavaticus), four agamid lizards (Diporiphora convergens, D. pindan, D. superba, and Pogona microlepidota), and 13 skinks (Carlia johnstonei, Ctenotus burbidgei, C. mastigura, C. tantillus, C. decaneurus yampiensis, Egernia douglasi, Eremiascincus brongersmai, Lerista apoda, L. borealis, L. kalumburu, L. separanda, L. walkeri, and Cyclodomorphus maximus). Endemic snakes are the rough-scaled python (Morelia carinata), Kimberley deep-soil blind snake (Anilios howi), Small-eyed blind snake (A. micromma), Sandamara blind snake (A. troglodytes), Yampi blind snake (A. yampiensis), Ord curl snake (Sula ordensis), and Simoselaps minimus. The endemic frogs include flat-headed frog (Limnodynastes depressus), cave-dwelling frog (Ranoidea cavernicola), magnificent tree frog (Ranoidea splendida), Derby toadlet (Uperoleia aspera), small toadlet (U. minima), fat toadlet (U. crassa), marbled toadlet (U. marmorata), Mjoberg's toadlet (U. mjobergi), and mole toadlet (U. talpa). Conservation and threats Sandalwood plantation in the Ord River valley Threats to the ecoregion's wildlife include: habitat loss from converting land to agriculture and pasture; trampling and overgrazing by livestock cattle and feral cattle, donkeys pigs, and rabbits; changes to the fire regime from replacing Aboriginal fire practices (small, frequent, and deliberately-set small fires) with widespread fire suppression resulting in larger late-season fires; and the introduction of exotic predators including house cats and foxes. Several introduced plants have become widepread weeds, displacing native plants and disrupting the region's fire and hydrologic cycles and food sources for native animals. These plants include rough cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium), parkinsonia (Parkinsonia aculeata), bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypifolia), castor bean plant (Ricinus communis), and stinking passionflower (Passiflora foetida). Protected areas Danggu Gorge National Park A 2017 assessment found that 84,546 km², or 25%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas in the ecoregion include Drysdale River National Park, Keep River National Park, Mitchell River National Park, Prince Regent National Park, Danggu Gorge National Park, Mirima National Park, Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges Conservation Park, Ord River Nature Reserve, Charnley River–Artesian Range Sanctuary, Marion Downs Sanctuary, Mornington Sanctuary, Tableland Wildlife Sanctuary, and the northern and western portions of Gregory National Park. Indigenous protected areas in the ecoregion include Nyangumarta Warrarn Indigenous Protected Area, Yawuru Indigenous Protected Area, Bardi Jawi Indigenous Protected Area, Dambimangari Indigenous Protected Area, Karajarri Indigenous Protected Area, Uunguu Indigenous Protected Area, Wilinggin Indigenous Protected Area, Balanggarra Indigenous Protected Area, and Wardaman Indigenous Protected Area.UNEP-WCMC (2020).

The values are 1 lepton, 5 lepta, 10 lepta, 20 lepta in red colour, 25 lepta, 50 lepta in lilac colour, 1 drachma, 2 drachma and 5 drachma. The lower values up to 20 lepta have no overprint. The values from 25 lepta to 5 drachma have a red overprint or a black overprint with the word in small letters or no overprint. First day cancels exist only on the lower values and the higher values with red overprint. The first cancel on a stamp with black overprint is \\"XANIA 3 MAPT 1900\\" on a 2 drachma stamp. The higher values without overprint were at first used only as revenue stamps. Some of these \\"revenues\\" were cancelled (without permission) in post offices. The first cancel on a stamp without overprint and no sign of a revenue might be \\"XANIA NOEM 1900\\" on a 5 drachma stamp. First day cancels are known from the main post offices in Chania (), Rethymnon () and Heraklion () and from the port of Sitia (). There should have been 20 other post offices at that time, but for some of them there is no proof that they opened before 1901. One in Kalochorion was closed in May 1900, so that fewer than five items cancelled with this postmark are known. The offices in Georgioupolis and Vokoulies were closed in spring 1901. Fewer than ten items cancelled with the Georgioupolis postmark are known; the Vokoulies cancels are seldom seen but not rare and forgeries exist. In July 1900 the 20 lepta stamp in orange colour and the 50 lepta in ultramarine colour were ordered, both without overprint. One 50 lepta is cancelled \\"\\" in \\" 1900\\", although Greek stamp catalogues list the issue of both stamps in January 1901. In December 1901 the 25 lepta with a black overprint \\"\\" in large letters was issued. The 20 lepta orange overprinted with two black 5 in the lower corners was issued circa November 1904. The first known cancel on this stamp is \\"18 NOEM 1904\\".  Later issues  In February 1905, the second series was released. The series depicted Artemis, Britomartis, infant Cydon suckling a female Cretan hound, Triton, Ariadne, as well as the ruins of the Palace of Knossos and the Arcadia Monastery against the backdrop of Mount Ida. In September 1908, after the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece, the stamps of the previous issues were overprinted \\"\\" (\\"Greece\\").  Foreign post offices  At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, five countries operated post offices on the territory of Crete. Britain and Russia issued stamps inscribed in Greek, while France and Italy used their own stamps overprinted with the name of the island. In February 1881, while Crete was still a part of the Ottoman Empire, Greek post offices opened in the three big cities of the island, Chania, Rethymnon and Heraklion. These Greek post offices were consulate departments and they operated until the end of 1881, just for eight or nine months, using Greek stamps with designs including large Hermes heads. Due to the very short period that these services operated in Crete, the postal items, stamps and especially letters, are very rare. The stamp for the russian post offices in Crete in the following gallery is a forgery. The type of forgery is described by Feenstra.

Remaining Cretan stamps were overprinted and issued in Greece in 1923.  Collections  Famous collectors of Cretan postal history include the late Dr. Angelos C. Papaioannou and Takis Karatzas from Greece but also Gunter Rhensius and Johann Ulrich Schmitt from Germany and Rienk Feenstra from the Netherlands. Currently, the probably largest and most complete collection of Cretan postal history is the one compiled by Dr. Manolis Mylonakis, but there must be a handful further large collections.

It is 16.8 km long and its estimated cost is . The Eastern Freeway was built by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and funded by the Central Government through the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM). Construction was contracted to Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. A 13.59 km stretch of the freeway, comprising two of three segments with one of the twin tunnels, from Orange Gate on P D'Mello Road up to Panjarpol, near RK Studios in Chembur, was opened to the public on 14 June 2013. The second tunnel was opened on 12 April 2014. The third and final segment from Panjarpol to Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road (GMLR) was opened on 16 June 2014. The Eastern Freeway is primarily intended to reduce travel time between South Mumbai and the Eastern Suburbs. It is also expected to ease traffic on Dr BR Ambedkar Road, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg, Port Trust Road, P D'Mello Road, the Eastern Express Highway (EEH) and Mohammad Ali Road. Heavy vehicles (except public buses), three-wheelers, two-wheelers, bullock carts, handcarts and pedestrians are prohibited from using the freeway. Vehicles are also prohibited from halting on the freeway. The maximum allowed speed limit is 60 km/h. History Wilbur Smith and Associates, commissioned in 1962 to study transportation in Bombay, recommended construction of a freeway from the southern part of the city to the Western Express Highway near Bandra. An eastern freeway to connect the Eastern Suburbs with South Mumbai was also proposed in the Central Road Research Institute's transport improvement plan for Bombay in 1983. It also recommended a western freeway to connect the Western Suburbs with South Mumbai. However, the plan was not given serious consideration until about 2003, when work on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL), which was part of the proposed Western Freeway, had begun. It led to an increase in traffic in eastern Mumbai, and the MMRDA decided to consider building the Eastern Freeway. The MMRDA called for bid in 2007, and construction of the main freeway began in January 2008, except for the Anik- Panjarpol link road on which construction had begun in 2004. The Eastern Freeway was scheduled to be completed by 18 January 2011 but faced several delays due to obtaining permissions for construction in forest and salt pan areas, reclaiming of land and difficulties posed by unmapped underground utilities in the construction work. The delays also escalated the cost of the 9.29 km elevated road from the initial to . A 14 km section of the 17 km Eastern Freeway was completed by 24 May 2013. Chavan had promised to open the freeway on 7 June 2013, when he inaugurated the Milan flyover in May 2013. The delay in opening the freeway led to criticism from transport experts and the media, and protests from angry Mumbai residents. The problem was exacerbated by heavy monsoon rains that caused most other roads to be waterlogged. A 13.59 km stretch of the Eastern Freeway, comprising the four-lane 9.29 km elevated road from Orange Gate on P D'Mello Road to the beginning of Anik-Panjarpol Link Road and four of eight lanes of the 4.3 km road-tunnel-flyover from Anik to the beginning of Panjarpol-Ghatkopar Link Road, was eventually inaugurated by the Chief Minister himself on 13 June 2013. However, the freeway could not be opened the same day as the stage erected for the ceremony remained in the middle of the road. The freeway was opened to the public the following day. All civil work on the remaining stretch from Panjarpol to Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road (GMLR) was completed in January 2014. The final stretch opened to the public in April 2014. The original estimated cost of all three segments together was . The final cost of the project is estimated to be . Eight CCTV cameras are installed on the freeway and are operational since 12 August 2015.http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/eastern-freeway-finally- under-cctv-coverage/ Construction The freeway was built in three segments - a 9.3 km elevated road from Orange Gate on P D'Mello Road to the beginning of Anik-Panjarpol Link Road, a 5 km mostly at grade road featuring twin tunnels from Anik to the beginning of Panjarpol-Ghatkopar Link Road, and a 2.5 km flyover from Panjarpol to Ghatkopar.

This phase also includes ground improvement of existing roads, the construction of a 4-lane elevated corridor and the construction of a missing link. This stretch is made up of 4 sections,Mmrdamumbai.org – Mmrdamumbai and Mumbai Samachar and has 5 ramps for exit and entry at Reay Road, Port Road, Anik and Orange Gate. *Section I – From S.V Patel road junction on P D'Mello road to Orange Gate consisting of up and down ramps (0.41 km) *Section II – Orange gate to Mumbai Port Trust pipeline gate – elevated corridor (7.02 km) *Section III – Mumbai Port Trust pipe line gate to WTT road consisting of construction of elevated corridor through salt pan (Missing Link) and Customs area (0.78 km) *Section IV – WTT road near customs area to start of APLR - Elevated corridor (1.08 km) Civil construction work on this section was completed on 9 March 2013. The 9.29 km stretch from Orange Gate to Mahul creek is the longest flyover in Mumbai and third longest flyover in India, after the 25 km Kanpur city bypass flyover on NH-2 and the 11.6 km P.V. Narasimha Rao Elevated Expressway in Hyderabad. This segment was opened to the public on 14 June 2013, along with four lanes of the Anik - Panjarpol link road. Anik - Panjarpol link road The tunnels on the Anik Panarpol Link Road Aerial view of the Anik Panjarpol road The second segment is the 8-lane, 5 km long Anik - Panjarpol link road. This stretch required the construction of Mumbai's first twin tunnel. The twin tunnels are 505m (North-bound) and 555m (South-bound) in length; 18 metres in width and 9 metres in height. This segment was opened to traffic on 14 June 2013. However, only the North-bound tunnel was opened on that date, but it was used for two- way traffic. The South-bound tunnel was opened to traffic from 12 April 2014, making the entire stretch 8-lane. The ramps connecting Anik Wadala Road to the Eastern Freeway were opened to traffic on 6 April 2014. The construction of these two ramps had been scheduled to complete in January 2014, but the work was delayed due to unforeseen technical reasons. Panjarpol - Ghatkopar link road Aerial image of the junction of Mumbai's Eastern Freeway with the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road. The third segment consists of a 4-lane elevated 2.8 km flyover from Panjarpol till the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road (GMLR), via Govandi. This stretch has 3 ramps near Deonar, Govandi and Panjarpol. The section consists of 103 spans. Like the elevated section of the freeway, the Panjarpol-Ghatkopar Link Road has a bitumen layer atop the concrete, ensuring smoother riding quality than a regular cement road. Construction work on this phase of the project was awarded in August 2009 at a cost of , and MMRDA officials announced February 2011 as the deadline. However, obtaining permissions from authorities concerned, rehabilitating project affected families and engineering challenges involved during the construction stage, delayed the project. All civil work on the final stretch of the Eastern Freeway, from Panjarpol to Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road (GMLR), was completed in January 2014. Engineers working on the project then concretised the surface of the Panjarpol-Ghatkopar Link Road, which begins at Panjarpol junction near R K Studio in Chembur and ends at the GMLR. When the first phase of the freeway was inaugurated in June 2013, the MMRDA had planned to commission the final stretch in December 2013. The up and down ramps on the Panjrapole - Ghatkopar Link Road at Panjrapole junction were opened for vehicular traffic on the morning of 30 April 2014. By the end of April 2014, the MMRDA was finishing up the painting and concretising and installing streetlights and signs. The final leg of the 2.8 km Panjarpol-Ghatkopar link road was opened to traffic on 16 June 2014, marking the commissioning of the entire Eastern Freeway. Other work Seismic arresters installed on the freeway will enable it to handle earthquakes of up to 7.5 on the Richter scale. Future Plans The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority plans to extend the southern arm of the freeway by building a 1.5 kilometer extension from Orange Gate, where it currently ends to Mint Road. It is looking at the costs involved as well as the number of lanes of traffic possible. Bus services Several bus services are operated on the Eastern Freeway, mostly connecting the Eastern and Harbour Suburbs with South Mumbai and further down to Navi Mumbai.

It offers a degree in acting and theatre-making as a department of the Australian Institute of Music (AIM). History Logo for the Australian Academy of Dramatic Art, the former name of the Australian Institute of Music – Dramatic Arts. AIM Dramatic Arts, was formerly known as the Australian Academy of Dramatic Art (AADA) and was established in 1983. It became the first drama school in New South Wales to gain State vocational education accreditation, well before 1999. In 2006, AADA became a department of the Australian Institute of Music (AIM), and in 2013 was rebranded as Australian Institute of Music – Dramatic Arts. From 2007, Andrew Davidson was the Head of the School, and in 2013 Peta Downes took over as Head of Dramatic Arts. The Degree In 2007, consultation with the theatre industry began to create a unique, university-level qualification. The growing independent theatre scene in Sydney and other Australian capitals was now to be supported by a custom-built training in contemporary theatre practice, \\"a unique education for the Actor / Creator / Producer\\". The school took the baton from the University of Western Sydney's now-defunct Theatre Nepean, a training program that gave the Australian performing arts sector over a decade of graduates who are all-round theatre makers. In 2009, the department accepted its first intake of students in the new Bachelor of Performance degree. Placement Students undertake a unique interaction with a creative workplace and, often, a future employer. They are matched with leading performing arts companies in Sydney, during or following their final trimester of study. Placement Partners include: Bell Shakespeare, Channel 7, Darlinghurst Theatre Company, Fountainhead Casting, Griffin, Performance Space, Playwriting Australia, Powerhouse, Shopfront, Sport for Jove, Sydney Theatre Company, Tamarama Rock Surfers, and Version 1.0.

Established in 1968 by the late Peter Calvo, the campus of the Australian Institute of Music has grown since the 1990s to house two concert halls, a black box theatre, four dance and drama studios, and multiple classroom, rehearsal and practice spaces. Pilgrim House Teaching and performances took place at the historic Pilgrim Theatre, located in Pilgrim House at 262 Pitt Street, Sydney until early 2017. Built in the Italian Palazzo style in 1927-8, the theatre was used as a broadcast and recording hall for live radio during the Great Depression. It was host to international performers including Noël Coward in the 1940s. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and 2GB Radio were tenants until the 1970s. Throughout the 1990s, Sydney Art Theatre was the resident company. The school's lease began in 2004 and finished in May 2017.

Education and career  After studying economics in college, Coppi worked at an East German foreign trade company for machine tools as a party secretary of the ruling SED party. From 1984 to 1987, he was employed by the Berlin district leadership of the Socialist Unity Party (SED). After a year of study abroad in Moscow, he went to the Harnack/Schulze-Boysen Research Center at the Academy of Sciences in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Writing his dissertation on Harro Schulze-Boysen, he got his doctorate at the Berlin Institute of Technology in 1992. He has spent considerable time devoted to the study of the Red Orchestra and the German Resistance. Although his parents are often identified as having been members of the Red Orchestra, Coppi himself says the term is a \\"catch-all\\" term the Nazis used to derogatorily refer to all Widerstand groups and it was used even after 1945 to defame them as Soviet spies. From 1990 to 1994, he was a researcher at the German Resistance Memorial Center in Berlin. From 1997 to 2002, he was the project director for the development of electronic archival resources at the Sachsenhausen Memorial.

He built a three-kilometre-long bridge in less than three months during the Siege of Hamburg in 1813. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. Biography Louis Didier Jousselin was born at Blois on 1 April 1776.Joubert-Bonnaire Jouvenel, assemblee-nationale.fr, p.438, accessed April 2010 His father was a lawyer who was also interested in politics. Jousselin was successfully admitted as one of the first students at the École Polytechnique, where he graduated two years later.Histoire de l'École polytechnique, Ambroise Fourcy, p.395, 1828, accessed April 2010 After becoming a qualified engineer he was sent to assist with the Northern Canal near Maastricht in May 1808.L’ingénieur_Jousselin L’ingénieur Jousselin, fr.wikisource.org, accessed April 2010 Siege of Hamburg By 1811 the canal had been completed and Jousselin was appointed Chief Engineer for Hamburg; a city that was then under French control. He fortified the town and was recognised for the role he played in securing the city whilst it was under siege by the Russian Army and in containing a population who were not supportive of the French invaders. The bridge at Hamburg Jousselin built a bridge which was useful to those defending the siege. Marshal Davout needed to get supplies across the River Elbe. His advisors advised that boats were the only solution. Jousselin was summoned and he said he could build a bridge in three months if he was given every material he would ask for. The Marshal agreed to the commitment. The bridge was not only built, but built well within the time that Jousselin had estimated. The bridge was three kilometres long and linked Hamburg over low ground with Harburg. Marshal Devout wrote to his wife in October 1813 assuring her that Hamburg was now impregnable. The bridge was described as beautiful and prodigious. Jousselin was praised as the Marshal could not believe the amount of work that had been achieved. The bridge was constructed in 1813. Hamburg was particularly important as it was on the supply lines of Napoleon's army. Hamburg was only surrendered when orders came from the French King following the fall of Napoleon. France On 24 April 1814, he was sent as Chief engineer to Orléans. He was there on 20 March 1815 when he heard of Napoleon's return from Elba. Jousselin returned to Paris and contacted Marshal Davout. Davout obviously remembered the skillful engineer from their work at Hamburg and recommended him further. Davout wrote to the Emperor, telling him of his Jousselin's exploits. He told Napoleon that he would be a prisoner of war in Siberia with his 40,000 soldiers if it had not been for this engineer. Jousselin's contribution was recognized and he was made Inspector General of Bridges. However at the end of Napoleon's \\"Hundred Days\\", all decrees are recanted and Jousselin returned to Orléans. The bridge he had built at Hamburg was decommissioned in 1817 as it was not maintained by the Germans.Jousselin Didier Louis (1776-1858), souvenir-davout.com, accessed April 2010 However, in Orléans, Chief Engineer Jousselin built quays around the mouth of the Loire.

Life  Augustus was born in 1564 as the fifth of fifteen children and the son of William the Younger and his wife Dorothea of Denmark. As a young man he was a colonel in the service of Rudolf II and fought in the campaigns against France and Turkey. In 1610 Augustus became the Lutheran administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg. In order to prevent hereditary aspirations the Ratzeburg cathedral chapter, the elective body, insisted that on ascending to power in the prince-bishopric (an elective monarchy), Augustus committed himself in his election capitulation not to marry. Nevertheless he lived with Ilse Schmidtchen, a commoner, in a 'marriage-like relationship'Christa Geckler, Die Celler Herzöge - Leben und Wirken 1371-1705, p. 73 and had 12 children by her; he built her a house near his residence, Celle Castle. The children were later elevated to the hereditary peerage under the name von Lüneburg; this surname still exists. In 1633 Augustus succeeded his brother, Christian, who had died, as Prince of Lüneburg. During the Thirty Years War he continued the policy of neutrality started by his brother. He died in Celle in 1636. Since 1831, the family descended from Augustus has resided at Essenrode Manor.

As a player, Barth is most known for his emotional melodic style and his slide work. Education Barth attended St. John's Military School in Salina, Kansas and finished his formal education at Fountain-Fort Carson High School in Fountain, Colorado. He began playing drums in 1960, working weekend and one-night shows in 1963. Barth learned guitar basics from his stepfather, and in 1968 he left home and began to play music full-time. Music career Barth joined the Colorado group Wakefield in 1969, as lead guitarist and singer. Wakefield was made up of Pueblo, Colorado natives Charlie Ferrill on drums, Carl Marcon on bass, Mike Carrol on trumpet, Ron Struthers on sax and flute and San Francisco native Paul Zamucen on congas and timbales. The band performed in clubs across the country until parting company around 1973. Barth launched Babyface around the same time, with Colorado drummer Bobby Miles, California bassist Mike Turpin, and Wisconsin keyboardist Edgar Riley, Jr. This band went through a few member changed and recorded their first and only record for now-defunct ASI Records. Although the band felt betrayed by the producer, who changed the direction of the record after the band left the studio, the record produced a top 20 song on the Billboard A/C charts. The band, which considered itself to be a cerebral rock band, but was stuck performing for crowds that expected to hear its top 20 hit, was forced to disband in 1978. After a short time Barth, Turpin and Riley joined forces with guitarist Michael Osborne and drummer Teddy Mueller to reform the Babyface concept without the intrusion of ASI Records and emerged in Gainesville, Florida as Alien. In 1979, MCA Records penned a deal with pop music label Curb Records to form a company that would co-produce rock bands. Alien was the first band to sign with the MCA-Curb label and after a quick name change to Axe,White, Dale. \\"Sharpening the blade,\\" Sarasota Herald-Tribune, October 7, 1979. due to the release of the motion picture Alien gave birth to two records, Axe and Living on the Edge. Barth recounts that both records were a poor representation of the band (despite the song \\"Battles\\" being played by album-oriented rock stations), due to their lack of studio experience and \\"dreadful\\" choice of producers. After the industry-wide bloodbath of 1980, like so many other bands, Axe found itself without a label. Working with Roger Probert of Atlantic Records, the band set a deal with Atlantic. Details are confusing, but overnight the band managed by Jim Dawson and Arnakata Management and produced by Thom Allom of Judas Priest, found itself on Atco Records instead of Atlantic, with a new manager and producer. Albums produced under that contract included Offering and Nemesis. Offering brought the band to the attention of American radio, with \\"Rock and Roll Party in the Streets\\", when the single, without any real support from Atco, made the Billboard Top 100 songs for their year ending charts, and the album making the Billboard top 75 albums of the year chart, both for 1981. The band continued to tour and record, until in 1984 Osborne and Barth were involved in a fatal car crash. Barth escaped with only spinal injuries, but Osborne was killed in the crash. Barth recorded his solo record, Two Hearts One Beat, as a tribute to Osborne in 1985. Barth joined Blackfoot, another Atco/Nalli band, in 1984 after recovering from the crash. He played with Blackfoot until their breakup in 1986. After the breakup of Blackfoot, Bobby continued to tour with Blackfoot's Ricky Medlocke until leaving in late 1986. Barth moved back to Los Angeles and partnered with UFO drummer Andy Parker to open Satellite Sound Recording in Burbank. Barth started to engineer and produce projects with the help of the producer of his solo record 2 Hearts, Was Not Was bassist Bruce Nazarian. The two became involved with writing and producing for major films until, in 1990, Barth was recruited to play guitar for Angry Anderson. After recording Angry's record Blood From Stone, Barth moved to Australia to tour with Anderson. The record garnered two top 10 hits and a tour with Aerosmith. Upon Barth's return to the USA, he and his wife left Los Angeles and moved to Denver, and started NEH Records. Barth produced several records for MTM, Toshiba-EMI, and Japan's Zero Corporation Label, as well as countless indie projects. In mid-2001, Barth and his business partner Michael McPherson separated the label's retail sales from the studio and Barth moved the studio to New Orleans. In 2004, the original members of Blackfoot (minus Medlocke) asked Barth to reunite and to tour again. From 2004 till 2010, Barth and Blackfoot were touring, with Barth fronting the band. He left in late 2010. In 2012 an anthology of his work covering seven CDs with Axe was released on Cleopatra records, titled Axeology. In June 2012, the final Axe show was filmed on their 35 anniversary and released as a DVD/CD package called Axe Live 2012 on the NEH Record label. Barth went into semi retirement in 2015 moving his family and studio to Lafayette County, Florida. On September 20, 2019, the release of Axe the Final Offering on Escape Music was made and is rumored to be the last Axe recording, making a total of 12 records spanning over 40 years. Other interests Although a working musician all his life, Barth says his greatest accomplishment was receiving the Colorado Master of the Year Award in 1998 while serving as the Worshipful Master of Denver Lodge No. 5, Colorado's oldest Masonic Lodge. He continues to be active in Freemasonry and in the rebuilding of New Orleans. He is also Vice President and a founding member of the Louisiana Grand Chapter of the \\"Widows Sons\\" motorcycle Riding Assoc. Barth is also currently an honorary member of the Alabama Widows Sons Masonic Riders Association in Montgomery, Alabama.

History  The first locomotive arriving at Léopoldville in 1898 The Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Congo (CCFC) was founded on 31 July 1887, on the same day the Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (CCCI) was founded. The construction of the railway was directed by Albert Thys, whose name was given to one of the railway stations, Thysville (now Mbanza-Ngungu).Historical Railway: Congo Railways - Leopoldville - a view of the port and the train station. The completion of the Matadi–Kinshasa railway, in 1898, provided an alternative route around the rapids and sparked the rapid development of Léopoldville. Its construction cost the lives of 1,932 people (1,800 locals and 132 immigrants). The living conditions in the construction of this railway were miserable. The sanitary and medical facilities were insufficient. In 1892, about two thousand people worked on the railroad, of which an average of one hundred and fifty workers per month lost their lives due to smallpox, dysentery, beriberi and exhaustion. By the end of 1892, 7,000 workers had already been recruited, 3,500 of whom had died or fled (for example, to neighboring forests). These conditions made it more difficult to recruit workers. Thys therefore attracted people from Barbados and China in September and November 1892 respectively. The Barbadians refused to leave the boats in the port of Matadi until they were forced by firearms. Seven people lost their lives in this action. The main challenge was to build the railway track through the gorges of the Congo River, onwards through the M'pozo River, and a difficult passage along the Monts de Cristal.  Gauges  Comparisonof the old and new alignment Starting in 1890, the railway line was initially built to a nominal gauge of 750 mm (2 ft 5½ in), and all rolling stock was constructed to this gauge. However, as local labour had difficulty understanding the concept of gauge widening on curves, the entire line was rebuilt to a gauge of 765 mm (2 ft 6⅛ in). Modifications were made from 1923 to 1931, when it was converted to 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge on a new alignment. Several tens of thousands of workers, mostly convicts and forced labor, were employed for this renovation. 7,000 of them lost their lives in the process. In spite of the technical and financial difficulties related to the construction of the railway line, it quickly proved to be profitable, mainly thanks to the transportation of ivory and rubber. As a 750 mm (2 ft 5½ in) gauge railway it operated a large fleet of 0-6-0T, 0-6-2T, 2-6-2T steam locomotives before turning to 32 0-6-0+0-6-0 Garratts, and finally 5 outside-framed 2-8-2 locomotives.

History and structure According to legend the song was originally sung by a man condemned to death who was pardoned his punishment after turning to look back at the city and singing its praises. Structurally and stylistically the song follows the pattern of traditional Mongolian epics in the way it frames its praise. Mount Bogd Khan Uul is called \\"Dunjingarav\\" which is its Tibetan name (e.g. \\"Khagan Dunjingarav\\", \\"Bogd Dunjingarav\\" and \\"Baghatur Dunjingarav\\"). The song dates back to the era of Manchu dominance (1691–1911) and includes references to Manchu imperial decrees (zarlig) the local Manchu governor (amban) and the Chinese commercial district (naimaa khot). It praises various aspects of Urga: its location at the foot of \\"savior Dunjingarav\\" where the \\"golden Tuul\\" river flows, its civil, religious, military and police administration, its \\"rich markets\\", its \\"80 elbow tall Maitreya statue\\" (built in 1833 and destroyed with its temple in 1933), its innumerable monasteries filled with \\"quick-witted disciples\\", its caravans and endless pilgrims.

It was located on the former 13.1 km (8.1 mi) long Milang railway line, which opened in 1884 and closed in 1970. This sign, all that remains of the former station, is about half-way along what is now a popular walking trail The branch line left the former South Australian Railways Mount Barker–Victor Harbor railway line (now the SteamRanger Heritage Railway) at the farming locality of Sandergrove. It ended at Milang, on the shore of Lake Alexandrina. Nurragi, the only intermediate station on the line, was about halfway along the line. The layout of track at Nurragi (click to enlarge) The limited facilities were a passing loop 70 metres (230 yards) long, a full- height platform, and a small shed for local farmers' consignments. The name Nurragi is derived from the word for \\"scrub country\\" in the language of the local indigenous Ngarrindjeri people. It does indeed describe the original vegetation in the region before more than 98 per cent of it was cleared by European settlers. After the Milang line was closed in 1970, the track was lifted and the site cleared. Since 1991, the site has been incorporated into the Nurragi Conservation Reserve, a popular rail trail. The reserve contains extremely important remnant vegetation indigenous to the Milang Scrub: more than 300 native plant species are present, of which more than 50 are of particular conservation significance. A community grouphttps://sacommunity.org/org/200910-Friends_of_Nurragi_Association_Inc. has worked to re-establish flora; local primary school children have also taken part. Bare areas have been revegetated with species of the original Milang Scrub, including Aboriginal food plants such as muntries, quandongs and native currants. The reserve is also an important corridor for wildlife and birds between the lakeside environment and the foothills, providing them with food and protective cover.

Since the beginning of IQ testing around the time of World War I, there have been observed differences between average scores of different population groups, but there has been no agreement about whether this is mainly due to environmental and cultural factors, or mainly due to some as yet undiscovered genetic factor, or even if the dichotomy between environmental and genetic factors is the most effective approach to the debate. In the late 19th and early 20th century, group differences in intelligence were assumed to be racial in nature; apart from intelligence tests, research relied on measurements such as brain size or reaction times. By the mid-1940s most psychologists had adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors predominated. In the mid-1960s, physicist William Shockley sparked controversy by claiming there might be genetic reasons that black people in the United States tended to score lower on IQ tests than white people. In 1969 the educational psychologist Arthur Jensen published a long article with the suggestion that compensatory education had failed to that date because of genetic group differences. A similar debate among academics followed the publication in 1994 of The Bell Curve by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray. Their book prompted a renewal of debate on the issue and the publication of several interdisciplinary books on the issue. One contemporary response was a report from the American Psychological Association that found no conclusive explanation for the observed differences between average IQ scores of racial groups. History=Early history Samuel Morton's Crania Americana, 1839. Morton believed that intelligence was correlated with brain size and varied between racial groups, Chapter 6, \\"Science and the idea of race\\", by Audrey Smedley Francis Galton, the English eugenicist who wrote extensively on the relation between intelligence and social class In the 18th century, European philosophers and scientists such as Voltaire, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and Carl Linnaeus, proposed the existence of different mental abilities among the races. During the 19th and early 20th centuries the idea that there are differences in the brain structures and brain sizes of different races, and that these differences explained the different intelligences, was much advocated and studied. Through the publication of his book Hereditary Genius in 1869, polymath Francis Galton spurred interest in the study of mental abilities, particularly as they relate to heredity and eugenics. Lacking the means to directly measure intellectual ability, Galton attempted to estimate the intelligence of various racial and ethnic groups. He based his estimations on observations from his and others' travels, the number and quality of intellectual achievements of different groups, and on the percentage of \\"eminent men\\" in each of these groups. Galton argued that intelligence was normally distributed in all racial and ethnic groups, and that the means of the distributions varied between the groups. In Galton's estimation ancient Attic Greeks had been the people with the highest average intelligence, followed by contemporary Englishmen, with black Africans at a lower level, and Australian Aborigines lower still. He did not specifically study Jews, but remarked that \\"they appear to be rich in families of high intellectual breeds\\". Abolitionist Frederick Douglass in 1856 Meanwhile, the American abolitionist and escaped slave Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) had gained fame for his oratory and incisive writings,Gatewood Jr., Willard B. 1981. \\"Frederick Douglass and the Building of a 'Wall of Anti- Slavery Fire' 1845–1846. An Essay Review.\\" The Florida Historical Quarterly 59(3):340–44. . despite having learned to read as a child largely through surreptitious observation. Accordingly, he had been described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that people of African descent lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.Stewart, Roderick M. 1999. \\"The Claims of Frederick Douglass Philosophically Considered.\\" Pp. 155–56 in Frederick Douglass: A Critical Reader, edited by B. E. Lawson and F. M. Kirkland. Wiley-Blackwell. . \\"Moreover, though he does not make the point explicitly, again the very fact that Douglass is ably disputing this argument on this occasion celebrating a select few's intellect and will (or moral character)—this fact constitutes a living counterexample to the narrowness of the pro-slavery definition of humans.\\"Hutchison, Michael. 2005. \\"Frederick Douglass.\\" P. 27 in Big Ideas in U.S. History, edited by K. Gordonson. Culver City, CA: Social Studies School Service. . Retrieved June 14, 2020. Likewise, Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been a slave.Matlack, James. 1979. \\"The Autobiographies of Frederick Douglass.\\" Phylon (1960–) 40(1):15–28. . . p. 16: \\"He spoke too well.… Since he did not talk, look, or act like a slave (in the eyes of Northern audiences), Douglass was denounced as an imposter.\\" In the later years of his life, one newspaper described him as \\"a bright example of the capability of the colored race, even under the blighting influence of slavery, from which he emerged and became one of the distinguished citizens of the country.\\" In 1895, R. Meade Bache of the University of Pennsylvania published an article in Psychological Review claiming that reaction time increases with evolution. Bache supported this claim with data showing slower reaction times among White Americans when compared with those of Native Americans and African Americans, with Native Americans having the quickest reaction time. He hypothesized that the slow reaction time of White Americans was to be explained by their possessing more contemplative brains which did not function well on tasks requiring automatic responses. This was one of the first examples of modern \\"scientific racism\\", in which a veneer of science was used to bolster belief in the superiority of a particular race. Sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois in 1911 In 1903, the pioneering African-American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois published his landmark collection of essays The Souls of Black Folk in defense of the inherent mental capacity and equal humanity of black people. According to Manning Marable, this book \\"helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. 'Souls' justified the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise of the black middle class.\\"Marable, Manning (2011), Living Black History: How Reimagining the African-American Past Can Remake America's Racial Future, p. 96. . In contrast to other civil rights leaders like Booker T. Washington, who advocated for incremental progress and vocational education as a way for black Americans to demonstrate the virtues of \\"industry, thrift, intelligence and property\\" to the white majority, Du Bois advocated for black schools to focus more on liberal arts and academic curriculum (including the classics, arts, and humanities), because liberal arts were required to develop a leadership elite. Du Bois argued that black populations just as much as white ones naturally give rise to what he termed a \\"talented tenth\\" of intellectually gifted individuals.Alfred Binet (1857-1911), inventor of the first intelligence test At the same time, the discourse of \\"scientific racism\\" was only accelerating. In 1910 the sociologist Howard W. Odum published his book Mental and Social Traits of the Negro, which described African-American students as \\"lacking in filial affection, strong migratory instincts and tendencies; little sense of veneration, integrity or honor; shiftless, indolent, untidy, improvident, extravagant, lazy, lacking in persistence and initiative and unwilling to work continuously at details. Indeed, experience with the Negro in classrooms indicates that it is impossible to get the child to do anything with continued accuracy, and similarly in industrial pursuits, the Negro shows a woeful lack of power of sustained activity and constructive conduct.\\" As the historian of psychology Ludy T. Benjamin explains, \\"with such prejudicial beliefs masquerading as facts,\\" it was at this time that educational segregation on the basis of race was imposed in some states. Lewis Terman, psychologist and developer of the Stanford-Binet intelligence test In 1916 George O. Ferguson conducted research in his Columba Ph.D. thesis on \\"The psychology of the Negro\\", that reflected contemporary stereotypes, finding African-Americans to be poor in abstract thought but good in physical responses, and recommending that this should be reflected in education. In the same year Lewis Terman, in the manual accompanying the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, argued for a higher frequency of so-called \\"morons\\" among non-white American racial groups, and concluded that the \\"enormously significant racial differences in general intelligence\\" which he believed he saw could not be remedied by education. The psychologist Henry H. Goddard had suggested with Terman that \\"feeble-mindedness\\" was hereditary In 1916 a team of psychologists, led by Robert Yerkes and including Terman and Henry H. Goddard, adapted the Stanford-Binet tests as multiple choice group tests for use by the US army. In 1919, Yerkes devised a version of this test for civilians, the National Intelligence Test, which was used in all levels of education and in business. Like Terman, Goddard had argued in his book, Feeble-mindedness: Its causes and consequences (1914), that \\"feeble- mindedness\\" was hereditary; and in 1920 Yerkes in his book with Yoakum on the Army Mental Tests described how they \\"were originally intended, and are now definitely known, to measure native intellectual ability\\". Both Goddard and Terman argued that the feeble-minded should not be allowed to reproduce. In the USA, however, independently and prior to the IQ tests, there had been political pressure for such eugenic policies, to be enforced by sterilization; in due course IQ tests were later used as justification for sterilizing the mentally retarded. It was also argued that the IQ tests should be used to control immigration to the USA. Already in 1917 Goddard reported on the low IQ scores of new arrivals at Ellis Island; and Yerkes argued from his army test scores that there were consistently lower IQ levels amongst those from Eastern and Southern Europe, which could lead to a decline in the national intelligence. In 1923, in his book A study of American intelligence, Carl Brigham wrote that on the basis of the army tests: \\"The decline in intelligence is due to two factors, the change in races migrating to this country, and to the additional factor of sending lower and lower representatives of each race.\\" He concluded that: \\"The steps that should be taken to preserve or increase our present mental capacity must of course be dictated by science and not by political expediency. Immigration should not only be restrictive, but highly selective.\\" The Immigration Act of 1924 put these recommendations into practice, introducing quotas based on the 1890 census, prior to the waves of immigration from Poland and Italy. While Gould and Kamin argued that the psychometric claims of Nordic superiority had a profound influence on the institutionalisation of the 1924 immigration law, other scholars have argued that \\"the eventual passage of the 'racist' immigration law of 1924 was not crucially affected by the contributions of Yerkes or other psychologists\\".but see 1920–1960 In the 1920s, psychologists started questioning underlying assumptions of racial differences in intelligence; although not discounting them, the possibility was considered that they were on a smaller scale than previously supposed and also due to factors other than heredity. In 1924, Floyd Allport wrote in his book Social Psychology Reprint of 1924 book. that the French sociologist Gustave Le Bon was incorrect in asserting \\"a gap between inferior and superior species\\", and pointed to \\"social inheritance\\" and \\"environmental factors\\" as accounting for differences. Nevertheless, he suggested that: \\"the intelligence of the white race is of a more versatile and complex order than that of the black race. It is probably superior to that of the red or yellow races.\\" In 1929, Robert Woodworth, in his textbook Psychology: A Study of Mental Life, Reprint of 1929 textbook. made no claims about innate differences in intelligence between races, pointing instead to environmental and cultural factors. He considered it advisable to \\"suspend judgment and keep our eyes open from year to year for fresh and more conclusive evidence that will probably be discovered\\". In the 1930s, the English psychologist Raymond Cattell wrote three tracts, Psychology and Social Progress (1933), The Fight for Our National Intelligence (1937) and Psychology and the Religious Quest (1938). The second was published by the Eugenics Society, of which he had been a research fellow; it predicted the disastrous consequences of not stopping the decline in the average intelligence in Britain by one point per decade. In 1933, Cattell wrote that, of all the European races, the \\"Nordic race was the most evolved in intelligence and stability of temperament\\". He argued for \\"no mixture of bloods between racial groups\\" because \\"the resulting re-shuffling of impulses and psychic units throws together in each individual a number of forces which may be incompatible\\". He rationalised the \\"hatred and abhorrence ... for the Jewish practice of living in other nations instead of forming an independent self-sustained group of their own\\", referring to them as \\"intruders\\" with a \\"crafty spirit of calculation\\". He recommended a rigid division of races, referring to those suggesting that individuals be judged on their merits, irrespective of racial background, as \\"race-slumpers\\". He wrote that in the past, \\"the backward branches of the tree of mankind\\" had been lopped off as \\"the American Indians, the Black Australians, the Mauris and the negroes had been driven by bloodshed from their lands\\", unaware of \\"the biological rationality of that destiny\\". He advocated what he saw as a more enlightened solution: by birth control, by sterilization, and by \\"life in adapted reserves and asylums\\", where the \\"races which have served their turn [should] be brought to euthanasia.\\" Franz Boas, regarded as the father of anthropology in the US, had a lasting influence on the work of Otto Klineberg and his generation He considered blacks to be naturally inferior, on account of \\"their small skull capacity\\". In 1937, he praised the Third Reich for their eugenic laws and for \\"being the first to adopt sterilization together with a policy of racial improvement\\". In 1938, after newspapers had reported on the segregation of Jews into ghettos and concentration camps, he commented that the rise of Germany \\"should be welcomed by the religious man as reassuring evidence that in spite of modern wealth and ease, we shall not be allowed ... to adopt foolish social practices in fatal detachment from the stream of evolution\\". In late 1937, Cattell moved to the US on the invitation of the psychologist Edward Thorndike of Columbia University, also involved in eugenics. He spent the rest of his life there as a research psychologist, devoting himself after retirement to devising and publicising a refined version of his ideology from the 1930s that he called beyondism. In 1935, Otto Klineberg wrote two books, Negro Intelligence and Selective Migration and Race Differences, dismissing claims that African Americans in the northern states were more intelligent than those in the south. He argued that there was no scientific proof of racial differences in intelligence and that this should not therefore be used as a justification for policies in education or employment. The hereditarian view began to change in the 1920s in reaction to excessive eugenicist claims regarding abilities and moral character, and also due to the development of convincing environmental arguments.A history of Modern Psychology in Context, Wade E. Pickren and Alexandra Rutherford, Wiley, 2010, page 163 In the 1940s many psychologists, particularly social psychologists, began to argue that environmental and cultural factors, as well as discrimination and prejudice, provided a more probable explanation of disparities in intelligence. According to Franz Samelson, this change in attitude had become widespread by then, with very few studies in race differences in intelligence, a change brought out by an increase in the number of psychologists not from a \\"lily-white ... Anglo- Saxon\\" background but from Jewish backgrounds. Other factors that influenced American psychologists were the economic changes brought about by the depression and the reluctance of psychologists to risk being associated with the Nazi claims of a master race. The 1950 race statement of UNESCO, prepared in consultation with scientists including Klineberg, created a further taboo against conducting scientific research on issues related to race. Adolf Hitler banned IQ testing for being \\"Jewish\\" as did Joseph Stalin for being \\"bourgeois\\".The structure & measurement of intelligence, Hans Jürgen Eysenck and David W. Fulker, Transaction Publishers, 1979, page 16. 1960–1980 William Shockley, the Nobel laureate in physics, suggested that the decline in the average IQ in the US could be solved by eugenics In 1965 William Shockley, Nobel laureate in physics and professor at Stanford University, made a public statement at the Nobel conference on \\"Genetics and the Future of Man\\" about the problems of \\"genetic deterioration\\" in humans caused by \\"evolution in reverse\\". He claimed social support systems designed to help the disadvantaged had a regressive effect. Shockley subsequently claimed the most competent American population group were the descendants of original European settlers, because of the extreme selective pressures imposed by the harsh conditions of early colonialism. Speaking of the \\"genetic enslavement\\" of African Americans, owing to an abnormally high birth rate, Shockley discouraged improved education as a remedy, suggesting instead sterilization and birth control. In the following ten years he continued to argue in favor of this position, claiming it was not based on prejudice but \\"on sound statistics\\". Shockley's outspoken public statements and lobbying brought him into contact with those running the Pioneer Fund who subsequently, through the intermediary Carleton Putnam, provided financial support for his extensive lobbying activities in this area, reported widely in the press. With the psychologist and segregationist R. Travis Osborne as adviser, he formed the Foundation for Research and Education on Eugenics and Dysgenics (FREED). Although its stated purpose was \\"solely for scientific and educational purposes related to human population and quality problems\\", FREED mostly acted as a lobbying agency for spreading Shockley's ideas on eugenics. Wickliffe Draper, founder of the Pioneer Fund The Pioneer Fund had been set up by Wickliffe Draper in 1937 with one of its two charitable purposes being to provide aid for \\"study and research into the problems of heredity and eugenics in the human race\\" and \\"into the problems of race betterment with special reference to the people of the United States\\". From the late fifties onwards, following the 1954 Supreme Court decision on segregation in schools, it supported psychologists and other scientists in favour of segregation. All of these ultimately held academic positions in the Southern states, notably Henry E. Garrett (head of psychology at Columbia University until 1955), Wesley Critz George, Frank C.J. McGurk, R. Travis Osborne and Audrey Shuey, who in 1958 wrote The Testing of Negro Intelligence, demonstrating \\"the presence of native differences between Negroes and whites as determined by intelligence tests\\". The official history of the Pioneer Fund written by a board member. In 1959 Garrett helped to found the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics, an organisation promoting segregation. In 1961 he blamed the shift away from hereditarianism, which he described as the \\"scientific hoax of the century\\", on the school of thought –the \\"Boas cult\\" – promoted by his former colleagues at Columbia, notably Franz Boas and Otto Klineberg, and more generally \\"Jewish organizations\\", most of whom \\"belligerently support the egalitarian dogma which they accept as having been 'scientifically' proved\\". He also pointed to Marxist origins in this shift, writing in a pamphlet, Desegregation: Fact and hokum, that: \\"It is certain that the Communists have aided in the acceptance and spread of egalitarianism although the extent and method of their help is difficult to assess. Egalitarianism is good Marxist doctrine, not likely to change with gyrations in the Kremlin line.\\" In 1951 Garrett had even gone as far as reporting Klineberg to the FBI for advocating \\"many Communistic theories\\", including the idea that \\"there are no differences in the races of mankind\\". One of Shockley's lobbying campaigns involved the educational psychologist, Arthur Jensen, of the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Although earlier in his career Jensen had favored environmental rather than genetic factors as the explanation of race differences in intelligence, he had changed his mind during 1966-1967 when he was at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford. Here Jensen met Shockley and through him received support for his research from the Pioneer Fund. Although Shockley and Jensen's names were later to become linked in the media, Jensen does not mention Shockley as an important influence on his thought in his subsequent writings;Roger Pearson's 1992 book \\"Shockley on Race and Eugenics\\" contains a foreword by Jensen, giving a lengthy assessment of ShockleyIn , Jensen is reported as saying that Shockley's main contribution was to distract opponents and that \\"I have always been amazed that someone as bright as he could have contributed so little over so long a span of time\\". rather he describes as decisive his work with Hans Eysenck. He also mentions his interest in the behaviorist theories of Clark L. Hull which he says he abandoned largely because he found them to be incompatible with experimental findings during his years at Berkeley. Arthur Jensen, professor of educational psychology at UC Berkeley who wrote the 1969 article on intelligence that became one of the most controversial articles in the history of psychology In a 1968 article published in Disadvantaged Child, Jensen questioned the effectiveness of child development and antipoverty programs, writing: \\"As a social policy, avoidance of the issue could be harmful to everyone in the long run, especially to future generations of Negroes, who could suffer the most from well-meaning but misguided and ineffective attempts to improve their lot.\\"See: * * * * In 1969 Jensen wrote a long article in the Harvard Educational Review, \\"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?\\" In October 1967 Arthur Jensen gave an invited address with the same title as his article at the annual meeting of the California Advisory Council of Educational Research in San Diego In his article, 123 pages long, Jensen insisted on the accuracy and lack of bias in intelligence tests, stating that the absolute quantity g that they measured, the general intelligence factor, first introduced by the English psychologist Charles Spearman in 1904, \\"stood like a Rock of Gibraltar in psychometrics\\". He stressed the importance of biological considerations in intelligence, commenting that \\"the belief in the almost infinite plasticity of intellect, the ostrich-like denial of biological factors in individual differences, and the slighting of the role of genetics in the study of intelligence can only hinder investigation and understanding of the conditions, processes, and limits through which the social environment influences human behavior.\\" He argued at length that, contrary to environmentalist orthodoxy, intelligence was partly dependent on the same genetic factors that influence other physical attributes. More controversially, he briefly speculated that the difference in performance at school between blacks and whites might have a partly genetic explanation, commenting that there were \\"various lines of evidence, no one of which is definitive alone, but which, viewed all together, make it a not unreasonable hypothesis that genetic factors are strongly implicated in the average Negro- white intelligence difference. The preponderance of the evidence is, in my opinion, less consistent with a strictly environmental hypothesis than with a genetic hypothesis, which, of course, does not exclude the influence of environment or its interaction with genetic factors.\\" He advocated the allocation of educational resources according to merit and insisted on the close correlation between intelligence and occupational status, arguing that \\"in a society that values and rewards individual talent and merit, genetic factors inevitably take on considerable importance.\\" Concerned that the average IQ in the USA was inadequate to answer the increasing needs of an industrialised society, he predicted that people with lower IQs would become unemployable while at the same time there would be an insufficient number with higher IQs to fill professional posts. He felt that eugenic reform would prevent this more effectively than compensatory education, surmising that \\"the technique for raising intelligence per se in the sense of g, probably lie more in the province of biological science than in psychology or education\\". He pointed out that intelligence and family size were inversely correlated, particularly amongst the black population, so that the current trend in average national intelligence was dysgenic rather than eugenic. As he wrote, \\"Is there a danger that current welfare policies, unaided by eugenic foresight, could lead to the genetic enslavement of a substantial segment of our population? The fuller consequences of our failure seriously to study these questions may well be judged by future generations as our society's greatest injustice to Negro Americans.\\" He concluded by emphasizing the importance of child-centered education. Although a tradition had developed for the exclusive use of cognitive learning in schools, Jensen argued that it was not suited to \\"these children's genetic and cultural heritage\\": although capable of associative learning and memorization (\\"Level I\\" ability), they had difficulties with abstract conceptual reasoning (\\"Level II\\" ability). He felt that in these circumstances the success of education depended on exploiting \\"the actual potential learning that is latent in these children's patterns of abilities\\". He suggested that, in order to ensure equality of opportunity, \\"schools and society must provide a range and diversity of educational methods, programs and goals, and of occupational opportunities, just as wide as the range of human abilities.\\" Later, writing about how the article came into being, Jensen said that the editors of the Review had specifically asked him to include his view on the heritability of race differences, which he had not previously published. He also maintains that only five percent of the article touched on the topic of race difference in IQ. also gave a detailed account of how the student editors of Harvard Educational Review commissioned and negotiated the content of Jensen's article. Many academics have given commentaries on what they considered to be the main points of Jensen's article and the subsequent books in the early 1970s that expanded on its content. According to , in his article Jensen had argued \\"that educational programs for disadvantaged children initiated as the War on Poverty had failed, and the black-white race gap probably had a substantial genetic component.\\" They summarised Jensen's argument as follows: # \\"Most of the variation in black- white scores is genetic\\" # \\"No one has advanced a plausible environmental explanation for the black-white gap\\" # \\"Therefore it is more reasonable to assume that part of the black-white gap is genetic in origin\\" According to , Jensen's article defended 3 claims: # IQ tests provide accurate measurements of a real human ability that is relevant in many aspects of life. # Intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, is highly (about 80%) heritable and parents with low IQs are much more likely to have children with low IQs # Educational programs have been unable to significantly change the intelligence of individuals or groups. According to , the article claimed \\"a correlation between intelligence, measured by IQ tests, and racial genes\\". He wrote that Jensen, based on empirical evidence, had concluded that \\"black intelligence was congenitally inferior to that of whites\\"; that \\"this partly explains unequal educational achievements\\"; and that, \\"because a certain level of underachievement was due to the inferior genetic attributes of blacks, compensatory and enrichment programs are bound to be ineffective in closing the racial gap in educational achievements.\\" Several commentators mention Jensen's recommendations for schooling:See; * * * * * * according to Barry Nurcombe,, Chapter 2, The Great Debate Jensen had already suggested in the article that initiatives like the Head Start Program were ineffective, writing in the opening sentence, \\"Compensatory education has been tried and it apparently has failed.\\"See: * * * Other experts in psychometrics, such as and , have given accounts of Jensen's theory of Level I and Level II abilities, which originated in this and earlier articles. As the historian of psychology William H. Tucker commented, Jensen's question is leading: \\"Is there a danger that current welfare policies, unaided by eugenic foresight, could lead to the genetic enslavement of a substantial segment of our population? The fuller consequences of our failure seriously to study these questions may well be judged by future generations as our society's greatest injustice to Negro Americans\\". Tucker noted that it repeats Shockley's phrase \\"genetic enslavement\\", which proved later to be one of the most inflammatory statements in the article. thumb180pxleftRaymond Cattell, one of Jensen's main supporters who referred to his opponents as \\"ignoracists\\"See: * * Shockley conducted a widespread publicity campaign for Jensen's article, supported by the Pioneer Fund. Jensen's views became widely known in many spheres. As a result, there was renewed academic interest in the hereditarian viewpoint and in intelligence tests. Jensen's original article was widely circulated and often cited; the material was taught in university courses over a range of academic disciplines. In response to his critics, Jensen wrote a series of books on all aspects of psychometrics. There was also a widespread positive response from the popular press — with The New York Times Magazine dubbing the topic \\"Jensenism\\" — and amongst politicians and policy makers. In 1971 Richard Herrnstein wrote a long article on intelligence tests in The Atlantic for a general readership. Undecided on the issues of race and intelligence, he discussed instead score differences between social classes. Like Jensen he took a firmly hereditarian point of view. He also commented that the policy of equal opportunity would result in making social classes more rigid, separated by biological differences, resulting in a downward trend in average intelligence that would conflict with the growing needs of a technological society. Hans Eysenck, professor of psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry and Jensen's mentor Jensen and Herrnstein's articles were widely discussed. Hans Eysenck defended the hereditarian point of view and the use of intelligence tests in \\"Race, Intelligence and Education\\" (1971), a pamphlet presenting Jensenism to a popular audience, and \\"The Inequality of Man\\" (1973). He was severely critical of anti-hereditarians whose policies he blamed for many of the problems in society. In the first book he wrote that, \\"All the evidence to date suggests the strong and indeed overwhelming importance of genetic factors in producing the great variety of intellectual differences which [are] observed between certain racial groups\\", adding in the second, that \\"for anyone wishing to perpetuate class or caste differences, genetics is the real foe\\". \\"Race, Intelligence and Education\\" was immediately criticized in strong terms by IQ researcher Sandra Scarr as an \\"uncritical popularization of Jensen's ideas without the nuances and qualifiers that make much of Jensen's writing credible or at least responsible.\\"; article previously published in Science, 1971, 174, 1223–1228. Although the main intention of the hereditarians had been to challenge the anti-hereditarian establishment, they were unprepared for the level of reaction and censure in the scientific world. Militant student groups at Berkeley and Harvard conducted campaigns of harassment on Jensen and Herrnstein with charges of racism, despite Herrnstein's refusal to endorse Jensen's views on race and intelligence. Two weeks after the appearance of Jensen's article, the Berkeley chapter of the student organization Students for a Democratic Society staged protests against Arthur Jensen on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, chanting \\"Fight racism. Fire Jensen!\\" Jensen himself states that he even lost his employment at Berkeley because of the controversy. Similar campaigns were waged in London against Eysenck and in Boston against Edward Wilson, the founding father of sociobiology, the discipline that explains human behavior through genetics. The attacks on Wilson were orchestrated by the Sociobiology Study Group, part of the left wing organization Science for the People, formed of 35 scientists and students, including the Harvard biologists Stephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin, who both became prominent critics of hereditarian research in race and intelligence. Segerstråle gives a detailed account of the Sociobiology Study Group, founded in 1975. In 1972 50 academics, including the psychologists Jensen, Eysenck, and Herrnstein as well as five Nobel laureates, signed a statement entitled \\"Resolution on Scientific Freedom Regarding Human Behavior and Heredity\\", criticizing the climate of \\"suppression, punishment and defamation of scientists who emphasized the role of heredity in human behavior\\". In October 1973 a half-page advertisement entitled \\"Resolution Against Racism\\" appeared in The New York Times. With over 1000 academic signatories, including Lewontin, it condemned \\"racist research\\", denouncing in particular Jensen, Shockley and Herrnstein. This was accompanied by a high level of commentaries, criticisms and denouncements from the academic community. Two issues of the Harvard Educational Review were devoted to critiques of Jensen's work by psychologists, biologists and educationalists. As documented by , the main commentaries involved: population genetics (Richard Lewontin, Luigi Cavalli-Sforza, Walter Bodmer); the heritability of intelligence (Christopher Jencks, Mary Jo Bane, Leon Kamin, David Layzer); the possible inaccuracy of IQ tests as measures of intelligence (summarised in ); and sociological assumptions about the relationship between intelligence and income (Jencks and Bane). More specifically, the Harvard biologist Richard Lewontin commented on Jensen's use of population genetics, writing that, \\"The fundamental error of Jensen's argument is to confuse heritability of character within a population with heritability between two populations.\\"See: * * Jensen denied making such a claim, saying that his argument was that high within-group heritability increased the probability of non-zero between-group heritability. The political scientists Christopher Jencks and Mary Jo Bane, also from Harvard, recalculated the heritability of intelligence as 45% instead of Jensen's estimate of 80%; and they determined that only about 12% of variation in income was due to IQ, so that in their view the connections between IQ and occupation were less clear than Jensen had suggested.See: * * , \\"Five Myths About Your IQ\\" Ideological differences also emerged in the controversy. The circle of scientists around Lewontin and Gould, some of them self-admittedly motivated by a Marxist ideology, rejected the research of Jensen and Herrnstein as \\"bad science\\". While not objecting to research into intelligence per se, they felt that this research was politically motivated and objected to the reification of intelligence: the treatment of the numerical quantity g as a physical attribute like skin colour that could be meaningfully averaged over a population group. They claimed that this was contrary to the scientific method, which required explanations at a molecular level, rather than the analysis of a statistical artifact in terms of undiscovered processes in biology or genetics. In response to this criticism, Jensen later wrote: \\"... what Gould has mistaken for 'reification' is neither more nor less than the common practice in every science of hypothesizing explanatory models to account for the observed relationships within a given domain. Well known examples include the heliocentric theory of planetary motion, the Bohr atom, the electromagnetic field, the kinetic theory of gases, gravitation, quarks, Mendelian genes, mass, velocity, etc. None of these constructs exists as a palpable entity occupying physical space.\\" He asked why psychology should be denied \\"the common right of every science to the use of hypothetical constructs or any theoretical speculation concerning causal explanations of its observable phenomena\\". Cyril Burt, the English educationalist whose disputed twin studies had been used as data by Jensen in some of his early articles and books The academic debate also became entangled with the so-called \\"Burt Affair\\", because Jensen's article had partially relied on the 1966 twin studies of the British educational psychologist Sir Cyril Burt: shortly after Burt's death in 1971, there were allegations, prompted by research of Leon Kamin, that Burt had fabricated parts of his data, charges which have never been fully resolved.See: * * * * * Franz Samelson documents how Jensen's views on Burt's work varied over the years: Jensen was Burt's main defender in the USA during the 1970s.See: * * * In 1983, following the publication in 1978 of Leslie Hearnshaw's official biography of Burt, Jensen changed his mind, \\"fully accept[ing] as valid ... Hearnshaw's biography\\" and stating that \\"of course [Burt] will never be exonerated for his empirical deceptions\\". However, in 1992, he wrote that \\"the essence of the Burt affair ... [was] a cabal of motivated opponents, avidly aided by the mass media, to bash [Burt's] reputation completely\\", a view repeated in an invited address on Burt before the American Psychological Association, when he called into question Hearnshaw's scholarship. Trofim Lysenko who, as director of Soviet research in biology under Joseph Stalin, blocked research into genetics for ideological reasons Similar charges of a politically motivated campaign to stifle scientific research on racial differences, later dubbed \\"Neo-Lysenkoism\\", were frequently repeated by Jensen and his supporters.See: * * * * * * * bemoaned the fact that \\"a block has been raised because of the obvious implications for the understanding of racial differences in ability and achievement. Serious considerations of whether genetic as well as environmental factors are involved has been taboo in academic circles\\", adding that: \\"In the bizarre racist theories of the Nazis and the disastrous Lysenkoism of the Soviet Union under Stalin, we have seen clear examples of what happens when science is corrupted by subservience to political dogma.\\" After the appearance of his 1969 article, Jensen was later more explicit about racial differences in intelligence, stating in 1973 \\"that something between one-half and three-fourths of the average IQ differences between American Negroes and whites is attributable to genetic factors.\\" He even speculated that the underlying mechanism was a \\"biochemical connection between skin pigmentation and intelligence\\" linked to their joint development in the ectoderm of the embryo. Although Jensen avoided any personal involvement with segregationists in the US, he did not distance himself from the approaches of journals of the far right in Europe, many of whom viewed his research as justifying their political ends. In an interview with Nation Europa, he said that some human races differed from one another even more than some animal species, claiming that a measurement of \\"genetic distance\\" between blacks and whites showed that they had diverged over 46,000 years ago. He also granted interviews to Alain de Benoist's French journal Nouvelle École and Jürgen Rieger's German journal Neue Anthropologie of which he later became a regular contributor and editor, apparently unaware of its political orientation owing to his poor knowledge of German. The debate was further exacerbated by issues of racial bias that had already intensified through the 1960s because of civil rights concerns and changes in the social climate. In 1968 the Association of Black Psychologists (ABP) had demanded a moratorium on IQ tests for children from minority groups. After a committee set up by the American Psychological Association drew up guidelines for assessing minority groups, failing to confirm the claims of racial bias, wrote the following as part of a response on behalf of the ABP:See: * * * > Psychological testing historically has been a quasi-scientific tool in the > perpetuation of racism on all levels of scientific objectivity, it [testing] > has provided a cesspool of intrinsically and inferentially fallacious data > which inflates the egos of whites by demeaning Black people and threatens to > potentiate Black genocide. Other professional academic bodies reacted to the dispute differently. The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, a division of the American Psychological Society, issued a public statement in 1969 criticizing Jensen's research, declaring that, \\"To construct questions about complex behavior in terms of heredity versus environment is to oversimplify the essence and nature of human development and behavior.\\" The American Anthropological Association convened a panel discussion in 1969 at its annual general meeting, shortly after the appearance of Jensen's paper, where several participants labelled his research as \\"racist\\". Subsequently, the association issued an official clarification, stating that, \\"The shabby misuse of IQ testing in the support of past American racist policies has created understandable anxiety over current research on the inheritance of human intelligence. But the resulting personal attacks on a few scientists with unpopular views has had a chilling effect on the entire field of behavioral genetics and clouds public discussion of its implications.\\" In 1975 the Genetics Society of America made a similarly cautious statement: \\"The application of the techniques of quantitative genetics to the analysis of human behavior is fraught with human complications and potential biases, but well-designed research on the genetic and environmental components of human psychological traits may yield valid and socially useful results and should not be discouraged.\\" 1980–2000 Jim Flynn, the New Zealand political scientist who has studied changes in IQ scores In the 1980s, the political scientist Jim Flynn compared the results of groups who took both older and newer versions of specific IQ tests. His research led him to the discovery of what is now called the Flynn effect: a substantial increase in average IQ scores over the years across all groups tested. His discovery was confirmed later by many other studies. While trying to understand these remarkable test score increases, Flynn had postulated in 1987 that \\"IQ tests do not measure intelligence but rather a correlate with a weak causal link to intelligence\\". By 2009, however, Flynn felt that the IQ test score changes are real. He suggests that our fast-changing world has faced successive generations with new cognitive challenges that have considerably stimulated intellectual ability. \\"Our brains as presently constructed probably have much excess capacity ready to be used if needed. That was certainly the case in 1900.\\"Flynn, James R. (2009). What Is Intelligence? (p. 110). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. Flynn notes that \\"Our ancestors in 1900 were not mentally retarded. Their intelligence was anchored in everyday reality. We differ from them in that we can use abstractions and logic and the hypothetical to attack the formal problems that arise when science liberates thought from concrete situations. Since 1950, we have become more ingenious in going beyond previously learned rules to solve problems on the spot.\\"Flynn, James R. (2009). What Is Intelligence? (pp. 10-11). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. Richard Lynn, the English psychologist who has written extensively on global group differences in intelligence From the 1980s onwards, the Pioneer Fund continued to fund hereditarian research on race and intelligence, in particular the two English-born psychologists Richard Lynn of the University of Ulster and J. Philippe Rushton of the University of Western Ontario, its president since 2002. Rushton returned to the cranial measurements of the 19th century, using brain size as an extra factor determining intelligence; in collaboration with Jensen, he most recently developed updated arguments for the genetic explanation of race differences in intelligence. Lynn, longtime editor of and contributor to Mankind Quarterly and a prolific writer of books, has concentrated his research in race and intelligence on gathering and tabulating data about race differences in intelligence across the world. He has also made suggestions about its political implications, including the revival of older theories of eugenics, which he describes as \\"the truth that dares not speak its name\\".See: * * * * Current editorial board of Mankind Quarterly announced the results of a survey conducted in 1984 on a sample of over a thousand psychologists, sociologists and educationalists in a multiple choice questionnaire, and expanded in 1988 into the book The IQ Controversy, the Media, and Public Policy. The book claimed to document a liberal bias in the media coverage of scientific findings regarding IQ. The survey included the question, \\"Which of the following best characterizes your opinion of the heritability of black-white differences in IQ?\\" 661 researchers returned the questionnaire, and of these, 14% declined to answer the question, 24% voted that there was insufficient evidence to give an answer, 1% voted that the gap was purely \\"due entirely to genetic variation\\", 15% voted that it \\"due entirely due to environmental variation\\" and 45% voted that it was a \\"product of genetic and environmental variation\\". have pointed out that those who replied \\"both\\" did not have the opportunity to specify whether genetics played a large role. There has been no agreement amongst psychometricians on the significance of this particular answer.See: * * * * Scientists supporting the hereditarian point of view have seen it as a vindication of their position.See: * * * * * * In 1989 J. Philippe Rushton was placed under police investigation by the Attorney General of Ontario, after complaints that he had promoted racism in one of his publications on race differences. In the same year, Linda Gottfredson of the University of Delaware had an extended battle with her university over the legitimacy of grants from the Pioneer Fund, eventually settled in her favour. Both later responded with an updated version of Henry E. Garrett's \\"egalitarian dogma\\", labelling the claim that all races were equal in cognitive ability as an \\"egalitarian fiction\\" and a \\"scientific hoax\\". spoke of a \\"great fraud\\", a \\"collective falsehood\\" and a \\"scientific lie\\", citing the findings of Snyderman and Rothman as justification. wrote that there was a \\"taboo on race\\" in scientific research that had \\"no parallel ... not the Inquisition, not Stalin, not Hitler.\\"See: * * , footnote: \\"Rushton's (1994) notion of the 'equalitarian fiction' is that Blacks and Whites are genetically equal in cognitive ability. Gottfredson's (1994) notion of the 'egalitarian fiction' is that 'racial-ethnic groups never differ in average developed intelligence' (p. 53). I have never seen a scholarly source which maintained that groups never show mean differences in intelligence test scores. Gottfredson gives no reference for anyone who holds this position.\\" In his 1998 book \\"The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability\\", Jensen reiterated his earlier claims of Neo-Lysenkoism, writing that \\"The concept of human races [as] a fiction\\" has various \\"different sources, none of them scientific\\", one of them being \\"Neo-Marxist philosophy\\", which \\"excludes consideration of genetic or biological factors ... from any part in explaining behavioral differences amongst humans\\". In the same year, the evolutionary psychologist Kevin B. MacDonald went much further, reviving Garrett's claim of the \\"Boas cult\\" as a Jewish conspiracy, after which \\"research on racial differences ceased, and the profession completely excluded eugenicists like Madison Grant and Charles Davenport.\\"See: * * , The meaning of race * In 1994 the debate on race and intelligence was reignited by the publication of the book The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray. The book was received positively by the media, with prominent coverage in Newsweek, Time, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Although only two chapters of the book were devoted to race differences in intelligence, treated from the same hereditarian standpoint as Jensen's 1969 paper, it nevertheless caused a similar furore in the academic community to Jensen's article. Many critics, including Stephen J. Gould and Leon Kamin, asserted that the book contained unwarranted simplifications and flaws in its analysis; in particular there were criticisms of its reliance on Lynn's estimates of average IQ scores in South Africa, where data had been used selectively, and on Rushton's work on brain size and intelligence, which was controversial and disputed. These criticisms were subsequently presented in books, most notably The Bell Curve Debate (1995), Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth (1996) and an expanded edition of Gould's The Mismeasure of Man (1996).See: * * * , Chapter 3, \\"The Misuse of Life History Theory: J. P. Rushton and the Pseudoscience of Racial Hierarchy\\" by Joseph L. Graves * , Chapter 2, \\"Evolutionary Psychology\\", by James B. Grossman and James Kaufman In 1994 a group of 52 scientists, including Rushton, Lynn, Jensen and Eysenck, were cosignatories of an op-ed article in the Wall Street Journal written by Linda Gottfredson entitled \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\\". The article, supporting the conclusions of The Bell Curve, was later republished in an expanded version in the journal Intelligence. \\"More importantly differential psychologists have been unanimous in their support for The Bell Curve. In fact, in the year the book was published, 52 eminent intelligence experts (not only from differential psychology) published a dossier entitled 'Mainstream Science on Intelligence' in which they endorsed the core claims and data endorsed by Herrnstein and Murray.\\" \\"The Bell Curve sparked huge controversy in the 1990s with its claims that African Americans (and 'underclass whites') were genetically predisposed to lower intelligence and higher criminality. In 1994, as the controversy raged on, a group of 52 professors (including Rushton, Lynn, Eysenck and Jensen) presented themselves as 'experts in intelligence and allied fields' and signed a statement that was published in the Wall Street Journal under the title 'Mainstream science on intelligence'. Among the statements of supposedly 'mainstream' scientific opinion were the following: 'Genetics plays a bigger role than environment in creating IQ differences among individuals ... The bell curve for whites is centred roughly around IQ 100; the bell curve for American blacks roughly around 85 ... black 17-year olds perform, on the average, more like white 13-year olds in reading, math and science, with Hispanics in between.' These views are presented as if distilled from numerous 'scientific' studies and the tone is somewhat dry. But the meaning is clear. First, the authors are saying that intelligence is largely a matter of genetic inheritance. Second, they are saying that most whites are naturally more intelligent than most black people; in fact, that the 'average white' is more intelligent than 8 out of 10 African Americans!\\" The editorial included the statements: Another early criticism was that Herrnstein and Murray did not submit their work to academic peer review before publication.Arthur S. Goldberger and Charles F. Manski (1995) \\"Review Article: The Bell Curve by Herrnstein and Murray\\", Journal of Economic Literature, 36(2), June 1995, pp. 762–776. \\"HM and their publishers have done a disservice by circumventing peer review ....a process of scientific review is now under way. But, given the process to date, peer review of The Bell Curve is now an exercise in damage control ....\\" There were also three books written from the hereditarian point of view: Why race matters: race differences and what they mean (1997) by Michael Levin; The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability (1998) by Jensen; and Intelligence; a new look by Hans Eysenck. Various other books of collected contributions appeared at the same time, including The black-white test gap (1998) edited by Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips, Intelligence, heredity and environment (1997) edited by Robert Sternberg and Elena Grigorenko.Fish (2002) pp. 1–28 A section in IQ and human intelligence (1998) by Nicholas Mackintosh discussed ethnic groups and Race and intelligence: separating science from myth (2002) edited by Jefferson Fish presented further commentary on The Bell Curve by anthropologists, psychologists, sociologists, historians, biologists and statisticians.Sternberg, Grigorenko & Kidd (2005) Intelligence, Race and Genetics In 1999 the same journal Intelligence reprinted as an invited editorial a long article by the attorney Harry F. Weyher Jr. defending the integrity of the Pioneer Fund, of which he was then president and of which several editors, including Gottfredson, Jensen, Lynn and Rushton, were grantees. In 1994 the Pioneer-financed journal Mankind Quarterly, of which Roger Pearson was the manager and pseudonymous contributor, had been described by Charles Lane in a review of The Bell Curve in the New York Review of Books as \\"a notorious journal of 'racial history' founded, and funded, by men who believe in the genetic superiority of the white race\\"; he had called the fund and its journal \\"scientific racism's keepers of the flame.\\" Gottfredson had previously defended the fund in 1989-1990, asserting that Mankind Quarterly was a \\"multicultural journal\\" dedicated to \\"diversity ... as an object of dispassionate study\\" and that Pearson did not approve of membership of the American Nazi Party. had himself defended the fund in his book Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe.See: * In response to the debate on The Bell Curve, the American Psychological Association set up a ten-person taskforce, chaired by Ulrich Neisser, to report on the book and its findings. In its report, \\"Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns\\", published in February 1996, the committee made the following comments on race differences in intelligence:See: * * * * Jensen commented: Rushton found himself at the centre of another controversy in 1999 when unsolicited copies of a special abridged version of his 1995 book Race, Evolution and Behavior, aimed at a general readership, were mass mailed to psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists in North American universities. As a result, Transaction Publishers withdrew from publishing the pamphlet, financed by the Pioneer Fund, and issued an apology in the January 2000 edition of the journal Society. In the pamphlet Rushton recounted how black Africans had been seen by outside observers through the centuries as naked, insanitary, impoverished and unintelligent. In modern times he remarked that their average IQ of 70 \\"is the lowest ever recorded\\", due to smaller average brain size. He explained these differences in terms of evolutionary history: those that had migrated to colder climates in the north to evolve into whites and Asians had adapted genetically to have more self- control, lower levels of sex hormones, greater intelligence, more complex social structures, and more stable families. He concluded that whites and Asians are more disposed to \\"invest time and energy in their children rather than the pursuit of sexual thrills. They are 'dads' rather than 'cads.'\\" J. Philippe Rushton did not distance himself from groups on the far right in the US. He was a regular contributor to the newsletters of American Renaissance and spoke at many of their biennial conferences, in 2006 sharing the platform with Nick Griffin, leader of the British National Party.Psych prof accused of racism , UWO Gazette, February 2000 2000–present In 2002, Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen, published IQ and the Wealth of Nations.Lynn, R. and Vanhanen, T. (2002). IQ and the wealth of nations. Westport, CT: Praeger. Vanhanen claimed \\"Whereas the average IQ of Finns is 97, in Africa it is between 60 and 70. Differences in intelligence are the most significant factor in explaining poverty.\\" A complaint by Finland's \\"Ombudsman for Minorities\\", Mikko Puumalainen, resulted in Vanhanen being considered to be investigated for incitement of \\"racial hatred\\" by the Finnish National Bureau of Investigations.Comments in interview could bring charges of inciting racism against PM Vanhanen's father Helsingin Sanomat, August 12, 2004 In 2004, the police stated they found no reason to suspect he incited racial hatred and decided not to launch an investigation. Several negative reviews of the book have been published in the scholarly literature. Susan Barnett and Wendy Williams wrote that \\"we see an edifice built on layer upon layer of arbitrary assumptions and selective data manipulation. The data on which the entire book is based are of questionable validity and are used in ways that cannot be justified.\\" They also wrote that cross country comparisons are \\"virtually meaningless.\\" Richardson (2004) argued, citing the Flynn effect as the best evidence, that Lynn has the causal connection backwards and suggested that \\"the average IQ of a population is simply an index of the size of its middle class, both of which are results of industrial development\\". The review concludes that \\"This is not so much science, then, as a social crusade.\\" A review by Michael Palairet criticized the book's methodology, particularly the imprecise estimates of GDP and the fact that IQ data were only available for 81 of the 185 countries studied. However, the review concluded that the book was \\"a powerful challenge to economic historians and development economists who prefer not to use IQ as an analytical input\\", but that it's likely those scholars will deliberately ignore this work instead of improving it. In a meta-analysis of studies of IQ estimates in Sub-Saharan Africa, concluded that Lynn and Vanhanen had relied on unsystematic methodology by failing to publish their criteria for including or excluding studies. They found that Lynn and Vanhanen's exclusion of studies had depressed their IQ estimate for sub- Saharan Africa, and that including studies excluded in IQ and Global Inequality resulted in average IQ of 82 for sub-Saharan Africa, lower than the average in Western countries, but higher than Lynn and Vanhanen's estimate of 67. Wicherts at al. conclude that this difference is likely due to sub-Saharan Africa having limited access to modern advances in education, nutrition and health care. A 2010 systematic review by the same research team, along with Jerry S. Carlson, found that compared to American norms, the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans was about 80. The same review concluded that the Flynn effect had not yet taken hold in sub-Saharan Africa. A 2007 meta-analysis by Rindermann found many of the same groupings and correlations found by Lynn and Vanhanen, with the lowest scores in sub-Saharan Africa, and a correlation of .60 between cognitive skill and GDP per capita. considers Rindermann's analysis to be much more reliable than Lynn and Vanhanen's. By measuring the relationship between educational data and social well-being over time, this study also performed a causal analysis, finding that nations investing in education leads to increased well-being later on. Kamin (2006) has also criticized Lynn and Vanhanen's work on the IQs of sub-Saharan Africans. Wicherts, Borsboom, and Dolan (2010) argued that studies reporting support for evolutionary theories of intelligence based on national IQ data suffer from multiple fatal methodological flaws. For example, they state that such studies \\"... assume that the Flynn Effect is either nonexistent or invariant with respect to different regions of the world, that there have been no migrations and climatic changes over the course of evolution, and that there have been no trends over the last century in indicators of reproductive strategies (e.g., declines in fertility and infant mortality).\\" They also showed that a strong degree of confounding exists between national IQs and current national development status. Similarly, Pesta & Poznanski (2014) showed that the average temperature of a given U.S. state is strongly associated with that state's average IQ and other well-being variables, despite the fact that evolution has not had enough time to operate on non-Native American residents of the United States. They also noted that this association persisted even after controlling for race, and concluded that \\"Evolution is therefore not necessary for temperature and IQ/well-being to co-vary meaningfully across geographic space.\\" In 2007, James D. Watson, Nobel laureate in biology, gave a controversial interview to the Sunday Times Magazine during a book tour in the United Kingdom. Watson stated he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really.” He also wrote that “there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically. Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so.” This resulted in the cancellation of a Royal Society lecture, along with other public engagements, and his suspension from his administrative duties at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He subsequently cancelled the tour and resigned from his position at CSHL, where he had served as either director, president or chancellor since 1968. However, Watson was later appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL, and, as of 2009, he continued to advise and guide project work at the laboratory.See: * Hunt-Grubbe, C. \\"The elementary DNA of dear Dr. Watson\\", Times Online (London), October 14, 2007.

In 2005 the journal Psychology, Public Policy and Law of the American Psychological Association (APA) published a review article by Rushton and Jensen, \\"Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability\\". The article was followed by a series of responses, some in support, some critical. Richard Nisbett, another psychologist who had also commented at the time, later included an amplified version of his critique as part of the book Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count (2009). Rushton and Jensen in 2010 made a point-for-point reply to this and again summarized the hereditarian position in \\"Race and IQ: A theory-based review of the research in Richard Nisbett's Intelligence and How to Get It\\". In 2016, attempted to replicate the findings of by surveying 71 self-identified psychology experts on the causes of international differences in cognitive test scores; only 20% of those invited participated. They found that the experts surveyed ranked education as the most important factor of these differences, with genetics in second place (accounting on average for 15% of the gap, with high variability in estimates among experts) and health, wealth, geography, climate, and politics as the next most important factors. About 90% of experts in the survey believed there was a genetic component to international IQ gaps. The authors emphasized, however, that their study serves as an \\"opinion instrument\\" rather than \\"an indicator of truth.\\" Notably, the study relied on \\"self-selection of experts,\\" which the authors acknowledge as a limitation, and focused on self-identified experts in psychology rather than genetics. In 2018, in response to a resurgence of public controversy over race and intelligence, the geneticist and neuroscientist Kevin Mitchell made a statement in The Guardian that described the idea of genetic IQ differences between races as \\"inherently and deeply implausible\\" because it goes against basic principles of population genetics. There he argued, \\"To end up with systematic genetic differences in intelligence between large, ancient populations, the selective forces driving those differences would need to have been enormous. What’s more, those forces would have to have acted across entire continents, with wildly different environments, and have been persistent over tens of thousands of years of tremendous cultural change.\\" Mitchell concluded that, \\"While genetic variation may help to explain why one person is more intelligent than another, there are unlikely to be stable and systematic genetic differences that make one population more intelligent than the next.\\" See also * Race and intelligence * Human intelligence * Intelligence quotient * Heritability of IQ * Eugenics NotesReferences * * , Chapter 5, \\"Race and IQ: Arthur R.

McCarrison was born in Portadown, in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. He qualified in Medicine at Queen's College, Belfast in 1900. He joined the Indian Medical Service and was posted as Medical Officer to Indian troops guarding the mountainous Northern Frontiers. He was promoted to Captain in January 1904, to Major in July 1912, Lieutenant-Colonel in January 1918, (List heading: \\"To be Brevet Lieutenant- Colonerl\\" is on p.10) Colonel from 1929, and to Major-General in July 1933. He retired from the Indian Medical Service on 19 August 1935. McCarrison's research in India on the cause of goitre won widespread recognition and in 1913 he was promoted to do research. In 1928 he became Director of Nutritional Research in India, where he remained until his retirement from the Indian Medical Service in 1935, when he returned to England, settling at Oxford. Pioneer in nutrition research McCarrison carried out the very first experiments to demonstrate the effect of nutrition on the epidemiology of disease. McCarrison is credited with being the first to experimentally demonstrate the effect of deficient dietaries upon animal tissues and organs. He also carried out human experiments aimed at identifying the cause of goitre, and included himself as one of the experimental subjects. Much of McCarrison's work was pioneering. His 1921 book Studies in Deficiency Disease was considered notable at the time, being published at a time when knowledge of vitamins and their role in nutrition was crystallizing. McCarrison himself noted that prior to publication of his studies on the pathogenesis of deficiency disease \\"no systemic post-mortem examination of animals fed on food deficient in vitamin B had ever been made; the histopathological effects of such food on the various systems of the body were wholly unknown; above all, its effects on the gastro-intestinal tract and the organs of digestion and assimilation, and the significance of these effects for clinical medicine, were wholly unsuspected\\". At age 23, McCarrison went to India, where he spent 30 years on nutritional problems.. Retrieved 12 August 2010 He attained the rank of major-general in the Indian Medical Service, and founded the Nutritional Research Laboratories in Coonoor. After retiring from the Indian Medical Service in 1935, he gave a series of Cantor lectures at the Royal Society of Arts, about the influence of diet on health. This comprised three lectures delivered on successive Mondays at the Society. The first lecture focused on the processes of nutrition; the second, on food essentials and their relationship to bodily structure and function; the third on disease prevention and physique improvement by attention to diet. The lectures were subsequently published in book form under the title Nutrition and Health, and at the time of the third edition in 1962, were still not seen as \\"dated\\", with the advances of the preceding 25 years largely filling the details of the principles previously recognised by McCarrison. \\"McCarrison's work on goitre, cretinism, and thyroid, begun in the western Himalayas in 1902, generated scores of scientific publications during the following thirty-five years\\", While McCarrison's work is often considered the start of serious studies of goitre and cretinism in South Asia, it was preceded by that of Commissioner David Scott at Rangur in north-east India around 1825, and was investigated by Mountford Bramley at Kathmandu in 1832. In 1918, McCarrison founded the Beri- Beri Enquiry Unit in a single room laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in Conoor, India. He was invalided to Britain from 1920–1922, and in 1923 the enquiry was axed on financial grounds. It was restored two years later as the Deficiency Disease Inquiry, which McCarrison headed from 1925-1929. Around 1928-29, this developed further into the Nutrition Research Laboratories (NRL. Renamed the National Institute of Nutrition in 1969), with McCarrison as its first Director, until his retirement in 1935. In 1926, as head of the Deficiency Diseases Inquiry, McCarrison submitted written and oral evidence on malnutrition to the Royal Commission on Agriculture in India. (Full text at Internet Archive The primary objective of McCarrison's submission was to indicate the significance of malnutrition \\"as a cause of physical inefficiency and ill-health among the massess in India\\"; the relationship between nutrition and agriculture; and \\"the necessity for closer co-ordination of nutritional, medical, veterinary and agricultural research\\" in India.McCarrison, Lieut.-Colonel R (1928), p.95 McCarrison's submission had impact. \\"A decade later, when the Commission's chairman, Lord Linlithgow, became Viceroy of India he showed a personal interest in nutrition, pushing it to the top of the research agenda. In 1936 a Nutrition Advisory Committee was established and roughly a tenth of IRFA's annual grants went to fund nutrition research at Coonoor and Calcutta\\". Retirement from India After the Second World War, from 1945 to 1955, McCarrison served as director of postgraduate medical education at Oxford University. Personal life In 1906 he married Helen Stella Johnston, to whom he was still married at the time of his death. Legacy * The National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad, India, continues to pay tribute to is origins in 1928 under McCarrison. * McCarrison is grouped, along with Sir Albert Howard and Richard St. Barbe Baker, as one of three progenitors of the organic agriculture movement. McCarrison Society In 1966, a group of doctors, dentists and veterinarians, interested in the promotion of nutrition and health, founded the McCarrison Society in honour of his efforts, with a Scottish group established in 1981 due to both travel logistics and differing needs in the Scottish population. The Society aims \\"to assemble scientific knowledge on nutrition and health that is free from economic and political pressures with the object of securing the physical and mental health of future generations\\". The Society meetings sometimes raise questions with elusive answers, with speakers presenting material based on scanty, often anectdotal data, inviting criticism that it is \\"a gathering of cranks\\". However, \\"one answer to that criticism is that speakers at MCarrison meetings tend to be rather well qualified. But the main point is that the society has a way of asking questions about the environment - what are we doing to it and what it is doing to us - that are of profound importance\\".. The journal \\"Nutrition and Health\\" is the official journal of the McCarrison Society and is listed in PUBMED. The journal was started by members in 1978 with the objective of publishing peer reviewed scientific work and reviews on nutrition and health from academic research workers who were independent of the food and agricultural industries or those with a conflict of interest. The Society's website summarises McCarrison's work thus: > His researches were extensive; they included work on the newly discovered > vitamins and on the contrasting disease patterns in the Indian subcontinent. > He demonstrated how many common diseases increasingly prevalent in > industrial societies were caused simply by diets made defective by extensive > food processing, often with the use of chemical additives. He deplored the > universal consumption in Britain and America of refined white flour, instead > of halite flour, and the substitution of canned, preserved and artificially > sweetened products for fresh natural food. > McCarrison's work was widely published in the medical press. He was > honoured for his discoveries, but completely ignored by government and the > medical profession at a time when medical thought was absorbed in the study > of disease rather than on prevention and the promotion of health.

It was built near the village of Uxegney between 1882 and 1884, and was modernized in 1910. It is an example of a Séré de Rivières system fortification. It retains its armament and is maintained as a museum. Located northwest of Épinal, the Fort d'Uxegney is part of a line of sixteen major fortifications designed to bar the advance of a German army into France. It retains a functioning example of an eclipsing Galopin turret. Armed with a 155mm gun, the assembly weighs 250 tons and was installed in 1907. A considerable amount of the fort's equipment remains in place, including kitchens, living facilities and details of armament, in an unusually good state of preservation.  Description  The fort was situated at an altitude of 379 meters above the valley of the Avière with the mission of controlling the Épinal-Mirecourt axis, the Épinal-Nancy railway and the Canal de l'Est. The fort was laid out in a pentagon, surrounded by a ditch. Construction took only two years (1882–1884). The fort includes fortified barracks, storage facilities and magazines, and shelters for troops. The stone buildings of variegated cut stone were built in the open, then covered with earth from the excavation of the ditch and the leveling of the natural terrain. The initial garrison comprised 287 men, and the construction cost of the original fort amounted to about 1.7 million francs.. The principal armament consisted of five 155mm and five 120mm de Bange or Lahotolle guns on the three forward- facing walls of the fort, in the open air on platforms. The first improvements came in 1892, when the fort's entry, powder magazine, a cistern, an infantry shelter and a number of other spaces were covered with concrete. From 1900 a series of spiral queue de cochon (pig tail-shaped) infantry shelters were placed on and around the fort. The second major phase of work, executed from 1910, completely transformed the fort. A retractable or \\"eclipsing\\" turret was installed, mounting a 155mm gun. Another turret mounted two 75mm guns with shortened barrels, and two more turret mounted machine guns. Two casemates de Bourges mounted two 75mm guns in each casemate to cover the intervals between the forts to either side of Uxegney, while armored observation points were created with steel cupolas or cloches. Further concrete reinforcement was placed, while subterranean passages linked all sections of the fort. The defenses were improved with the addition of counterscarp positions in the outer walls of the ditch. A small central electrical plant was installed as well. The cost of these renovations came to 1.2 million francs. The renovated fort's garrison comprised 15 officers, 36 non-commissioned officers and 416 enlisted men. In 1914 a further project to add two 155mm gun turrets in a separate armored battery was proposed, but was canceled by the outbreak of war.  History  The Fort d'Uxegney saw no action during World War I, as the Germans did not advance into the area around Épinal. Between World War I and World War II the fort remained military property and was kept under maintenance. Along with the neighboring Fort de Bois l'Abbé, Fort d'Uxegney was used as an ammunition depot.. During World War II the Germans left Uxegney intact even as they stripped other forts around Épinal. The French army used both forts as ammunition depots until 1960. They were afterwards abandoned.  Present status Since 1989 the Association pour la Restauration du Fort d'Uxegney et de la Place d'Épinal (ARFUPE) has restored and maintained the Uxegney site. The fort may be visited between May and September. The Fort de Bois l'Abbé was used after 1960 by private tenants, but was restored by ARFUPE beginning in 1995. It may be visited on special occasions.
