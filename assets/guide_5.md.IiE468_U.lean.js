Thomas, City Ballet Soloist and Teacher, Dies at 87,\\", The New York Times August 4, 2013; retrieved August 4, 2013. He is known as a teacher of Eliot Feld and Twyla Tharp. Early life Thomas was born on December 3, 1925, in Paintsville, Kentucky, his father a coal miner and his mother a nurse. At the encouragement of his father, Thomas enrolled one semester at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, intending to pursue an engineering degree. Dancing career =As a performer= Following his first exposure to a performance by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo ‚Äì while visiting relatives in Seattle, Washington ‚Äì he entered the tutelage of Russian ballet dancer and choreographer Bronislava Nijinska in Los Angeles, and Vincenzo Celli and Anatole Vilzak in New York. Thomas subsequently appeared on Broadway in Kiss Me Kate and Billion Dollar Baby. During his early career with the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo and Ballet Theatre, Thomas met fellow dancer Barbara Fallis, whom he married in Cuba in 1950 while both were on tour with the Company Alicia Alonso (later the National Ballet of Cuba). Their son ‚Äì future Emmy-winning actor and The Waltons star Richard Thomas ‚Äì was born a year later. Thomas's first teaching experience also occurred there, when Fernando Alonso attempted to develop a school by selecting pupils from a local orphanage and asked Thomas to assist. The Thomases returned to Manhattan to dance with the New York City Ballet from 1953 to 1958. During this time Thomas was a frequent soloist and member of the premiere casts of Todd Bolender's Souvenirs, Balanchine's Jeux, and Jerome Robbins's The Concert (or The Perils of Everybody). Thomas left the New York City Ballet in 1958 to join the circus but soon returned to the city to indulge his overriding desire to teach. =As a teacher= Thomas, who was known by his friends and pupils as \\"Dick\\" or \\"Dicky,\\" first joined Harry Asmus at a school on Broadway and 54th Street, chiefly working with students from the High School of the Performing Arts. He later was employed at the schools of June Taylor and Robert Joffrey, whose company he escorted to Russia. In 1963 he abandoned a position at American Ballet Theatre to open what would become the New York School of Ballet on West 56th Street, with his wife. Thomas and Fallis alternated shifts at the Pennsylvania Ballet in Philadelphia to fund their fledgling school, out of which Eliot Feld founded the American Ballet Company. In 1969 George Balanchine and Lincoln Kerstein offered the couple the former studios of the School of American Ballet, at 2291 Broadway between 82nd and 83rd Street. Thomas taught well-established and up-and-coming students in his daily classes, including Cynthia Gregory, Debbie Allen, Christine Sarry, Twyla Tharp, Sean Lavery, and Feld. In 1975 following Feld's departure, the couple formed U.S. Terpsichore, as a touring showcase of the most advanced New York School of Ballet students. Daniel Levans (b. 1953) served as co-artistic director and choreographer of the troupe, composed of approximately 25 to 40 members, mostly teenagers ‚Äì including Thomas's and Fallis's children Richard Thomas and Bronwyn Thomas (b. 1960). Their repertory of over 30 ballets included both the classic and the contemporary, such as the work of Merce Cunningham and Levans. Thomas was one of the first ballet directors to arrange performances for schools. The troupe originally appeared in New York City and Kentucky venues, until a 1976‚Äì1977 series of nationwide performances contracted with Columbia Artists Management, inc., who insisted the ten-member troupe appear under the title of \\"Richard Thomas Theatre Ballet\\"; this led to further extensive traveling through the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The revenue from sold-out houses helped fund the school. In 1984 he raised $370,000 to organize and host the First International Ballet Competition with co-founder Ilona Copen; the competition ‚Äì which unconventionally required all participants to perform the same four pas de deux rather than their own selected dances ‚Äì still continues to this day. After Fallis's death in 1980, Thomas directed the troupe and operated the School until its forced closure in 1985. He continued to teach, chiefly children, commencing work in 1990 at Feld's Ballet Tech School, which educated minority students at New York City public schools. Thomas eventually retired to a farm in Kentucky, where he committed to an already established second career in dog breeding and showing until his death from a stroke on July 27, 2013.

Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Alaska was won by Richard Nixon (R-California) with 45.3 percent of the popular vote against incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey (D-Minnesota) with 42.6 percent. Nixon ultimately won the national vote as well, defeating Humphrey and becoming the next President. Former Governor George Wallace (D-Alabama) ran under the far-right American Independent Party ticket, which favored continuing racial segregation within public schools in addition to most other areas of society throughout the Southern United States. Although unsuccessful, Wallace‚Äôs third party campaign was one of the strongest in the 20th century, rivaling the performance of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, Robert M. La Follette in 1924 and Ross Perot in 1992. Alaska has only voted Democratic once, and that was in the previous 1964 election for incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, who did not run for re- election; nonetheless, during the state‚Äôs first four presidential elections Alaska was little or no more Republican than the nation at-large.Counting the Votes; Alaska Nixon‚Äôs 45.28 percent stood 1.86 percent above his national figure and Humphrey‚Äôs 42.65 percent a trifling 0.07 percent below his national total. As usual, the Democrats were strongest in the Bering Sea coastal regions: Humphrey obtained a majority of the vote in Bethel Census Area, North Slope Borough, Northwest Arctic Borough and a plurality in Nome Census Area.Popular vote at 1968 presidential election Defections to Wallace may have permitted Humphrey to win a plurality in Kenai Peninsula Borough, which as of 2017 remain the last time a Democrat has carried this borough; Humphrey also carried Sitka City and Borough and Yakutat City and Borough, which would subsequently vote Democratic only in 1992, 2012 and (Sitka only) in 2016. Nixon won the remainder of Alaska; however he obtained an absolute majority only in the southern boroughs and census areas of Wrangell and Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan. Despite Alaska lying at the opposite end of the country from Wallace‚Äôs support base in the Deep South, he did not fare badly in the relatively heavily populated areas of Anchorage, the Kenai Peninsula and the Susitna Valley: indeed in Kenai Peninsula Borough Wallace received over twenty percent of the vote.Popular vote at 1968 presidential election: Percent for George C.

Biography His family had hoped he had chosen a career as a doctor, and for that purpose he was sent to Rome with his paternal uncle for an education. In Rome, he enrolled in philosophy and mathematics at the school of the Apollinare. But he soon gravitated to painting, and worked in the studio of Tommaso Minardi for about six years.

He was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the Nationalist Party from 9 Jun 1934 until 13 December 1941. He was an alderman of the City of Launceston, and Mayor of the city in 1933‚Äì1934, 1946 and 1950. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of William Hollingsworth and his second wife, Amelia Airey. William, Amelia and their family of eight children (four daughters from William's first marriage, and one son and three daughters of their own) had left Launceston in January 1893 to join the New Australia colony in Paraguay. They sailed from Sydney on the Royal Tar, with the first group of colonists. The New Australia Colony was formally founded in Paraguay on 28 September 1893. Following the development of problems within the group of colonists, William and family left New Australia for Argentina, where he found work on the railways. Son Allen William was born in Buenos Aires on 17 October 1894, and was subsequently baptised there in the Presbyterian Church (William had been an active member of the Congregational Church in Launceston). The family was in very difficult circumstances, and funds were raised in Launceston to pay for their return. They travelled on the ship Mitredale to Newcastle, New South Wales, arriving there on 11 May 1895, and at Launceston on 27 May 1895. Allen was then aged 7 months. William resumed his trade as a blacksmith, and two more daughters were born. But both he and Amelia died young, he in 1902 and she in 1903. They left a family of six children aged 15 and under (the daughters of William's first marriage were all adults by then). Allen was only eight. The extended Airey and Hollingsworth families supported and helped raise the children. The Aireys belonged to the Methodist Church, and Allen and his sisters attended Sunday School. When he reached 14 years, Allen was apprenticed as a French polisher, a trade he followed all his working life. When war broke out in 1914, he enlisted in the AIF on 8 January 1915, and was posted to the 15th Battalion. He was with the 15th when they landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, and served there throughout the campaign. After the evacuation from Gallipoli, he was transferred to the 4th Division Signals, in which he served for the rest of the war. He reached the rank of Lance-Corporal. In 1918, he was selected for early return to Australia, and arrived home on the Burmah on 19 January 1919. He resumed his trade as a French polisher in Launceston. On 29 June 1921, at West Pine, near Penguin on the North West Coast of Tasmania, he married Elizabeth Owens, the sister of one of his fellow soldiers, who had been killed at Gallipoli. The couple lived in Launceston, in Invermay, first at 11 Waugh St, and then from the 1930s in a beautiful Federation house in Mayne St, demolished when the Northern Outlet was constructed. In the 1920s, they had two sons, Owen and Leslie John, and a daughter, Margaret, who did not survive infancy. They were active in the Invermay Methodist Church, with Allen teaching Sunday School there. His sister Millie did the same at the Margaret St Methodist Church. In 1928, he stood for election as an alderman on the Launceston City Council, advertising his role as \\"the only returned soldier candidate\\". He narrowly missed election, coming in 5th for 4 positions. He was also involved with the Invermay Progress Association, especially in its campaigning for the establishment of a recreation reserve on the Mowbray Swamp. [Examiner, 28 February 1929, p.8; Mercury, 19 March 1929, p.7]. In 1929, he was also involved in the establishment of a Northern Branch of the League of Nations Union. [Mercury, 29 July 1929, p.11] In 1934 he was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as a Nationalist member for Bass. He was defeated in 1941. He died in Hobart.

He is best known for giving up Babe Ruth's first two career home runs. Considered by baseball insiders and historians as an unlucky pitcher, Warhop had a career 69‚Äì92 win‚Äìloss record, but with a 3.12 earned run average while playing for mostly second division Highlanders/Yankees teams. Of his 92 losses, the Yankees did not score a run in 23, and he holds the MLB record for losing the most 1‚Äì0 games with five in 1914. He was released after the 1915 season and played a number of seasons in minor league baseball and semi-professional teams until his late 40s or early 50s. Warhop had an underhand submarine delivery, which gave him the nickname \\"Crab\\". He was also known for his rather small size, which is a subject of some conflict, although most historians and statisticians agree that he measured between 5 feet, 8 inches, used by several historians like Marty Appel or 5 feet 9 inches, used by Baseball-Reference.com.  Early life  Warhop was born in Hinton, West Virginia. He spent his early life working as a coal miner for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Warhop played for local semi- professional teams sponsored by the railway company. He drew the attention of several minor league teams, and in 1906, Warhop signed with the Class-D Freeport Pretzels of the Wisconsin‚ÄìIllinois League in 1906 to start his professional career. His debut campaign included a no-hitter on Independence Day against the La Crosse Pinks. From 1906 to 1908, Warhop had an 82‚Äì20 win‚Äìlost record and 330 strikeouts, with a career high 30 wins in 1907. After pitching to a 29‚Äì7 record for the Williamsport Millionaires in 1909, people throughout both the National and American League started to take notice of his ability. As many as a dozen teams were interested in Warhop, and he signed a $1,000 contract ($ in today's dollars) with the Detroit Tigers. However, they soon sold Warhop to the Highlanders without appearing in a single game with the Tigers.  Major League Baseball career  =1908‚Äì1912= Warhop made his debut on September 9, 1908. He ended up with a 1‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record with a 4.46 earned run average (ERA) in five games that year. Warhop became a regular fixture in the starting rotation in 1909. He pitched a three hitter against the Cleveland Nats on August 10, 1909 and finished the year with a 13‚Äì15 win‚Äìloss record, a 2.40 ERA, and 21 complete games in 36 games pitched as the Highlanders finished fifth in the American League (AL). However, Warhop led the AL in hit batsmen in 1909 (26) and 1910 (18), which might have been caused by his unorthodox pitching style. In 1910, Warhop pitched to a 14‚Äì14 win‚Äìloss record, a 3.00 ERA and 11 errors (the most among AL pitchers).Gallagher p. 226 He was respected throughout baseball, and Baseball Magazine once called him the \\"unluckiest pitcher in the American League\\". Tobacco card of Jack Warhop The season saw Warhop post a 12‚Äì13 record, a 4.16 ERA and 15 hit batsmen (the third highest in the league). His starts throughout the season were mixed; some were poor or marred by bad luck. He was shelled on May 9 in a 10‚Äì0 loss against a Detroit Tigers lineup featuring Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty, giving up runs in each of the first four innings. However, he improved a few weeks later on May 20, when he limited the St. Louis Browns to four hits. This began a quality stretch for Warhop, who won five consecutive games by July 17‚Äîa result of an improvement in his control. Then, during an August 21 road game against the Tigers, he lost a 5‚Äì4 walk-off game in the eleventh inning, in part due to his own unsuccessful strategy in fielding two bunts. On both occasions, he threw to second base but was too late, and the baserunners were able to advance safely and load the bases. The Highlanders lost when Earle Gardner booted a routine ground ball by Bill Donovan in an rushed attempt to throw out the go-ahead runner at home plate. His desperation culminated in him unsuccessfully requesting the league at the end of the season to change his win‚Äìloss record to 14‚Äì11, under the mistaken belief that his 12‚Äì13 record was incorrect. Warhop's penchant for tough luck was best exemplified in the season, when he finished with a 10‚Äì19 record‚Äîthe second highest number of losses in the AL‚Äîdespite compiling a 2.86 ERA and 6.7 Wins Above Replacement (WAR). Both his ERA and WAR were tenth best in the AL, though he also finished second in hit batsmen (16) and fifth in errors as a pitcher (7). In a July 5 road game against the Washington Senators, he entered the game in the second inning and lost 6‚Äì5 in a walk-off, despite dueling Walter Johnson up to the 16th inning. Then, in a game on August 22, he held the Chicago White Sox to just two hits and no runs in the first five innings. While pitching with a 3‚Äì0 lead, Warhop surrendered one run in the sixth inning, before getting shelled in the seventh, giving up four runs and the lead. After another four runs were given up in the ninth inning, the Highlanders lost the game 9‚Äì4. Towards the end of the season, Warhop was again on the losing side of a bad luck game, when he lost a 3‚Äì0 pitchers' duel against the St. Louis Browns, having held them scoreless for the first five innings. =1913‚Äì1915= A sore arm in caused Warhop to pitch ineffectively and have just seven games started. He recovered by ; however, Warhop was on the unfortunate end of a hard-luck campaign. He had an 8‚Äì15 win‚Äìloss record with a 2.37 ERA. However, the Yankees were one of the worst offensive and defensive teams in baseball, which caused Warhop to be on the losing end of five 1‚Äì0 games, a present-day Major League Baseball record shared with five other pitchers. In one of those games, on July 25, Warhop shutout the Chicago White Sox for twelve innings before losing 1‚Äì0 in the thirteenth, due to two errors‚Äîone of which was committed by himself on an errant throw to first base after a sacrifice bunt. His first win of the season finally came on June 25 against the Boston Red Sox. He led the American League in home runs allowed at the end of the season with eight, a very high number in the dead-ball era. His pitching style included an underhand, submarine delivery which he abandoned by 1914. He gave up Babe Ruth's first career home run on May 6, 1915, while Ruth was a member of the Boston Red Sox. Warhop threw a fastball in the third inning, and Ruth hit the ball to the upper right field stands. Warhop won the game 4‚Äì3 in extra innings. When interviewed about it many years later, Warhop shrugged it off, stating \\"that's one way to be remembered\\". A little over three weeks later, on June 2, he gave up Ruth's second career home run in a 7‚Äì1 Yankee defeat. In what would be his final season in Major League Baseball, Warhop had a 7‚Äì9 win‚Äìloss record and a 3.96 ERA, while leading the American League in home runs allowed (7) for the second consecutive year. He was released alongside first baseman Charlie Mullen and catcher Ed Sweeney on August 14 and then sold to Jack Dunn of the Richmond Climbers in the International League, but Warhop didn't play a game with them. According to one historian, however, Warhop was released because Yankee management thought he was a \\"jinx\\" to the club, as during Warhop's tenure‚Äîwith the exception of the 1910 season‚Äîthe Highlanders/Yankees finished no higher than fifth in the division. Warhop led the Yankees in games pitched four times (1908, 1909, 1912, 1914), saves three times (1909, 1910, 1912), and complete games once (1909).Gallagher p. 593 His 114 career hit batsmen is a Yankees team record and ranks in the top 100 on the MLB all-time hit batsmen list.  Later life  After leaving the Yankees, Warhop played in the minor leagues, including stints in the Pacific Coast League and the International League, until the late 1920s. He was player‚Äìmanager for the Class-B Norfolk Tars of the Virginia League in 1921 and won 20 games for the team. In 1927, he pitched and won both games of a doubleheader, a rare achievement, while with Bridgeport of the Eastern League at age 42. In 1928, Warhop became the manager for the Sally League Spartanburg team. He played semi-professional baseball until the age of 50, when he retired and became a butler for a large house in Long Island. He married Grace Nichols on November 23, 1907. They later divorced, and he married Frances Helsinger in 1918. Warhop died at age 76 in Freeport, Illinois, where his professional baseball career began.

These names are said to be corrupted text, and have been emended to \\"Leviat[h]an\\" (), by German translator Hermann Eth√©. \\"Kuyooth√°n\\" is an alternate spelling from the source Lane identifies as Ibn-Esh-Shi·∏•neh,, p. 106, note 1 which was some manuscript Lane had in his possession. \\"Rakabo√ªn√¢\\" is one variant name for the bull, as read from some manuscript of Al-Damiri (d. 1405) by Frenchman Nicolas Perron. Al-Rayann is the name of the bull as it appears in Mu·∏•ammad al-KisƒÅ æƒ´ (ca. 1100)'s version of the Qi·π£a·π£ al-AnbiyƒÅ‚Äô (\\"Tales of the Prophets\\").Mu·∏•ammad al-KisƒÅ æƒ´, Qi·π£a·π£ al-AnbiyƒÅ‚Äô, Derivation L≈´yƒÅtƒÅn () was the bull's reconstructed correct name in Arabic according Hermann Eth√©'s notes. Accordingly, he translates the bull's name as Leviathan in his German translation of Qazwini. Other commentators such as have also stated that the bull derived from the biblical Leviathan, much as the name of the Islamic cosmic fish Bahamut derived from the biblical Behemoth. Lane's summary Borges relied on Islamic traditional cosmography as summarized by Edward Lane in Arabian Society in the Middle Ages (1883). (on \\"Bahamut\\" am \\"Quyata\\"), and Hurley's note to them, pp. 221, 234, saying that the entries derive from Lane, Arabian Society. Lane's summary of Arabic source explains that \\"Kuyoot√†\\" was the name of the bull created by God to hold up a rock of \\"ruby\\", on which stood an earth-propping angel. God created the angel, rock, then the bull in that order according to this source, then a giant fish called Bahamut to sustain the bull underneath. Before this, the earth was oscillating in wayward directions, and all these layers of support were needed to achieve stability. The bull had 4,000 eyes, ears, noses, mouths, tougues, feet, according to Lane's summary, but the number is 40,000 eyes, limbs, etc. in several (older) Islamic sources, as discussed below. Arabic sources Kuy≈´thƒÅ is the name of the bull in the text of al-Qazwini (d. 1283)'s popular cosmography, The Wonders of Creation. This approximates Lane's spelling \\"Kuyoot√†\\". There exist a multitude of \\"editions\\" and manuscripts of al-Qazwini, which vary widely., \\"al-·∏≤azwƒ´nƒ´\\", Ency. of IslƒÅm, p. 841 Al-Damiri (d. 1405) on authority of Wahb ibn Munabbih, is one source he specifically named as being used by Lane, in his summary., p. 107, note 2. This so-called al-Damiri's account is considered to be a mere later redaction of al-Qazwini's cosmography printed on the margins,, \\"al-·∏≤azwƒ´nƒ´\\", Ency. of IslƒÅm, p. 844. and it may be noted that in Qazwini's account, Wahb ibn Munabbih acts as narrator.The passage begins \\"Wahb ben Munabbih sagt...\\" (in German), A translation of Al-Damiri into French was undertaken by Nicolas Perron. The bull's name was however \\"Rakabo√ªn√¢\\" (Rakab≈´nƒÅ) in al-Damiri, according to Perron's translation. The name of the bull is wanting in Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229)'s geography, Mu'jam al-Buldan. Yaqut is thought to have borrowed from al-Tha'labi (d. 1038)‚Äôs Qi·π£a·π£ al- anbƒ´yƒÅ æ (\\"Lives of the Prophets\\"), one of the two earliest sources containing the cosmology., notes 1, 2 Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1348) (Kharƒ´dat al- øAjƒÅ'ib, \\"The Pearl of Wonders\\"), considered to be a derivative rearrangement of Yaqut,, p. 19, note 4. is an alternate source used by Lane who noted variant readings from it. =Number of appendages= The bull has 4,000 legs in al-Damiri (d. 1405). But in Qazwini (d. 1283), the bull has 40,000 eyes, etc., with \\"teeth\\" () replace \\"tongues\\" in Lane's list. The larger number repeats what is found in older texts: \\"40,000 horns and 40,000 limbs\\" according to Yaqut (d. 1229)'s geography, 70,000 horns and 40,000 legs according to al-Tha'labi (d. 1038)‚Äôs Lives and 40,000 eyes, ears, mouths and tongues according to Mu·∏•ammad al- KisƒÅ æƒ´'s Lives of the Prophets. The bull has 40 humps, 40 horns, and four feet according to Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1348) in another passage,: Ibn al-Wardƒ´, Kharƒ´dat al- øajƒÅ æib (Cairo, 1939), p. 239. (although in the corresponding passage he merely repeats Yaqut's 40,000 horns and feet)., Tornberg's Latin translation. Its horns extended from the earth to God's Throne (,  øar≈°), entangling itYaqut al-Hamawi's geography, or lying like a \\"prickly hedge\\" underneath.al-Tha'labi's Lives of Prophtets, =Gem rock above bull= As for the rock platform supported by the bull, which Lane said was made of \\"ruby\\", the Arabic word used in original sources yƒÅq≈´t () has ambiguous meaning. Many of the Islamic sources have specifically indicated the rock was a green gem, viz.: \\"rock (made) of green jacinth\\",\\"Felsen aus gr√ºnem Hyacinth\\", Eth√©'s German translation of Qazwini, \\"green rock\\", \\"green corundum\\", etc. It is given as \\"green emerald\\" in a Latin translation of ibn al-Wardi.accusative, smaragdum viridem, God created the angel, rock, then bull in that order (the order they are arranged, one on top of another), according to Qazwini. However, in other sources, God created in the order of angel then bull, so that the angel could stand on the bull's hump, but as this was unstable, God inserted the rock platform above the bull's hump. These sources also say that God also inserted a sandhill between the great bull and the great fish. =Bull controlling tides= The bull's breathing is said to control the ocean tides according to some sources. Among the oldest sources (al-Tha'labi), the bull (ox) had its nose in the sea, and breathed once a day, causing the sea to rise when it exhaled, and ebb when it inhaled. The bull had its two nostrils pinned against two holes in the \\"green corundum\\" enabling it to breathe (Yaqut). On a related natural phenomenon, the bull and fish were considered responsible for drinking the water that tapped off from the land into the sea, maintaining the base level of the ocean's water. However, once their bellies become full they will become agitated (Ibn al-Wardi),: Ibn al-Wardƒ´, Kharƒ´dat al- øajƒÅ æib, p. 15. and it is a sign of the advent of Judgment Day (Yaqut).

Henri was also a collector of a broad range of fine art, including prints, paintings, and books of both European and Asian origin. By the 1880s, Vever became one of the earliest Europeans to formally collect Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, purchasing extensively from dealers such as Hayashi Tadamasa. He was a member of Les Amis de l'Art Japonais, a group of Japanese art enthusiasts including Claude Monet, that met regularly to discuss Japanese prints and other works over dinner. By the early 20th century, Vever had amassed a collection of many thousands of fine ukiyo-e prints. His collection was so well regarded that the authors of some of the pioneering European scholarly works on ukiyo-e used Vever's collection for much their research on actual prints. Such authors include von Seidlitz, Migeon, and , whose L'Estampe Japonaise used Vever's prints exclusively. At the peak of World War I, however, Vever chose (or was forced) to dispose of the bulk of his collection, selling some 7996 prints to the Japanese industrial mogul Matsukata K≈çjir≈ç, who purchased them sight-unseen based on the collection's reputation. The prints would eventually find their way to the Tokyo National Museum, forming the bulk of that institution's ukiyo-e corpus. Many of Vever's prints also ended up in the national museums of France, donated earlier by Vever himself. Although the thousands of pieces that made their way back to Japan via Matsukata included many of the masterpieces of the ukiyo-e movement, Vever had kept many of his best prints for himself and continued to collect after the First World War, acquiring pieces from former rivals Gonse, Haviland, Manzi, Isaac, and Javal as their collections went to the auction houses of Paris. He stopped collecting in the 1930s, and his \\"legendary\\" collection disappeared the following decade amid World War II and the German occupation of France, not to reappear until 1974 when Sotheby's announced that the collection would be auctioned. The sale took place in four parts, each in London: * Part I: 26 March 1974, 412 lots * Part II: 26 March 1975, 410 lots * Part III: 24 March 1977, 415 lots * Final Part: 30 October 1997, 197 lots Works from the first two parts were soon re-printed, together with 148 prints not sold at those auctions, in a limited-edition (2000-copy) three-volume catalog: Japanese Prints & Drawings from the Vever Collection, by Jack Hillier.

References Category:Cyclic peptides ","title":"Viscumamide"},{"id":"40148358","text":"Adipsia, also known as hypodipsia, is a symptom of inappropriately decreased or absent feelings of thirst. It involves an increased osmolality or concentration of solute in the urine, which stimulates secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the hypothalamus to the kidneys. This causes the person to retain water and ultimately become unable to feel thirst. Due to its rarity, the disorder has not been the subject of many research studies. Adipsia may be seen in conditions such as diabetes insipidus and may result in hypernatremia. It can occur as the result of abnormalities in the hypothalamus, pituitary and corpus callosum, as well as following pituitary/hypothalamic surgery. It is possible for hypothalamic dysfunction, which may result in adipsia, to be present without physical lesions in the hypothalamus, although there are only four reported cases of this. There are also some cases of patients experiencing adipsia due to a psychiatric disease. In these rare psychogenic cases, the patients have normal levels of urine osmolality as well as typical ADH activity. Cause =Dopamine= Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, has been linked with feeding behaviors. In an experiment, scientists measured how much food and water mice consumed when they were born without dopamine in their systems. They found that without dopamine, the mice would starve and be dehydrated to the point of death. The scientists then injected the mice without dopamine with its precursor, L-DOPA, and the mice started eating again. But, even though the mice were born without dopamine in their systems, they still had the capacity to control their feeding and drinking behaviors, suggesting that dopamine does not play a role in developing those neural circuits. Instead, dopamine is more closely related to the drive for hunger and thirst. Although the lack of dopamine resulted in adipsia in these rats, low levels of dopamine do not necessarily cause adipsia. 307x307pxLocation of the hypothalamus in the brain. Other findings in support of the role of dopamine in thirst regulation involved the nigrostriatal pathway. After completely degenerating the pathway, the animal becomes adipsic, aphagic, and loses its interest in exploring. Although dopamine plays a role in adipsia, there is no research involving exclusively the relationship between adipsia and dopamine, as changes in dopamine simultaneously mediate changes in eating and curiosity, in addition to thirst. =Hypothalamus= The area of the brain that regulates thirst is located in the anterior part of the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus is in close proximity to osmoreceptors which regulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH secretion is one of the primary mechanisms by which sodium and osmolar homeostasis are regulated, ADH is also secreted when there are small increases in serum osmolality. Thirst is triggered by increases in serum osmolality and along with increases ADH secretion. Both serum osmolality and ADH maintain normal ranges of serum osmolality. Adipsia can tend to result from lesions to hypothalamic regions involved in thirst regulation. These lesions can be congenital, acquired, trauma, or even surgery. Lesions or injuries to those hypothalamic regions cause adipsia because the lesions cause defects in the thirst regulating center which can lead to adipsia. Lesions in that region can also cause adipsia because of the extremely close anatomical proximity of the hypothalamus to ADH-related osmoreceptors. Diagnosis =Symptoms= Diagnosing adipsia can be difficult as there is no set of concrete physical signs that are adipsia specific. Changes in the brain that are indicative of adipsia include those of hyperpnea, muscle weakness, insomnia, lethargy, and convulsions (although uncommon except in extreme cases of incredibly rapid rehydration). Patients with a history of brain tumors, or congenital malformations, may have hypothalamic lesions, which could be indicative of adipsia. Some adults with Type A adipsia are anorexic in addition to the other symptoms. =Testing= Initial testing for adipsia involves electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, serum and urine osmolality, blood hormone levels, like vasopressin (AVP). In patients who have defects in thirst regulation and vasopresin secretion, serum vassopresin levels are low or absent. Measurements of urine electrolytes and osmolality are critical in determining the central, rather than renal, nature of the defect in water homeostasis. In adipsia, the fractional excretion of sodium is less than 1%, unless a coexisting defect in AVP secretion is present. In salt intoxication, the urine sodium concentrations are very high and fractional excretion of sodium is greater than 1%. Initial test results may be suggestive of diabetes insipidus. The circulating AVP levels tend to be high, which indicate an appropriate response of the pituitary to hyperosmolality. Patients may have mild stable elevations of serum sodium concentrations, along with elevations in both BUN and creatinine levels and in the BUN/creatinine ratio. =Characteristic= Type A Type A (essential hypernatremia syndrome) involves an increase of the level in which solvent molecules can pass through cell membranes (osmotic threshold) for vasopressin release and the activation of the feeling of thirst. This is the most characterized sub-type of adipsia, however there is no known cause for Type A adipsia. There is debate over whether osmoreceptor resetting could lead to the increase in threshold. Other studies have shown that it is the loss of osmoreceptors, not resetting, that cause the change in threshold. Patients with Type A adipsia can be at risk of seizures if they rapidly re-hydrate or quickly add a significant amount of sodium into their bodies. If not treated, Type A adipsia could result in both a decrease in the size of the brain and bleeding in the brain. Type B Type B adipsia occurs when vasopressin responses are at decreased levels in the presence of osmotic stimuli. Although minimal, there is still some secretion of AVP. This type may be due to some elimination of osmoreceptors. Type C Dopamine pathways in the brain. The production of dopamine is concentrated in the Ventral Tegmental Area and the Substantia Nigra. Type C adipsia (type C osmoreceptor dysfunction) involves complete elimination of osmoreceptors, and as a result have no vasopressin release when there normally would be. Type C is generally the adipsia type found in patients with adipsic diabetes insipidus. Type D Type D is the least commonly diagnosed and researched type of adipsia. The AVP release in this subtype occurs with normally functioning levels of osmoregulation. Management People affected by adipsia lack the ability to feel thirst, thus they often must be directed to drink. Adipsic persons may undergo training to learn when it is necessary that they drink water. Currently, there is no medicine available to treat adipsia. For people with adipsia because of hypothalamic damage, there is no surgical or medicinal option to fix the damage. In some cases where adipsia was caused by growths on thirst centers in the brain, surgical removal of the growths was successful in treating adipsia. Although adipsic persons must maintain a strict water intake schedule, their diets and participation in physical activities are not limited. People affected by diabetes insipidus have the option of using the intranasal or oral hormone desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), which is molecularly similar enough to vasopressin to perform its function. In this case, desmopressin helps the kidneys to promote reabsorption of water. Some doctors have reported success in treating psychogenic adipsic patients with electroconvulsive therapy, although the results are mixed and the reason for its success is still unknown. Additionally, some patients who do not successfully complete behavioral therapy may require a nasogastric tube in order to maintain healthy levels of fluids.

His works are abstract but maintain a strong link to the figurative, which give them a dream like quality. Although he won awards and was a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana during his lifetime, his work is not well known now in part because he did not do as much to promote it as other artists did. Life Hurtado was born in Mexico City in 1940, one of five children. He showed an early aptitude for painting and taught himself various techniques. Despite his talent, he entered the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico to study architecture. In 1969, he won a grant from the French government to study in Europe where he learned graphic design with Paul Colin and lithography in Stanley William Hayter‚Äôs Atelier 17. He also had studies at the Pratt Institute and at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\", where he met Irma Palacios. Hurtado was very shy and reserved although his humor could be ironic and caustic. He was also emotionally fragile, heavily affected by the death of his mother, who he adored and kept her wheelchair for years afterwards. His insecurity prompted him to seek psychological treatment with limited success. He also studied shamanism and supernatural practices. During his art career he had a studio in the Colonia Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City. Hurtado died of lung cancer in 2005, but the exact date is not known. He did not speak publicly about his illness, although rumors spread among intellectual circles. It was originally diagnosed as diabetes but when it was obviously cancer, he still did not give up smoking cigarettes. Career Hurtado‚Äôs art career was as a painter and printmaker. In the 1960s, he participated in various collective exhibitions with his first individual shows at the Galer√≠a Antonio Souza in Mexico City in 1965 and 1968. His later important individual exhibitions include the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1986, a tour in 1992 which sent works to various parts of Mexico as well as the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica and an exhibition at the Museo Mural Diego Rivera in 1996. His last important exhibitions were an exhibit of his engraving and other works on paper at the Museo de la Estampa and in 2001, the Casa Lamm Cultural Center had a showing of his work, accompanied by a catalog. Over this same time period he participated in numerous collective exhibits, and his work can be found in various collections in both Mexico and abroad. In addition to painting, Hurtado worked as an illustrator for the Exc√©lsior newspaper, the Revista de la Universidad and the Revista de Bellas Artes. Hurtado‚Äôs work is not very well known today in part because he did not work as hard to promote himself or the work while he was alive. However his work won various prizes including the third Sal√≥n de Pintura UNAM (1962), and honorable mention at the New Values Salon in Brussels (1962) and the fifth Bienal de Pintura Rufino Tamayo (1990). He was also accepted as a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana . After his death, he received a homage and retrospective in 2008 at the Palacio de la Autonom√≠a in Mexico City. Artistry Hurtado is classified with the ‚ÄúIntermediate Generation,‚Äù those artists who came into their own after the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura . According to historian Sergio Fern√°ndez, ‚ÄúHe brings together all the qualities of the great Mexican painters but‚Ä¶ if he is different it is because he hardly seems to be there; there is no ostentation nor desperate back-slapping, nor an irritating desire for applause.‚Äù Alfonso de Neuvillate wrote that ‚ÄúThe painting of Rodolfo Hurtado is both feeling and testament, and more than the first than the second, it is also a nocturnal labyrinth interpreted in the light of day.‚Äù His later works showed influence from the work of Paul Klee, Jean Dubuffte and Han Hartung, as well as Rufino Tamayo. This introduced abstract elements but his work stayed within a figurative discourse, with the abstractions and the coloring influence of Tamayo giving his pieces a dreamlike quality. The play of positive and negative appears in many of his works. In 1974 he discovered the writings of Carlos Castaneda, whose philosophy of life had a strong impact on his work, affecting his figures, background and even including elements of Yaqui shamanism. Sergio Fernandez said of his work ‚ÄúAs if coming from faraway places, his canvases signal to us from eternity; as Graci√°n would say, his oils and pastels acquire ‚Äúa train of incomprehensibilities.‚Äù‚Äù His best work was done in the latter 1970s to early 1980s, with oils done in small format being better than his larger works according to art critic Teresa del Conde who also considered him one of the best print makers in Mexico. Many of the qualities of his engraving, illustration and drawing in general is influenced by his training in Paris. They have geometric tendencies, but with fluid lines.

Description The Gotham bee has a greenish-blue body and brown legs and antennae. Females are long, about the size of a sesame seed. Males are smaller than females, about long. The Gotham bee has a wide head ( wide versus long). Males are bluer in color than females which are more green. The Gotham bee can be distinguished from other sweat bees from the pattern of bristles on its abdomen. It most closely resembles Lasioglossum zephyrus and Lasioglossum smilacinae. Distribution and habitat The Gotham bee was first spotted at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. It has since been found throughout the Atlantic coast of the United States, as far south as Georgia. A few specimens have been found in the Midwest, and one in Nebraska. It nests underground. Discovery The Gotham bee was discovered by John Ascher in 2010 as part of a biological survey of New York City's bee populations for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). When he first saw the Gotham bee, Ascher was unable to identify it as it did not precisely match any of the 700,000 bee specimens he curates for AMNH. He passed the bee to Jason Gibbs, who identified it as a new species in 2011 with the help of DNA testing. The specific name, L. gotham, was chosen because New York City is sometimes called \\"Gotham City\\". At the same time, Gibbs identified ten other new sweat bee species using AMNH's collections. His research, which was published in Zootaxa in October 2011, also reclassified 97 other species of Lasioglossum (Dialictus). Due to its small size, the Gotham bee was previously indistinguishable from other bees native to New York City. Gibbs commented, \\"This little bee has been quietly living in the city, pollinating flowers in people‚Äôs gardens for years. It‚Äôs a pleasure to help give it some well-deserved recognition.\\" Unlike many honeybees, urban bees in the Northeastern U.S. have adapted to rising temperatures, which have caused spring‚Äîand the first bloom of flowers for pollination‚Äîto arrive about 10 days earlier in recent years, Rutgers University researchers said.

They are free and open for any students to attend. Charter schools had the autonomy to set their own curriculum, qualifications, pay rates for teachers, school-hours and school terms. The schools were operated by sponsors such as MƒÅori Iwi, not-for-profit organisations, businesses or existing education providers. Charter schools were legalized after an agreement between the National Party and the ACT Party following the 2011 general election. In October 2012, the controversial Education Amendment Bill creating charter schools passed with a five-vote majority. The Charter School model was heavily criticized by a wide range of educational authorities, teacher organizations, the general public and political parties who vowed to overturn it. In late October 2017, the newly-formed Labour-led coalition government announced that it would be abolishing charter schools. This announcement triggered mixed responses with teaching unions supporting the Government while charter schools and the opposition National and ACT parties opposing the announcement. In response to protests, Prime Minister Ardern and the MƒÅori Labour MPs Education Minister Kelvin Davis and Willie Jackson have suggested that charter schools could convert to \\"special character\\" schools. By September 2018, all twelve remaining charter schools had successfully transitioned to become state integrated schools. Organizational structure and oversight Partnership Schools in New Zealand come under the oversight of an independent Authorisation Board, appointed by the Minister of Education. The Board advises the Minister on which applications should be considered for contracts. The Board is also responsible for monitoring the educational performance and achievement progress of the Partnership Schools. On 22 February 2018 the Authorisation Board's chair Catherine Isaac announced that the entire Authorisation Board would be resigning in protest of the Labour-led coalition government's decision to abolish the Partnership School model. =List of former Partnership Schools= As of September 2019, all twelve existing charter schools had converted into state integrated or special character schools. These schools are listed below. *Middle School West Auckland, sponsored by the Villa Education Trust, opened February 2015. *Pacific Advance Senior School, Auckland, sponsored by the Pacific Peoples Advancement Trust, opened February 2015. *South Auckland Middle School, sponsored by the Villa Education Trust, opened February 2014. *Te Aratika Academy, Napier, sponsored by the Te Aratika Charitable Trust *Te Kura Hourua O Whangarei Terenga Paraoa, Whangarei, sponsored by the He Puna Marama Charitable Trust, opened February 2014. *Te Kura MƒÅori o Waatea, Auckland, sponsored by the Manukau Urban MƒÅori Authority, opened February 2015. *Te KƒÅpehu Whet≈´ (Teina), Whangarei, sponsored by the He Puna Marama Charitable Trust, opened February 2015. *Te K≈çpuku High, Hamilton, sponsored by the Kia Ata Mai Educational Trust. *The Rise UP Academy, Auckland, sponsored by The Rise UP Trust, opened February 2014. *Vanguard Military School, Auckland, sponsored by the Advanced Trading Group Ltd., opened February 2014. *T≈´ranga Tangata Rite, Gisborne. *Waatea School, Auckland. History =Origins= In 1989, the Fourth Labour Government reformed the state (public) school system in what was known as the \\"Tomorrow's Schools\\" reforms. Blaming the amount of centralised bureaucracy for slipping school standards, the government disestablished the Department of Education, replacing it with the smaller Ministry of Education and moving the governance of state schools to their individual school communities. Since the Education Act 1877, the New Zealand public primary schooling system has been free and secular with provision for private religious schools. In 1935, secondary school education was made free by the First Labour Government. State schools are crown entities, meaning they are government-owned and retain the strong governmental and parliamentary oversight and control in common with other New Zealand crown entities. State schools are the most common in New Zealand. Apart from the numerous State schools there are several variations on the Tomorrow's Schools model, the largest of which is state-integrated schools. State-integrated schools are parochial schools or private schools that have been \\"integrated\\" into the state school system under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975, usually because they have run into financial difficulty. These schools are run the same as state schools, but they are allowed to retain their special character. Proprietors of the school (e.g. the Catholic Church in the case of a Catholic school) own the integrated school facilities and sit on the school's board of trustees, but they do not receive government funds to maintain separation of church and state, and subsequently require parents to pay \\"attendance dues\\" for upkeep of the facilities. Kura Kaupapa schools are state run schools with heavy emphasis on learning Maori language and culture but having most of the features of normal state schools. In addition there are fee paying private schools which receive limited funding from the state. Most follow the national curriculum or internationally recognized variations. =Legislative implementation= Following the 2011 general election, the National Party, in return for confidence and supply, announced it would pick up an ACT party policy of setting up charter schools in southern Auckland and eastern Christchurch within three years. This followed the appointment of Lesley Longstone as the new Secretary of Education, who had experience in England with charter schools, although Longstone resigned in November 2012 after falling out with Education Minister Hekia Parata over the error-ridden Novopay payroll system. The National-ACT alliance intended to set up charter schools as alternatives to state schools. Schools would be operated by private businesses or organisations and would be directly accountable for performance to the organizations running them. The schools would receive state funding and private donations, but have the same freedoms as private schools in matters such as in setting the curriculum, length of the school year and teachers' pay. Teaching staff would also not have to be registered or even formally trained (although they would still require police clearance). Charter schools would still be subject to triennial external reviews by ERO, and the government would still have the power to intervene if there are serious problems, either taking over from the sponsor for a period of time or sacking them altogether. Unlike state schools, charter schools would not be subject to either Ombudsman scrutiny or the Official Information Act 1982. However, in April 2013, it was also announced that charter schools would be subject to Ombudsman scrutiny on matters relating to suspensions and expulsions (other than the Ombudsman, the only other way to appeal a suspension or expulsion is through the court system). The plan was heavily criticised by the opposition Labour and Green parties, and the main teachers' professional associations-- the NZEI and the PPTA. Most of the opposition was over the idea of unregistered and untrained teachers having direct contact with students, and the lack of accountability through the Ombudsman and the Official Information Act. In April 2012, Massey University released a report highly critical of the proposed charter school model, claiming there was no international evidence to support claims that charter schools do better and all they would do is increase segregation. In September 2012, Minister of Education Hekia Parata announced that many schools in Christchurch would be closed or amalgamated, largely due to population changes and damaged facilities following the February 2011 earthquake. However, parents, teachers and students protested at the changes for going too far, and feared that the closures were being used as an excuse to start charter schools. In June 2013, the closed school sites were put up for sale, with charter schools and property development among the proposed uses. The Education Amendment Bill to allow charter schools, rebranded Partnership Schools/Kura Hourua, was introduced on 15 October 2012 and passed its first reading three days later 63 votes to 56. The bill was referred to the Education and Science select committee for closer scrutiny and public submissions, with the committee reporting back in April 2013 that the bill should proceed with amendments. After the report was released, United Future MP Peter Dunne announced he was pulling support for charter schools, leaving only the National, Act and Maori Parties supporting the bill. The bill passed its third reading on 4 June 2013, 62 votes to 57. During the select committee stage, the Labour Party announced that if elected to government at the 2014 general election, it would introduce provisions to require charter schools to employ registered teachers and make the schools fully accountable to the Ombudsmen and the Official Information Act. It would also not allow any new charter schools and would not guarantee future funding or integration to any existing schools, leaving them either to continue as private schools or close altogether. =Creation and operations= In May 2013, the PPTA published in its staff newsletter a list of 21 parties it believed were interested in the charter school programme, which included a high proportion of religious groups. While the Ministry of Education refused to release the full list of 36 interested parties, in July 2013, the Ombudsman overruled the MoE and forced them to release the list as soon as possible. In September 2013, the Education Minister Hekia Parata and Association Education Minister John Banks announced that the first five charter schools would open in Auckland and Northland by the first term of 2014. These schools included the Vanguard Military School, the MƒÅori secondary schools Te Kura Hourua o Whangarei Terenga Paraoa and Te Kura Hourua ki Whangaruru, The Rise UP Academy, and the Christian-oriented South Auckland Middle School. In September 2014, the Northland-based Te Kura Hourua ki Whangaruru in Whangaruru attracted controversy over its poor leadership, high absenteeism of 20%, and mismanagement of government funds. The school, which received 500% more funding than a state school, spent half its income buying a farm. The Ministry of Education carried out a secret inquiry and immediately installed its own manager. One of the two original managers left hurriedly. Problems first arose in 2013 when it was claimed that the school had been set up in a paddock using portaloos for toilets. It was reported that drugs were a problem in the school and that some students had been removed to an unknown place. The school has only one teacher with a current practicing certificate. The original management was replaced by an executive manager from Child, Youth and Family. The school received $27,000 per student compared to $6,000 per student in a state school. In October 2015, the Education Ministry acknowledged that charter schools had been over-funded an extra $888,000 more than they would have been allocated had their funding been strictly based on their enrolments. In May 2016, an independent Partnership School support entity called E Tipu E Rea was established to provide support for existing and prospective charter school sponsors through a $500,000 conditional grant from the Government. Education Under-secretary and ACT leader David Seymour claimed that this would bring NZ charter schools in line with overseas models such as England's New Schools Network and New York's New York Charter School Centre. The Board was chaired by former EY Australasia CEO Rob McLeod. Other board members included former Maori Party Co-Leader Dame Tariana Turia, Dame Jenny Gibbs, former All Black rugby player La‚Äôauli Savae Michael Jones, Bruce Ritchie, and Kep Rapson. In August 2016, Seymour announced that two new MƒÅori-oriented charter schools would be opening in Hamilton and Napier by 2017, adding to the eight that were already operating. In May 2017, the consultancy firm Martin Jenkins published an independent report on behalf of the Ministry of Education praising most of the country's eight charter schools for helping MƒÅori, Pacific Islander, and disadvantaged children. During the 2017 general election, the opposition Labour, Green, and New Zealand First parties announced that they would introduce legislation abolishing charter schools if elected into government. On 7 September, the National Government announced the creation of four new charter schools including a Christchurch outpost of the Auckland-based Vanguard Military School, a MƒÅori-oriented junior high school, a bilingual MƒÅori high school, and a STEM-oriented Auckland school. =Abolition and transition to state-integrated schools= Following the formation of a Labour- led coalition government in October 2017, the new Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the Government would be abolishing charter schools. In early 2018, the Labour-led Government introduced legislation blocking the creation of future charter schools while still allowing the existing 11 charter schools to continue operating while they negotiated options with the Ministry of Education. The Government's announcement was welcomed by the Post Primary Teachers' Association. By contrast, the announcement was criticized by charter schools, several parents, and the opposition National and ACT parties. The National Party's education spokesperson Nikki Kaye asked the Auditor- General to investigate potential conflicts of interest in the process of closing charter schools. On 11 February 2018, ACT leader and charter school advocate David Seymour led a 150-strong protest in Central Auckland criticizing the Government's decision. In response to criticism from parents and charter school advocates, Prime Minister Ardern, and MƒÅori Labour MPs Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis and former broadcaster Willie Jackson have suggested that charter schools could convert to \\"special character\\" schools in order to avoid closure. On 21 February the entire Partnership Schools Authorisation Board announced that it would be resigning in protest of the Government's approach to abolishing charter schools. On 5 March, charter school representatives including Villa Education Trust's academic advisor Alwyn Poole sought clarification from the Government on the deadline for charter schools to convert to \\"special character\\" schools. Education Ministry spokesperson Katrina Casey issued a statement confirming that 1 April 2018 would be the deadline for new schools but not existing schools. On 2 April 2018, The New Zealand Herald newspaper reported that the Government had paid NZ$3.4 million to five proposed charter schools on the day that the Labour-led coalition government was sworn in on 26 October 2017. Education Minister Chris Hipkins acknowledged that his Government had paid the schools establishment grants since the Government was bound by contracts signed before the 2017 general election. None of these proposed schools have paid back the establishment grants since they are in the process of negotiating with the Government about reopening as state schools or integrated schools. It was also reported that terminating the contracts for the existing 11 charter schools and proposed five charter schools would generate compensation costs of up to NZ$1 million per school; amounting to an estimated total of NZ$16 million. These proposed schools have included the science- oriented City Senior School in Auckland, Vanguard Military School's Christchurch branch, the Gisborne MƒÅori high school Te R≈´nanga o T≈´ranganui ƒÅ Kiwa, and Waatea High School. By September 2018, all twelve existing charter schools had successfully transitioned into state integrated schools, ending New Zealand's charter school programme. The announcement was welcomed by Education Minister Hipkins but received a bitter-sweet response from charter school advocates and the opposition National and ACT parties. In late August 2018, the Villa Education Trust's Middle School West Auckland, South Auckland Middle School, and the independent Vanguard Military School were redesignated as special character state schools. The Mangere-based Te Kura MƒÅori o Waatea, a proposed Waatea High School, and the proposed T≈´ranga Tangata Rite in Gisborne were designated as state integrated schools.

It is a troglobitic species endemic to cave habitat in southwestern Madagascar. It is unique among known cave- dwelling fish in that is both blind and darkly pigmented.Sparks, J. S. and P. Chakrabarty. (2012). Revision of the endemic Malagasy cavefish genus Typhleotris (Teleostei: Gobiiformes: Milyeringidae), with discussion of its phylogenetic placement and description of a new species. American Museum Novitates 3764, 1-28. It has well-developed nonvisual sensory systems and dives to avoid approaching objects. The fish was first collected in 2008 and was described to science as a new species in 2012. Description Typhleotris mararybe is about long. The body is uniformly dark brown in color, and the fins are mostly white with brown bases. Its sensory systems include a series of pores on its head, but it lacks eyes. The fish is relatively slow-moving, but more responsive to approaching objects than the closely related T. madagascariensis, diving to avoid them. It can be distinguished from other members of genus Typhleotris by its dark pigmentation and aspects of its bone structure. T. mararybe is possibly the sister species of T. madagascariensis, as the two share characteristics in common that T. pauliani, the only other member of the genus, does not. T. mararybe may have evolved from an ancestral species that lacked pigmentation and was blind, but that pigmentation was regained for camouflage in parts of the cave that receive sunlight. Habitat Typhleotris mararybe is one of four cave-dwelling fishes in Madagascar. It was initially known from only a single cave, a karst sinkhole called the Grotte de Vitane near Itampolo, where two specimens were collected, but has later been discovered to occur in four additional sinkholes/caves in the region. It is overall less widespread and common than T. madagascariensis, which also occurs in the five caves/sinkholes inhabited by T. mararybe. Despite this, direct competition between the two species is not known. Taxonomic evaluation Typhleotris mararybe was described from the two specimens, the holotype and the paratype, in 2012. It was published in American Museum Novitates, a journal of the American Museum of Natural History. Locals sometimes enter the Grotte de Vitane cave where it was first discovered, but were unaware of the species. The specific name was derived from the Malagasy words marary (ill or sick), and be (big), combined to mean \\"very sick\\" or \\"big sickness\\". It commemorates an unknown severe illness suffered by members of the field team after their snorkeling expedition to survey the sinkhole.

Sites on the Golan in black are Syrian villages. Areas of the Golan occupied by Israel are light- coloured while those under Syrian control are grey. The Agreement on Disengagement (, ) is an agreement between Israel and Syria that was signed on May 31, 1974, which officially ended the Yom Kippur War and the subsequent attrition period on the Syrian front. Background As soon as the ceasefire came into place at the end of the Yom Kippur War, a time when Israel had control over the entire territory of the Golan Heights, including the area Syria had controlled before the war and which Israel had conquered during the war. The enclave was in front of northern Golan, with a width of and a total area of . The area consisted of many small Syrian villages as well as volcanic cone and the top of Hermon mountain. The enclave was at a distance of from Damascus. Even though the temporary ceasefire was made official, both sides kept exchanging fire, bringing the situation into attrition. It continued throughout the negotiation process, and became more intense every time it was interrupted. Negotiations were repeatedly initiated by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 339, however from its very beginning there were multiple disputes over its procedures that prevented the resolution from being successful. The attrition grew even more as the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Egypt was finally signed in January 1974. Israel demanded that a list of its captives held in Syria be released as a condition for re- opening the negotiations, and asked that they be allowed to receive medical treatment from the Red Cross if needed. Syria denied the request, demanding territorial compensation in exchange. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, came for a short shuttling journey between Jerusalem and Damascus in February 1974 (he later admitted in his books that he had decided to mediate due to pressure from the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and ruler of Saudi Arabia, who had deep interests in finishing the Yom Kippur War and the oil crisis that was going on). On February 27, Kissinger returned from Damascus with a list of prisoners, following a promise given to the Syrians that Quneitra will be given back to them, and then began formal negotiations. Attrition warfare greatly increased in the coming months, and between March and May there were over a thousand different incidents, including heavy bombings on cities in the Golan as well as constant fire at Israel Defense Forces (IDF) forces, and battles over the control of Mount Hermon. Throughout this period, fears that the battles will become a full-scale war delayed the release of reserve units in months. Syrians demanded Israeli withdrawal from large territories in the Golan which they had lost. Eventually Israel agreed to withdraw from all the territories occupied during the war, consisting of approximately on the Israeli side of the Purple Line (1967 armistice line). In exchange, a 235 square kilometer (146 sq mi) UNDOF buffer zone was formed on the Syrian side of that line. According to testimonies of the participants in the negotiations, there were bargainings about the smallest detail until the agreement was signed in Geneva on May 31, 1974 (more than seven months after the ceasefire declaration). The negotiations led to many misunderstandings and indirectly caused the crises of fire incidents, such as when Israel agreed to give back Syria the control over Quneitra, Syria interpreted it as if the area referred to included the Avital and Bental mountains, while Israel intended only to the area of the city itself. The negotiations went on with continued U.S. pressure on Israel. Details and implementation It was decided in the agreement that the two countries will maintain the ceasefire and immediately return prisoners of war on both sides. Then, it said, Israel will withdraw from all the enclaved areas and the Hermon top it occupied during the war, and a surface of about 25 km¬≤ around the city of Quneitra and other small areas occupied during the Six-Day War. Finally, two separation lines were put into place: Israeli (marked in blue) and Syrian (marked in red),UNDOF BACKGROUND - map with red and blue lines on this page including a 235 km¬≤ UNDOF buffer zone on the Syrian side. The agreement stated that the Syrian civilians forced to leave their homes in the buffer zone will be able to return to them, as it pledged fight terrorist activities in the Golan Heights. These two undertakings were given as an oral commitment to the United States. Following the agreement was the establishment of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone (UNDOF), which appointed 1,043 soldiers to oversee the buffer zone. Prisoners were returned immediately after the signing of the agreement (June 1‚Äì6, 1974), and Israel withdrew from Mount Hermon and the enclave areas. The new separation line was completed on June 26, 1974. Unlike what many had expected, the agreement on disengagement between Israel and Syria not only lasted for more than 45 years, but has been in place from the moment it was signed until today. This makes it the longest successful agreement Israel has ever had with an Arab country.

That is, the curve representing each edge should have the property that every horizontal line intersects it in at most one point, and no two edges may intersect except at a shared endpoint.; . In this sense, it is the ideal case for layered graph drawing, a style of graph drawing in which edges are monotonic curves that may cross, but in which crossings are to be minimized. Characterizations A directed acyclic graph must be planar in order to have an upward planar drawing, but not every planar acyclic graph has such a drawing. Among the planar directed acyclic graphs with a single source (vertex with no incoming edges) and sink (vertex with no outgoing edges), the graphs with upward planar drawings are the st-planar graphs, planar graphs in which the source and sink both belong to the same face of at least one of the planar embeddings of the graph. More generally, a graph G has an upward planar drawing if and only if it is directed and acyclic, and is a subgraph of an st-planar graph on the same vertex set., pp. 111‚Äì112; , 6.1 \\"Inclusion in a Planar st-Graph\\", pp. 172‚Äì179; ; . In an upward embedding, the sets of incoming and outgoing edges incident to each vertex are contiguous in the cyclic ordering of the edges at the vertex. A planar embedding of a given directed acyclic graph is said to be bimodal when it has this property. Additionally, the angle between two consecutive edges with the same orientation at a given vertex may be labeled as small if it is less than œÄ, or large if it is greater than œÄ. Each source or sink must have exactly one large angle, and each vertex that is neither a source nor a sink must have none. Additionally, each internal face of the drawing must have two more small angles than large ones, and the external face must have two more large angles than small ones. A consistent assignment is a labeling of the angles that satisfies these properties; every upward embedding has a consistent assignment. Conversely, every directed acyclic graph that has a bimodal planar embedding with a consistent assignment has an upward planar drawing, that can be constructed from it in linear time., pp. 112‚Äì115; , 6.2 \\"Angles in Upward Drawings\\", pp. 180‚Äì188; ; . Another characterization is possible for graphs with a single source. In this case an upward planar embedding must have the source on the outer face, and every undirected cycle of the graph must have at least one vertex at which both cycle edges are incoming (for instance, the vertex with the highest placement in the drawing). Conversely, if an embedding has both of these properties, then it is equivalent to an upward embedding., p. 115; , 6.7.2 \\"Forbidden Cycles for Single-Source Digraphs\\", pp. 209‚Äì210; . Computational complexity Several special cases of upward planarity testing are known to be possible in polynomial time: *Testing whether a graph is st- planar may be accomplished in linear time by adding an edge from s to t and testing whether the remaining graph is planar. Along the same lines, it is possible to construct an upward planar drawing (when it exists) of a directed acyclic graph with a single source and sink, in linear time., p. 119; , p. 179. *Testing whether a directed graph with a fixed planar embedding can be drawn upward planar, with an embedding consistent with the given one, can be accomplished by checking that the embedding is bimodal and modeling the consistent assignment problem as a network flow problem. The running time is linear in the size of the input graph, and polynomial in its number of sources and sinks., pp. 119‚Äì121; , 6.3 \\"Upward Planarity Testing of Embedded Digraphs\\", pp. 188‚Äì192; ; ; . *Because oriented polyhedral graphs have a unique planar embedding, the existence of an upward planar drawing for these graphs may be tested in polynomial time., pp. 191‚Äì192; ; . *Testing whether an outerplanar directed acyclic graph has an upward planar drawing is also polynomial., pp. 125‚Äì126; , 6.7.1 \\"Outerplanar Digraph\\", p. 209; . *Every series-parallel graph, oriented consistently with the series-parallel structure, is upward planar. An upward planar drawing can be constructed directly from the series-parallel decomposition of the graph., 6.7.4 \\"Some Classes of Upward Planar Digraphs\\", p. 212. More generally, arbitrary orientations of undirected series-parallel graphs may be tested for upward planarity in polynomial time.. *Every oriented tree is upward planar. *Every bipartite planar graph, with its edges oriented consistently from one side of the bipartition to the other, is upward planar. *A more complicated polynomial time algorithm is known for testing upward planarity of graphs that have a single source, but multiple sinks, or vice versa., pp. 122‚Äì125; , 6.5 \\"Optimal Upward Planarity Testing of Single-Source Digraphs\\", pp. 195‚Äì200; ; . *Testing upward planarity can be performed in polynomial time when there are a constant number of triconnected components and cut vertices, and is fixed-parameter tractable in these two numbers.; . It is also fixed-parameter tractable in the cyclomatic number of the input graph.. *If the y-coordinates of all vertices are fixed, then a choice of x-coordinates that makes the drawing upward planar can be found in polynomial time.. However, it is NP-complete to determine whether a planar directed acyclic graph with multiple sources and sinks has an upward planar drawing., pp. 126‚Äì132; , 6.6 \\"Upward Planarity Testing is NP- complete\\", pp. 201‚Äì209; . Straight-line drawing and area requirements F√°ry's theorem states that every planar graph has a drawing in which its edges are represented by straight line segments, and the same is true of upward planar drawing: every upward planar graph has a straight upward planar drawing.; . A straight-line upward drawing of a transitively reduced st-planar graph may be obtained by the technique of dominance drawing, with all vertices having integer coordinates within an n √ó n grid., 4.7 \\"Dominance Drawings\\", pp. 112‚Äì127; . However, certain other upward planar graphs may require exponential area in all of their straight-line upward planar drawings. If a choice of embedding is fixed, even oriented series parallel graphs and oriented trees may require exponential area.; ; . Hasse diagrams Upward planar drawings are particularly important for Hasse diagrams of partially ordered sets, as these diagrams are typically required to be drawn upwardly. In graph-theoretic terms, these correspond to the transitively reduced directed acyclic graphs; such a graph can be formed from the covering relation of a partial order, and the partial order itself forms the reachability relation in the graph. If a partially ordered set has one minimal element, has one maximal element, and has an upward planar drawing, then it must necessarily form a lattice, a set in which every pair of elements has a unique greatest lower bound and a unique least upper bound., 6.7.3 \\"Forbidden Structures for Lattices\\", pp. 210‚Äì212; . The Hasse diagram of a lattice is planar if and only if its order dimension is at most two., pp. 118; . However, some partial orders of dimension two and with one minimal and maximal element do not have an upward planar drawing (take the order defined by the transitive closure of a < b, a < c, b < d, b < e, c < d, c < e, d < f, e < f).

It is independent in the sense that it operates according to the basic principle of autonomy for accountability, that it is freed from the rules but accountable for results.  Public vs. private school  There is debate on whether charter schools ought to be described as private schools or state schools. Advocates of the charter model state that they are public schools because they are open to all students and do not charge tuition, while critics cite charter schools' private operation and loose regulations regarding public accountability and labor issues as arguments against the concept. It is also described as a form of public education that is controlled by parents and small constituencies. On the other hand, charter schools are often established, operated, and maintained by for-profit organizations.  By country  = Australia = All Australian private schools have received some federal government funding since the 1970s. Since then they have educated approximately 30% of high school students. None of them are charter schools, as all charge tuition fees. Since 2009, the Government of Western Australia has been trialling the Independent Public School (IPS) Initiative. These public schools have greater autonomy and could be regarded as akin to 'charter' Schools (but the term is not used in Australia). = Bulgaria = The first charter school in Bulgaria, 151 General Education School with Interest-Based Profiles, was established in 1990 in Sofia, Bulgaria. = Canada = The Canadian province of Alberta enacted legislation in 1994 enabling charter schools. The first charter schools under the new legislation were established in 1995: New Horizons Charter School, Suzuki Charter School, and the Centre for Academic and Personal Excellence. , Alberta remains the only Canadian province that has enabled charter schools. There are 23 charter school campuses operated by 13 Alberta charter schools. The number of charter schools is limited to a maximum of 15. = Chile = Chile has a very long history of private subsidized schooling, akin to charter schooling in the United States. Before the 1980s, most private subsidized schools were religious and owned by churches or other private parties, but they received support from the central government. In the 1980s, the government of Augusto Pinochet promoted neoliberal reforms in the country. In 1981 a competitive voucher system in education was adopted. These vouchers could be used in public schools or private subsidized schools (which can be run for profit). After this reform, the share of private subsidized schools, many of them secular, grew from 18.5% of schools in 1980 to 32.7% of schools in 2001. As of 2012, nearly 60% of Chilean students study in charter schools. = England and Wales = The United Kingdom established grant-maintained schools in England and Wales in 1988. They allowed individual schools that were independent of the local school authority. When they were abolished in 1998, most turned into foundation schools, which are really under their local district authority but still have a high degree of autonomy. Prior to the 2010 general election, there were about 200 academies (publicly funded schools with a significant degree of autonomy) in England. The Academies Act 2010 aims to vastly increase this number. = Germany = Due to Art. 7 of the Grundgesetz (German constitution), private schools may only be set up if they do not increase the segregation of pupils by their parents' income class. In return, all private schools are supported financially by government bodies, comparable to charter schools. The amount of control over school organization, curriculum etc. taken over by the state differs from state to state and from school to school. Average financial support given by government bodies was 85% of total costs in 2009. Academically, all private schools must lead their students to the ability to attain standardized, government-provided external tests such as the Abitur. = Hong Kong = Some private schools in Hong Kong receive government subsidy under the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS). DSS schools are free to design their curriculum, select their own students, and charge for tuition. A number of DSS schools were formerly state schools prior to joining the scheme. = Ireland = Charter schools in Ireland were set up mostly in the 1700s by the Church of Ireland to educate the poor. They were state or charity sponsored, but run by the church. The model to copy was Kilkenny College, but critics like Bernard Mandeville felt that educating too many poor children would lead them to have unrealistic expectations. Notable examples are the Collegiate School Celbridge, Midleton College, Wilson's Hospital School and The King's Hospital. = Netherlands = = New Zealand = Charter schools in New Zealand, labelled as Partnership schools  kura hourua, were allowed for after an agreement between the National Party and the ACT Party following the 2011 general election. The controversial legislation passed with a five-vote majority. A small number of charter schools started in 2013 and 2014. All cater for students who have struggled in the normal state school system. Most of the students have issues with drugs, alcohol, poor attendance and achievement. Most of the students are Maori or Pacific Islander. One of the schools is set up as a military academy. One of the schools ran into major difficulties within weeks of starting. It is now being run by an executive manager from Child, Youth and Family, a government social welfare organization, together with a commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Education. 36 organizations have applied to start charter schools. = Norway = As in Sweden, the publicly funded but privately run charter schools in Norway are named friskoler and was formally instituted in 2003, but dismissed in 2007. Private schools have since medieval times been a part of the education system, and is today consisting of 63 Montessori and 32 Steiner (Waldorf) charter schools, some religious schools and 11 non-governmental funded schools like the Oslo International School, the German School Max Tau and the French School Lyc√©e Fran√ßais, a total of 195 schools. All charter schools can have a list of admission priorities, but only the non-governmental funded schools are allowed to select their students and to make a profit. The charter schools cannot have entrance exams, and supplemental fees are very restricted. In 2013, a total of 19,105 children were enrolled in privately run schools. = Sweden = The Swedish system of friskolor (\\"free schools\\") was instituted in 1992. These are publicly funded by school vouchers and can be run by not-for-profits as well as for-profit companies. The schools are restricted: for example, they are prohibited from supplementing the public funds with tuition or other fees; pupils must be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis; and entrance exams are not permitted. There are about 900 charter schools throughout the country. = United States = In 2003, Granada Hills Charter High School in Los Angeles became the largest charter school in the United StatesDiMassa, Cara Mia. \\"Granada Hills Gets Charter OK.\\" Los Angeles Times. 14 May 2003. Retrieved 8 January 2016. According to the Education Commission of the States, \\"charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor). This contract ‚Äì or charter ‚Äì details how the school will be organized and managed, what students will be expected to achieve, and how success will be measured. Many charters are exempt from a variety of laws and regulations affecting other public schools if they continue to meet the terms of their charters.\\" These schools, however, need to follow State-mandated curriculum and are subject to the same rules and regulations that cover it, although there is flexibility in the way it is designed. SER-Ni√±os Charter School, a charter school in the Gulfton area of Houston, Texas Minnesota passed the first charter school law in the United States in 1991. , Minnesota had 165 registered charter schools, with over 41,000 students attending. The first of these to be approved, Bluffview Montessori School in Winona, Minnesota, opened in 1992. The first charter to operate was City Academy in St. Paul. Some specialized Minnesota charter schools include the Metro Deaf School (1993), Community of Peace Academy (1995), and the Mainstreet School of Performing Arts (2004). approximately 5,600 charter schools enrolled an estimated total of more than 2 million students nationwide. The numbers equate to a 13% growth in students in just one year, while more than 400,000 students remain on charter school waitlists. Over 500 new charter schools opened their doors in the 2011‚Äì12 school year, an estimated increase of 200,000 students. This year marks the largest single-year increase ever recorded in terms of the number of additional students attending charter schools. The most radical experimentation with charter schools in the United States possibly occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (2005). the New Orleans Public Schools system was engaged in reforms aimed at decentralizing power away from the pre-Katrina public school board to individual charter school principals and boards, monitoring charter school performance by granting renewable, five-year operating contracts permitting the closure of those not succeeding, and parents the choice to enroll their children in almost any school in the district.Vallas wants no return to old ways.

SAGE Publications. 5 December 2011. These differences largely relate to what types of public agencies are permitted to authorize the creation of charter schools, whether or not and through what processes private schools can convert to charter schools, and what certification, if any, charter school teachers require. In California, local school districts are the most frequent granters of school charters. If a local school district denies a charter application, or if the proposed charter school provides services not provided by the local school districts, a county board consisting of superintendents from state schools or the state board of education can grant a charter.Premack, Eric. \\"Charter schools: California's education reform 'power tool.'(Special Section on Charter Schools).\\" Phi Delta Kappan 78.1 (1996): 60+. Academic OneFile. Web. 5 December 2011. The Arizona State Board for Charter Schools grants charters in Arizona. Local school districts and the state board of education can also grant charters. In contrast, the creation of charter schools in Michigan can be authorized only by local school boards or by the governing school boards of state colleges and universities.Lacireno- Paquet, Natalie. \\"Moving Forward or Sliding Backward: The Evolution of Charter School Policies in Michigan and the District of Columbia.\\" Educational policy (Los Altos, CA) 21. (2007): 202. Web. 5 December 2011. Educational policy (Los Altos, CA). Different states with charter school legislation have adopted widely different positions in regard to the conversion of private schools to charter schools. California, for example, does not allow the conversion of private schools into charter schools. Both Arizona and Michigan allow such conversions, but with different requirements. A private school wishing to convert to a charter school in Michigan, for example, must show that at least 25% of its student population is made up of new students. Legislation in Arizona stipulates that private schools that wish to become charter schools within that state must have admission policies that are fair and non- discriminatory. Also, while Michigan and California require teachers at charter schools to hold state certification, those in Arizona do not. Charter schools were targeted as a major component of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. Specifically, the act specifies that students attending schools labeled as under-performing by state standards now have the option to transfer to a different school in the district, whether it is a state, private, or charter school. The act also suggested that if a failing school cannot show adequate yearly progress, it will be designated a charter school. there were almost 100 charter schools in North Carolina, the limit passed by legislation in 1996.Knight, Meghan. \\"Cyber Charter Schools: An Analysis of North Carolina's Current Charter School Legislation.\\" North Carolina journal of law . 6. (2005): 395. Web. 6 December 2011. http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ncjl6. The 1996 legislation dictates that there will be no more than five charter schools operating within one school district at any given time. It was passed in order to offer parents options in regard to their children and the school they attend, with most of the cost being covered by tax revenue. After the first several years of permitting charter schools in North Carolina, the authority to grant charters shifted from local boards of education to the State Board of Education. This can also be compared with several other states that have various powers that accept charter school applications. There is strong demand for charter schools from the private sector. Typically, charter schools operate as nonprofits. However, the buildings in which they operate are generally owned by private landlords. Accordingly, this asset class is generating interest from real-estate investors who are looking towards the development of new schools. State and local governments have also shown willingness to help with financing. Charter schools have grown in popularity over the recent past. In 2014‚Äì2015, 500 new charter schools opened in the country. , 6,700 charter schools enroll approximately 2.9 million students in the United States. NCES, The Condition of Education ‚Äì Charter School Enrollment, April 2016  Cyber schools  Charter cyber schools operate like typical charter schools in that they are independently organized schools, but are conducted partly or entirely over the Internet. Proponents say this allows for much more flexibility compared with traditional schools.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Cyber Charter Schools, 2014 For 2000‚Äì2001, studies estimated that there are about 45,000 online K‚Äì12 students nationally. Six years later, a study by Picciano and Seamon (2006) found that over 1 million students were involved. These numbers increased to 6.7 million students in 2013. A study by Watson, Murin, Vashaw, Gemin, and Rapp found that cyber charter schools are currently (as of 2014) operating in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The increase of these online campuses has aroused controversy. In November, 2015, researchers at the University of Washington, Stanford University, and the Mathematica Policy Research group published the first major study of online charter schools in the United States, the \\"National Study of Online Charter Schools\\". It found \\"significantly weaker academic performance\\" in mathematics and reading in such schools when compared to conventional ones. The study resulted from research carried out in 17 US states which had online charter schools. It concluded that keeping online pupils focused on their work was the biggest problem faced by online charter schools and that in mathematics the difference in attainment between online pupils and their conventionally-educated peers equated to the cyber pupils missing a whole academic year in school. Four states have adopted specific legislation tailored to cyber charter schools. One example is Arizona, which has about 3,500 students in cyber schools, about half of them cyber charter schools and the other half governed by traditional, brick-and- mortar public school districts. The cyber schools teach students from kindergarten to 12th grade, and the setting varies from being entirely online in one's home to spending all of the class time in a formal school building while learning over the Internet. Cyber charter school diplomas have been unevenly valued by post-secondary institutions. Universities sometimes apply additional requirements or have cyber-charter quotas limiting the number of applicants. The US military also classifies non-traditional diplomas at a lower tier, although as of 2012 this could be bypassed by high ASVAB test scores.  Charter schools and public schools  In 2014, New Orleans became the first place in the United States to establish an all-charter school district, called the Recovery School District. A 2017 policy statement from the National Education Association expressed its strong commitment to public schools. Charter schools are funded by taxpayers so there must be the same liability, transparency, safeguards, and impartiality as public schools. 44 American states along with the District of Columbia implement legislation on state charter schools. However, many states do not compel charters to abide by open meeting statutes as well as prerequisites on conflict of interest that pertain to school districts, boards, and employees. The Trump administration's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is a major proponent of \\"school choice\\" and charter schools.

It is endemic to Tasmania, Australia. Description It is medium to large for a galaxiid, usually growing up to 140 mm, occasionally to 240 mm, in length. It has a thickset body with a long head and slender snout. The upper body and sides are golden-amber in colouring, with dark oval spots. The underparts are silvery-grey, the fins amber to light orange edged black. Distribution and habitat The golden galaxias is found only in Lakes Sorell and Crescent and their associated streams in the Central Highlands region of Tasmania. Adult fish prefer shallow, lake-shore waters with rocky substrates that provide shelter as well as breeding and feeding habitat. Behaviour =Breeding= The fish spawn from late autumn to winter. The small (1.5 mm diameter) eggs are stuck to rocky surfaces and aquatic vegetation, scattered rather than clumped. Some 1000‚Äì15,000 eggs are produced, depending on the age and size of the female. Newly hatched larvae are 5‚Äì6 mm long and float in the water column; the juveniles live in open water until 4‚Äì5 months old (when they reach a length of 40 mm) before moving to inshore lake bottom habitat. Males mature during their first year (at over 50 mm), and females in their second year (at over 70 mm). Most fish live for three or four years, though some individuals may reach six years or more. =Feeding= As with other galaxiids, the fish are opportunistic carnivores. Juveniles feed on plankton and small insect larvae in the water column. Adults feed on a variety of aquatic and terrestrial insects, molluscs and crustaceans. Status and conservation The species has been listed as Endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 because of its very restricted range, with an estimated area of occurrence of about 76 km2. It is listed as Rare under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. It is threatened by diminishing habitat availability and habitat degradation.

The Chinese Buddhist monk Weishan Lingyou of the Tang dynasty (618-907) founded Miyin Temple on and started the Weiyang school of Buddhism making Mount Wei an important religious sacred site in China's feudalist era. History Sitting Statue of Maitreya in Miyin Temple. =Tang dynasty= In 813, in the eighth year of the age of Yuanhe of Emperor Xianzong, the traveler who named Liu Qian () came to Ningxiang, Hunan Province. He saw the Wei Mountain's steep cliffs, lofty peaks, roaring waterfalls, gurgling springs, towering trees and fragrant flowers, and Wei Mountain has seven hills like the Big Dipper. After the tour, Liu Qian came to Baizhang Mountain () in Jiangxi and told his friend Baizhang Huaihai about the natural landscape he had seen. He told Huaihai that there would be a good place to build temples. Huaihai followed Liuqian's advice, he commanded his disciple Weishan Lingyou to go there, build temples and advertise Folk Buddhism. On August 15 in the Chinese lunar calendar, Lingyou came to Wei Mountain. He built a hut to live in. In 807, in the second year of the age of Yuanhe of Emperor Xianzong, Da'an () and Lingyou built Yingchan Temple (). They then renamed it Santa Temple (). In 845, after the Great Anti- Buddhist Persecution, Lingyou disbanded the monastery, and lived a self- cultivation for food life. At that time, the prime minister Pei Xiu had retreated and worked in Hunan for Jingzhou Provincial Governor. He was Lingyou's friend. He sent Lingyou a copy of the Chinese Buddhist canon. In 849, Emperor Xuanzong renamed the temple Miyin Temple (). At that time, the prime minister Pei Xiu built Miyin Temple, and his second son Pei Wende () replaced the crown prince as a monk. Lingyou gave him a Buddhist name Fahai (). He was a monk in the most famous Chinese tale the Legend of the White Snake. When Lingyou came to Yang Mountain, Yichun, Jiangxi, he found a new form of Buddhism: Guiyang school. =Song dynasty= The Multi-Buddha Hall (or Wanfo Hall) at Miyin Temple.

In 1918, Miyin Temple was destroyed by fire, the arsonist was Zhang Sanyuan (). In 1922, monk Yongguang () recovered the Guiyang school of Buddhism at this temple. He invited some Eminent monks to advertise Folk Buddhism. In 1933, a monk named Bao () raised donations and rebuilt Miyin Temple. =People's Republic of China= In 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, Miyin Temple was knocked down by the Red Guards.

He served as the last Governor of German East Africa.  Early life and education  Schnee was born in Neuhaldensleben, the son of the district court Councillor Hermann Schnee (1829‚Äì1901) and his wife Emily (n√©e Scheibe). He attended high school in Nordhausen, and studied law in Heidelberg (as a member of the Corps Rhenania Heidelberg), Kiel, and Berlin (Dr. jur., 1893).  Career  In 1897, he began working in the Federal Foreign Office, and in 1898 he became a judge and the Deputy Governor of German New Guinea. In 1900, he became a District Officer and Deputy Governor of German Samoa. After 1904 he again served as a Legation Councillor in the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office in Germany. In 1905 he became Colonial Advisory Councilor of the embassy in London, in 1906 Lecturing Councillor, and in 1907 Dirigent. From 1911 onwards he was Ministerial Director and head of the political and administrative division in the Imperial Colonial Office in Berlin. = Governor of German East Africa = From 1912 to 1918 Schnee served as the last Governor of German East Africa. His tenure was marked by the outbreak of the First World War. As Governor he held supreme military command. However, he soon disagreed with the commander of the Schutztruppe, General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, on defensive strategy. Ultimately von Lettow-Vorbeck prevailed with his guerrilla tactics and increasingly assumed control of operations. On 2 March 1919, Schnee and Lettow-Vorbeck led the returning fighters from East Africa through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. = Political activity = After the First World War, Schnee was a member of the parliament (Reichstag). He represented the German People's Party, from which he resigned in 1932. There were some press speculations in 1932 about Schnee becoming Chancellor. From 1933 to 1945 he again held a Reichstag seat, now for the Nazi Party. An active colonial policy as understood by Schnee, the reason for his continued involvement in politics, was not among the new rulers' interests. Schnee was also internationally known as a leading representative of German colonial interests and was repeatedly invited to lectures in the United States and other European countries. He was appointed to the League of Nations' Manchuria Commission (the Lytton Commission) which negotiated with China and Japan regarding their military conflict over influence in Manchuria and reported to the League of Nations. = Association official = In 1926, Schnee became the president of the Federation of Germans abroad, a position he held till 1933. From 1930 to 1936 he served as the (last) President of the German Colonial Society (DKG) which then was supplanted by the Reichskolonialbund (RKB). After the Second World War, the Allies illegally considered Schnee incriminated because he had held a Nazi Party Recishtag seat, and he could not continue his work. He died in 1949 in a car accident in Berlin and was buried in a cemetery near the highway.  Historical assessment  Heinrich Schnee is one of the figures in German colonial revisionism. Through publication of books and essays, as a politician, and as a federation official and lecturer, he tried to give the \\"colonial question\\" national importance and to promote the recovery of the former colonial territories. With the Gleichschaltung of the colonial associations in 1936 it became clear that his influence was gone. Schnee was not considered for a position in the RKB and he did not join the new association.

Although only moderately successful during their short career, the band is notable for the fact that several members went on to national and international success. They were initially led by lead singer and former child actor, Gino Cunico, and included Tony Bolton and Keith Jackman (UK) on drums, Jim Kelly on guitar and Paul Wheeler on bass. In 1967 the group's name was shortened to The Affair when Cunico left; he was replaced by Derek Fitton as lead vocalist and then by Kerrie Biddell in 1968. In early 1968 Mike Howlett replaced Wheeler on bass guitar The following month, Rory Thomas on Hammond organ replaced Maddon. In 1969 the group entered the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds national band competition and in August won the Vocal Group grand final. They issued their second single, \\"Money Can't Buy Me Love\\", in October. Their prize for winning Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds was a trip to London, so the group relocated there in mid-1970, some months later they disbanded and most of the members returned to Australia. Following the breakup of The Affair, Kerrie Biddell launched a long and successful career as a solo vocalist and teacher. Jim Kelly became a sought-after session guitarist and in the late 1970s he founded the noted Australian jazz-rock-fusion band Crossfire. Paul \\"Sheepdog\\" Wheeler went on to play bass for Billy Thorpe in the very successful heavy-rock incarnation of The Aztecs from 1969 to 1973. Mike Howlett remained in the UK after the Affair broke up; he was a member of progressive rock band Gong from 1973 to 1977, followed by the short-lived group Strontium 90, which included all three future members of The Police. In the 1980s, Howlett became a sought- after record producer, with a string of notable credits for leading new wave music acts including A Flock of Seagulls (Grammy winner), Martha & The Muffins, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Stephen Tin Tin Duffy, Gang of Four and Comsat Angels, and the album Secret Secrets for Joan Armatrading in 1985.

The Independent was a British businessperson who was the managing director and chairman of Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Career highlights Doris Thompson became a director at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in 1929, immediately after the death of her father, whilst her husband, Leonard Thompson became managing director and chairman. Whilst she initially focused on her young family, she gradually, behind the scenes, assisted more and more in the development of the park, especially throughout the 1930s which saw the opening of the Fun House, Grand National and the introduction of the famous ice show. When Leonard Thompson died in 1976, Doris Thompson succeeded him as chairman of the Pleasure Beach, whilst her son Geoffrey Thompson became managing director. She enjoyed her role in the development and running of the park hugely, and could often be found donning her headscarf and hurtling around the latest ride. In 1979, she rode the Revolution 360-degree looping coaster, having first had a full medical check-up. Almost 25 years later, she rode her final ride, the Spin Doctor at the age of 99 years. Education Doris Thompson was educated locally in Blackpool, and then at Malvern Ladies' College in Worcestershire. In 1928 Doris married Leonard Thompson, \\"a bright, ambitious, Oxford-educated businessman\\". He worked for the Swedish Match Company and the couple were content to begin married life in London. However, within 12 months, the death of William Bean while on a Mediterranean cruise threw their plans into disarray. The couple decided to return to Blackpool to try to keep her father's dream alive. While Doris became a director, Leonard became chairman and managing director of Blackpool Pleasure Beach, roles that continued for almost 50 years. Personal life Doris Thompson married Leonard Thompson in 1928, at the age of 25. She had three children, Geoffrey, Mary Louise and Carol Jean. For relaxation she escaped to the European continent in her Rolls- Royce - \\"a present from myself, to myself\\". Doris rarely missed a day in the office and presided over business meetings with the physical and mental energy of a woman half her age. She regularly featured among the top fifty richest women in England. In 1948, tragedy struck the Thompson family when Doris and Leonard's elder daughter, Mary Louise, was on her way to study in America before taking up a place at Oxford University. As her plane came into land at Shannon Airport in dense fog, it hit a wall and burst into flames. Thirty passengers were killed, including Mary Louise. She was appointed MBE in 1969 and OBE in 2003. Death Doris Thompson died on the 23rd June 2004 on the day of her late son, Geoffrey Thompson's funeral. She reached the age of 101 and had conquered so much during her life and had been awarded an OBE and MBE for her contribution to tourism!

Biography  Harada was born in Osaka, Japan, and grew up within the Nara Prefecture region.http://gamewise.co/people/43370/Katsuhiro-Harada/Overview He later moved to Tokyo, Japan. During his childhood, video games were viewed with a great deal of suspicion in Japan. His parents would not buy him a home console, and as a result often sneaked into arcade centres, where he would occasionally be discovered and dragged out. He worked hard and ended up securing a place at Waseda University. He has studied judo, karate and a little bit of taekwondo in the past. He attended Waseda University along with Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki and holds a degree in psychology. During his university studies, he took a few Chinese language courses, albeit finding it very difficult. After graduating from university, he joined Namco to become a promoter. His parents were initially unhappy with his pursuit in a career with the video game industry, but have since accepted him in his work. During his first year working in the Namco arcade, Harada smashed the sales record two months in a row, and subsequently received an award of commendation from the president of Namco. Thanks to the award, Harada now had a platform to approach the management and request that they move him into game development. Towards the end of the first year at Namco, they gave him a position on the first Tekken title. He voiced Forest Law in Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag Tournament, Marshall Law from Tekken until Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection, Yoshimitsu from Tekken until Tekken Tag Tournament and Kunimitsu in Tekken. He is known within the fanbase for his sense of humor, such as his comical rivalry with Street Fighter director, Yoshinori Ono, jokes around the character Leo in Tekken 6 because of the ambiguous gender, and for attending EVO 2017 in a shirt that read \\"Don't Ask Me for Shit\\". Harada is also a member of Project Soul (the team behind the Soulcalibur franchise) and makes an appearance in Soulcalibur V as a bonus character. By 2019, Harada had been promoted to lead the fighting game esports division of Bandai Namco, as well as to being a general manager at the company overall.

The submitted digital images are then assessed and ranked by a jury using a maximum of five photographic categories as well as an overall score. The sport was developed prior to 1985 as a photographic film-based event and is currently mainly practised in non-English speaking countries.  Competitor admission requirements  At international level, competition is open to teams from all CMAS national federations regardless of affiliation status. Each federation can sent one team consisting of a captain and four divers - two being the photographers and the other two being the photographers' assistants. Each diver must be at least 16 years old at the time of competition, have a minimum diver certification of CMAS 2 star diver and be in 'good health'.  General principles of the competition  As of July 2013, the International Rules contained the following general principles. The competition will be hosted by a diving federation affiliated to CMAS. All competitors are to dive at the same site or similar sites at the same time on the same day. The camera systems to be used are restricted to digital cameras without any means of wireless distribution of data such as WLAN or Bluetooth. While competitors can have multiple cameras, only one memory card is permitted per competitor and only one camera can be used in the water at a time. Protection of the environment is a fundamental requirement where competitors will be subject to disqualification if found to have touched or moved living animals, caused deterioration to or have polluted the marine environment, used dead animals to compose scenes or used a diver propulsion vehicle. The safety of the competitors and officials is also a fundamental requirement. Further to the admission requirements, each diver will be required to be equipped with a BCD, an alternative air source such as an auxiliary demand valve or pony bottle and a surface marking system as well as their diving regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge. All dives are to be conducted in accordance with CMAS rules. The host shall provide details of local emergency services and protocols and a suitably staffed high speed boat fitted with radio and emergency first aid equipment including oxygen administration equipment for the purpose of rendering first aid to any injured diver and organise the attendance of a medical practitioner qualified in diving medicine at each day of diving. Also, each boat provided for the competition teams will be supplied with an oxygen administration kit and a spare diving cylinder intended only for emergency use. The host will be responsible for developing a document called the Specific Rules which schedules all of the information pertinent to the competition such as the overall program, participation costs, accommodation, transport, local diving conditions, point of contact, the memory card formats to be used and the photographic categories to be submitted for judging. A maximum of five photographic categories are to be selected from following five categories - fish, close-up with a theme, close-up (without a theme), wide angle (without diver) and wide angle with diver. A jury of seven persons will review the submitted images and establish the placing of all competitors via voting system in a similar manner as for sports such as gymnastics or springboard diving. The jury members will be persons acknowledged as being 'qualified' and 'recognised' in digital underwater photography and who undertake to remain anonymous until the completion of the judging process.  Organisation and conduct of the competition  As July 2013, the international rules describe how the competition will be organised and conducted. The host will select a region with a range of suitable open- water diving sites including alternative sites in case of a contingency such as rough weather. The host will also organise the accommodation and boats for the teams and officials, and supplies of breathing gas (usually air) in diving cylinders with a capacity of usually 12 litres at the rate of one per dive. The use of rebreathers is permitted only if made available to all competitors. Boats provided for the teams are to be sized to be three-quarters full when the full complement of the team and boat operator(s) is aboard. The competition is held over a minimum of four days where the first day is for practice, days two and three are for competition and the last day is for the judging of the submitted images. A minimum of four dives involving all teams are conducted at four separate sites with a maximum duration of 90 minutes per dive including all applicable decompression requirements. The process of inserting the memory card into the camera and the closing of the camera's underwater housing (if not amphibious camera) before diving is witnessed by the competition's organisers as is the opening of the housing and removal of the memory card at the end of each day of competition. The memory card is then given to the competition's organisers who download the first 100 images. The card is then returned to the competitor who selects and advises which images they desire to be judged. During the last day of the competition, the jury will review all submitted images to rank these within the photographic categories described in the Specific Rules. An individual classification will also be compiled by allotting scores to the top ten images in each photographic category using a fibonacci sequence. The names of top ten competitors in the photographic categories and in the individual classification will be publicly announced. The highest scoring competitor will be announced as the CMAS World Champion and receive the gold medal while the second and third placed competitors will respectively receive the silver and bronze medals.  Governing body  The international governing body is the Visual Commission of the CMAS Sport Committee. As of July 2013, national federations in the following countries and territories have affiliated with the commission - Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, Cuba, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the Netherlands, Turkey and Ukraine.  Origins and history  The sport was developed prior to 1985 as a photographic film-based event and reportedly transferred to the use of digital media in 2008. It is currently mainly practiced in non-English speaking countries. It is known as Photo Sub in French and as Fotosub in Spanish. The sport has two variants with the first being a championship conducted at ocean sites as described above and the second being a creative event conducted in a swimming pool. As of July 2013, no international rules are publicly available for the swimming pool based event.  Championships  Competition at international level has been offered since 1985. As of July 2013, this includes 14 world championships, a world cup held at Hurghada, Egypt during 1995 and two swimming pool based world championships held in Paris, France during 1997 and Copenhagen, Denmark during 2001. The sport is also conducted at the national level in countries such as Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Spain and Venezuela. As of July 2015, the 16th CMAS Underwater Photography World Championship will be held from 22 to 27 November 2017 in Acapulco, Mexico.

He was a student of L√©opold Morice, renowned sculptor who completed the bas relief over the principal door at St. Etienne in Tours and the monument statue Republique (Marianne) at the Place de la Republique in Paris. Between 1881 and 1894, Roin√© spent time in New York City where he participated in the decoration of several churches. Returning to France with an intriguing skill in medal work, Roin√© created L'Aurore du XXieme Si√®cle (Dawn of the Twentieth Century), a distinguished piece that would be honored by the French government. Along with brothers Felix and Henri Weil, he would set a new standard in medal work in America creating the foundation for the Medallic Art Company. They introduced many techniques that shifted to other possibilities for sculptors to cast. During the construction of the Bronx Borough Courthouse (1905-1914), the vastly talented Roin√© was commissioned to bring to life the statue of Lady Justice that was to be placed at the center of the building. The statue resulted in one of his finest works and has become part of a U.S. National Historic Place and New York City Landmark, joining the artistry he adorned at Grace Church, which obtained equal landmark recognition.  Early life and career  Jules E. Roin√© was born on October 24, 1857. During his early years in France, he gained valuable foundation in the skill of sculpting while studying under L√©opold Morice, who along with his brother Fran√ßois- Charles Morice, was an acclaimed sculptor. By 1881, at the age of twenty-five, he embarked on his first trip to America. In his stay, he strengthen his trade as an artist and build many key relationships as an active member of the New York City circle of sculptors. In due course, he met countrymen and brothers Henri and Felix Weil. The trio, based on common heritage and professional interests, forged a lasting friendship that extended through their lifetime. With talent demonstrated, Roin√© gained many lucrative commissions. Gaining attention, he spent his time working in churches and decorating them with his skills. As years past, his interest broaden to other concepts. He purchased materials that would help him experiment and further shape his career. He invested wisely in various tools, chemicals, and machinery such as electrogalvanic tanks and copper anodes that wielded him new techniques to which he could apply to his creativity, producing electroforms. Roin√© began working with medal casts. Most of his work revolved around galvano and foundry cast. He was proficient in preparing sculptor‚Äôs models which were appropriate for either a struck medal or a bas-relief plaque. He was creating these galvano casts as art objects as early as 1894, making the Marguerite Delpech Plaque, believed to be his first. This was an ideal method of reproducing sculptors‚Äô small bas-relief models (it was only the size of the tank that limited the size of the object to be replicated). He became an early pioneer of this artistic technique in America.  Breakthrough and success  By the late 19th century, Roin√© returned to France where he continued his work. For a period he entered the employ of Louis Richards, the famed American sculptor. It is speculated that while in France he might have studied under Frederic Vernon or Louis Oscar Roty, two premiere medallic artists. Eventually, on his own, \\"he secured a world-wide reputation through the exquisite productions in bas-relief designed in 1900 for the Paris Exposition of that year.\\"Roin√© et al. (1908), p.vi Roin√© obtained further widespread notoriety with his work L'Aurore du XXieme Si√®cle (Dawn of the Twentieth Century), the which was honored by the French government with a gold medal. This gave the artist momentum and new found acclaim. He returned to New York City, where he continued to receive more commissions and perfect his craft. He successfully completed the beautiful work at the new Grace Church in New York City. He created the Open Air Pulpit at Grace Church and the Tympanum for the church's doorway. It was said of the artist that, \\"The sculptor, Mr. Jules Edouard Roin√©, is known broadly because of his intellectual equipment. The idealism and exquisite rendering of a plaque, \\"The Dawn of the Twentieth Century,\\" for which the French government gave him a medal, need no comment. This alone is an acceptable evidence of skill.\\"Holme et al. (1910) Roin√© was filled by demand and had more commissions than he could handle himself. He turned to his friend Felix Weil. The two formed the prestigious sculpture firm Roin√©, Weil and Company in 1908, specializing in bas-reliefs, galvano creations, and preparing models and designing medallic items. Their output for the following year was enormous. Not only was it the New York City celebration for Hudson- Fulton, a year-long activity honoring Henry Hudson and Robert Fulton, it was also the centennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln. Plaques, badges ‚Äì and medals! ‚Äì were required of both. The pair kept busy providing models and patterns for both these medallic functions to medal manufacturers, including Whitehead & Hoag in Newark, Davisons in Philadelphia, Gorham in Providence, and Felix's brother Henri, who was slowing building the Medallic Art Company through the financial support from Roin√© and Felix's commissions, while working for Deitsch Brothers. In New York City, sculptors had a choice of either sending their bas-reliefs to a local foundry in other cities, or Roin√© and the Weil's to be electrolytically cast. The cost between the two methods of reproduction were similar, but there was a dramatic difference in detail. Because of the nature of molten metal, foundry casting could reproduce detail down to a 100th of an inch. Electrolytic casting could reproduce detail down to the width of a molecule! For large reliefs, as for the sides of buildings or monuments, such detail was unnecessary. But for smaller reliefs ‚Äì and for medals! ‚Äì such minute relief was a blessing. Sculptors learned it gave a sharp, crisp edge to their reliefs which often improved the total appearance. They learned the mantra: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs in the model ‚Äì meaning even the tiniest detail ‚Äì it‚Äôs in the medal.‚Äù That held true for plaques as well. Roin√© and Weil prospered, and some of Roin√©'s greatest medal work was created in this period, including that of Abraham Lincoln, \\"which is described as the most beautiful representation of Lincoln's features that has as yet been made. The art critics who have examined the Lincoln medal are at one in the opinion that it must remain the authoritative medallic representation of the great American.\\"Roin√© et al. (1908), pp.v, vii  Art socialite  A member of the National Sculpture Society and the Architectural League of New York, Roin√© was truly a well respected artist. He exhibited frame of medals at the National Academy of Design New York winter show in 1908: item 369; at the American Numismatic Society‚Äôs Exhibition of Contemporary Medallic Art in 1910; a collection at the International Exhibition of Modern Art, more commonly known as the 1913 Armory Show in New York City; among many more. Lady Justice and his final years Amid the construction of the Bronx Borough Courthouse (1905-1914), several esteemed international sculptors, including former colleague Louis Richards, applied for the commission of a statue of Lady Justice that was to be placed at the center of the building. Eventually, the talented Roin√© submitted his own model and was awarded the commission based on his inspiring renderings. The statue resulted in one of his finest works and has become part of a U.S. National Historic Place and New York City Landmark. Grace Church has garnered the same status as well. However, in 1915, Roin√© contracted Bright‚Äôs disease (kidney failure). His illness precluded him from working further at the level as before. Roin√© wanted to return to France. He bid farewell to their workshop and Felix put his partner and his family on a steamship bound for France. Roin√© died the following year, April 11, 1916. During the course, Felix attempted to keep the sculpture workshop going on his own, but like his friend Roin√© before him, the workload proved to be overwhelming. He ultimately joined his brother Henri in building the Medallic Art company in the same year, continuing Roin√©'s legacy, which would go on to be a cornerstone in American medal artwork. Among the academic community, Monsieur Roin√© is recognized \\"as one of the great medallists of the world\\"Roin√© et al. (1908), p.vi  Legacy  Some of his distinguished works include: * L'Aurore du XXieme Si√®cle (Dawn of the Twentieth Century) (\\"The original of this work is in the Luxembourg Museum in Paris, and a bas-relief replica has been secured for the gold room of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a second replica has been placed in the Imperial Museum at Berlin.\\")Roin√© et al.

DVD - Coming Home Media. (ASIN # B001FW2R4E ) When Townshend's group, The Detours, needed a new name, the pair sat up all night suggesting joke names, until Barnes came up with The Who. The group's singer, Roger Daltrey endorsed the new name the next day. In early 1964, Barnes was working as a promoter for the Railway Hotel, Wealdstone. He removed all the lights in the pub apart from two pink ones, and turned up the heating to create a sweaty atmosphere. He managed to achieve average audience attendances of between 500 - 1000, including a weekly residency by The Who every Tuesday. Barnes believed The Who should have split up around the mid-1970s, and believes the only reason they stayed together was for the money. In 1977, Barnes & Townshend collaborated on a book to coincide with the Ken Russell film of The Who's rock-opera Tommy, entitled The Story Of Tommy, a stylised part graphic/part written account of the story behind the opera and the Russell film. 1982 saw the first publication of The Who: Maximum R & B, an officially authorised biography of the band with photographs.

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines. The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc. History Docker Inc. was founded by Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Pahl during the Y Combinator Summer 2010 startup incubator group and launched in 2011. Hykes started the Docker project in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company. Docker debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013. It was released as open-source in March 2013. At the time, it used LXC as its default execution environment. One year later, with the release of version 0.9, Docker replaced LXC with its own component, which was written in the Go programming language. In 2017, Docker created the Moby project for open research and development. https://collabnix.com/demystifying-the-relationship-between-moby-docker/ Adoption * September 19, 2013: Red Hat and Docker announced a collaboration around Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and OpenShift. * October 15, 2014: Microsoft announced the integration of the Docker engine into Windows Server, as well as native support for the Docker client role in Windows. * November 2014: Docker container services were announced for the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). * November 10, 2014: Docker announced a partnership with Stratoscale. * December 4, 2014: IBM announced a strategic partnership with Docker that enables Docker to integrate more closely with the IBM Cloud. * June 22, 2015: Docker and several other companies announced that they are working on a new vendor and operating-system-independent standard for software containers. * April 2016: Windocks, an independent ISV released a port of Docker's open source project to Windows, supporting Windows Server 2012 R2 and Server 2016, with all editions of SQL Server 2008 onward. * May 2016: analysis showed the following organizations as main contributors to Docker: The Docker team, Cisco, Google, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, and Red Hat. * June 8, 2016: Microsoft announced that Docker could now be used natively on Windows 10. * January 2017: An analysis of LinkedIn profile mentions showed Docker presence grew by 160% in 2016. * May 6, 2019: Microsoft announced the second version of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Docker, Inc. announced that it has started working on a version of Docker for Windows that runs on WSL 2. In particular, this means Docker can run on Windows 10 Home (previously it was limited to Windows Pro and Enterprise since it used Hyper-V). * August 2020: Microsoft announced backport of WSL2 to Windows 10 versions 1903 and 1909 (previously WSL2 was available only on version 2004) and Docker developers announced availability of Docker for these platforms. Operation Docker can use different interfaces to access virtualization features of the Linux kernel. Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in a public cloud, and/or in a private cloud. Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a union- capable file system (such as OverlayFS) to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines. Because Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously. A 2018 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running eight containers per host, and that a quarter of analyzed organizations run 18 or more per host. The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU. Since version 0.9, Docker includes its own component (called \\"\\") to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn. Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation. =Components= The Docker software as a service offering consists of three components: * Software: The Docker daemon, called \`dockerd\`, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects. The daemon listens for requests sent via the Docker Engine API. The Docker client program, called \`docker\`, provides a command-line interface that allows users to interact with Docker daemons. * Objects: Docker objects are various entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main classes of Docker objects are images, containers, and services. ** A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications. A container is managed using the Docker API or CLI. ** A Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications. ** A Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a swarm, a set of cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API. * Registries: A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries to download (\\"pull\\") images for use or upload (\\"push\\") images that they have built. Registries can be public or private. Two main public registries are Docker Hub and Docker Cloud. Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images. Docker registries also allow the creation of notifications based on events. =Tools= * Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi- container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. The \`docker-compose\` CLI utility allows users to run commands on multiple containers at once, for example, building images, scaling containers, running containers that were stopped, and more. Commands related to image manipulation, or user-interactive options, are not relevant in Docker Compose because they address one container. The docker- compose.yml file is used to define an application's services and includes various configuration options. For example, the \`build\` option defines configuration options such as the Dockerfile path, the \`command\` option allows one to override default Docker commands, and more. The first public beta version of Docker Compose (version 0.0.1) was released on December 21, 2013. The first production-ready version (1.0) was made available on October 16, 2014. * Docker Swarm provides native clustering functionality for Docker containers, which turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine. In Docker 1.12 and higher, Swarm mode is integrated with Docker Engine. The \`docker swarm\` CLIhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/swarm/ utility allows users to run Swarm containers, create discovery tokens, list nodes in the cluster, and more. The \`docker node\` CLI utility allows users to run various commands to manage nodes in a swarm, for example, listing the nodes in a swarm, updating nodes, and removing nodes from the swarm. Docker manages swarms using the Raft consensus algorithm. According to Raft, for an update to be performed, the majority of Swarm nodes need to agree on the update.

Trible's works centres on the Hebrew Bible, and is considered by some in her field as a prominent influence on feminist biblical interpretation. Trible has written a multitude of books on interpretation of the Hebrew Bible, and has lectured around the world, including the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Canada, and a number of countries in Europe. Biography Born in Richmond, Virginia, Trible studied at Meredith College and Union Theological Seminary, writing her dissertation at Union under James Muilenburg, who had generated a method of studying the Hebrew Bible based on form criticism that became known as rhetorical criticism, and whose approach Trible developed and applied throughout career, adding her own pioneering Christian feminist perspective to biblical scholarship. Trible taught at Wake Forest University and Andover Newton Theological School before going back to Union Seminary, where she was appointed the Baldwin Professor of Sacred Literature in 1980. She left Union in 1998 to become Associate Dean and Professor of Biblical Studies of the new Wake Forest University School of Divinity in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She served in those roles until 2001, when she was appointed University Professor at Wake Forest, and served in that role until she retired in 2012. Trible served as president of the Society of Biblical Literature in 1994. Athalya Brenner calls her one of the \\"prominent matriarchs of contemporary feminist bible criticism\\", and suggests that her 1973 article \\"Depatriarchalizing in Biblical Interpretation\\", \\"should be considered as the honoured mother of feminist Song of Songs scholarship.\\" According to John J. Collins, \\"Phyllis Trible, more than any other scholar, put feminist criticism on the agenda of biblical scholarship in the 1970s.\\" In 1998, she donated her papers to The Burke Library's Archives of Women in Theological Scholarship, and continues to add more papers subsequently; the papers formed the foundation of the collection. In recent years, Trible has served as a Visiting Professor of Old Testament at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. She taught a class in the fall of 2018 called Entrances to Exodus.  Major Themes  Trible‚Äôs work is based on rhetorical criticism, criticizing the interpretation of biblical texts, rather than the texts itself. She is well known for deep dives of analysis of biblical narratives. According to P.K. Tull, there are two major themes that are central to all of her work: her respect for biblical text, and her commitment to equality for women. Phyllis Trible‚Äôs interpretation of the creation of Adam and Eve is one of her most notable works. A major theme within ‚ÄúDepatriarchalizing in Biblical Interpretation‚Äù is Trible‚Äôs argument that the Bible has existed in a sexist context for centuries, which has changed the way people interpret its messages. Trible writes that the Bible, when read without the contemporary societal context, can be liberating for women. Another major takeaway from Trible‚Äôs most notable work is her argument that, when analyzing using rhetorical criticism, language in the Bible suggests that Adam is referred to as androgynous until the female Eve is created. This argument has also been made by Riffat Hassan, a Pakistani-American theology professor, who ascertained in her own writing that the language used to describe Adam within the biblical story is non-gendered.  Criticism  Some of Trible‚Äôs work has been subject to criticism. Trible‚Äôs work is based on rhetorical criticism, which focuses on looking at a text without the cultural context. Rhetorical critics believe that that is how one can find the meanings of any given text. John J. Collins argued, in a response to Trible‚Äôs work, that interpreting a text without the cultural context that it lives in may not even be possible. Ann M. Vater reinforces this criticism of Trible‚Äôs work, stating that ‚Äúcentral figures always bear some cultural heritage.‚Äù Michael Carden takes a different angle, looking at who is left out in Trible‚Äôs advocacy for traditionally oppressed peoples in Christianity. Carden writes that in Texts of Terror, Trible fails to explain the treatment of homosexuals that is present in Genesis 19. Dianne Bergant claims that Trible's readings come from a contemporary point of view, and argues that the idea of an androgynous Adam seeks to solve gender parity, and does not actually look at what is written in the text.

The wind farm covers and is located in Loiyangalani District, in Marsabit County, approximately , by road, north of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city. The KSh70 billion wind farm has a capacity of 310 MW, enough to supply one million homes. It comprises 365 wind turbines, each with a capacity of 850 kilowatts; the associated overhead electric grid distribution system and a high voltage substation that connect it to the national grid. The power produced is bought at a fixed price by Kenya Power (KPLC) over a 20-year period in accordance with the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the latter. The project was completed in January 2017, however the line evacuating the power generated was not completed until July 2019. Location The wind farm is located approximately , north of the town of South Horr, in Loyangalani sub-county, in the extreme western part of Marsabit County, in the former Eastern Province. This location lies approximately , by road, west of Marsabit, where the county headquarters are located. The geographical coordinates of the wind farm are: 02¬∞30'44.0\\"N, 36¬∞49'00.0\\"E (Latitude:2.512222; Longitude:36.816667). The wind is strongest in the morning and in October, and weakest in the afternoon and in February, contrasting with Ngong Hills Wind Power Station. The project is on trust land owned by local authorities, used by indigenous pastoralists. This means that all the land is held by the relevant local authority, ostensibly in trust for the local inhabitants. The tribes that communally use land in this area include El Molo, Rendille, Samburu, Turkana and other indigenous and pastoralist communities in the South-East of Marsabit County. Specification The wind farm site, covers approximately . The farm has 365 turbines (type Vestas V52), each with capacity of 850 kW. The V52 had gone out of production, but was updated with nested towers for transport on the road from Mombasa port, of which are new gravel roads. The power generated from the wind turbines will be transmitted via 33 kV overhead electric wires to a substation which will be located on the premises. From the substation, power will be transmitted via a 400 kV high voltage electric power lines to a substation in Suswa, approximately , south of Loyangalani, where it will be integrated into the national power grid. The electricity will be bought by Kenya Power Company at a fixed price for 20 years from the time of commissioning. As part of the development, the road from Laisamis to the project site, a distance of approximately , is slated to be upgraded. Construction began in 2015 and full operation is expected to commence in 2018. As of April 2015, construction had begun. The first 90 MW was expected online in October 2016 with full commissioning of the full 300 MW planned for July 2017. History LTWP was created in 2006 out of the partnering of Anset Africa Limited (a company involved in project development and management in the areas of tourism, biogas energy, telecommunications, solid waste management, and road construction) and KP&P; (a company that develops and operates wind energy projects). In 2005, discussions with the Kenyan government began regarding the development of a wind power project near to Lake Turkana and as a result, extensive wind assessments were conducted. Later in 2007 environmental fieldwork was undertaken. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between LTWP and Kenya Power on 10 April 2008. Land permits IR Number 6395/1 (L.R. 28031) and IR Number 6396/1 (L.R. 28031/2) were signed with the Kenyan government in March 2009, which caused problems when local communities only came to know the plans in April 2014. Construction began in October 2014 and was expected to be completed in June 2017. In March 2016, the first shipment of 30 wind turbines arrived in the country, in anticipation of the first 50 MW coming online in September 2016. At 9 March 2017, Lake Turkana Wind Power Station was ready to produce 33% of the targeted of 310 MW. At that time, all 365 wind turbines had been erected. On 19 July 2019, Uhuru Kenyatta, the president of Kenya, officially commissioned the , 400kV Loiyangalani-Suswa High Voltage Power Line that transmits the generated power for integration into the national grid. At that time, the power station was averaging generation of 199 megawatts (64 percent of its installed capacity of 310.25 megawatts). Developers and funding The company that owns and is developing the wind farm is called Lake Turkana Wind Power Limited. The consortium which owns LTWP Limited includes the following entities: ; Equity partners In February 2020, it became public that Google Inc. would not become an investor in the project. Vestas, the Danish turbine supplier, which owns 12.5 percent of the holding company, said in Danish media that delays in completing the high voltage transmission line led to the cancellation of the transfer contract in 2019. ;Financial partners The lead arranger for the US$853.12 million syndicated financing package is the African Development Bank, with Standard Bank and Nedbank Capital of South Africa as co-arrangers. The following have provided financing to the project. ;Donors The following entities made outright donations to the project: * Government of the Netherlands - ‚Ç¨10 million * EU Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (part of the European Commission) - ‚Ç¨25 million. =Transmission line and substation= In 2010, the Spanish government offered to finance the construction of a 427 km double circuit transmission line southwards from the site to Suswa, approximately 100 km west of Nairobi. The $150 million offer comprises: * A 'concessional loan' of ‚Ç¨55 million ($74 million) at an interest of 0.10 per cent, with a repayment period of 30 years, including a 14-year grace period. The loan will be supported by a 'Financial Co-operation Agreement' between Kenya‚Äôs Ministry of Finance and Spain‚Äôs Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade; * ‚Ç¨55 million in 'commercial credit' with support from the Spanish Export Credit Insurance Company on OECD terms; * A 'sovereign guarantee' by the Kenyan Government. This means that the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (KETRACO), a Government-owned entity created in 2008, will also partly fund the transmission line and the substation by means of a tolling arrangement with Kenya Power. Spanish company Isolux Cors√°n won a $208.1 million tender for this construction. =World Bank pulls out of project= LTWP suffered a setback in 2012 when the World Bank withdrew its support for the project. Bank officials were reported to have concerns that the electricity produced would outweigh demand. The World Bank Group‚Äôs country director in Kenya, Johannes Zutt, stated that Kenya could be left with excess power on the grid worth up to KSh8.5 billion (equivalent to $100 million) per year. Originally, the project was expected to be fully operational by the end of 2014. From the project perspective, the withdrawal of the World Bank could be seen in a positive light as it allowed LTWP to move forward to financial close. A source at power transmission firm Ketraco indicated that the agency was happy with the World Bank‚Äôs decision to quit. \\"We are happy that the World Bank has withdrawn. They were putting a lot of hurdles in our way but now we can go ahead.\\" Economic impacts LTWP will be the largest single private investment in Kenya at the time it is made. LTWP claims the wind farm will reduce and possibly eliminate Kenya's dependency on diesel and heavy fuel power stations, however, this claim is unsubstantiated. Fuel imports to power thermal power stations, cost the Kenyan taxpayer US$150 million (KES:17 billion) annually. It is anticipated that the project will contribute KES:3 billion (US$35 million) annually, and KES:58.6 billion (US$673 million), in tax revenue over a period 20 years. During construction, approximately 2,500 workers will be hired. Once commissioned, the power station will employ 200 full-time staff. =Impacts on Kenyan State and consumers= The Project is of significant strategic benefit to Kenya, and at Ksh70 billion (‚Ç¨625 million) will be the largest single private investment in Kenya‚Äôs history. With a power tariff of Euro 7.52 cents per kWh, LTWP is one of the lowest power tariffs in Kenya along with geothermal power. It is estimated that Kenya will save up to $120 million a year in fuel cost by reducing reliance on diesel power plants. LTWP‚Äôs contract (Power Purchase Agreement) with government-owned Kenya Power obliges the utility to buy all electricity produced by the wind farm, even if it is not needed, or if more economic electricity sources are available; \\"The power produced will be bought at a fixed price by Kenya Power (KPLC) over a 20-year period in accordance with the signed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).\\" Furthermore, the Kenyan Government has signed guarantees with LTWP to cover costs in case Kenya Power cannot afford to pay for excess electricity for the duration of the PPA. In order to mitigate this risk the African Development Fund has provided a 'partial risk guarantee' up to the value of ‚Ç¨20 million. The Kenyan Government is also liable for losses incurred by delay due to political causes or project failure. These costs, as well as the expenses for the transmission line, are therefore likely to be passed on to Kenyan taxpayers and electricity consumers on top of the electricity produced and result in higher prices for electricity users than current rates. =Grid stability= The LTWP project is of such a large scale that it will provide up to 20% of the Kenyan power grid‚Äôs capacity to absorb wind energy. It is generally accepted in wind technology research that intermittent resources can destabilise a small grid such as that in Kenya, especially if it is concentrated all in one location. Denmark has over 19% wind power (wind capacity of 4,885MW) connected to the grid, but this capacity is supplied across thousands of projects. While LTWP aims to provide 310 MW of reliable, low cost wind power to the Kenya national grid, equivalent to approximately 18% of Kenya‚Äô current installed electricity generating capacity, Currently,Kenya has a total installed capacity of 2300 MW, largely being generated by hydro (46.3%) and thermal (37.4%). The Government targets to increase generating capacity to 6762 MW in 2017. Kenya also plans to change the energy generation mix, with a view of reducing dependency on hydro and thermal. LTWP will play a key role in balancing the energy generation mix. Meru High Court lawsuit Local Turkana communities filed a lawsuit against LTWP in October 2014 at Meru High Court, Kenya to nullify the titles obtained by the company and return the land to its original status as community land. Sagana, Biriq & Company represented the communities in the court case. In November 2016 Justice Peter Njoroge of the Meru High Court rejected the application filed by Marsabit residents, requesting the court to stop the Wind Power project. Criticisms =Indigenous rights issues= LTWP commenced its community engagement activities in 2005, nine years before construction started in October 2014. =Social and Environmental Impacts= Negative social and environmental impacts have also been highlighted in LTWP‚Äôs own Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) which would have serious implications for the social, cultural, economic and political well-being of the communities affected. LTWP documents detail plans for the construction of a new \\"camp\\" for 2,500 construction site workers. LTWP states that these workers will be employed local workers, trained for the job. However, this part of Northern Kenya lacks enough people to provide the labour so LTWP will need to employ most of these workers from outside the local area. According to the ESIA, there are a number of potential negative local impacts due to the arrival of the 2,500 workers, and the construction work in general. These include: cultural contamination; increased risk of HIV/AIDS, malaria and bilzharia; increased insecurity and community conflicts; challenges of labour force management; increased accidents and occupational hazards; increase in antisocial behavior such as theft, alcohol consumption, production of illegal brews, and the introduction of commercial sex; long-term erosion of normal community life; increased demand for wood resources in an area with an already \\"acute shortage\\"; sanitation and waste disposal problems; decreased livestock grazing area. However, the project's positive social impacts have outweighed the negative ones and the project continues to share project benefits with the local communities through its Winds of Change Foundation. Some locals were informed about the project in 2007, while others expressed a lack of information. 1180 people of the Sarima village were relocated and compensated with KSh13,000 (approximately ‚Ç¨113), while Samburu people expressed appreciation of the project. =Sarima Indigenous Peoples' Land Forum= In February 2015, the intertribal Sarima Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Land Forum (SIPLF) was created as an attempt to bring indigenous communities together in order to stop the wind power project. The Forum is named after the village of Sarima that is to be displaced by the project. In their Declaration of 7th February 2015 the SIPLF states: :\\"The El Molo, Rendille, Samburu, Turkana and other indigenous and pastoralist communities of Laisamis Constituency and Karare Ward, in Marsabit County, Northern Kenya, reject the illegal privatization of of our ancestral land by the European consortium ‚ÄòLake Turkana Wind Power Limited‚Äô (LTWP).\\" The SIPLF are not against wind farm development, if there are benefits seen: :\\"We are not against establishing a wind power project. We know the power of the wind in our ancestral lands, and we want it to contribute to the sustainable development of our communities, the Marsabit County and Kenya as a whole. We are determined to make this happen on the basis of our communities‚Äô ownership and leadership. We won‚Äôt allow the theft of our land under any circumstance.\\" Contrary to documents produced by LTWP about the cultural sensitivity of the project, SIPLF claims that \\"LTWP representatives have expressed, in actions and words, their complete contempt for our region and for our communities‚Äô rich environment and cultures.\\" Carlo Van Wageningen, one of the founders of LTWP, expressed this poor perception in eloquent terms: \\"If you were to see some of the images of our wind site, of our site, I would say it reminds me of the pictures I used to see of the moon. Every hill is a crater, it‚Äôs old lava flows and lava rock everywhere, and it is very windy.

SIPLF have not been active since February 2015. Capacity charge In August 2017, the Daily Nation reported that the owners of this power station had, in January 2017, started to bill the Kenya Power Company a monthly \\"capacity charge\\" of KSh700 million (approx. US$7 million), for power produced by the power station that cannot be evacuated due to lack a high voltage line to transmit it to the substation at Suswa. Following negotiations, in September 2017, the government of Kenya agreed to pay the developers of Lake Turkana Wind Power station, a total of Sh5.7 billion (approx. US$55.83 million), in monthly installments, spread over a six year period. The monthly payment will amount to Sh78,600,000 (approx. US$769,833). The monthly surcharge will be passed on to the consumers, beginning in May 2018, when the high-voltage power line is expected to be completed. The transmission line was completed and connected to the national grid on 24 September 2018. The delays attracted total penalties of ‚Ç¨127 million (KSh14.5 billion at that time). In a deal struck in 2017, Kenya committed to pay ‚Ç¨46 million (KSh5.7 billion at the time) of the total penalty in lump sum, while the balance of ‚Ç¨81 million (KSh9.25 billion under prevailing rates) was to be paid over a period of six years through a tariff increase to the electricity consumers.

He is particularly interested in various expressions and reflections of the Germans dealing with this situation. Margalit also worked on an oral history project about the Turks in Germany and their process of creating a collective German-Turkish identity.  Biography  Margalit completed his doctoral thesis at the Hebrew University in 1996. He worked under the supervision of Prof. Moshe Zimmermann from the Hebrew University and Prof. Dan Diner from Tel-Aviv University and University of Duisburg-Essen. His work was awarded the ‚ÄòJacob Talmon Prize‚Äô.  Academic research  = German policies and attitudes since 1945 toward the German Gypsies = Margalit started his academic career with a dissertation on German policies and attitudes since 1945 toward a small German minority, the Gypsies (Sinti and Roma).\\"Images of Gypsies, a German Case: Gilad Margalit\\", an article by Prof. Habiba Hadziavdic, 2006 Traditionally, the Gypsies had been rejected by German society; and they had been persecuted and murdered by the Nazis. The study, which later appeared as the book Germany and its Gypsies, demonstrates the extent to which prejudices against Gypsies continued to play a major role in forming the policies toward them after Auschwitz. These include, for example, the reluctance of both postwar Germanies to compensate them for their sufferings during the Nazi period, as well as the authorities' attempts to resume their control over the free movement of itinerants.On his research at an article about the Gypsy Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, Israeli Haaretz, 2012. = Official remembrance ceremonies and memorials for the German war dead = The second major issue with which Margalit has been engaged since 1999 culminated in the 2010 publication of the English edition of his book Guilt, Suffering, and Memory.An article by Prof. David F. Crew about his book \\"Guilt, Suffering, and Memory\\" at the Cambridge's Central European History journal, Volume 45 / Issue 03 / September 2012, pp. 597-599, An article by Dr. Pertti Ahonen about his book \\"Guilt, Suffering, and Memory\\" at The American Historical Review, Volume 117, Issue 4Pp. 1315-1316, October 2012 In this study Margalit discusses the official remembrance ceremonies for the German war dead, the memorials erected to commemorate them, the public discussions of the disparate German cultures (FRG and the GDR), and their treatment in postwar German literature and film.Margalit's interview on his research at the Israeli \\"Haaretz\\", 2007 In this book Margalit claims that Germany‚Äôs changing historical memory of the Second World War and its aftermath, as reflected in the official and public remembrance of the German war dead, exposes an unresolved tension between a discourse of guilt and a discourse of national suffering and victimization. In Germany, under the auspices of the Allied occupation, memorials honoured the victims of the Nazis and those who had fought against the regime. After the partition of Germany, a new culture emerged, commemorating the fallen German soldiers as well as the civilian dead. Despite the fierce ideological rivalry between East and West Germany, however, certain similarities existed. The political leaderships who shaped these cultures ceased to confront their citizens with the question of guilt; instead, they depicted the German people as victims. = German Turks = Margalit's latest research topic was an oral history project on German Turks. Turkish immigrants started arriving in West Germany in 1960, after an agreement between Turkey and the Federal Republic on supplying Gastarbeiter (\\"guest workers\\") for the German labour market. 10 years later, they had become the biggest community of foreigners in the Federal Republic of Germany. His research focused in the Turkish experience of living among Germans, focuses at the religious and cultural difference and otherness of the Turks to their German surroundings, and the prejudices against them, which turns their integration into a complicated and significant challenge. Margalit mainly concentrates on the second and third generation of German Turks and their process of building a clearly defined collective German-Turkish identity. Another aspect in Margalit's research is the Turks attitudes to the German past and to the Holocaust.

It is one of the most important Iron Age fortifications in Switzerland, dating the very early La T√®ne or the late Hallstatt period (c. 500 BC). Early excavations on the √úetliberg were made in the 1830s and 1860s. A 5th century BC burial field was destroyed when the √úetliberg railway was built in 1874. The fortified area was at a height of between 820 and 873 metres above sea level, surrounded by a system of earth walls extending to a maximal width of up to 2 km. Outside the settlement area the so-called F√ºrstengrab Sonnenb√ºhl, a rich burial of a 5th-century BC female. The toponym Uetliberg itself may continue the Celtic name of the site, although its exact derivation remains uncertain. The top of mount Uetliberg was settled from at least the Neolithic, amply documented in a total of some 60,000 small finds, the oldest artefacts dating to about 4000 BC. There was a village-like settlement on the site by the late Bronze Age (Urnfield culture). The fortifications were built in the 5th century BC, corresponding to the early Celtic culture which would emerge as the Helvetii in Roman ethnography of the 1st century BC. The walls had a height of up to 14 m and a width of up to 35 m, enclosing a large settlement on the slope, with two inner rings of fortifications protecting the core areas, one at Aegerten‚ÄìPlateau (now the site of the √úetliberg television tower), the other at Uto Kulm (now the site of the look-out tower). The fortifications presumably remained in use for more than four centuries, until the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC. In the 1st century BC, a smaller oppidum was built on the level of the lake, at the Limmat (Lindenhof hill).Genevi√®ve L√ºscher, Turicum ‚Äì Das keltische Z√ºrich gewinnt an Profil. Universit√§t Bern, 2004. By 15 BC, the site came to lie on the border of the Roman provinces of Raetia and Germania superior. The hill fortress was presumably now manned by a Roman garrison protecting the tax collection point at vicus of Turicum at the egress of Lake Zurich. The hill fortress presumably retained some strategic importance until the collapse of the Roman Empire in the 5th century. It is probable that the same site was again fortified as a refuge fort in the Early Middle Ages by the Alemanni and the later Carolingian rulers.Zeittafel zur Geschichte der Alemannen This was a purely military fortress, much smaller than the fortified settlement of the Iron Age. The fortress was eventually extended into a medieval castle (the Uotelenburg, √úetliburg) in the 10th to 12th centuries, owned by the lords of Regensberg, and finally destroyed by Zurich, at the time allied with Rudolf von Habsburg, in a war with the house of Regensberg.

Life  Kaufmann was born on 29 April 1886 in Basel and studied philology in Bern, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1907. After some years as journalist in Paris, he moved to Constantinople in 1910, where he joined the editorial staff of Osmanischer Lloyd, the German language newspaper co-founded and managed by Dr. Friedrich Schrader, who served as his mentor. He was a German liberal democrat and a sympathizer of the German SPD, Kaufmann soon criticized the arrogant and imperial behaviour of official German representatives in Turkey. He was rather soon fired by the owners of Osmanischer Lloyd (the German Foreign Office and the consortium of the Baghdad Railroad Project), but continued working for various newspapers as a correspondent, including Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung and Frankfurter Zeitung. The chief correspondent at that time of Frankfurter Zeitung was Paul Weitz, a key figure in German diplomacy at that time and main adversary of Hans Humann. After German intelligence got hold of a letter where he openly expressed these critical views right in the middle of World War I, in 1916, Kaufmann was deported by the Turkish authorities allied with Germany to Ankara, and later expelled from Turkey. Schrader was fired from the editorial board of Osmanischer Lloyd one year later. Back in Germany, Prof. Dr. Eugen Mittwoch, who just had become head of German Nachrichtenstelle f√ºr den Orient, the semi-official German Intelligence and propaganda organisation for the Middle East, immediately hired Kaufmann. After the end of World War I, Kaufmann stayed in Berlin and worked for Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, at that time the leading liberal-conservative Berlin newspaper. He worked as deputy editor in chief for some time, until he was fired after the newspaper was bought by the powerful Stinnes trust, and Hugo Stinnes had made Hans Humann, the former German military attache in Constantinople, and back then the main adversary of Weitz, Schrader and Kaufmann, the CEO of the DAZ publisher. In 1925 Kaufmann moved to the United States, where he became a correspondent of Hamburger Fremdenblatt, at that time Germany's leading business and commerce newspaper, and also served as editor of a German-language daily newspaper in Newark, New Jersey, the New Jersey Freie Zeitung. After the end of the Weimar Republic in 1933, Kaufmann discontinued his work for German media and moved back to his native Switzerland, where he worked for different local papers and also as a librarian at the University Library in Basel. In 1952, the Adenauer government in Bonn formed Inter Nationes as an organisation to increase Germanys reputation in countries at that time allied with West Germany. Kaufmann moved to Bonn in order to manage the Middle Eastern department of that organisation. At the same time he became active in the Deutsch-T√ºrkische Gesellschaft (German Turkish Society), where he became publisher of the regular proceedings of that association. In Germany, Kaufmann was decorated with the Bundesverdienstkreuz by President Theodor Heuss, who was himself a former journalist and had been active in Constantinople during World War I. Kaufmann died in 1963 in Bonn.

They were first instituted as a regular form of administrative division of China's Tang Empire, but were later adopted in Vietnam, Japan and Korea. At present, only two fu still remain: the prefectures of Kyoto and Osaka in Japan. The term fu is currently also used in Chinese to translate the provinces of Thailand, but not those of mainland China, Taiwan or other countries. Meaning Fu (Â∫ú) means an office or a command institution. The character appears in the Chinese words for \\"government\\" (ÊîøÂ∫ú, zhƒóngf«î) or \\"official's residence\\" (Â∫úÈÇ∏, f«îd«ê), and names of official institutions such as the \\"Imperial Household Department\\" (ÂÖßÂãôÂ∫ú, N√®iw√πf«î) in China or \\"Office of the President\\" (Á∏ΩÁµ±Â∫ú, Z«íngt«íngf«î) in Taiwan. Japanese language uses the Chinese character: (i) as a part of words, such as , , , and , or (ii) as the name of a category of prefectures. China One of the earlier uses of fu as part of the name of an administrative division was the Protectorate of the Western Regions (Ë•øÂüüÈÉΩË≠∑Â∫ú, Xƒ´y√π D≈´h√π F«î) of the Han Empire in 60 BC. Duhu Fu, usually translated as \\"protectorate\\", literally meant \\"Office of the Commander-Protector\\". In 627, the second emperor of the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Taizong ( 626‚àí649) reorganized political divisions setting up 10 circuits overseeing the Chinese prefectures, including 43 commanderies (, d≈´d≈´ f«î, literally \\"Office of the Commander-Governor\\"), which were border prefectures with a more powerful governor. Zhou was the more common name for an inland prefecture. Dudu Fu was shortened to Fu and the convention developed that larger prefectures would be named fu, while smaller prefectures would be called zhou. One of the earliest cities to be called a fu was Jingzhao-fu (), which including the capital city Chang'an and Henan-fu, which including the secondary capital Luoyang during the Tang Dynasty. By the time of the 14th‚Äìcentury Ming Dynasty, the term had become common across provinces: typically, each prefecture under province was called a fu. Fu of Ming and Qing dynasty are sometimes translated as \\"Prefectures\\", Shuntian Prefecture for instance. Sub-prefectures, such as that which administered Macao's inner harbor from Qianshan, were called \\"military/civil fu\\" (t s j≈´nm√≠nf«î). After the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Republic of China abolished fu in order to streamline administrative divisions, recategorizing them into counties or cities. The People's Republic of China inherited these divisions of mainland China in 1949 and did not reinstate the fu. Many former fu have become prefecture-level cities. Japan As part of the Taika Reform in (645), the capitals of the Provinces of Japan were named . The fu character is an element still found in several Japanese city names, such as , , , , and the old name for Shizuoka, . During the Meiji Restoration, the newly formed Meiji government enacted Fuhanken Sanchisei in 1868, splitting the country into three varieties of prefecture. One of these were fu, used for urban prefectures as opposed to . The first two were created on 14 June 1868: Kyoto- fu and Hakodate-fu. By the end of 1868, 10 fu had been established: Kyoto, Hakodate, Osaka, Nagasaki, Edo (later Tokyo), Kanagawa, Watarai, Nara, Echigo (later Niigata) and K≈çfu. Due to some prefectures gaining non-urban land or being amalgamated into other territories in 1869, three remained: Kyoto-fu, Osaka-fu and Tokyo-fu. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Government wished to tighten control of the local autonomy of the different areas of Tokyo.Kurt Steiner, Local government in Japan, Stanford University Press, 1965, p. 179 The Home Ministry published a plan to rename Tokyo to a , but the special wards of Tokyo (35 in 1938) objected to the plan. In 1943 the plan was implemented, and Tokyo-fu and Tokyo-shi were merged to become the current Tokyo Metropolis. This brought the number of fu in Japan to its current number of two: Kyoto-fu and Osaka-fu. There is currently a plan which will turn Osaka to a metropolis, which would leave the amount of urban prefectures to one if successful. Korea Bu (Î∂Ä, Â∫ú) has been used in use in Korea since the Goryeo Dynasty as a suffix designating a city. The city of Kaesong was designated Kaesong-bu in 995. The 1485 code of law Gyeongguk daejeon designates the city of Seoul as Hanseong-bu (Êº¢ÂüéÂ∫ú) and Kaesong as Kaesong-bu. In the 17th Century, additional areas were designated bu, including Ganghwa-bu, Suwon-bu and Gwangju-bu. In 1895 after the Donghak Peasant Revolution and the Treaty of Shimonoseki, a series of wide changes called the Gabo Reform were enacted. One of these changes was to split the Eight Provinces of Korea into 23 bu: Andong, Chuncheon, Chungju, Daegu, Dongnae, Gangneung, Gongju, Haeju, Hamh≈≠ng, Hanseong, Hongju, Incheon, Jeju, Jeonju, Jinju, Kaes≈èng, Kanggye, Kapsan, Ky≈èngs≈èng, Naju, Namwon, P'y≈èngyang and ≈¨iju. The districts were named after the capitals of each district, and also included rural areas. A year later in August 1896, these districts were replaced by 13 new provinces, using the previous word do (ÎèÑ; ÈÅì). After the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910 and the occupation of Korea by Japan, many areas were renamed and local government was reorganised. On 1 April 1914, twelve bu were created: Seoul (then ), Incheon, Gunsan, Mokpo, Daegu, Busan, Masan, Pyongyang, Chinnampo, Sinuiju, Wonsan and Chongjin. Between 1930 and 1944, 10 more were added by the Japanese government: Kaesong and Hamhung in 1930, followed by Daejeon, Jeonju and Gwangju in 1935, Rason (1936), Haeju (1938), Jinju (1939), Kimchaek (1941) and Hungnam (1944). After the Potsdam Declaration in 1945 and Japan's defeat in World War II, as well as the Division of Korea, the term has no longer been in use.

In export markets, it was known simply as Lada 1600 or alternatively as Lada 2106. In the domestic market it was popularly nicknamed –®–µ—Å—Ç—ë—Ä–∫–∞ (≈†estyorka, in English; The sixth one). A hugely popular car and one of most successful Lada models, it was in serial production for 30 years (from 1976 to 2006), although production in the VAZ plant ended after 25 years, in 2001, with manufacture continuing at Izhevsk for the final five years.Lada 1600 / VAZ-2106, www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au Retrieved on 3 May 2014 Overview Derived from its predecessor, the VAZ-2103, 2106 was created as its alternative due to expense and complexity of production of chrome elements which were severely reduced on it (although it did not fully replace it until 1984, when the 2103 was finally discontinued). Like the 2103, the 2106 was a four-door, four-seat saloon, but powered by a more powerful single overhead cam inline four engine of Lada's own design. It used the pistons of the VAZ-21011's and the crankshaft of the VAZ-2103's .Thompson, Andy. Cars of the Soviet Union (Haynes Publishing, Somerset, UK, 2008), p.111. Though only marginally more powerful than the 2103's engine, it produced more torque, rather than , making it easier to drive. Top speed was , with acceleration in 16 seconds.Thompson, p.113. For many consumers, it was \\"the top of the Eastern Bloc charts for comfort and prestige\\", since the more expensive and luxurious GAZ and ZIL cars, intended firstly for party members and various other state officials, were out of reach for them. 1978 Lada 1600 It debuted in December of 1975, and \\"would become the most popular and most numerous VAZ product\\". It externally differed from its predecessor, the VAZ-2103, firstly by having smaller grille due to having plastic headlight surrounds, different bumpers and by wider taillights also featuring reverse lights, which were then a new feature for VAZ models. Internally it was almost as same as its predecessor with only minimal differences; most notably by being the first VAZ model with height adjustable headrests on front seats and also by its steering wheel; it was visually easily recognizable by being decorated with classic Russian ornaments together with Lada logo on its central (leather) part. In 1976, due to being the latest model in VAZ arsenal, it served as a basis for latest prototype what would become the highly successful VAZ-2121 Niva or Lada Niva 1600 the next year. It borrowed many of its elements to it, like firstly its 1600 cc (55 kw/75 PS) petrol engine, as well as its headlights and taillights, direction pointers, side/external mirrors, front seat headrests, steering wheel, instruments and many other details. The VAZ-2106 was severely restyled in the second half of 1990s, its chrome lined elements were further reduced; the chrome external/side mirrors became black metallic back in the first half of 1980s when the VAZ-2103 was discontinued, however, the grille was now replaced with black plastic one, also featuring a new front Lada badge. Chrome lined rim covers and exterior body part edges were also removed. However, the chromed bumpers as well as Fiat 124 door knobs were still present until the very end of production. Internally, the aging Fiat 125 steering wheel (firstly used by VAZ-2103 and later by VAZ-2121 Niva) also featuring chrome elements was replaced by newer one. The previous wood imitation dashboard was replaced with black one and, along with some other details, its original berth foldable seats were also replaced with more modern ones. The 21061, with the VAZ-2103 engine, and 21063, with the , appeared in 1979. (The 21063 would disappear in 1993.) The less-powerful, but also cheaper, 21061 would be the sales leader, helping make the 2106 the top Lada-branded marque.Thompson, p.114. In Canada, the model was sold from late 1978-early 1979 as the Lada Signet, with the official factory name being VAZ 21061-37. It was made up to 1984. One variant of this model is the 21061-41, which had Canadian Domestic Market bumpers and fitments, but it featured European Domestic Market repeaters, tail lights, side logo, etc. This model is one of the rarest of the 2106 series, and some examples survive in the former USSR and in Europe. Special rally-prepared versions had up to from the and up to from the , while there was a turbocharged sixteen-valve 1.8 liter delivering .Thompson, p.115. In 2017, an old VAZ-2106 participating in the Banjul Challenge traversed twelve European and African countries in 15 days, starting in Saint Petersburg and finishing in Banjul, the Gambia. The car was eventually given to local residents, while four travellers returned home on a plane. Safety by modern standards In 2002, the Izmash version of the VAZ-2106 was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian ARCAP safety assessment program. The reviewers noted that the result was unsurprising and that the car was outdated by the time of the test, with its construction dating back to the 1960s.

Poisson clumping, or Poisson bursts, is the phenomenon wherein random events may appear to have a tendency to occur in clusters, clumps, or bursts. Etymology Poisson clumping is named for the 19th- century French mathematician Sim√©on Denis Poisson, who is known for his work on definite integrals, electromagnetic theory, and probability theory and is the namesake of the Poisson distribution. History The Poisson process provides a description of random independent events occurring with uniform probability through time or space (or both). The expected number Œª of events in a time interval or area of a given measure is proportional to that measure; the distribution of the number of events follows a Poisson distribution entirely determined by the parameter Œª. If Œª is small, events are rare, but purely by chance they may, nevertheless, occasionally occur in clusters, also referred to as Poisson clumps or Poisson bursts. Applications Poisson clumping is used to explain marked increases or decreases in the frequency of an event, such as shark attacks, \\"coincidences\\", birthdays, or heads or tails from coin tosses, and e-mail correspondence.Anteneodo, C.; Malmgren, R.

The theory primarily involves the role of neurotransmitters in dynamically adjusting the way computational learning algorithms interact to produce the kinds of robust learning behaviour currently unique to biological life forms. 'Metalearning' has previously been applied to the fields of Social Psychology and Computer Science but in this context exists an entirely new concept. The theory of Metalearning builds off earlier work by Doya into the learning algorithms of Supervised learning, Reinforcement learning and Unsupervised learning in the Cerebellum, Basal Ganglia and Cerebral Cortex respectively. The theory emerged from efforts to unify the dynamic selection process for these three learning algorithms to a regulatory mechanism reducible to individual neurotransmitters. Roles of Neuromodulators =Dopamine= Dopamine is proposed to act as a \\"global learning\\" signal, critical to prediction of rewards and action reinforcement. In this way, dopamine is involved in a learning algorithm in which Actor, Environment and Critic are bound in a dynamic interplay that ultimately seeks to maximise the sum of future rewards by producing an optimal action selection policy. In this context, Critic and Actor are characterised as independent network edges that also form a single Complex Agent. This Agent collectively influences the information state of the Environment, which is fed back to the Agent for future computations. Through a separate pathway, Environment is also fed back to Critic in the form of the reward gained through the given action, meaning an equilibrium can be reached between the predicted reward of given policy for a given state, and the evolving prospect of future rewards. =Serotonin= Serotonin is proposed to control the balance between short and long term reward prediction, essentially by variably \\"discounting\\" expected future reward sums that may require too much expenditure to achieve. In this way, serotonin may facilitate the expectation of reward at a quasi-emotional level, and thus either encourage or discourage persistence in reward-seeking behaviour depending on the demand of the task, and the duration of persistence required. As global reward prediction would theoretically result from Serotonin modulated computations reaching a steady state with the computations similarly modulated by Dopamine; high serotonergic signalling may override the computations of Dopamine and produce a divergent paradigm of reward not mathematically viable through the dopamine modulated computations alone. =Norepinephrine= Norepinephrine is proposed to facilitate \\"wide exploration\\" by stochastic action selection. The choice between focusing on known, effective strategies or selecting new, experimental ones is known in probability theory as the Exploration-Exploitation Problem. An interplay between situational urgency, and the effectiveness of known strategies thus influences the dilemma between reliable selection for the largest predicted reward, and exploratory selection outside known parameters. Since neuronal firing cascades (such as those required to perfectly swing a golf club) are by definition unstable and prone to variation; Norepinephrine thus selects for the most reliable known execution pattern at higher levels, and allows for more random and unreliable selection at low levels with the purpose of potentially discovering more efficient strategies in the process. =Acetylcholine= Acetylcholine is proposed to facilitate the balance between memory storage and memory renewal, finding an optimal balance between stability and effectiveness of learning algorithms for the specific environmental task. Acetylcholine thus modulates plasticity in the Hippocampus, Cerebral Cortex and Striatum to facilitate ideal learning conditions in the brain. High levels of Acetylcholine would thus allow for very rapid learning and remodelling of synaptic connections, with the consequence that existing learning may become undone. Likewise, the learning of states that takes place over an extended temporal resolution may be overridden before it reaches a functional level, and thus learning may occur too quickly to actually be performed efficiently. At lower levels of Norepinephrine, plastic changes are proposed to occur much more slowly, potentially being protective against unhelpful learning conditions or allowing for information changes to embody a much broader temporal resolution. Metalearning Central to the idea of Metalearning is that global learning can be modelled as function of efficient selection of these four neuromodulators. While no mechanistic model is put forward for where Metalearning ultimately exists in the hierarchy of agency, the model has thus far demonstrated the dynamics necessary to infer the existence of such an agent in biological learning as a whole. While computational models and information systems are still far away from approaching the complexity of human learning; Metalearning provides a promising path forwards for the future evolution of such systems as they increasingly approach the complexity of the biological world. Potential Applications The investigation of Metalearning as a neuroscientific concept has potential benefits to both the understanding and treatment of Psychiatric Disease, as well as bridging the gaps between Neural Networks, Computer Science and Machine Learning.

It parodies two Steven Spielberg-directed films at once: Jaws and Jurassic Park. Plot A megalodon (prehistoric shark) is accidentally unleashed after an oil rig in the middle of a small island on a lake drills too far into the lake floor. The resulting malfunction also creates an explosion. The shark eats two girls before attacking a group of art thieves in a boat which consists of Barb, Rich, Doug, Jerry, and Jack. Jack is eaten while the others escape onto the island, although they drop the painting into the water. Jerry is sent in to get it, although fails to do so, and is killed by the shark. Meanwhile, a group of college students consisting of Jill, Tia, Kristen, and Mike attempt to get onto the island so Jill can find the rig, which she hopes will help with her essay on pollution. However, the shark attacks their boat, and kills Mike while the others reach shore. They meet up with the thieves who claim to be tourists, and spend the night on the island. The next morning, they find the facility, as well as the only survivor of the explosion, Dr. Lincoln Grant. Barb, Rich, and Doug then reveal their true identities, and force Grant into the water to retrieve the painting, although he's quickly eaten. Jill, Tia, and Kristen use this time to hide, although the thieves chase them, and Kristen is eaten in the ensuing chaos while Jill, and Tia are recaptured. The next morning, Barb has Jill, and Tia dive for the painting while Rich distracts the shark with dynamite. The girls throw a rock at Rich, which gives the dynamite enough time to explode in his hand, killing him. They then throw a rock at Doug, and he ends up in the water, where he's killed. The girls get hold of a gun, and end up in a stand off, although the shark jumps out of the water, and eats Barb. Jill then uses the remaining dynamite to kill the shark, and she, and Tia leave the island. Meanwhile, two fishermen are eaten alive by another megalodon, hinting that the threat is not over.

Conversely, Alex DiGiovanna of Move Buzzers panned the film, noting that with VOD or direct to DVD films about giant creatures attacking folks on a beach \\"you can expect them to be funny, in a terrible sort of way while also having some sort of added entertainment value. Too bad that‚Äôs not the case with Brett Kelly‚Äôs wannabe Jaws meets Jurassic Park Megalodon feature, Attack of the Jurassic Shark\\". He offered \\"when I say this movie is one of the worst pieces of cinema that my eyes had the misfortune of viewing, I truly mean it.\\" He explained \\"I love terrible horror movies, I think they‚Äôre hilarious and while this one had a few of those moments, it couldn't live up to its potential.\\" He noted that viewer expectations would be subverted by only \\"average girls in bikinis, terrible prop work, awful CG (for the most part), pathetic death sequences, a flying shark and a really long, dialogue-free walking montage.\\" Dread Central spoke negatively about production's first efforts at a film trailer, calling it \\"underwhelming\\" as \\"a trailer for a killer shark movie with very little shark in it\\". Comparing the early trailer to the later, they expanded by writing \\"the differences between the two trailers should be a lesson to indie filmmakers not to release the first trailer for their movie to the public before they‚Äôre really ready to show off their movie goods.\\" JoBlo spoke somewhat more positively about the later trailer which included footage of the purported megalodon and predicted the film \\"has potential to become something special.\\" After DVD release, they found the film and premise to be \\"ridiculous shit\\". Aint It Cool News panned the film for poor CGI effects making its shark look cartoonish. They expanded it was \\"Amazing how bad the effects are here,\\" and that the film was \\"an exercise in how not to make a low budget flick\\". As of March 2018, the film is the #12 Worst Rated Movie on IMDb.

He attended Public School #132 and in 1969, graduated from the Baku State University with a degree in Arab Studies. For the next seven years, he worked as a Russian to Arabic translator with various Soviet missions in Egypt and South Yemen. From 1971 to 1990, he worked for the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, where he later earned a master's degree in philology.Politoloq Z…ôrd√º≈üt ∆èlizad…ô il…ô - FOTOS√ñHB∆èT. Modern.az. 10 May 2013. In the Popular Front In 1988, Zardusht Alizadeh became one of the founders of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, the first opposition party in then Soviet Azerbaijan. In his memoirs, Alizadeh described his initial vision of the party as one led by \\"patriotic intellectuals able to [...] make adequate decisions guaranteeing [...] democratization, transferring of the state's property under the people's control, freedom of speech, a multi-party system and fair elections\\".Zardusht Alizadeh. The End of the Second Republic. Alizadeh says he was against electing Abulfaz Elchibey as the leader of the new party, as that would mean changing its orientation from being democratic to nationalist. Later he also questioned Isa Gambar's dedication to democratic change, accusing him of \\"pandering to the demands of the angry mob\\" to gain its support. In 1989, he was one of the party delegates sent to Georgia to meet with members of the Georgian opposition, including Zviad Gamsakhurdia and Merab Kostava, to prevent potential ethnic clashes involving Georgia's Azerbaijani minority. Alizadeh belonged to the centrist wing of the Popular Front, which is why, as the party's radicalised membership grew, he and fellow centrists came under the attack of Elchibey's supporters, mainly Azernaijani natives of Nakhchivan and Armenia. Alizadeh described the state of the Popular Front at the time as a \\"gathering of KGB agents and regional mafia clans\\". On 7 January 1990, Zardusht Alizadeh announced his resignation from the Popular Front due to the fact that the capture of the party by extremists, according to him, was leading to violence and chaos.Suha Bolukbasi. Azerbaijan: A Political History. I.B.Tauris, Sep 15, 2011; p. 127. In opposition Almost immediately after leaving the Popular Front, together with his brother Araz Alizadeh and fellow ex-Popular Front members Leyla Yunus, Fakhraddin Aghayev, Abdulvahab Manafov and Arzu Abdullayeva, Alizadeh founded the Azerbaijan Social Democratic Party, which aimed at a Western European style of social democracy and more harmony in relations with other former Soviet republics. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan on 30 September 1990 and claimed the election was rigged. Elchibey was elected as Azerbaijan's new president in the 1992 election. In his interviews and publications, Alizadeh described Elchibey's presidency as thoughtless, destructive and paving way to the dictatorial rule of Heydar Aliyev. He openly called Popular Front activists \\"Aliyev's agents\\".–ó–∞—Ä–¥—É—à—Ç –ê–ª–∏–∑–∞–¥–µ: –õ–∏–¥–µ—Ä—ã –ù–§–ê ‚Äì –ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –∞–≥–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –ê–ª–∏–µ–≤–∞. Haqqin.az. 12 July 2013. In 2000, he left the party then led by his brother Araz Alizadeh, unimpressed by the latter's policies, and the relationship between the two brothers remains strained. Current activity After retiring from politics, Alizadeh has continued to be a critic of the current Azerbaijani government. He describes the political state of Azerbaijan as an increasingly absolute rule, when the ruling elite is only interesting in multiplying its own wealth.Z…ôrd√º≈üt ∆èlizad…ô: ¬´Az…ôrbaycanda m√ºtl…ôq hakimiyy…ôt b…ôrq…ôrar olur¬ª.

In 2006, in the aftermath of the arrest of the opposition journalist Mirza Sakit on the allegedly fabricated charges of drug possession, Zardusht Alizadeh published an article in the newspaper Azadlig accusing the key figures of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Drug Enforcement Administration of running drug-related business themselves.

Alizadeh views Russia as a power that orchestrated the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and continues to be the sole power that exercises control over the negotiations. This, however, does not stop other great powers, including the United States, from trying to benefit from the conflict situation, according to Alizadeh. He is pessimistic about the efforts of the Minsk Group, the official mediator, and believes that any developments, positive or negative, in the negotiation process are either a reflection of the geopolitical interests of the great powers or pre-election bravado of the parties at conflict.H…ôms…ôdrl…ôr Az…ôrbaycan v…ô Erm…ônistan xarici i≈ül…ôr nazirl…ôrinin g√∂r√º≈ü√º haqqƒ±nda bunlarƒ± deyirl…ôr.

In 2012, Alizadeh condemned the pardoning of Ramil Safarov, a convicted murderer of an Armenian officer, extradited to Azerbaijan from Hungary after serving eight years of his lifelong sentence. According to Alizadeh, the act was not based on any political will, respect of law or interest in conflict resolution, but instead had only \\"cheap fame\\" to it, and could only disrupt the peaceful solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Alizadeh has been critical of the non-governmental organisations and opposition parties calling on the international military operation against Iran from Azerbaijan's territory. He described such an attack against a sovereign state both as a violation of international law and a major destabilising factor in the region, which may lead Iranian troops to incur in Azerbaijan and reach Baku in a matter of 12 hours. At the same time, Alizadeh believes Iran is very likely to be targeted by an American military operation in the near future.Z…ôrd√º≈üt ∆èlizad…ô: ¬´ƒ∞ran ordusu 12 saata Bakƒ±da ola bil…ôr¬ª.

The degeneracy of the genetic code is what accounts for the existence of synonymous mutations. Background Degeneracy of the genetic code was identified by Lagerkvist.Lagerkvist, U. (1978.) \\"Two out of three: An alternative method for codon reading\\", PNAS, 75:1759-62. For instance, codons GAA and GAG both specify glutamic acid and exhibit redundancy; but, neither specifies any other amino acid and thus are not ambiguous or demonstrate no ambiguity. The codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions; however, more often than not, this difference is in the second or third position. For instance, the amino acid glutamic acid is specified by GAA and GAG codons (difference in the third position); the amino acid leucine is specified by UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG codons (difference in the first or third position); and the amino acid serine is specified by UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, AGC (difference in the first, second, or third position). Degeneracy results because there are more codons than encodable amino acids. For example, if there were two bases per codon, then only 16 amino acids could be coded for (4¬≤=16). Because at least 21 codes are required (20 amino acids plus stop) and the next largest number of bases is three, then 4¬≥ gives 64 possible codons, meaning that some degeneracy must exist. The appearance of codon degeneracy implies the existence of certain symmetry for codon multiplicity assignment. Implications These properties of the genetic code make it more fault- tolerant for point mutations. For example, in theory, fourfold degenerate codons can tolerate any point mutation at the third position, although codon usage bias restricts this in practice in many organisms; twofold degenerate codons can withstand silence mutation rather than Missense or Nonsense point mutations at the third position. Since transition mutations (purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine mutations) are more likely than transversion (purine to pyrimidine or vice versa) mutations, the equivalence of purines or that of pyrimidines at twofold degenerate sites adds a further fault- tolerance. hydropathy. A practical consequence of redundancy is that some errors in the genetic code cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathy; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. These tendencies may result from the shared ancestry of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases related to these codons. These variable codes for amino acids are allowed because of modified bases in the first base of the anticodon of the tRNA, and the base-pair formed is called a wobble base pair. The modified bases include inosine and the Non- Watson-Crick U-G basepair. Terminology A position of a codon is said to be a n-fold degenerate site if only n of four possible nucleotides (A, C, G, T) at this position specify the same amino acid. A nucleotide substitution at a fourfold degenerate site is referred to as a synonymous nucleotide substitution, whereas nucleotide substitutions in which the substitution involves the change of a purine to a pyrimidine, or vice versa, are non- synonymous transversion substitutions. A position of a codon is said to be a non-degenerate site if any mutation at this position results in amino acid substitution. There is only one threefold degenerate site where changing to three of the four nucleotides may have no effect on the amino acid (depending on what it is changed to), while changing to the fourth possible nucleotide always results in an amino acid substitution. This is the third position of an isoleucine codon: AUU, AUC, or AUA all encode isoleucine, but AUG encodes methionine. In computation, this position is often treated as a twofold degenerate site. There are three amino acids encoded by six different codons: serine, leucine, and arginine. Only two amino acids are specified by a single codon each. One of these is the amino-acid methionine, specified by the codon AUG, which also specifies the start of translation; the other is tryptophan, specified by the codon UGG.

Life He was the eldest son of John Lyon, 7th Lord Glamis, by his wife, Janet Keith, daughter of Robert Keith, Master of Marischal, and sister of William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal. He succeeded as Lord Glamis on the death of his father in 1558. His name first appears in the list of members of the privy council at a meeting of 22 December 1561. On 10 September 1563 the island of Inchkeith was committed to his charge. Glamis supported the marriage of Mary Queen of Scots with Henry Darnley, and took part in the roundabout raid against James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray. At the time of the murder of Darnley he was in Edinburgh, but may have had no knowledge of the conspiracy. He signed the Ainslie Tavern Bond for the marriage of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell to the queen; but later joined the association for the overthrow of Bothwell and the protection of the young king James VI of Scotland. On 16 February 1569 he was appointed one of a committee for the pursuit of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly. He was one of those who voted against the queen's divorce, 31 July 1569, and assisted with other seven noblemen in bearing the body of the Regent Moray at his funeral to St Giles' Cathedral, 14 February 1570. On 30 September 1570 Glamis was appointed an extraordinary lord of session. After Moray's death he became a close associate of his kinsman James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, whom in 1571 he accompanied on an embassy to England, in order to defeat proposals to restore Queen Mary to the throne. On 18 June 1572 he was ordered with other northern nobles to proceed against Adam Gordon of Auchindown, who had invaded The Mearns, and in July he barely escaped capture by Gordon at Brechin. On 2 September 1573 he and other barons of the north signed a band of allegiance to Morton, now Regent, and he was thought to be one of the most loyal of his supporters. On the death of Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll he was appointed to succeed him as Lord chancellor of Scotland on 12 October 1573. Like many Scottish aristocrats, Glamis was often short of money, and seems to regularly borrowed from the Edinburgh lawyer John Shairp of Houston.Margaret Sanderson, Mary Stewart's People (Edinburgh, 1987), p. 25. When the question of episcopacy was occupying the attention of the lords of the congregation, Glamis corresponded with Theodore Beza on the subject in 1575, and Beza wrote the treatise De triplici Episcopatu, prompted by some of his queries. After the complaint of Colin Campbell, 6th Earl of Argyll to the young king of 4 March 1578, regarding Morton's overbearing demeanour, Glamis joined with other noblemen in advising Morton's resignation, and was one of a deputation sent to ask him to resign. In consenting, Morton is supposed to have taken influenced by Glamis's advice. Death Glamis was accidentally killed in a street brawl in Stirling between his followers and those of David Lindsay, 11th Earl of Crawford. He was shot through the head, and David Hume of Godscroft ascribed his death to his height.David Reid, ed, History of the House of Angus, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 2005), pp. 242-3. Andrew Melville composed a Latin epigram to him.

The term 'deep social mind' was first coined in 1999 by Andrew Whiten, professor of Evolutionary and Developmental Psychology at St. Andrews University, Scotland.Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193. Together with closely related terms such as 'reflexivity' and 'intersubjectivity', it is now well-established among scholars investigating the evolutionary emergence of human sociality, cognition and communication.Knight, C. and C. Power (2012). Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), Handbook of Language Evolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 346-49. Mind-reading in apes and humans It is widely agreed that the brain is social in both human and nonhuman primates.Dunbar, R. I. M. 1998. The social brain hypothesis. Evolutionary Anthropology 6: 178-91. But, according to Andrew Whiten, human sociality goes much further than ape sociality. Ape social intelligence is overwhelmingly 'Machiavellian' in the sense of manipulating others in social settings.Whiten, A. and R. W. Byrne 1988. The manipulation of attention in primate tactical deception. In R. Byrne and A. Whiten (eds), Machiavellian Intelligence: Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans. Oxford: Clarendon Press. One consequence is that while an ape may be motivated to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others around it, it has little motive to reciprocate. Instead of making its own mental states transparent to potential rivals, it seeks to block others from 'reading' its own mind. For example, one way to infer what another primate might be thinking is to detect which way its head is pointed, so as to reconstruct what it might be looking at. In the case of gorillas and chimpanzees, adult apes have evolved eyes which give away very little information concerning direction of gaze. Their eyes are dark-on-dark: the iris is dark brown or even black and the same applies to the sclera and surrounding skin. Looking at the eyes, therefore, it is not easy to detect direction of gaze. In the human case, the eyes are very different, the dark iris standing out against a white surrounding sclera. This feature, combined with the relatively large size of the human eye and its horizontally elongated shape, assists neighbouring conspecifics to detect direction of gaze and, on that basis, engage in mind-reading.Kobayashi, H., and S. Kohshima (2001). \\"Unique Morphology of the Human Eye and Its Adaptive Meaning: Comparative Studies on External Morphology of the Primate Eye.\\" Journal of Human Evolution, 40 (5): 419-35. According to the 'deep social mind' theory, this means that humans have become cognitively adapted to reflexivity and intersubjectivity: as a species, we are well-adapted to read the minds of trusted others while at the same time assisting those others in reading our own minds. One consequence of this is self-awareness or 'egocentric perspective reversal': I read your mind as you are reading mine. Therefore, between us, we can gain an awareness of our own minds as if from the outside: my mental states as these are reflected in yours and yours as they are reflected in mine. In that sense, if this argument is accepted, our minds mutually interpenetrate. 'Mind' in the human sense is not locked inside this or that skull but instead is relational, stretching between us.Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193. According to evolutionary psychologist Michael Tomasello, a human child normally achieves egocentric perspective reversal‚Äîviewing its own mental states as if from the standpoint of others‚Äîat around one year of age.M.

It began in 1999 and lasted until 2004,http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/sahrawis-campaign-independence- second-intifada-western-sahara-2005-2008 transforming into the Independence Intifada in 2005. Background Status quo in Western Sahara since 1991 cease-fire: most under Moroccan control (Southern Provinces), with inner Polisario-controlled areas forming the Sahrawi Arab Republic Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, was annexed by Morocco in 1975, as Spain pulled out. This sparked a war with the Polisario Front, which, according to the UN, represent the indigenous Sahrawi population; it was backed by neighboring Algeria. In 1976, the main Sahrawi movement, the Polisario Front, declared statehood of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in Polisario- controlled areas of Western Sahara. In 1991, a ceasefire between Polisario and Morocco was agreed upon, on the condition of a referendum on self- determination of Moroccan-occupied Southern Provinces (including the options of independence or integration into Morocco). Since 1991, the terms of a referendum have been subject to years of dispute between the parties, although the ceasefire continues to hold despite remaining tensions. Morocco controls the majority of the territory, with Polisario forces controlling a rump. A UN mission, MINURSO, patrols the demarcation line. Sahrawi political activity in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara remains severely restricted, and police crackdowns and forced disappearances have been a frequent response to civil protest.Amnesty International ‚Äì Morocco / Western Sahara ‚Äì Covering events from January ‚Äì December 2003 The political climate gradually relaxed in the 1990s after the ceasefire, and following considerable liberalization in Morocco proper. First Intifada =1999 protests= Since political liberalization, intermittent protests have broken out and pro-Polisario groups have declared minor \\"intifadas\\" in 1999 and 2000, often resulting in dozens of demonstrators being arrested.Amnesty International ‚Äì REPORT 1999: MOROCCO AND WESTERN SAHARAU.S. Department of State ‚Äì Western Sahara ‚Äì 2001 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices The First Sahrawi Intifada began in late 1999 and was characterized by large-scale protests. King Hassan II, who had pledged democracy and reform, had died on 23 July, creating a new political atmosphere. In early September 1999, Sahrawi students held a sit-in at al- Zamlah Square in al-'Ayun, the capital of the territory, demanding scholarships and transportation subsidies to Moroccan universities located in northern Morocco. Many students sat in a constant vigil underneath tents in the square, which directly faced Najir Hotel, where United Nations personnel stayed during their visits. The square was also symbolic because of its past history: in 1970, the Spanish army had killed a group of Sahrawis protesting for independence in the square. The students were also joined by Sahrawi political prisoners, arguing for compensation and an end to the common \\"disappearances\\" of other political activists. Shortly, they were also joined by Sahrawi mine workers and Sahrawi members of the \\"National Association of Unemployed University Graduates\\" in Morocco. The demonstrators occupied al- Zamlah Square for 12 days before Moroccan officials responded, sending police to break up the protest, beating protesters, and arresting many; some Sahrawis were reportedly driven out into the desert and left there. Sahrawi activists organized another protest five days later in which they demanded independence and a referendum. It is claimed that in response, Moroccan officials authorized local thugs to ransack Sahrawi homes and businesses. State security forces arrested 150 demonstrators during the protest, and rounded up many more in the early months of 2000. Though security forces released the prisoners fairly quickly, Sahrawi activists accused the police of torture and other maltreatment during detainment. Throughout the First Intifada, Sahrawi protests attracted other Moroccan settlers. Witnessing the violence and injustices, many of Morocco's own Sahrawis became disillusioned with Moroccan government policy. =Political regrouping= In November 1999, Sahrawi political activists, who had been jailed and \\"disappeared\\", formed the Truth and Justice Forum, which sought government redress of human rights violations and injustices. A branch of this group was formed in al-'Ayun, Western Sahara, by Sahrawi activists on 26 August 2000. The Moroccan government had little tolerance towards the Sahara Branch, stating that it was a pro-independence campaigner, and in November 2002, Moroccan courts created legislation to outlaw the organization. Protests persisted throughout the years 2000 to 2004, but small peace developments were made during the time period (such as the Baker Plan of 2003, which was the United Nation's proposal to grant self- determination to the territory), influencing activist mindsets and the protest environment. =Reconciliation attempts= In January 2004, Sahrawi political activist groups united under the Collective of Sahrawi Human Rights Defenders. The collective demanded the formation of an international commission of inquiry to investigate human rights injustices in the Western Sahara. Aminatou Haidar, the president of the collective, and Ali Salem Tamek, vice president, were both organizers of the Sahrawi plight. Also in January 2004, Moroccan King Mohammed released and pardoned twelve Sahrawi activists, some of whom had been involved in the Sahara Branch of the Truth and Justice Forum. By 2005, however, discussions for peace negotiations had reached a standstill. Out of this, a new wave of Sahrawi nonviolent protest erupted, in what is known as the Second Sahrawi Intifada or Independence Intifada. Aftermath The Independence Intifada refers to a series of disturbances, demonstrations, and riots that broke out in May 2005 in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara and in southern Morocco.An Urgent Appeal Importance of First Intifada The nonviolent campaign of the Second Sahrawi Intifada focused more openly on the issue of independence than had the First Intifada, which mainly highlighted human rights; however, the First Intifada was pivotal in showing Sahrawis that they could dissent, protest, and state their demands.

He was married to Laxmi HirƒÅ Kansakar, and was popularly known as Bhagat SƒÅhu. The Tuladhars owned a business house in Lhasa, and following in the footsteps of his merchant ancestors, Bhakta Bir Singh went to Tibet to manage the family shop at a young age. He divided his time between Kathmandu, Lhasa and Kalimpong in India, a trade center and staging point for mule caravans to Tibet. Samyak and the revolution Bhakta Bir Singh's father Samyak Singh had made a pledge in 1950 to sponsor a special Samyak next year, and issued invitations to the ceremony, but he died while the preparations were being made. His sons went ahead with the arrangements to hold it as scheduled. However, the Nepalese revolution broke out, and their plans got caught in the middle. Since Samyak requires the presence of the head of state, Bhakta Bir Singh and his brothers were put in a difficult position regarding whom to invite. In November 1950, King Tribhuvan went into exile in New Delhi, India in an attempt to bring down the Rana regime which held real power in the country. The Ranas then made his grandson Gyanendra the king. They pressed Bhakta Bir Singh to hold Samyak with Gyanendra presiding over it in order to grant him cultural endorsement. The freedom fighters, meanwhile, threatened him not to do so. Bhakta Bir Singh found a way out of the dilemma by citing his father's recent death and deferring the event. The Ranas were overthrown in February 1951, and Tribhuvan returned to Nepal. A year later, the postponed Samyak was held on 15 January 1952 with Tribhuvan presiding over it. A stone mandala was installed at the venue at Bhuikhel to commemorate the event. The religious celebration was seen as an affirmation of the king's triumph in the power struggle against the hereditary prime ministers the Ranas. Samyak commemorates the practice of giving to the Buddhas and monks in the Newar Buddhist tradition. It is spread over three days, and is held at Kathmandu Durbar Square and the field at the foot of Swayambhu hill. During the ceremony, hundreds of images of Dƒ´pankara Buddha are assembled, and gifts of different types of food are made to the deities and the Buddhist community. Page 112.

Biography Coming from an old Orthodox Jewish family, Mittwoch was born in Schrimm, Prussian Province of Posen, Imperial Germany (now Srem in Poland). He initially wanted to become a Rabbi. During his studies in Berlin he discovered Islamic studies and did his doctorate with Eduard Sachau. During World War I, Mittwoch was the head of the German Nachrichtenstelle f√ºr den Orient from 1916 until 1918. After the agency initially employed people who advocated Jihad and violence against the Western powers, Mittwoch hired more liberal and cosmopolitan writers and intellectuals for the Nachrichtenstelle such as the Swiss Max Rudolf Kaufmann (Mittwoch hired him for the Nachrichtenstelle, after he arrested, briefly imprisoned and deported from Turkey because Turkish intelligence had found letter of Kaufmann criticizing German-Turkish militarism and jingoism), the Social Democrat Friedrich Schrader and the Zionist Nahum Goldmann. Schrader and Kaufmann were correspondents for the Jewish-owned liberal Frankfurter Zeitung and close associates of , one of the sharpest critics of German collaboration with the genocidal politics of the Young Turks. In the 1920s Mittwoch was the leading orientalist in Germany, and the founder of a more politically oriented, modern science of Middle East Studies, in contrast to the traditional philologic, apolitical approach very much influenced by Goethe. In 1924, Mittwoch stayed in Jerusalem, where he participated in the founding of a Department for Semitic Studies at Hebrew University. Since he was the leading specialist on Ethiopian languages world- wide, Mittwoch did not lose his academic position in 1933 immediately like almost all his Jewish colleagues in Germany did at that time. This had to do with a special intervention by Mussolini with Hitler on behalf of Mittwoch. Because of their colonial activities in Ethiopia, the Italians were extremely interested in Mittwoch's knowledge and research. Mittwoch was very active on behalf of the Ethiopian Jews (Falasha), and was also one of the first German Jews who could speak fluent Ivrit. Starting in 1933, Mittwoch used his \\"privileged\\" position in Germany (he continued to receive his salary as a German professor until the beginning of the war) on behalf of the Jewish community, he became head of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in Berlin. However, in 1938, after Kristallnacht, also Mittwoch had to emigrate, and moved via Paris to London with his immediate family. During the last 18 months of his life, he worked for the Middle East department of the British Ministry of Information under the leadership of Ernst Jaeckh. The remaining family, including his mother, who was murdered in Bergen-Belsen, perished in the Shoah. A daughter Adele Mittwoch (1925 - 2011) was a renowned psychotherapist in England, specializing in group psychotherapy, another daughter Agnes (born 1926) later immigrated to Israel ( made aliyah ) and was a university lecturer in Jerusalem. The oldest daughter, Ursula, born 1924, was professor for human genetics at the UCL (University of London) and, in 2014, was still scientifically active and celebrated her 90th birthday in her old institute.

The international cast included Helen Slater, Robert Reynolds, Caroline Goodall, Tim Hughes and Barry Bostwick. The film was based on the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race. The film was also known as The Great Air Race in video and international versions.Murray 1996, p. 203. Plot In 1934, the \\"London to Melbourne Air Race\\" known as the \\"MacRobertson Trophy Air Race\\" named after Sir Macpherson Robertson (James Condon), a wealthy Australian confectionery manufacturer, was announced as a long-distance race open to competitors from all over the globe. As part of the Melbourne Centenary celebrations, the idea of the race was devised by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne with a prize fund of ¬£50,000 put up by Sir Macpherson Robertson. The race was organised by the Royal Aero Club to fly from RAF Mildenhall in East Anglia to Flemington Racecourse, Melbourne, approximately . Five compulsory stops at Baghdad, Allahabad, Singapore, Darwin and Charleville, Queensland were scheduled although the competitors could choose their own routes. In England, two special purpose de Havilland DH.88 Comet racers were built by Geoffrey de Havilland (Robin Bowering) for the teams of Captain Tom Campbell Black (Robert Reynolds) and Flight Lt. C. W. A. Scott (Tim Hughes) as well as the husband and wife team of Jim (Jonathan Hyde) and Amy Mollison (Caroline Goodall). Many other entries from England were production aircraft that could not compete with the Comets. The other serious contenders were from the United States where celebrity pilots such as Roscoe Turner (Barry Bostwick), Clyde Pangborn (David Arnett) and Jacqueline Cochran (Helen Slater) were entered with potent long-distance racing aircraft. The most unusual entry was from KLM with a Douglas DC-2 airliner that would fly the course as part of a proving flight to establish the efficiency and safety of the airline. Starting on 20 October 1934, the 20 competitors set off with many dramatic twists. Nearly all the competitors faced some adversity although the KLM crew flying an example of the new generation of American all-metal passenger transports, proved to be dependable, actually finishing second behind only the purpose-built de Havilland DH.88 racer Grosvenor House (G-ACSS) flown by Campbell Black and Scott.

Early life and education Witcombe was born in Yorketown, South Australia where her father ran a farm, and later a grocery store. In 1939, the family drove to Queensland, intending to move to Cooktown, but ending up in Brisbane where Eleanor and her sister Aileen attended Brisbane Girls Grammar School. In 1941, Witcombe left school due to chronic asthma, and the family moved to Sydney, where she attended the National Art School. She worked as a governess at a New South Wales property during World War II, but was unhappy in the role and dreamt of becoming a writer. Writing career In 1947, Witcombe was awarded a scholarship at the Mercury Theatre founded by Peter Finch. The following year, the Mosman Theatre Club commissioned her to write three plays for children, which received national acclaim and began her writing career. In 1952, she moved to England and worked at the BBC as a typist. Whilst in London, she managed to get her play, Smugglers Beware!, produced and performed at Toynbee Hall. She returned to Australia, and began producing radio scripts for the ABC and the Macquarie and Lux Radio Theatres. In the 1960s, she adapted Smugglers Beware! and the novel Pastures of the Blue Crane for ABC television, and was on the writing team for the sketch comedy series The Mavis Bramston Show on the Seven Network. She was also a founding member of the Australian Writers' Guild (AWG) in 1962. In the early 1970s, Witcombe adapted two of Norman Lindsay's works: The Magic Pudding for a marionette stage show, and Redheap for television, which resulted in a lifelong friendship with Lindsay's daughter, Jane Glad. She then joined the writing team for the soap opera Number 96. In 1973, she adapted Ethel Turner's Seven Little Australians for ABC television. In the late 1970s, Witcombe adapted two novels into film scripts which became part of the Australian film renaissance at the time: The Getting of Wisdom directed by Bruce Beresford, and My Brilliant Career directed by Gillian Armstrong.

Amarna letter EA 161, titled An Absence Explained, is a tall clay tablet letter of 8 paragraphs, with single paragraphing lines. The surface is somewhat degraded, but most cuneiform signs that remain (undamaged corners, or scrapes contain lost signs, added by context per translation), allow for a relative complete translation context for the letter, and the eight paragraphs. The clay tablet is no. BM 29818 at the British Museum; the number is visible at the top of the tablet, above Para I-(in black ink, the top half of the number visible). The letter is about 3.2 in wide x 4.7 in tall, and probably slightly less than 1.0 inch thick. The text of the letter does not end at the right margin of the letter; instead the text appears to use the side of the clay tablet. The Amarna letters, about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are mid 14th century BC, about 1350 BC and 25? years later, correspondence. The initial corpus of letters were found at Akhenaten's city Akhetaten, in the floor of the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh; others were later found, adding to the body of letters. Text Paragraph I is a very short introductory, salutory paragraph, with sections of the prostration formula, notably: 7 times and 7 times, God-mine, Sun-mine, I bow. The appellation \\"My Lord\\" is used here in Para I, and throughout the letter's paragraphs; my Lord is Lord-mine, and in EA 161 uses the sumerogram EN, for \\"Lord\\", with the possessive first person mine, ia (cuneiform). Many other Amarna letters use \\"be-li\\", or equivalent for 'lord', Akkadian language, bƒìlu.Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, bƒìlu, for lord, owner, p. 122. Cuneiform \\"ia\\"-(-iya) is still used today in world languages in Asia/Southeast Asia as -iya, as for example \\"TownXYZ-iya\\", \\"TownXYZ-mine\\". -Ia, or ia, is extremely common throughout the Amarna letters with one of the most common phrases being: King, Lord, mine, often at the very beginning of a letter (especially vassal city-states, Canaan), but will then be repeated throughout the letter. Para II begins the story of the letter, and the context of persons and places involved. Para III introduces Tunip, one of two \\"locations\\", city townfolk who authored an Amarna letter to the pharaoh; EA 59, From the Citizens of Tunip, and EA 100, The City of Irqata to the King. Notably, Para III ends with a list of 6 supply items needed for the arrival of messenger Han'i, a list similar to items needed for the arrival of archers (Egyptian pitati), part of Pharaoh's foreign army. The list ends with a cuneiform sign for \\"plural\\" for each listed item; though many signs are degraded in lines 21, 22, every alternate sign (mostly) in lines 21, 22, is for the plural: \\"ME≈† (cuneiform)\\" (or is a sumerogram equivalent).

Now, in all haste, I am going to build it. :(Para VI, 41-46)-And may my lord know that Hatip has taken half of the things that the king, my lord, gave (gave me). All the gold and silver that the king, my lord, gave me, Hatip has taken. May my lord know (this). :(Para VII, 47-53)-Moreover, the king, my lord, also said, \\"Why did you provide for the messenger of the king of Hatti, but did not provide for my messenger?\\" But this is the land of my lord, and the king, my lord, made me -one of the mayors! :(Para VIII, 54-56)-Let my lord's messenger come to me so I can give all that I promised in the presence of the king, my lord.

As a three-year-old in 1980 he finished second in The Derby and won the Group One Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. In the following year he added victories in the Coronation Cup and Eclipse Stakes before being retired to stud. He stood as a breeding stallion in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany with mixed results before his death in 2001. Background Master Willie was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and four white socks bred by William and Robert Barnett. He was sired by High Line, a stayer who won three consecutive runnings of the Jockey Club Cup. His dam, Fair Winter, was a top class racemare whose wins included the Nassau Stakes. Like all the Barnett's horses, the colt was trained by Henry Candy at Kingstone Warren in Oxfordshire. He was ridden in most of his races by Candy's stable jockey Philip Waldron. Racing career =1979: two-year-old season= Master Willie ran four times as a two-year-old in 1979, winning two races. He also finished first in the Acomb Stakes but was disqualified and relegated to second place. =1980: three- year-old season= Master Willie began his three-year-old season by winning the Easter Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse before finishing fourth in his next race. At York in May, Master Willie finished second to the Henry Cecil- trained Hello Gorgeous in the Dante Stakes, a major trial race for the Epsom Derby. At Epsom Downs Racecourse in June, Master Willie was one of twenty-four colts to contest the 201st running of the Epsom Derby. Starting as a 22/1 outsider he was settled in mid-division before producing a strong late run to finish second, three quarters of a length behind the winner Henbit. Master Willie started favourite for the Irish Derby at the end of June but was unsuited by the very soft (\\"gluepot\\") ground and finished fifth behind Tyrnavos. At York in August Master Willie was matched against fillies and older horses in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup and started at odds of 13/2. He appeared to be under pressure two furlongs from home but finished strongly to take the lead in the last strides to win by half a length from the Irish filly Cairn Rouge. He started favourite for the Valdoe Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse but was beaten one and a half lengths by the four-year-old Welsh Chanter. On his final appearance of the season, Master Willie finished second to Cairn Rouge in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 18 October. =1981: four-year-old season= Master Willie returned as a four-year-old in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket in April. Starting at odds of 2/1 he took an early lead and was never challenged, winning by ten lengths from King's Ride, with Henbit unplaced. Master Willie returned to Epsom for the Coronation Cup in June and was made the 1/2 favourite. On a course covered with litter left behind after the previous day's Derby, he led from the start and won easily from Prince Bee with the filly Vielle in third place. In July the colt was moved back in distance for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He started the 6/4 favourite and again made all the running to win by three quarters of a length from Hard Fought (subsequently disqualified) and Vielle. In July he contested the 31st running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. He led for most of the race but faded in the straight and finished fourth behind Shergar. In August Master Willie attempted to win the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup for the second time, but finished third behind Beldale Flutter. Master Willie was rested until October when he finished unplaced behind Vayrann in the Champion Stakes. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Master Willie was sold to the Windfields Farm and exported to stand as a breeding stallion in the United States. His sale valued him at $10 million, with Windfields owner E. P. Taylor regarding him as providing an outcross to Northern Dancer. He returned to the United Kingdom in 1988 and also stood in Germany. Master Willie suffered from an arthritic knee in later life and was euthanised at Conduit Farm in Oxfordshire in October 2001. After the horse's death Candy described him as \\"the most laid-back horse I've had. If you looked at the string from a mile away and there was a big gap in it, it would always be in front of Master Willie\\". His best winners included Make A Stand, Chilly Billy (Gimcrack Stakes), Deputy Governor (Eddie Read Handicap), Hollywood Dream (Premio Presidente della Repubblica, Deutschland-Preis) and Master Speaker (Ben Ali Stakes).

Zeledon's antbird feeds on insects, and regularly follows swarms of army ants in order to catch prey flushed by the swarms, but it is not an obligate ant-follower like some species of antbirds. Zeledon's antbird was described by the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in 1909 and given the binomial name Myrmeciza zeledoni. It was subsequently treated as a subspecies of the blue-lored antbird. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that the genus Myrmeciza was polyphyletic.

James Ormiston McWilliam Life Brought up in Dalkeith, McWilliam became a licentiate of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons in 1827, and entered the Royal Navy in 1829 as assistant-surgeon. After serving abroad in this capacity for seven years, he was appointed surgeon to 'HMS Scout on the west coast of Africa. McWilliam returned to England in November 1839, and attended the London medical schools and hospitals. He became M.D. of Edinburgh in 1840, and in September of the same year was appointed senior surgeon on board the steamer Albert, which joined the expedition sent to the River Niger for geographical and commercial purposes, and against the continuing Atlantic slave trade. The Albert and two other vessels left England on 12 May 1841, and entered the Niger on 18 August. On 4 September a malignant fever broke out in the Albert, and almost simultaneously in the other two vessels. The latter were sent back to sea filled with the sick and dying, leaving the Albert to continue the voyage alone. By 4 October the Albert had also turned back, and was managed for some days by McWilliam and William Stanger, the other officers and crew being unable to take part in the work. In ten days they reached the open sea. A few days later McWilliam himself was taken ill. Out of 145 Europeans who took part in the expedition 130 went down with fever and 40 died; but among 158 Africans there were only 11 cases of fever and 1 death. McWilliam reached England on 19 November 1841. After again serving two years afloat, McWilliam was sent on a special mission to the Cape de Verde Islands to inquire into the yellow fever which attacked the inhabitants of Boa Vista soon after the arrival of HMS Eclair. In 1847 he was appointed medical officer to the custom house, a post he retained till his death. In 1848 McWilliam was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1858 he became Companion of the Order of the Bath, and in 1859 Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London. He was a member of the Epidemiological Society, and for several years acted as secretary. He was also one of the secretaries to the medical section of the International Statistical Congress held in London in 1860. He worked to ensure that naval medical officers obtained the official recognition of their rights. McWilliam died, 4 May 1862, from the effects of a fall in his own home, No. 14 Trinity Square, Tower Hill. He left a widow and several children. Works McWilliam's Journal of Practice from 'HMS Scout. In 1843 he brought out Medical History of the Niger Expedition, which was well received. It included a history of the fever, description, morbid anatomy, sequences, causes, treatment, with cases; with an account of the state of medicine among the Africans and of vaccination; a description of the ventilation of the ships, which was carried out on the plan adopted by David Boswell Reid for the houses of parliament; an abstract of meteorological observations; and a brief account of the geology of the Niger, condensed from the notes of William Stanger. McWilliam's report which established that yellow fever had been imported into Boa Vista by the Eclair, was presented to parliament, and printed in 1847. He contributed to medical and other journals, and also wrote: *Remarks on Dr. Gilbert King's Report on the Fever at Boa Vista, 1848. *Exposition of the Case of the Assistant-Surgeons of the Royal Navy, 3rd edit. 1850. *Further Observations on that portion of Second Report on Quarantine by General Board of Health which relates to Yellow Fever Epidemic on board H.M.S.

The battle was fought as part of the allied counterattack to rid the German held ground of the 'Bulge' which forced them on the defensive. British XXX Corps with British 6th Airborne Division attached was tasked with clearing the area East of Dinant, Rochefort, Grupont and Bure. In a tough battle Bure was secured after nearly three days of heavy fighting whilst Gupont and Rochefort were both cleared with little resistance and the advance continued. Background In December 1944, the German armies launched a massive counter-attack through the forests of the Ardennes. The plan was to drive across the River Meuse and on to Antwerp to split the Allied armies and their lines of communication. As part of the First Allied Airborne Army, 6th Airborne Division was available as a component of the strategic reserve for the Allied forces in northwest Europe. The other two divisions available in reserve, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne, were already at Rheims in northern France. A the same time the 6th Airborne rested and re-trained after their success in Normandy was sent from England by sea to Belgium to assist in the defence.Hastings, p.239 On Christmas Day the 6th Airborne Division moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance. By Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur along the River Meuse.Saunders, p.279 Soon after British XXX corps eliminated the most furthest Western German penetration and thus advanced. The 3rd Parachute Brigade were on the left, 5th Parachute Brigade on the right, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade in reserve.Harclerode, p.549 By the time they arrived in position the German advance had faltered. Battle The positions soon after the German attack had faltered Just before New Year's Day the brigades were ordered to advance against the tip of the German salient. On 2 January 1945, they were to capture the villages of Bure and Grupont supported by the Sherman tanks of the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry detached from the 11th Armoured Division. Once these had been captured, a crossing over the River Lomme would be seized in order to halt any German breakthrough and thus put them firmly on the defensive. The following day the 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion of the 5th Parachute Brigade left Resteigne on foot and at 13:00 started the attack on Bure. Supported by the tanks, 'A' Company was to secure the village, while 'B' Company secured the high ground and 'C' Company was in reserve. The attack was met immediately with sustained heavy mortar and machine gun fire, supported by German armour and casualties began to rise in both companies. After being repelled they regrouped and attacked again and this time 'A' Company managed to gain a foothold in the village while 'B' Company reached the high ground by which it was able to enter Bure. At 17:00 'C' Company was sent in to reinforce 'A' and 'B' Companies, who were holding half the village with difficulty but this time they were supported by combined tank and artillery fire.Whiting, p.178 German counterattacks now began but the battalion was able to form a tight perimeter around half the village and develop strong points in all occupied buildings. As a result, they carried out fighting patrols and fought off four German counterattacks with one on 'A' Company which was only defeated when they called down artillery fire on their own positions. In the closeness of the fighting, the paratroopers used their fighting knives to avoid giving away their locations and casualties could not be evacuated nor could supplies be brought forward. On 4 January the battalion was subjected to a continuous artillery barrage, and fought off another five German counterattacks knocking out tanks with their PIATS. At one stage in the battle an ambulance did get in to Bure from which stepped a Sergeant of the 225th (Parachute) Field Ambulance from the Regimental Aid Post accompanied by a padre. It stopped a few yards from a German Tiger tank which had moved up to it, almost pointing its gun through the drivers window, a German officer appeared who agreed in perfect English that the wounded could be collected but the ambulance was not to return. By now the town of Bure was nearly a heap of rubble but the Germans clung to the houses and ruins, hid in cellars and catacombs, fighting and sniping to the end. Tiger tanks were still operating in the village which made mopping up extremely difficult. In the evening 'C' Company from 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry from 6th Airlanding Brigade joined the 13th Parachute Battalion as reinforcements, and in the early hours of 5 January, a determined attack by the Battalion succeeded in pushing the bulk of the Germans out of the village although one Tiger tank remained despite repeated PIAT attacks on it.Saunders, pp.279‚Äì280 However, by 21:00 the last German outpost was eliminated by' 'A Company and the village was secured and German resistance ceased. During the same time the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion had captured Grupont with only light resistance and with 5th Parachute Brigades objectives now taken the battle came to an end.Whiting, p.181 Aftermath Memorial at Bure, Belgium In the fight to capture Bure and the surrounding villages, the units sustained heavy casualties. The 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion lost about a third its strength: seven officers and 182 enlisted (68 killed in action). The 2nd Battalion, Ox and Bucks, lost one officer and 20 enlisted (seven KIA). The Fife and Forfar Yeomanry and 23rd Hussars also suffered heavy casualties including the loss of sixteen Sherman tanks. The Belgian SAS lost three men during the action whilst supporting the attack on Bure. The 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion was pulled back from Bure and replaced by troops from the 29th Armoured Brigade. The men of 6th Airborne went on to liberate Wavreille, Jemelle, On, Hargimont, Nassogne, Forrieres, Masbourg, Lesterny, Amberloup, Marloie, Waha and Roy. At Bande on 11 January 1945, a patrol from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion who had been in reserve, accompanied by the Belgian SAS, discovered the bodies of thirty four civilians who had been murdered by the Germans on Christmas Eve.Toland, p.355 By the middle of 6 January the 6th Airborne Division withdrew to Holland and patrolled along the River Maas before returning to the United Kingdom in late February in preparation for their next undertaking in Operation Varsity. When General Courtney Hodges commanding the First US Army joined up with General George S. Patton's Third US Army on 16 January 1945, the Allies launched a counter-offensive towards the German border which recaptured all the ground that had been gained during the offensive.Saunders, p.283 =Legacy= A memorial dedicated to 13 Para stands in the centre of Bure and in the church there is a memorial book to the men of the 6th British Airborne Division killed fighting during the Ardennes campaign and in addition the CWGC at Hotton.

He played for Cambridge University, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and Nottinghamshire between 1888 and 1896. He was born at Arnold, Nottinghamshire and died at Worksop, also in Nottinghamshire. He was known during his lifetime as \\"Sandford Robinson\\" as his father was called \\"John Robinson\\". Robinson's father founded the successful Home Brewery in Daybrook, Arnold in 1875, later acquired Worksop Manor and was knighted in 1905; Sandford Robinson was sent to Harrow School and then he went to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper, but neither at school nor at university did he make much impression: at Harrow he did not play in the grand set-piece cricket matches against the other major public schools, though he did appear in a 12-a-side match with the MCC in 1886. At Cambridge, he played in two trial games but was given only one chance in the first team: a match against the Gentlemen of England in which he opened the batting, scored 7 and 1, and took a catch in each innings. He did no better in a game for Nottinghamshire later in that season and in single matches in both 1889 and 1890 against Cambridge University ‚Äì playing for an opposing team was a frequent ploy used by Cambridge when they wanted to try a cricketer out, but in Robinson's case it led to no further first-team appearances. Robinson graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1890. In 1891 and 1892, he played first-class cricket fairly regularly for Nottinghamshire, captaining the team on occasion, and for some amateur teams, though only in 1892 did he have any success: his two first-class scores of more than 50 both came in this season. His best innings was a score of 72 in the Nottinghamshire game against Middlesex when he put on 161 for the fifth wicket with Arthur Shrewsbury, who made 212. At the end of the 1892 English cricket season he joined Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1892‚Äì93, where he played in a single first-class match; he did not then appear at all in first-class cricket in 1893. He reappeared in Nottinghamshire matches in 1894 and occasionally kept wicket that season, and at the end of it he went on a second tour, this time with Lord Hawke to North America, where he played in two first-class cricket matches. He played occasionally in both 1895 and 1896 with no success. Robinson had other interests outside cricket, though he appears not to have had a career or profession. He was a captain in the Robin Hood Rifles, a volunteer army unit raised in Nottinghamshire and he also played football for Worksop Town F. C.. He was also engaged in field sports and a fall from his horse while hunting two weeks before he died was thought to have accelerated his death, which was unexpected.

His ability and performances over those games made him instantly popular with supporters of the Norfolk club. Preparations for the 2003‚Äì04 season looked extremely promising when The Linnets announced Stevenson would be signing a permanent deal for the coming season. However, he ruptured a cruciate knee ligament during a pre-season training camp and it looked unlikely that he would take any part in the following season. He underwent surgery following his injury, and managed to return to action in February 2004. He came on as a substitute in a 5-0 league win at Erith & Belvedere, scoring within 60 seconds of coming on to the field. He played in all of King's Lynn's final 16 matches that season and scored some crucial goals as they eventually secured the Southern League Eastern Division title by 3 points. This saw them gain promotion to the Southern Premier League. Stevenson remained with The Linnets for the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season in the new look Southern Premier League with the club tipped amongst the favourites for promotion again. However the season began inconsistently for both the club (which saw the managers depart after just eight games); and Stevenson who was struggling with injuries and in and out of the team as a result. New manager Tommy Taylor began dramatically reshaping the playing squad, despite releasing a number of players he expressed that he was keen to keep Stevenson. However, he was forced to announce his departure from the club in November 2004. It had been discovered that there were still complications surrounding the knee surgery he had the previous year. Following further surgery and almost two years out of the game, Stevenson signed for Northern League side Belper Town in 2006. Stevenson joined Eastwood Town from Belper Town in summer 2010. He signed with Mansfield Town in May 2011, becoming a full-time professional footballer for the first time. He was loaned out to Alfreton Town in October 2011. He scored 11 goals in 27 Conference Premier games in the 2012‚Äì13 season as the \\"Stags\\" won promotion to the Football League as champions of the Conference.

He went on to score three goals in the Linnets' final six matches of the season, helping them narrowly avoid relegation from the Northern Premier League. Stevenson made his move back to The Walks permanent during June 2015, despite King's Lynn Town being moved from the Northern Premier to the Southern Premier Division. He missed only one game for the Linnets during the 2015‚Äì16 season, scoring 16 times from 53 appearances. On 24 May 2016 he agreed to stay at King's Lynn for the 2016‚Äì17 season.

Life Described also as a palm oil merchant of Liverpool, and as of Glasgow, Jamieson sought to open up major African rivers to navigation and commerce. His schooner, the Warree, went to the River Niger in 1838. In 1839 he equipped the Ethiope, and its commander, Captain John Beecroft, explored several West African rivers, to higher points in some instances than had then been reached by Europeans. In 1840 Jamieson was offered, but declined, a vice-presidency of the Institut d'Afrique of France. When the Second Melbourne ministry, in 1841, supported the African Colonisation Expedition to the Niger, he denounced the scheme. The attempt was abandoned from September 1841, and on 25 October many of the surviving colonists were rescued by the Ethiope. Jamieson died in London on 5 April 1861. Works Narratives of explorations were published by Jamieson and others in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. Jamieson opposed the Niger expedition in Appeals to the Government and People of Great Britain, where he claimed the proposed colonisers would be monopolists. He pointed out the fulfilment of his predictions of disaster in Sequel to two Appeals (London, 1843). In 1859 Jamieson published Commerce with Africa, emphasising the insufficiency of treaties for the suppression of the African slave trade, and urging the use of the land route from Cross River to the Niger.

It is Egypt‚Äôs leading independent, liberal newspaper. History Cover of the final edition of Egypt Independent Egypt Independent was a weekly, 24-page English- language newspaper that had evolved from the English web edition of the newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm. Its first edition was published on 24 November 2011. In December 2011, the second edition of the newspaper was prevented from being printed, following internal censorship of an article written by political scientist Robert Springborg which was critical of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. In April 2013, the editorial team was informed by the management of Al-Masry Media Corporation that their print and online news operation will be shut down. The editorial team decided to put together a closing edition, which would have been published on 25 April, \\"to explain the conditions under which a strong voice of independent and progressive journalism in Egypt is being terminated\\". However, the management decided in the last minute to withhold the printing of the final edition, so the editorial team decided to publish it online. The online edition of Egypt Independent was re-launched later that year. Founding of Mada Masr On 30 June 2013, Mada Masr published its first issue. In the first article published, the editorial team described the planning process for the launch: \\"We decided we want to publish in Arabic as well as English, that we want to see more data-based reports, more investigative journalism. We want to experiment with different ways of storytelling. And very importantly, develop a business model and deploy a visionary commercial team that helps make our work sustainable.\\" The article also described how the editorial team arrived at the name: \\"It needed a name. An Arabic name that was easy to say in English, but one that also reflected our practice of independent, progressive journalism. After a long process, we came to Mada. It is the Arabic word for range, scope or span, but it's also the spot where a stone is placed on a ring, a symbol of taking a position.\\" The article concluded with: \\"Today Mada Masr is born amid many challenges and uncertainties. But it's also born out of inevitability. It is the inevitability of rebuilding a home for our team and our practice, the inevitability of a different form of journalism, the inevitability of experimentation and adventure as the only gateway for our imagination to strive.\\" Since then, Mada Masr published a number of articles on different topics such as politics, economy, environment, culture and lifestyle, and some of their articles on current affairs in Egypt were referenced by international news media. As an example, an article by Sarah Carr about the political movement The Third Square was quoted extensively in a New York Times blog article about the subject. Freedom of press in Egypt In July 2013, an article by the Associated Press about media bias in Egypt following the military coup quoted Lina Atallah, editor-in-chief of Mada Masr, as saying that there was increased pressure on journalists to toe the line, pointing to the coverage of protester killings, which repeated the military's version of the violence. \\"What's scary about this time around in the media performance is that there is much more agenda-setting from above,\\" she said. Mada Masr has been censored in Egypt since June 2017. No official statements were issued regarding the block on websites, which also affected 20 other outlets. Mada Masr media company filed a lawsuit several weeks later, petitioning the Egyptian National Telecom Regulatory Authority (NTRA) to provide official documentation of the decision behind it, if there had been one, and technical explanation as to how the block was enacted, requesting that ISPs to remove obstacles placed to prevent users from accessing its website. NTRA denied it was responsible for administering the block, an assertion it has maintained throughout the case. A back and forth ensued, with lawyers representing Mada Masr and the Communications and Information Technology Ministry arguing that it was solely responsible, and the NTRA countering that website blocks fell under the purview of the Supreme Media Regulatory Council or a national security body, which includes the presidency, the Interior Ministry, the General Intelligence Services and Administrative Control Authority as designated by Article 1 of the communication law (Law 10/2003), According to Article 64 of the law, the Armed Forces are also considered an agency concerned with national security, when it comes to technical capabilities that include: telecommunications equipment, systems and programs. as media regulatory bodies continued to deny involvement in the blocking of access to its website, Mada Masr Media requested that the court add the president of Egypt, the defense minister, deputy head of the General Intelligence Service, the interior minister and head of the Supreme Media Regulatory Council as respondents in the case. with no information provided by the state lawyers and the NTRA, on September 30 2018, the date the court set to announce a verdict; the court referred the case for a technical review. The case would be referred to the NTRA, but because the body is a respondent in the case, it has been handed to the Authority of Experts at the Justice Ministry, essentially suspending the judicial process until an unknown date, as the ministry‚Äôs Authority of Experts could take years to examine the case, according to the lawyer Hazem Azhary. The papers' editor-in-chief, Lina Attalah, was arrested on 17 May 2020 by Egyptian security forces. She was released on bail later the same day.

Fitzgerald, William D. Mahon (1861-1949), and Hugh Frayne (1869-1934) in 1916. William Daniel Mahon (1861‚Äì1949) was a former coal miner and streetcar driver who became president of the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees of America, now the Amalgamated Transit Union. Early years William D. Mahon was born in Athens, Ohio in 1861. He worked in the Hocking Valley coalfields of Ohio as a miner. In the late 1880s he moved to Columbus, Ohio and became a mule car driver. Mahon wrote of conditions in the days of horse-drawn trolleys, \\"It is a fact that in the early days the horse received much better treatment than the car man who drove him. Men could be easily replaced even at the miserable wages paid, but a horse cost money.\\" In 1893 Mahon represented the Columbus local in asking the Ohio Legislature pass a law requiring streetcar companies to enclose their cars to protect the platform men. The request was successful despite strong opposition from the street railway owners, and the first vestibule law was passed that year. The Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employes of America (\\"the Amalgamated\\") was founded at a meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, in September 1892 called by Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor. Mahon attended the meeting as representative of the Columbus local, but said little. William J. Law was elected president. The union struggled during its first year, and Law proved to be an ineffective leader. William D. Mahon was elected president at the 1893 convention. Labor leader Unlike other AFL unions, the Amalgamated had an industrial charter, in theory covering all occupations in the transit industry. In practice, it mainly focused on motormen and conductors. Mahon was president of the Amalgamated from 1893 until he retired in 1946. From 1898 to 1900 he was also the presiding judge at the Michigan State Court of Arbitration. At the start of the 20th century the Amalgamated Association launched a militant organizing program. Although the union was always willing to arbitrate in disputes, there were many strikes against the streetcar companies. Often these turned violent. The public and small businesses sympathized with the strikers, and passengers and other unions often became involved in the street actions. On 4 July 1897 the United Mine Workers called for a general strike for improved pay. Over 100,000 miners walked off the job in the first four days. The AFL saw the importance to the overall labor movement of the strike succeeding, and on 9 July 1897 placed Mahon in charge of coordinating a plan to help the West Virginia miners. Union organizers spoke in mining towns throughout the coalfields, and the orderly behavior of the miners even when provoked drew public support. The strike was successful, and was a great victory for the labor movement. Mahon became a member of the executive committee of the National Civic Federation (NCF), an organization in which labor leaders and business executives discussed cooperation. Towards the end of 1904 August Belmont, president of the NCF and head of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) of New York, began working towards removing the unions from the IRT. Belmont brought in strikebreakers and failed to comply with existing contracts with the unions. This was not appropriate behavior for the NCF president. The New York conciliation committee of the NCF approached Mahon and Warren Stanford Stone of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, \\"trying to impress the labor end of the dispute with the importance of being fair and decent.\\" Mahon and Stone agreed not to support a strike, but the locals walked out anyway, although the strike did not last long. As of October 1907 the NCF had three categories of executive committee member. \\"On the Part of the Public\\" included people such as former President Grover Cleveland, the industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and Episcopal Bishop Henry C. Potter of New York City. \\"On the Part of Employers\\" included the heads of major companies in industry, transport, finance and publishing. \\"On the Part of Wage Earners\\" included Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor and the heads of major unions including Mahon. In May 1913 Mahon was appointed to a three-man Detroit Street Railway Commission by Mayor Oscar Marx to study the possibility of municipal ownership of the streetcar lines. The Detroit United Railway had a monopoly of streetcar service in the city. The Street Railway Commission made an offer to purchase the DUR in late summer of 1913, which was rejected. However, they agreed that the question of municipal ownership would be submitted to the voters, and if they approved the Wayne County Circuit Court would set the price. In April 1914 Mahon quit the commission claiming that Mayor Marx was trying to subvert the municipal takeover. In May 1915 the Detroit street railway workers went on strike for a day. During World War I (1914-1918) Mahon made much of the contribution of streetcar workers to the war effort. Although employees complained that the streetcar operators were not raising wages to compensate for inflation, he said, \\"But no matter how justifiable this unrest may be, it must not influence us to acts that will compromise our integrity as an organization of workers that stands by its agreements and holds its obligations sacred.\\" He generally managed to prevent strikes during the war. After the war ended, however, Mahon was unable to prevent a wave of strikes. Mahon was twice a member of the executive council of the American Federation of Labor, from 1917‚Äì23 and 1935-46. After the 1932 Presidential election, the AFL wanted one of their members to be chosen Secretary of Labor, as had generally been done in the past. Mahon supported Daniel J. Tobin, president of the Teamsters, who won the backing of the AFL Executive Council. In the end President Franklin D. Roosevelt selected Frances Perkins, who took office on 5 March 1933. In 1936 Mahon was on the AFL Executive Council during a crisis in the relationship with the recently formed CIO (Committee for Industrial Organization), the precursor of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The CIO advocated industrial unionism, with one union representing all workers in a given plant, while the AFL was dominated by supporters of craft unionism, with different unions for each skilled occupation. The council voted 13-1 to give ten unions a deadline for breaking with the CIO or else being suspended from the AFL. Mahon was not entirely comfortable with the decision, but voted with the majority. Only David Dubinsky of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union voted against. William D. Mahon retired in 1946 and died three years later at the age of 88. He was said to have been the longest-serving leader of a union in the history of the United States. Beliefs Mahon had strong religious beliefs. In an 1899 speech he called for the church to play a greater role in supporting organized labor, saying its \\"true mission\\" was to \\"establish the brotherhood of man.\\" The report of the union's 1899 convention says the \\"question of drawing the color line in Ritual and Constitution was discussed at some length, and it was stated by delegates from the South that they had never seen a colored man on a streetcar.\\" Despite this, when Mahon visited the south he spoke to groups of black union members. In 1937 Alexander F. Whitney informed mayor Fiorello La Guardia of New York City that the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen planned to start organizing Independent Subway System (ISS) motormen and conductors. At first, LaGuardia said he had no objection. Later he noted that the non-segregated Amalgamated Association might be more appropriate given the number of black ISS conductors. Mahon saw arbitration as the best way to solve disputes, and would not authorize strikes unless the employer rejected this approach. In 1918 a strike by laundry workers in Kansas City escalated into a general strike involving streetcar workers. Mahon met the local union leaders and voiced his strong disapproval, saying they had violated their contracts and damaged the possibility of good relations with their employers. He and other union chiefs would order the strikers back to work if the local leaders refused to do so. In September 1920 Brooklyn Rapid Transit workers went on strike. Mahon addressed a meeting of the strikers. He said, \\"I regret you were not more prudent and careful in going out on strike. You can get into strikes easily and I regret your impatience. The thing, however, has been done...\\" He then called for New York Mayor John Francis Hylan to be appointed the sole arbiter of the strike. William D. Mahon was quoted as saying \\"I would sooner face the world with an organization of ten thousand men with $1 million in their treasury than I would with an organization of ten million men with ten thousand in their treasury.\\" References Notes Citations Sources      * * Category:1861 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Leaders of American trade unions Category:Amalgamated Transit Union people Category:Trade unionists from Ohio Category:American coal miners Category:People from Athens, Ohio ","title":"William D.

United States, 364 U.S. 206 (1960), was a US Supreme Court decision that held the \\"silver platter doctrine\\", which allowed federal prosecutors to use evidence illegally gathered by state police, to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.. Evidence of illegal wiretapping had been seized from the home of James Butler Elkins by Portland, Oregon police officers on an unrelated search warrant, and he was subsequently convicted in federal court. Elkins appealed, arguing that evidence found by the officers should have been inadmissible under the exclusionary rule, which forbids the introduction of most evidence gathered through Fourth Amendment violations in criminal court. In a 5-4 decision, the Court overturned the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented. By giving a rationale for a broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision prepared the way for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.  Silver platter doctrine  The Fourth Amendment prevents most warrantless searches by law enforcement officers, and since Weeks v. United States (1914), has been enforced by the exclusionary rule, which excludes most evidence gathered through Fourth Amendment violations from criminal trials. While Wolf v. Colorado (1949) had held the amendment to apply to the states, a process known as incorporation, the exclusionary rule had explicitly not been incorporated by the decision. Evidence gathered by state law enforcement was therefore not yet bound by the same strictures as that gathered by federal law enforcement. In Lustig v. United States (1949), Justice Felix Frankfurter coined the silver platter doctrine, ruling that evidence gathered by Fourth Amendment violations was still admissible if state police gave it to federal officials on \\"a silver platter\\"--that is, without any level of involvement by federal authorities. This doctrine nonetheless created an incentive for federal authorities to coordinate with state law enforcement in the gathering of evidence.  Background of the case  Portland, Oregon police officers searched the home of James Butler Elkins, ostensibly for obscene material, and seized tape recordings that Elkins had made from illegal wiretaps. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of intercepting and divulging telephone communications, but appealed his federal conviction on the grounds that state police had gathered the evidence against him in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. His conviction was upheld by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.  Court's decision  Associate Justice Potter Stewart Associate Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the court in this case, in which Chief Justice Earl Warren and Associate Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and William J. Brennan, Jr. joined. Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Associate Justices John M. Harlan II, Charles E. Whittaker, and Tom C. Clark. Harlan also wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Whittaker and Clark. The Court overturned the silver platter doctrine, ruling that \\"[e]vidence obtained by state officers during a search which, if conducted by federal officers, would have violated the defendant's immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible\\". Elkins' conviction was therefore overturned. Stewart wrote that the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule was to provide a disincentive to abuses by law enforcement, stating that \\"[t]he rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter-- to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way--by removing the incentive to disregard it.\\" Frankfurter's dissent criticized the extension of the exclusionary rule, noting that the conduct of the state police in the Elkins investigation had already been found illegal at the state level; he argued that the Court's extension of the rule would only create further confusion, and that the relation between federal and state criminal law should be governed by the principle of federalism. Harlan's dissent followed similar reasoning to Frankfurter's and argued that Elkins' conviction should be upheld. Scholar Jacob W. Landynski called Stewart's opinion \\"the most thorough and convincing analysis in favor of the exclusionary rule to be found in any opinion of the Court\\". In giving a rationale for a broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision set the stage for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.

He invited Boris Kustodiev to create artwork for the performance. The upheaval caused by the February and October Revolutions and the Russian Civil War led to desperate conditions in the cities. The currency was devalued and there was no money for the theatre to pay Chaliapin for his performance. Instead the theatre offered Chaliapin a rich fur coat, taken from a Soviet warehouse containing items confiscated from rich people during the revolution.ru: –í –º–µ–º–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –º—É–∑–µ–µ –®–∞–ª—è–ø–∏–Ω–∞ –≤–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ –≤—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ –ö—É—Å—Ç–æ–¥–∏–µ–≤–∞ ‚Äî –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç –®–∞–ª—è–ø–∏–Ω–∞ –≤ –±–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π —à—É–±–µ Chaliapin wore the coat on a visit to Kustodiev to invite him to design artworks for the performance. Kustodiev was ill at the time and was unable to walk. When Kustodiev learned of the coat's history, confiscated from its previous owner, he announced his intention to paint a portrait of Chaliapin in this coat. Thus began a double work: Feodor Chaliapin brought Kustodiev to the theatre to work on the stage scenery, and Kustodiev painted Chaliapin's portrait at home. The Soviet government had allocated only a small room to Kustodiev, and there was not enough space to work on a single canvas. Instead Kustodiev painted it in parts. Chaliapin talked about himself as he posed, and at times they sang together. The Portrait of Chaliapin is typical of Kustodiev's style, and is set against a background of festivity, specifically the Russian traditions of Maslenitsa. Kustodiev titled the picture New City, depicting a city where Chaliapin had arrived for the first time while on tour. But the name did not stick, and the picture became known as the Portrait of Chaliapin. The picture is full of symbolism. Chaliapin rises over the people, from which he had emerged. He is dressed in a smart suit, holding a cane, as was fashionable at the time. Kustodiev included in the scene Chaliapin's favourite dog. In the lower left corner of the portrait Kustodiev painted Chaliapin's daughters Mary and Martha, strolling on the festive square, accompanied by a close friend, the secretary of singer I. Dvorictchin. They are shown near a theatre poster promoting Chaliapin's concert. In 1922 Chaliapin emigrated from Russia, taking the portrait with him.ru: –ë. –ú. –ö—É—Å—Ç–æ–¥–∏–µ–≤ That same year Kustodiev made a miniature copy of the portrait, which is now displayed in the Russian Museum, St. Petersburg.

Born at Tullamore, County Offaly to a farming family, as a youth he considered a vocation with the Irish Christian Brothers but withdrew due to chronic poor health. As the Legion's Envoy beginning he left Ireland on 16 July 1953 accompanied by Seamus Grace, on their way to Bogota. He went to serve in Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Brazil, as well as Argentina, where he died in Buenos Aires at age 26 from stomach cancer. He is interred in the vault of the Irish Christian Brothers, in Buenos Aires's Recoleta Cemetery. It is said that his missionary work for the Legion of Mary was greatly helped by his ability to learn languages as he quickly became fluent in both Spanish and Portuguese. He was kidnapped, briefly, but his captors granted him a phone call to prove who he was so he called that Irish Ambassador to vouch for him and this resulted in his release. While in Argentina he also learned Russian with the intention of visiting the Soviet Union but he died before that intention could be realised. On each anniversary of his death there are celebrations throughout South America in his honour by the members of the Legion of Mary. A Cause for Canonization for Lambe was introduced by the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires in 1978 and concluded on 26 March 2015. On 17 January 2020 the Ordinary Congress of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints appointed Monsignor Brosel Gavila Jos√© Jaime as Relator for the Cause to take forward the process of the potential canonisation of Alfie Lambe.

His family encouraged his art studies, and Quadrone enrolled in the Accademia Albertina, where he studied with Enrico Gamba and Gaetano Ferri (1822‚Äì1896) and won the Triennial competition. He initially painted in a realistic style, but this changed after traveling to Paris in 1870, where he worked in the studios of Jean-L√©on Gerome and befriended Giuseppe De Nittis. Back in Turin, he continued to paint genre scenes, mainly of laborers in folkloric dress. He also painted many scenes of hunting, often with dogs, and horse-racing themes. He was mainly represented by the Florentine gallery of Luigi Pisani. In the 1880s, he travelled frequently to Sardinia, where he was married. Cacciando website, biography of Quadrone. Although sometimes referred to as the \\"Italian Meissonier, some later critics called him a Flemish Piedmontese, reflecting his ardent adhesion to realism in his animal paintings. The Museo Borgogna of Vercelli displays his Lo studio dello scultore (1891). He painted this subject of the artist in his studio on other occasions: Vergognosa!

Early life and career  Battle Company and The War At Home exhibition at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce, Commerce, Texas, 2015 Trieb was born on July 1, 1982 in Dallas, Texas. Her parents are Michele Pegues and Mark Alan Trieb. She received a bachelor of arts degree from Texas A&M; University-Commerce. Trieb started her career in photography in Israel and Palestine in 2004. In 2005 she worked as a part time newspaper correspondent for the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News.  Professional photojournalism  Trieb began her career as a professional photojournalist in 2007. She has worked for numerous magazines and newspapers. She has worked all over the world but is focused on the Middle East and the United States. Some countries Trieb has visited for her photojournalism include Israel, Syria, Palestine, Iraq, Bosnia, and Turkey. Director of Photography at NBC News James Collins described Trieb as \\"a visually creative person but also as a solid journalist.\\" The work of photographs and visual news like Trieb's is starting to change the way certain cultures look at their identity.

Accessed 29 November 2017 = The Homecoming Project = One of Trieb's biggest projects is The Homecoming Project. It was designed to draw attention Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and begin a dialogue about how to help soldiers who struggle with it. Trieb followed members of the United States Army's tenth mountain division in Afghanistan. She notes that the hardest part of this project was not the shootouts, the landmines, or the fact that she was the only woman in sight (a commonality that is starting to be brought to the surface), it was seeing the effect war has on these people. Trieb recounts that most of the soldiers had some psychological problems. The Homecoming Project started a conversation about how to deal with the mental health problems soldiers face. This work has been shown all around the world. Trieb's website describes the Homecoming project displaying \\"the trauma, loss, courage, and struggle so many service members experience after exiting the battlefield.\\" = Girls basketball in Iraq = Trieb photographed a women's basketball team in Iraqi Kurdistan shortly after the 2014 ISIS conflict between the two. During this time, women's sports were not widely accepted in the area. Trieb photographed the story of women trying to change the way their country sees them.  Women's issues  Roughly 10% of those involved in photojournalism are women. Trieb is part of Women Photograph, an organization that highlights women photographers and photojournalists worldwide and works to reduce the large gender gap in the industry. She was a featured \\"icon\\" in Outside magazine's special adventurous women issue. Trieb is an avid advocate for gender and ethnicity diversification in photojournalism, saying \\"Minorities, especially women and people of color, have a unique perspective and voice that needs to be seen and heard.

The Tomb of the Red Queen is a burial chamber containing remains, perhaps of Lady Ix Tz'akbu Ajaw, located inside Temple XIII in the ruins of the ancient Maya city of Palenque, now the Palenque National Park, in the Chiapas state in southern Mexico. It has been dated to between 600 and 700 AD. The tomb was discovered in 1994 by the Mexican archeologist Fanny Lopez Jimenez http://www.mexiconewsnetwork.com/art-culture/red-queen-palenque/ The Red Queen Of Palenque on mexiconewsnetwork.com after being commissioned to perform routine stabilization work on a temple stairs by the local Archaeologist Arnoldo Gonzalez Cruz. http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places- americas/mystery-mayan-red-queen-008659?nopaging=1 The Mystery of the Mayan Red Queen The Mystery of the Mayan Red Queen on ancient-origins.net It takes its popular name from the fact that the remains of the noblewoman and the objects in the sarcophagus were covered with bright red cinnabar powder when the tomb was discovered.http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeologic7/ss/Palenque-Walking- Tour_4.htm Archeology.about.com article on Temple XIII and the structures of Palenque (Retrieved August 3, 2013) Temple XIII The Pyramid of the Inscriptions is in the foreground, the smaller Temple XIII is just next to it to the right. Palenque was one of the wealthiest and most powerful of the Maya city states in Pre-Columbian Mexico. It was located in the foothills of the Chiapas mountains, on a site where several rivers come together, with waterfalls and pools; the name of the site in modern Mayan is Lakam Ha, or \\"big water\\". The site was first occupied in the early Classical Period (200-600 AD) and fell in about 800 AD. The City went into a decline and was gradually abandoned and reclaimed by the jungle. Spanish explorers first visited the site in 1773 and 1784, and a Spanish military expedition was sent to the city in 1786; they broke down walls searching for treasure, but did not find the royal tombs. Several explorers visited the city in the 19th century, making drawings and publishing reports about the ruins. In 1948, an archaeologist, Alberto Ruz Lhuillier, discovered the hidden entrance to the Pyramid of the Inscriptions, and four years later he opened the tomb of Pakal, with its treasures; but Temple XIII remained unexplored for decades. The ruins of Palenque cover an area of about a square mile, with hundreds of structures. In the center of the city are a large palace and a group of three pyramids, located on the Great Plaza, or main square. The largest pyramid, the Pyramid of the Inscriptions, was constructed especially for the remains of Pakal or Pakal the Great, who ruled from 615 AD until 683 AD, the period of the city's greatest glory. An internal stairway with a concealed entrance on the side of the pyramid led down to the burial chamber beneath the pyramid. Next to it are two smaller but similar pyramids. Temple XIII is next to the Pyramid of the Inscriptions, and much smaller in size. It is about twelve meters high, built in steps, with an external stairway leading to the top. An internal stairway led into the center of the pyramid, but it had completely collapsed and was blocked by debris. In 1973 the archeologist Jorge Acosta explored the first two levels of Temple XIII, but did not find the entrance to the burial chamber. The Discovery In the spring of 1994, a young Mexican archaeologist named Fanny L√≥pez Jim√©nez was performing routine stabilization work on a temple adjacent to the Temple of the Inscriptions. Fanny (do we really have to know all these trivia?) noted a small crack on the stairs, partially covered by masonry and some weeds. Using her flashlight and a mirror, she peered into a narrow passageway hidden by the stairs, that seemed to conduct to a sealed door. She immediately notified her discovery to the team leader, Arnoldo Gonzales Cruz. The next day the archaeology team working for the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico, began to explore what Fanny had uncovered. They located a small blocked door on a vertical section on the second level of the pyramid, about 2.8 meters above the level of the Plaza. The team removed the masonry and found a narrow corridor six meters long, blocked by debris, leading into the pyramid. That corridor led to another corridor, fifteen meters long, made of large limestone blocks, which ran from north to south inside the pyramid. This corridor was free of debris. There were three chambers on the south side of the corridor; two were open and empty, with signs of rituals performed in front, but the third was blocked by a stone wall covered with stucco, and traces of pigment. The team headed by Cruz was extremely curious to know what was inside, but they did not tear down the wall right away, fearing to damage any decoration on the inside of the wall. After deliberation, they made a small hole fifteen centimeters by fifteen centimeters, and peered inside. They saw a sarcophagus and what appeared to be a perfectly intact tomb. http://www.mesoweb.com/palenque/features/red_queen/08.html A first-person account of the discovery of the tomb by Arnoldo Gonzales Cruz, from mesoweb.com (Retrieved August 3, 2013) http://arqueologiamexicana.mx/mexico- antiguo/quien-es-la-reina-roja [Spanish] ¬øQui√©n es la Reina Roja? by Fanny L√≥pez Jim√©nez on arqueologiamexicana.mx The Burial Chamber The burial chamber and the stairway leading into it. The chamber was 3.8 meters long and 2.5 meters wide, with a vaulted stone ceiling. There were no decorations or paintings on the walls. In the center, occupying almost all the burial chamber, was a limestone sarcophogus 2.4 meters long and 1.8 meters wide, closed by a stone lid ten centimeters thick. Atop the lid was a censer with a lid and a small spindle whorl. At the western end of the sacarcophus a badly preserved skeleton of a male about eleven years old was found lying on the floor. He was evidently a servant who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the Red Queen into Xibalba, the \\"Place of Fear\\", the Maya name for the underworld. At the eastern end of the sarcophogus was a second skeleton of a woman 30‚Äì35 years old, who also had apparently been sacrificed. On the first step leading to the chamber was a large brown ceramic plate and two orange ceramic vases, as well as some human remains; long bones and teeth inlaid with jade. The sarcophagus The archaeologists carefully lifted the lid of the sarcophogus by twenty centimeters, a laborious process which took fourteen hours. Inside they found the remains of a woman lying on her back. Her skeleton was covered and surrounded by a large collection of jade and pearl objects, bone needles and shells, which were originally pieces of necklaces, earspools and wristlets. Around the skull was a diadem made of flat circular jade beads, and the malachite pieces of what had been a funeral mask. In the chest area of the skeleton were more flat jade beads and four obsidian blades. In addition, there was a tiny limestone figurine inside a seashell. The skeleton, the collection of objects and the inside of the sarcophogus were entirely covered with a bright red dust made of cinnabar, or the ground ore of mercury.Arnoldo Gonzalez Cruz, \\"La Reina Roja: una tomba real en Palenque\\" The Identity of the Red Queen The remains of the \\"Red Queen\\" and the objects in the tomb were taken to the laboratory of Mexican National Institute of Archeology and History for further study, The tomb was dated to between 600-700 AD by a comparison of the ceramic pottery with that found at other Maya sites. The scientists conducted carbon 14 tests and facial reconstructions studies, and successfully extracted a sample of DNA from the collagen in her vertebrae. They were able to establish that she was about sixty years old when she died, and that she had a severe case of osteoporosis that stiffened her bones. They established that she consumed a large amount of meat in her diet, and had remarkably healthy teeth considering her age and the time in which she lived; but there are no inscriptions in the burial chamber of other texts to establish with certainty who she was. It was certain that she was a person of importance; The pyramid where her burial chamber was located was next to that of Pakal the Great, and objects in the tomb - the funeral mask, diadem and other objects in the sarcophagus - were similar to those found in the tomb of Pakal. When the tomb was discovered it was suggested that she was the mother of Pakal, an important figure who had been co-ruler of the state for a time, but the DNA tests showed that the Red Queen did not have common DNA with Pakal. The current theory (August 2013) is that she was Ix Tz'akbu Ajaw, the wife of Pakal, and the grandmother of the last Mayan ruler. Arnoldo Gonzalez Cruz and his team hope to find the tombs of the sons of Pakal in the yet-unexplored other temples of Palenque, which, if their DNA is intact, could confirm her identity.Arnoldo Gonzalez Cruz, \\"La Reina Roja: una tomba real en Palenque \\" Her remains were returned to Palenque in June 2012, and buried in a different location, since the humidity inside the pyramid did not allow returning her remains to the sarcophagus. The mystery of her identity remains unresolved.http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2‚à´_new=60129#.Uf_LY3waySM  Article in Artnews on DNA testing of the Red Queen References =Notes and citations= =Bibliography= * External links * Category:Palenque Category:Maya sites in Chiapas Category:Pyramids in Mexico Category:Maya architecture ","title":"Tomb of the Red Queen"},{"id":"40151750","text":"Old Los Angeles is a 1948 American Western film directed by Joseph Kane and written by Gerald Drayson Adams and Clements Ripley.

The railway originally formed as the Prince Edward County Railway in 1879, running between Picton and Trenton, where it connected with the Grand Trunk Railway that ran between Montreal and Toronto. After being purchased by a group of investors and receiving a new charter to build northward, the railway renamed as the COR in 1882 and the company started building towards the gold fields at Eldorado and newly discovered iron fields in Coe Hill. On reaching Coe Hill in 1884, the mine was found to have low grade ore, nearly bankrupting the company. Expansion continued to other mining areas around Bancroft, along with two wholly owned subsidiary lines, the Ontario, Belmont and Northern Railway, later known as the Marmora Railway, and the Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway. The later was supposed to connect to the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (OA&PS;) at Barry's Bay, but these plans were shelved. A new route to the OA&PS; was selected to Whitney, just outside Algonquin Provincial Park. Construction on this final portion reached Maynooth in 1907 but was never completed, and the line ultimately ended in the now abandoned town of Wallace, about 25 kilometres south of Whitney. The COR was taken over by Mackenzie and Mann in 1910, along with the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway which was connected to the COR north of Bancroft in July 1910. Both lines were then merged into their Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) in 1911. After CNoR was nationalized 1918, the lines became part of the Canadian National Railways (CN) system in 1923. CN operated the COR as the Maynooth Subdivision. Sections of the line north of Maynooth were lifted in 1965, and the entire rest of the line in 1985. All of the side branches had been abandoned much earlier, typically when the ore deposits dried up. Much of the route of the COR has been re-purposed as a multi-use recreational rail trail, which has a variety of names depending on its location, with the Hastings Heritage Trail being a prominent part. History =Prince Edward County Railway= Prince Edward County is a large peninsula on eastern Lake Ontario. It is roughly triangular in shape with its apex pointed to the east, and its connection to the mainland at the northwestern corner. It was first settled starting in 1784 by Loyalists after the American Revolutionary War, and depended largely on fishing and barley in its early days. The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) reached Belleville on its way to Toronto in 1855, opening new markets to the County. Local businessmen began considering a railway to collect produce from across the peninsula and connecting with the GTR at Trenton, on the north side of the land bridge with the mainland. The Prince Edward County Railway company (PECR) was formed in 1873 and began construction due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the peninsula, then turning northward for Trenton. Due to financial constraints, the line finally completed in 1879 and opened for service in October. In 1976 a large branch was wyed off west of Picton to serve large quarries north of town, near Elmbrook. =Expansion to Coe Hill= The opening of Central Ontario during the 19th Century was driven primarily by the discovery of a number of mineral deposits, notably gold and iron ore. As mines grew, principally in the area of Marmora and Madoc, a race formed between a series of railways companies who wanted to serve these markets. Among the many claimants were the Victoria Railway (VicR) that ran through Lindsay, a combined rail and water route by the Cobourg and Peterborough Railway (C&P;), and a potential extension of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway. None of these were well placed though, as they ran towards Toronto instead of east to the major markets and shipping routes. The only line that appeared to be well positioned was a proposed branch of the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) out of Belleville. Since the new mining areas were directly north of both Trenton and Belleville, the PERC was also in an ideal location as a starting point. William Coe of Madoc found iron ore deposits outside Brinklow and began looking for ways to commercialize the find. He contacted George William McMullen, a railway promoter in Chicago who had been born and raised in Picton. McMullen started looking for partners, and found Samuel Ritchey, a businessman from Ohio who was looking for new ventures. Rickey, McMullen and McMullen's brother J.B. bought the PECR in 1880 to serve as the basis for a rapid expansion. In 1881 the group purchased 70,000 acres of land for the mines, and transferred the deeds to the company. The group then petitioned the Ontario Legislature for the rights to rename the company and start construction northward, which was granted on 10 March 1882. The land deeds were transferred to the newly formed Coe Hill Mining Company, and the railway was renamed the Central Ontario Railway. The route was selected to take the line through several other mining areas, including Marmora, Deloro and Malone, before reaching Eldorado. The line reached Marmora in 1883 and the newly formed Coe Hill in 1884. The first load of ore left the station on 2 June 1884, but when the samples reached Cleveland for analysis the results showed that the ore was too low grade to be useful for mining, leaving the company on the verge of bankruptcy. =Further routes and branches= A Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) passenger train heads south out of Bancroft station in 1910. From that point the company turned to servicing other mines and sawmills in the area and constructed a number of branch lines. As early as May 1891, the Ontario, Belmont & Northern Railway (OB&NR;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the COR, received a charter to build a branch line to the iron mines in the Marmora area. Construction did not start for some time, and the 14.5 km line from Marmora Junction near Belmar to the Cordova mines was finally completed in July 1896. Later that year the branch was renamed to become the Marmora Railway & Mining Company. Starting in 1899 the mainline was extended further north, not from the original terminus in Coe Hill which became a branch line, but by via a wye off the line south of Brinklow and running almost due north from that point, roughly following the route of the modern Ontario Highway 62. The 19.55 mile extension to Bancroft opened on 2 November 1900. Another subsidiary line, the Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway, was chartered in 1904 (although apparently formed in the late 1800s) to branch off the COR at L'Amable, just south of Bancroft, and run eastward to connect to Bessemer and the Child's Mine. Later, plans were made to use this branch as the basis for an extension all the way to the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway, at that time the busiest railway in Canada,\\"Track and Tower\\" brochure, Friends of Algonquin Park meeting it at Barry's Bay. However, the extension plans were never taken up and the B&BB; remained a spur ending Child's Mine. A connection with the OA&PS;, by this time reorganized to become part of the Canadian Atlantic Railway (CAR), remained desirable. A new route running from the Bancroft terminus was selected, running almost due north to meet the CAR near Whitney, just outside today's Algonquin Provincial Park. Construction on this link reached Maynooth on 7 November 1907, Lake St. Peter in 1909, and Wallace in 1911\\"Central Ontario Railway\\" , Railway Bob \\\\- so- named for the line's surveyor and chief engineer. By this time the logging era had reached its peak and traffic was dwindling on the COR, and further expansion was abandoned, leaving the end of the line a turnaround-wye next to Joseph Lavalley's farm in Wallace. =Leasing, purchase and abandonment= By the time this photo was taken in 1971, the COR north of Maynooth had been abandoned and the section north of Bancroft was little used. Maynooth station is already in shabby condition. In 1910 the entire COR was leased by the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway, which was itself purchased by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) in 1911. The Canadian government took control of the CNoR in 1916, and folded its holdings into the forming Canadian National Railways (CNR) in 1918. Under CN ownership, various sections were renamed as subdivisions; the line from Picton to Trenton became the Picton Subdivision,\\"C.N.Rys. Picton Subdivision\\" the mainline to Maynooth became the Maynooth Subdivision,\\"C.N.Rys. Maynooth Subdivision\\" while the various spurs became the Coe Hill Subdivision,\\"C.N.Rys. Coe Hill Subdivision\\" the Marmora Subdivision,\\"C.N.Rys. Marmora Subdivision\\" and the Bessemer Subdivision.\\"C.N.Rys. Bessemer Subdivision\\" The line was kept active by a series of small lumber mills that opened in the Lake McKenzie area. McConnell's Mill near the current intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and Ontario Highway 127 was the first of these, and later taken over by the Rathbun Lumber Company. Judson Gunters opened a mill slightly to the north around 1918, which gives its name to maps to this day. The final mill in the area opened in 1943 when J.S.L. McRea moved his mill from Lake of Two Rivers in Algonquin to the area just north of Wallace. This mill operated until 1952. With the closing of the McRea mill and several other businesses in the area, traffic on the northern section of the line quickly dwindled. By 1955 all the business in Wallace had closed, and the COR ran a single train to the town every Wednesday to deliver mail. This section was abandoned in 1960, leaving the terminus at Lake St. Peter. On 22 April 1964 CNR applied to abandon the entire line from Wallace to Bird's Creek, just north of Bancroft where the COR met the Irondale (at today's \\"Y\\" Road). But only a smaller section, from Maynooth to Lake St. Peter was abandoned in 1965, along with most of the spurs. The remainder of the line was abandoned by CNR in 1984, and the rails lifted either that year or the next. Today only a 1.5 km long section of the line remains, used by CN Rail as a siding to service the grain terminal at Trenton junction. =Conversion to rail-trail= Looking south from the northernmost \\"navigable\\" point of the COR, at the ghost town of Gunters. Maynooth Station on the COR, about 2 km east of the town of Maynooth, Ontario. The station was the northernmost major station on the Central Ontario Railway. Most of the COR, including the original PECR route, has been converted to rail-trail use. After its abandonment the line has increasingly been turned to local authorities for maintenance. The route of the original PECR was purchased by Prince Edward County in 1997 and is now known as the Millennium Trail, running for 49 km out of Picton and ending just outside Trenton.Map of the Millennium Trail . The 17 km section between the 401 at Trenton and Glen Ross had been re-used for roadways and other uses, as well as being in a built-up area. The unused sections in this area only started conversion to trail use in the 2000s, and several of these sections opened in 2011. Just north of Trenton this is known as the Jack Lange Memorial Trail, and from there, from just south of to Glen Ross, it becomes the Lower Trent Trail. The largest section of the trail network is the long four-season Hastings Heritage Trail, stretching from Glen Ross all the way to Lake St. Peter Provincial Park outside Maynooth.Map of the Hastings Heritage Trail This is the official end of the line, where it hits the border between Hastings County and South Algonquin. The trail remains in good repair, signed and used, north of this border to its current ending point near McKenzie Lake, at the intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and McKenzie North Road, marked on many maps as the village of Gunters.\\"Gunters, Ontario\\", as it appears in Google Maps. The short remaining section from Gunters to Wallace is used for a variety of purposes, including section of McKenzie Lake Road, Hydro One lines providing local service, and in some areas simply abandoned and heavily overgrown. The ultimate terminus can be seen a few meters to the west of McKenzie Lake Road at the ghost town of Wallace. Route This map, from the COR's June 1910 passenger timetable, shows the route running all the way to Whitney. It actually ended near the \\"Y\\" in \\"RAILWAY\\", in Sabine County. The original Prince Edward County Railway ran almost due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the Prince Edward County peninsula. It turned northwest at Wellington and then due north at Hillier before turning northwest again at Consecon to loop around the western end of the Bay of Quinte and then northeast for the short remaining distance to Trenton. There were ten stations on the line, Picton, Bloomfield at 4.22 miles, Hallowell 7.59 miles, Wellington 10.97 miles, Niles' Corner 14.90 miles, Hillier 16.55 miles, Consecon 21.32 miles, Weller's Bay 25.64 miles, Canal 27.02 miles and Trenton 30.60 miles.\\"Prince Edward County Railway\\" This section of the line was abandoned in 1984 and the rails removed, but now the majority is used for a recreational trail. The original Picton Station is located on Main Street, and is occupied by C.F. Evans Lumber Company. From Trenton the line ran almost due north through Frankford, Glen Ross, Anson, Bonariaw, Marmora Station (just northeast of Marmora) and Deloror. Here it turned northeast toward Malone, and then east through Madoc to Eldorado. The line then turned north to run through Bannockburn, Millbridge Station and Gilmour, before turning west just south of Brinklow and running through Ormsby to its end just southwest of Coe Hill. The Bancroft extension wyed off near Brinklow at Ormsby Junction, running north through Brinklow and detouring to the east en route to serve Detlor before reaching Bancroft. The next extension took it north from Bancroft to Maynooth Station (east of Maynooth). The original plans would have had it run roughly northeast along the route of Ontario Highway 62 to Barry's Bay, but instead took it northward along the route of Ontario Highway 127 through Lake St. Peter Provincial Park before ultimately ending in the bush near McKenzie Lake. There were two main spur lines. One split just south of Marmora at Belmar Station to run northwest to Cordova Mines, and the other split at Bessemer Junction near Detlor running east-northeast to Childs Mine. The COR was joined by several other railways in the area. The Grand Junction Railway (GJR) ran between Peterborough and Belleville and met the COR in a wye junction just outside the town of Anson, near Stirling. A branch of the GJR, the Belleville and North Hastings Railway (B&NH;), later met the COR about 1 km west of Eldorado. The Bay of Quinte Railway was extended to meet the COR just north of Eldorado at Bannockburn, reaching this point in 1902.\\"Trail of Two Lakes, Belleville and North Hastings Line\\"\\"Belleville and North Hastings Railway\\" The final connection was to the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa which met the COR just north of Bancroft in 1910, meeting it at what it today known as \\"Y\\" Road, named for the wye intersection. Main stations on the line included Picton, Bloomfield, Wellington, Trenton, Frankford, Marmora, Coe Hill, Bancroft and Maynooth. Several stations have survived; the original Picton station was moved and became a private home, while the second station remains in use as a lumberyard. Hallowell was moved to Stanley Street in Bloomfield as a children's playhouse, Bloomfield moved to West Lake as a summer residence, Consecon is abandoned in place, Frankford moved to Stockdale as a restaurant, Marmora and Coe Hill both moved to a park to become information centres, Bancroft's station remains in place and is now a museum, Maynooth was abandoned in place (see image at top) and Lake St. Peter was moved to an unknown location.

With a four-story flagship store in the downtown business district of McKeesport, Pennsylvania, Cox's had seven retail stores in shopping malls throughout the Pittsburgh area. History Cox's was the successor to a small seamstress shop established in 1884 by Mary Ann Cox in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. By the 1950s, the operation had grown so much that Robert Cox, grandson of Mary Ann, purchased the White Opera house at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Walnut Street in the downtown business district of McKeesport and demolished it to build a flagship department store. The modern four-story department store, built in the International Style, opened in 1955. A large concrete medallion of William Shakespeare that had served as a centerpiece of the opera house was retained and displayed on the lower level of the department store. During the 1970s, there were seven additional locations in shopping malls throughout the Pittsburgh area. The flagship store was expanded. However, by the early 1980s, an economic recession in the Pittsburgh area had resulted in an unemployment rate of 22.8 percent. On November 2, 1982, the company filed for bankruptcy.

Disconnection syndrome is a general term for a collection of neurological symptoms caused -- via lesions to associational or commissural nerve fibres -- by damage to the white matter axons of communication pathways in the cerebrum (not to be confused with the cerebellum), independent of any lesions to the cortex. The behavioral effects of such disconnections are relatively predictable in adults. Disconnection syndromes usually reflect circumstances where regions A and B still have their functional specializations except in domains that depend on the interconnections between the two regions. Callosal syndrome, or split-brain, is an example of a disconnection syndrome from damage to the corpus callosum between the two hemispheres of the brain. Disconnection syndrome can also lead to aphasia, left-sided apraxia, and tactile aphasia, among other symptoms. Other types of disconnection syndrome include conduction aphasia (lesion of the association tract connecting Broca‚Äôs area and Wernicke‚Äôs), agnosia, apraxia, pure alexia, etc. Anatomy of cerebral connections Theodore Meynert, a neuroanatomist of the late 1800s, developed a detailed anatomy of white matter pathways. He classified the white matter fibers that connect the neocortex into three important categories ‚Äì projection fibers, commissural fibers and association fibers. Projection fibers are the ascending and descending pathways to and from the neocortex. Commissural fibers are responsible for connecting the two hemispheres while the association fibers connect cortical regions within a hemisphere. These fibers make up the interhemispheric connections in the cortex. Callosal disconnection syndrome is characterized by left ideomotor apraxia and left-hand agraphia and/or tactile anomia, and is relatively rare. Hemispheric disconnection Many studies have shown that disconnection syndromes such as aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, pure alexia and many others are not caused by direct damage to functional neocortical regions. They can also be present on only one side of the body which is why these are categorized as hemispheric disconnections. The cause for hemispheric disconnection is if the interhemispheric fibers, as mentioned earlier, are cut or reduced. An example is commissural disconnect in adults which usually results from surgical intervention, tumor, or interruption of the blood supply to the corpus callosum or the immediately adjacent structures. Callosal disconnection syndrome is characterized by left ideomotor apraxia and left-hand agraphia and/or tactile anomia, and is relatively rare. Other examples include commissurotomy, the surgical cutting of cerebral commissures to treat epilepsy and callosal agenesis which is when individuals are born without a corpus callosum. Those with callosal agenesis can still perform interhemispheric comparisons of visual and tactile information but with deficits in processing complex information when performing the respective tasks.  Sensorimotor disconnection  Hemispheric disconnection has impacted behaviors relating to the sensory and motor systems. The different systems affected are listed below: * Olfaction ‚Äì The olfactory system is not crossed across hemispheres like the other senses, which means that left input goes to the left hemisphere and right input goes to the right hemisphere. Fibers in the anterior commissure control the olfactory regions in each hemisphere. A patient who lacks an anterior commissure cannot name odors entering the right nostril or use the right hand to pick up the object corresponding to the odor because the left hemisphere, responsible for language and controlling the right hand, is disconnected from the sensory information. * Vision ‚Äì Information from one visual field travels to the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, with a commissurotomy patient, visual information presented in the left visual field travelling to the right hemisphere would be disconnected from verbal output since the left hemisphere is responsible for speech. * Somatosensory ‚Äì If the two hemispheres are disconnected, the somatosensory functions of the left and right parts of the body become independent. For example, when something is placed on the left hand of a blindfolded patient with the two hemispheres disconnected, the left hand can pick the correct object within a set of objects but the right hand cannot. * Audition ‚Äì Though most of the input from one ear would go through the same ear, the opposite ear also receives some input. Therefore, the disconnection effects seems to be reduced in audition compared to the other systems. However, studies have shown that when the hemispheres are disconnected, the individual does not hear anything from the left and only hears from the right. * Movement ‚Äì Apraxia and agraphia may occur where responding to any verbal instructions by movement or writing in the left hand is inhibited because the left hand cannot receive these instructions from the right hemisphere, History The concept of disconnection syndrome emerged in the late nineteenth century when scientists became aware that certain neurological disorders result from communication problems among brain areas. In 1874, Carl Wernicke introduced this concept in his dissertation when he suggested that conduction aphasia could result from the disconnection of the sensory speech zone from the motor speech area by a single lesion in the left hemisphere to the arcuate fasciculus. As the father of the disconnection theory, Wernicke believed that instead of being localized in specific regions of the brain, higher functions resulted from associative connections between the motor and sensory memory areas. Lissauer, a pupil of Wernicke, described a case of visual agnosia as a disconnection between the visual and language areas. Dejerine in 1892 described specific symptoms resulting from a lesion to the corpus callosum that caused alexia without agraphia. The patient had a lesion in the left occipital lobe, blocking sight in the right visual field (hemianopia), and in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Dejerine interpreted this case as a disconnection of the speech area in the left hemisphere from the right visual cortex. In 1965, Norman Geschwind, an American neurologist, wrote ‚ÄòDisconnexion syndromes in animals and man‚Äô where he described a disconnectionist framework that revolutionized neurosciences and clinical neurology. Studies of the monkey brain led to his theory that disconnection syndromes were higher function deficits. Building on Wernicke and previously mentioned psychologists‚Äô idea that disconnection syndromes involved white matter lesion to association tracts connecting two regions of the brain, Geschwind was more detailed in explaining some disconnection syndromes as lesions of the association cortex itself, specifically in the parietal lobe. He described the callosal syndrome, an example of a disconnection syndrome, which is a lesion in the corpus callosum that leads to tactile anomia in just the patient‚Äôs left hand. Though Geschwind made significant advances in describing disconnection syndromes, he was not completely accurate. He didn‚Äôt think the association cortex had any specialized role of its own besides acting as a relay station between the primary sensory and motor areas. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, Mesulam and Damasio incorporated specific functional roles for the association cortex. With Mesulam and Damasio‚Äôs contributions, Geschwind‚Äôs model has evolved over the past 50 years to include connections between brain regions as well as specializations of association cortices. More recently, neurologists have been using imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to visualize association pathways in the human brain to advance the future of this disconnection theme.

It also includes the taxon hypochlora (emerald-bellied woodnymph) from south- western Ecuador and adjacent Peru here. All are sometimes considered distinct by other taxonomists. It also formerly included the Mexican woodnymph as subspecies. Past studies have shown territorial differences between males and females. Female crowned woodnymph territories are of higher quality compared to the males. This is because females are more aggressive in defending their territory. Female territories also received more intruders contrary to males and produced higher mean nectar volume. These factors point to the fact that female crowned woodnymphs have higher quality feeding territories than males (Bertin, Wilzbach 1979).

History William James Quarles was a rural school teacher from Tennessee who settled in the Long Beach community of south Mississippi in 1884. The Quarles House was constructed in 1892 as a five-bay, wood-frame, two-story residence with clapboard outer walls. The structure was two rooms deep and sat on a foundation of brick piers with one interior chimney. The house was the residence of W.J. Quarles until 1924. Battered by a century of hurricanes, the Quarles House was severely damaged by Hurricane Camille in 1969. Through the latter half of the 20th century, the house was vacant and sealed. In 2003, the Quarles House was listed as one of the ten most endangered historic places in Mississippi by the Mississippi Heritage Trust.Mississippi Heritage Trust‚ÄîEndangered Historic Places Retrieved 2013-08-03. Because the house was located on property that was highly prized for commercial development in Long Beach, the owner sought permission from the keeper of the National Register of Historic Places to move the structure approximately 400 feet (122 meters) northeast, near the Quarles Family Cemetery. The move was approved in 2012. Following the move, restoration of the structure was initiated to achieve historical accuracy. =Cottage= W.J. Quarles Cottage, January 2013 When the Quarles house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, there was a one-story, two-room, clapboard cottage located just east of the main house. In 1884, the cottage was originally part of a one-story house where the Quarles family resided while their new 2-story home was under construction. In the 1930s, the 1-story house was torn down, leaving the cottage. References External links * Find A Grave (Quarles Cemetery) Retrieved 2013-08-03.

He set both indoor and outdoor world records in his speciality and was national co-champion both indoors and outdoors in his peak year of 1934. High jump career =Early career= As a student at Fresno High School, Marty jumped 6 ft in (1.93 m) at the 1929 West Coast Relays, setting a United States high school record; only five athletes of any age jumped higher that year. Marty duplicated the mark in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum while winning the 1929 CIF California State Meet.http://lynbrooksports.prepcaltrack.com/ATHLETICS/TRACK/stateres.htm#1929 In 1930 Marty was national junior champion and represented the United States in a dual meet against the British Empire; he cleared a personal best 6 ft in (1.96 m) in that meet and won ahead of national senior champion Anton Burg. In June 1931 Marty cleared a personal best 6 ft in (1.99 m) at the inaugural Kern County Relays in Taft; at the national (AAU) senior championships three weeks later he jumped 6 ft in (1.94 m) and placed second to Burg, who defended his title. Marty was selected to tour South Africa that fall as one of nine American track and field athletes. In Queenstown he cleared 6 ft in (2.00 m) for a new South African all-comers record; it was the second-best jump in the world that summer, behind George Spitz at 6 ft in (2.01 m). Marty remained in good form in 1932; he cleared 6 ft in (1.99 m) at the Far Western Conference meet in Sacramento, leading Fresno State College to a conference title. Marty also won at the Olympic Trials semi-finals in Long Beach, jumping 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m). He was considered one of the favorites to make the 1932 Olympic team but narrowly missed out; at the final Olympic Trials in Palo Alto he cleared 6 ft (1.97 m) and placed shared fourth as the top three qualified. =Peak and decline= In 1933 and 1934 Marty was the world's leading high jumper, setting several new world records. He set his first world record at the West Coast Relays in Fresno on May 13, 1933, clearing 6 ft in (2.04 m) and breaking Harold Osborn's outdoor world record from 1924. Marty's main rivals at his peak were Spitz and Cornelius Johnson; Spitz held the indoor world record of 6 ft in (2.04 m), while Johnson was a consistent competitor with excellent head-to-head records against both Spitz and Marty. Johnson won the 1933 AAU title with a jump of 6 ft 7 in (2.00 m), ahead of Marty, who shared second place with Spitz. Marty competed indoors for the first time in the winter of 1934; until then, he'd been purely an outdoor jumper. At the New York Athletic Club's indoor games on February 17 he jumped 6 ft in (2.05 m) to set a new indoor world record and defeat previous record holder Spitz, who was second. In the AAU indoor meet later that winter Marty cleared 6 ft in (2.01 m) and shared the championship with Spitz. Marty's 1934 outdoor shape was also record-breaking; on April 7 he jumped 6 ft in (2.07 m) in a dual meet between Fresno State and Sacramento Junior College, but the jump couldn't be recognized as a new record as no AAU officials were present to ratify it. Three weeks later he cleared 6 ft in (2.06 m) in a dual meet against Stanford, his second official outdoor world mark. Marty was then briefly sidelined by a bruised knee but returned in time for the NCAA championships in Los Angeles, where he tied for first with Spitz at 6 ft in (2.00 m). Marty also tied for first, with Johnson, at the 1934 AAU outdoor meet; the two cleared 6 ft in (2.04 m) for a new meeting record. A hernia kept Marty out of action for most of 1935, and he was expected to retire; however, after a successful operation he attempted a comeback in 1936. He almost managed to regain his 1934 form, clearing 6 ft in (2.05 m) in May 1936 and even exceeding his world record in training. He was favored to qualify for the United States' 1936 Olympic team, but at the Olympic Trials he only cleared 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m), again placing shared fourth and missing out. The top two - Johnson and Dave Albritton - both sailed over 6 ft in (2.07 m), breaking Marty's world record. The American team of Johnson, Albritton and Delos Thurber went on to sweep the Olympic medals. =Technique= Marty used the high jump technique known as the Western roll, pioneered in the early 1910s by George Horine and Edward Beeson. At the time, there were two main jumping styles; Marty (and other west coast jumpers, like Johnson) used the roll, whereas east coast jumpers (such as Spitz) mostly used the Eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors jump.

Villanueva, a Honduran immigrant, was shot and killed by a Montreal Police officer in the parking lot of Montreal-Nord's Henri-Bourassa Arena, near Rolland Boulevard and Pascal Street, just after 7:00 p.m. Two other men were injured in the shooting. No criminal charges were filed against the officers involved. Villanueva's death led to protests in Montreal. Background Fredy Alberto Villanueva was born on April 6, 1990 in Honduras, and was 18 at the time of his death. A Montreal resident, Villanueva arrived in Quebec with his older brother, Dany, and his three sisters (Patricia, Wendy, and Lilian) on December 5, 1998. They joined their parents (Gilberto Villanueva Madrid and Lilian), who had been in Canada for refugee status after leaving the Honduras. His father has survived two attempted murders related to a land conflict. Fredy had no criminal record. According to Pierre-Yves Boisvert, SPVM (Service de police de la ville de Montr√©al) counsel to the inquest, he was not identified as a street gang member. Dany had been arrested on several occasions since 2005, mostly for petty theft. In April 2006, he was sentenced to serve a sentence of eleven months in prison after he had pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery. He was then 19, and it was his first conviction. According to the complainant's version, Dany stole his neck chain without using violence at Henri-Bourassa Park on September 14, 2005. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of being found in a car in the presence of a firearm while he was in the company of four individuals, wearing red scarves. Incident Fredy, Dany, and three other men were playing a game of dice in a parking lot when two patrolling constables, Jean-Loup Lapointe and St√©phanie Pilotte, approached them as their game of dice was contrary to a municipal bylaw. The reason for the police action was the fact that gambling with money is prohibited in Montreal North parks under Article 12 e) of the Regulations parks, pools and public buildings. The constables identified some of those present as local gang members, including a known member of the Bloods street gang, named Jeffrey Sagor M√©t√©llus, as well as another man, recognized by Lapointe as another street gang member. Lapointe stopped his car and called the men over. All of them complied with his order exception for Dany, who instead began to walk away. At that point, Lapointe exited his cruiser and ordered the man to identify himself. Dany refused, and Lapointe then tried to take him into custody and worried that Dany might be armed. Lapointe said that some of the men shouted out in protest and began to form a line behind the officers. He said he felt \\"surrounded and confined against his car.\\" Lapointe said that Villanueva fought back, forcing the officer to push him to the ground. Pilotte was subsequently kicked several times all, and Lapointe was punched in the face. Lapointe then noticed the other four men moving in on him. Two of them appeared to be reaching toward his neck and his belt, where his holstered gun was located. One of the men grabbed Lapointe's neck and he realized that his partner \\"was not in a position to come to (his) defence... and (he) was not physically capable of overcoming these men.\\" The men were ordered to back up but refused, and Lapointe said that he \\"saw no other alternative than to fire immediately.\\" Lapointe said his concern about the threat of being disarmed by the men was so great that he shot his gun \\"three or four times\\" before he was able to remove it from its holster. One gunshot struck and killed Fredy. Jeffrey Sagor M√©t√©llus and another man, Denis M√©as, were also struck and injured. Only approximately 60 seconds had passed from the officers exitng their vehicle to the shots being fired. Fredy was seriously injured. Two bullets hit his internal organs, perforating the stomach and causing lacerations to the inferior vena cava, liver left lobe, and pancreas. He was pronounced dead in the operating room at H√¥pital Sacr√©- Coeur at 21:45. At 10:00 PM, the SPVM issued a press release in which it said: \\"Around 7:10 p.m., police patrolling the Montreal North sector intervened in Henri-Bourassa Park at the intersection of Pascal and Rolland streets. During the intervention, while trying to arrest a suspect at the scene, police were encircled by several individuals. At one point, a group movement was initiated with a number of men rushing the male and female police officers, assaulting them. The male officer then fired towards the suspects, hitting three of them; one was wounded fatally.\\" Constable Pilotte had graduated from the province‚Äôs police academy 18 months before the shooting. Coroner's inquest On December 1, 2008, the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DCPP), Louis Dionne, held a press conference in the company of the Minister of Justice and Public Security, Jacques Dupuis, and Mayor G√©rald Tremblay. Dionne announced that no charges were brought against the officers Lapointe and Pilotte. Crown Prosecutor Fran√ßois Bri√®re particularly cited several excerpts of the report of Lapointe to explain how the DCPP had reached that conclusion. For his part, Minister Dupuis announced the holding of a public inquiry, chaired by Judge of the Court of Qu√©bec Robert Sansfa√ßon coroner appointed for the occasion. Minister Dupuis said that the inquest was designed to \\"reassure the population about the merits of the decision that was taken by the Crown prosecutor.\\" The decision not to charge against the police was greeted with disappointment by the Villanueva family. \\"We wanted to have confidence in the judicial process, but now we do not know what to think,\\" said Patricia Villanueva. \\"I am shocked, shocked, but not surprised. There is a justice for police officers and for citizens. It was the trial of Villanueva, not the police,\\" denounced Will Prosper, a Montreal-Nord Republik spokesman. For his part, the president of the FPPM (Montreal Police Brotherhood), Yves Francoeur, responded positively to the decision of the DCPP. \\"The police will keep a high level of confidence in the justice system,\\" he said. Francoeur also welcomed the decision to hold an inquest. The movement \\"Solidarity Montreal North\\" (a group represented by a city-linked PR firm) also reacted positively, distributing to the media a statement supporting the holding of the inquest, even before the end press conference of DCPP. Aftermath During a peaceful protest against the officers' actions, riot police were dispatched after bonfires had been set in the streets of Montreal North on August 10 in retaliation to the event. The protest would escalate to looting and car torching. Eventually, one paramedic and two police officers were wounded and one female police officer shot. Seventy-one people were arrested. The death caused the Quebec government to reform how police shootings are investigated in the province. The Canada Border Services Agency attempted to deport Villanueva. A judge ended a seven-year civil suit involving the families of Villanueva and the other two injured. Quebec Superior Court Judge William Fraiberg ruled that the families' lawyers had failed too many times to meet deadlines, which caused unjustified delays. The event was one of the inspirations behind Sophie Deraspe's 2019 film Antigone, which adapted the ancient Greek play by Sophocles into a modern story of police brutality against immigrants.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and him, started working in the oil and gas industry in 1981, when they founded Arkoma Production Company, which they later sold to Arkla Inc.  Football Executive  In 1989 when Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys franchise, McCoy became a minority owner with a 5% stake in the team. In 1990, he was named team Vice-President. In 1991 Jones and head coach Jimmy Johnson wanted to come up with a system to help them evaluate NFL draft trades quickly. McCoy invented a trade-value draft chart that assigned values to each draft pick and a numeric total for each deal. With the success of the Cowboys in the Nineties, the trade-value draft chart gained prominence in the NFL and now every team employs a version of it. In 1996, he left the Cowboys to return to the oil and gas industry.

This large class of methods in numerical analysis encompass multistage Runge‚ÄìKutta methods that use intermediate collocation points, as well as linear multistep methods that save a finite time history of the solution. John C. Butcher originally coined this term for these methods, and has written a series of review papers a book chapter and a textbook on the topic. His collaborator, Zdzislaw Jackiewicz also has an extensive textbook on the topic. The original class of methods were originally proposed by Butcher (1965), Gear (1965) and Gragg and Stetter (1964).  Some definitions  Numerical methods for first-order ordinary differential equations approximate solutions to initial value problems of the form : y' = f(t,y), \\\\quad y(t_0) = y_0. The result is approximations for the value of y(t) at discrete times t_i : : y_i \\\\approx y(t_i) \\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad t_i = t_0 + i h, where h is the time step (sometimes referred to as \\\\Delta t ). A description of the method We follow Butcher (2006), pps 189‚Äì190 for our description, although we note that this method can be found elsewhere. General linear methods make use of two integers, r , the number of time points in history and s , the number of collocation points. In the case of r=1, these methods reduce to classical Runge‚ÄìKutta methods, and in the case of s=1, these methods reduce to linear multistep methods. Stage values Y_i and stage derivatives, F_i, i=1,2,\\\\dots s are computed from approximations, y_i^{[n-1]}, i=1, \\\\dots, r , at time step n: : y^{[n-1]} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} y_1^{[n-1]} \\\\ y_2^{[n-1]} \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ y_r^{[n-1]} \\\\ \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right], \\\\quad y^{[n]} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} y_1^{[n]} \\\\ y_2^{[n]} \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ y_r^{[n]} \\\\ \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right], \\\\quad Y = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ Y_s \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right], \\\\quad F = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} F_1 \\\\ F_2 \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ F_s \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]. The stage values are defined by two matrices, A = [a_{ij} ] and U = [ u_{ij} ]: : Y_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^s a_{ij} h F_j + \\\\sum_{j=1}^r u_{ij} y_j^{[n-1]}, \\\\qquad i=1,2, \\\\dots, s, and the update to time t^n is defined by two matrices, B = [b_{ij}] and V = [v_{ij}] : : y_i^{[n]} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^s b_{ij} h F_j + \\\\sum_{j=1}^r v_{ij} y_j^{[n-1]}, \\\\qquad i=1, 2, \\\\dots, r. Given the four matrices, A, U, B and V, one can compactly write the analogue of a Butcher tableau as, : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} Y \\\\ y^{[n]} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} A \\\\otimes I & U \\\\otimes I \\\\ B \\\\otimes I & V \\\\otimes I \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} F \\\\ y^{[n-1]} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right], where \\\\otimes stands for the tensor product, and F = f( Y ) . Examples We present an example described in (Butcher, 1996). This method consists of a single 'predicted' step, and 'corrected' step, that uses extra information about the time history, as well as a single intermediate stage value. An intermediate stage value is defined as something that looks like it came from a linear multistep method: : y^*_{n-1/2} = y_{n-2} + h \\\\left( \\\\frac9 8 f( y_{n-1} ) + \\\\frac3 8 f( y_{n-2} ) \\\\right). An initial 'predictor' y^*_n uses the stage value y^*_{n-1/2} together with two pieces of time history: : y^*_n = \\\\frac{28}{5} y_{n-1} - \\\\frac{23}{5} y_{n-2} + h \\\\left( \\\\frac{32}{15} f( y^*_{n-1/2} ) - 4 f( y_{n-1} ) - \\\\frac{26}{15} f( y_{n-2} ) \\\\right), and the final update is given by: : y_n = \\\\frac{32}{31} y_{n-1} - \\\\frac{1}{31} y_{n-2} + h \\\\left( \\\\frac{5}{31} f( y^*_n ) + \\\\frac{64}{93} f( y^*_{n-1/2} ) + \\\\frac{4}{31} f( y_{n-1} ) - \\\\frac{1}{93} f( y_{n-2} ) \\\\right). The concise table representation for this method is given by: : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccccccc} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \\\\frac{9}{8} & \\\\frac{3}{8} \\\\ \\\\frac{32}{15} & 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{28}{5} & -\\\\frac{23}{5} & -4 & -\\\\frac{26}{15} \\\\ \\\\frac{64}{93} & \\\\frac{5}{31} & 0 & \\\\frac{32}{31} & -\\\\frac{1}{31} & \\\\frac{4}{31} & -\\\\frac{1}{93} \\\\ \\\\hline \\\\frac{64}{93} & \\\\frac{5}{31} & 0 & \\\\frac{32}{31} & -\\\\frac{1}{31} & \\\\frac{4}{31} & -\\\\frac{1}{93} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right].

It was founded in 1825 and closed in 2009. History United Reformed Church The United Reformed Church was founded in 1825 when the people of Chiswell, the oldest settlement on the island, banded together to convert a barn and stable into a place of worship. By 1827, Chiswell had to accommodate the growing congregation and as a result the first chapel was built during 1827‚Äì28. The church flourished under the guidance of the Rev JH Crump. The first pastor appointed to Portland was the Rev Frederick William Meadows. The next pastor, Rev C Cannon, died in office in 1854, whilst in those years the building had become too small for the growing congregation. As the building was not large enough for the local congregation, a new church opened on the same site. Rev James Cheney, described in the church records as \\"a remarkable, resourceful and skilful man\\", was the guiding light for the building that stands in Chiswell today, which was opened by 21 October 1858. The church was first known as the Independent Chapel, as well as the Union Chapel, then the Congregational Church. It became known as the United Reformed Church in 1972. However, by the 21st century, the numbers in the congregation had dramatically dropped. Seven local people decided to team together in an attempt to the keep the church open by dealing with administration and fund raising. Despite various attempts by the congregation to save it, the church's final service was held on 27 September 2009, conducted by the Rev Bob Damer. Although the building's future was uncertain, renovations have begun.

History In 1921, Samuel Gati established Sljeme with the first shop at 12 Meduliƒáeva Street in Zagreb. Gati was an Austro-Hungarian trunk maker master with over two decades of experience. In Zagreb, he began production of top quality high-fashion trunks, car trunks, bags, gloves, and accessories under name Sljeme. Company soon became famous for its excellent craftsmanship. They started exporting throughout Europe and took part in numerous exhibitions like the 1937 Paris Exhibition, eventually a store was opened at 26 Ilica Street, Zagreb's busiest street. Expansion continued and a store opened in Belgrade at 2 Poenkarova Street, in the heart of the city. It soon grabbed the attention of the royal family with Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark becoming a regular customer. In 1931 Sljeme became a Royal Warrant Holder of the Yugoslav court. At the beginning of World War II, a new store was opened in Zagreb main square, 1, Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square. After World War II communists came to power in Croatia. Private companies were nationalized, including Sljeme. Because the company manufactured \\"bourgeois\\" luxury goods and supplied to the royal family purveyor it was considered to be \\"politically incorrect.\\" Name was forcefully changed into Partizansko Sljeme to celebrate Yugoslav Partisans. By the end of the 1960, Sljeme was merged with another leather goods manufacturer in Zagreb and was discontinued as brand. Sljeme was reborn in 2012. File:Sljeme_company_advertise.jpgSljeme ad Samuel Gati Samuel Gati, the founder of Sljeme was an Austro-Hungarian Jew born in 1887 in Szigetv√°r. After his apprenticeship to become a malletier in Budapest, he moved to P√©cs in 1915 and founded a trunk-making company. He got married with Elisabeth Seƒçan from Nagykanizsa and their daughter Magdalena Gati was born in 1917. After World War I, and maybe because of the White Terror (Hungary), the family moved in 1920 to Zagreb. The following year Samuel Gati continued his trunk-making business with his newly founded company, Sljeme. When World War II started and after the Independent State of Croatia was formed, Jews were persecuted by anti-Semitic legislation (The Holocaust in Croatia). Samuel Gati was not exception. He was arrested and detained first at Crikvenica and then Kraljevica, later he was moved to the Rab concentration camp, all under Fascist Italy rule. Later, after the surrender of Italy, Gati was transferred to Birkenau concentration camp under Nazi Germany control where he was murdered in the camp's gas chamber in 1944.

A former Unitarian Universalist lay leader, he has frequently addressed the intersection of sexuality and spirituality. Biography Ravenstone first became involved in the BDSM community addressing the issue of \\"ravishment\\" or rape fantasies. He wrote a number of articles and two books.Ravenstone, Desmond. Ravishment: The Dark Side of Erotic Fantasy (2005) Ravenstone, Desmond. Taken: A Story of Ravishment (2005) dealing with both the psychology and practical enactment of ravishment role-play, and helped to form the online Ravishment Network (RavNet) as a forum for education and advocacy. Ravenstone has also led workshops on ravishment, erotic role-playing and other subjects to a number of BDSM groups across the country. He served as education coordinator for the New England Dungeon Society for two years, and authored an advice column for the online zine '‚ÄòThe Dominant's View'‚Äô. Ravenstone was a member of Arlington Street Church, an historic Unitarian Universalist congregation, where he served on the worship committee as well as serving as Co-Moderator, and other leadership roles; in the past, he has represented the congregation as a delegate to the Mass Bay District and the UUA General Assembly. He also wrote a blog for several years, '‚Äò‚ÄòRavenstone's Reflections'‚Äô‚Äô, offering his thoughts on sexuality, spirituality, politics and other related topics. This gave him a prominent place to speak on behalf of kinksters, polyamorists and other \\"alt-sexers\\" within the UU denomination. Ravenstone started the organization Leather & Grace in 2011, for UUs identified with kink and BDSM. In October 2014, he published a lengthy post on his blog, defending the view that kink should be regarded as a sexual orientation, which was also carried as a guest blog on the website of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom. In October 2015, Ravenstone posted on his blog that he was leaving organized Unitarian Universalism, expressing frustration at how resistant the leadership of the Unitarian Universalist Association's handled many issues, including those around sexuality. In January 2017, he officially ended Ravenstone's Reflections, and announced the start of a new blog devoted specifically to sex workers' rights, The Harlot's Bulldog. He currently administrates the website for Clients of Sex Workers Allied for Change (CoSWAC) Ravenstone is politically unaffiliated, and describes himself as a \\"libertarian progressive\\" and \\"deep pragmatist\\". In 2008, he ran a write-in campaign for president on a sexual freedom platform; his running-mate was Theresa \\"Darklady\\" Reed, a fellow writer and sexual- freedom activist from Oregon.

It was originally designed to be a loop, starting near Toronto and running northeast to Peterborough, then southeast to meet the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) on the banks of Lake Ontario. By the time it had been built other lines had run into Toronto, so the GJR instead ran from Belleville to Peterborough, and then to Omemee where it met the Midland Railway of Canada. Just north of its starting point, the wholly owned subsidiary Belleville and North Hastings Railway branched off for the mining areas around Madoc, meeting the Central Ontario Railway just outside Eldorado. The GJR was one of five struggling short lines merged into the Midland Railway in April 1882. Midland, in turn, was leased by the GTR in 1884 and acquired outright in 1893.http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/GTRConstituents.htm The line was used for passengers into the 1960s and freight until the 1980s, but was abandoned starting in 1987.

Background  Paul Loeb was born on August 26, 1935 in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Early career Loeb's first practice was called Paul Loeb's Animal Analysis (1958‚Äì1962). It was an in-home problem-solving program. In 1962, he went further and created The Loeb Animal Institute Inc., which was an international animal behavior clinic. The institute was in existence until 1984. For several years, Loeb was funded by a private grant. He lived on a 400-acre working farm in Amenia, New York, and then bought a house in Piermont on the Hudson. Loeb studied the behavior of wildlife and farm animals and how they either avoided contact with human beings, or how they used contact with human beings to their advantage. This eventually led to the formulation of his Magic Touch theory of animal training which is described in. Recognition The Wall Street Journal compared Paul Loeb's work with animals to the work of B. F. Skinner: \\"Loeb illustrates practical approaches to physical needs as a means to psychological (read \\"behavioral\\") cures he is to the canine world what B.F. Skinner, the noted Harvard psychologist who devoted himself to the techniques of shaping behavior, was to the study of man.\\" In 1975, the Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"His credits include more than 600 TV commercials, ranging from pet foods to men's underwear. He also cured 8,000 family pets of such bad habits as biting, drooling, wetting, chewing, wandering, and intimidation.\\" Writing and media appearances Loeb's first book Paul Loeb's Complete Book Of Dog Training (Prentice Hall), was selected as the best book of 1974 by the Dog Writer's Association of America as mentioned in. Loeb's You Can Train Your Cat (Simon & Schuster 1979) was translated into many languages. This book was followed by Cathletics (Prentice Hall). Early on, Loeb realized the need for a holistic approach, including diet and nutrition, when working with animals. Because of his working knowledge of diet and nutrition, Gaines, a division of General Foods, hired Loeb as a consultant in the early development of their Cycle dog food. In addition to Nutrition And Your Dog (Pocket Books), which was originally titled Good Dog (G.P.Putnam's Sons), his work regarding diet, nutrition and proper exercise has been written up in the Wall Street Journal, Reading Eagle, Esquire Magazine, Glamour, Newsweek, Cosmopolitan, Family Circle, The Christian Science Monitor, The Charleston News and Courier, The New York Times, New York Post, New York Daily News, Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, and the Philadelphia Inquirer. Loeb also wrote a column for Parents magazine during the early eighties, dealing with topics concerning pet behaviour and having pets in a household with children. Loeb appeared on his first national talk show, the Mike Douglas show, in 1973, Loeb was also a guest on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show in 1975, ABC's Good Morning America in 1979, Dateline NBC in 1998, and WNEW Midday in 1977.

Plot summary After a job in Monte Carlo, an English jewel theft ring returns to Paris. Suave cat burglar Oliver Lane (Herbert Marshall), fashioned the \\"Solitaire Man\\" in the newspapers after seven years of eluding Scotland Yard, proposes marriage to his lovely accomplice Helen (Elizabeth Allan) and informs her he has bought a country house in Devonshire to which they can all retire. However unstable Robert Bascom (Ralph Forbes), drug-addicted after his experiences in the Great War, also loves Helen and wants to continue on his own. He presents Oliver with the \\"Brewster necklace\\" that he burgled from the British Embassy while he dined there with his former colonel. Realizing Bascom would be the only suspect and his arrest would lead back to all of them, Oliver returns the Brewster necklace to the safe just as an inspector from Scotland Yard tracking the Solitaire Man arrives at the embassy. Before Oliver can make his escape, a second man sneaks in and steals the necklace but is interrupted by the inspector, who recognizes the thief but is shot and killed by him. Oliver struggles in the dark with the killer during his getaway and grabs the necklace and part of the killer's watch chain. With Bascom, Helen and the elderly Mrs. Vail (May Robson), the fourth member of the ring who poses as an impoverished British aristocrat in order to sell the stolen jewels to gullible American tourists, Oliver hastily decides to fly to England. They are joined on the airplane by a garrulous, wealthy American socialite, Mrs. Hopkins (Mary Boland), and a last moment arrival in the form of an unknown Englishman (Lionel Atwill). As the airplane is taking off, Mrs. Hopkins demands that the pilot stop to pick up her late-arriving husband Elmer. Although Oliver's group is willing to oblige her, the other man insists that they continue, and the pilots refuse because of a heavy fog. The stranger identifies himself as Inspector Wallace of Scotland Yard and attempts to arrest Oliver for being the Solitaire Man. When he demands at gunpoint to search Oliver's luggage for the Brewster necklace, the group disarms Wallace, revealing their complicity, and Oliver tells Bascom to lock Wallace in his own handcuffs. The passengers become aware that another plane is following them, which Wallace claims is a French Army plane he arranged as an escort in case they tried to land in France. Convinced that Wallace is what he claims to be, Oliver offers to give himself up and turn over the necklace in exchange for the freedom of the others. When Wallace is distracted by the offer, Oliver turns off the plane's cabin lights to throw off the pursuing French plane in the fog. Noticing that Wallace is not really handcuffed, Oliver asks him about how he knew Oliver would be on the flight and accuses Bascom of tipping off the police. Bascom admits that he intended to betray Oliver in his anger over Helen but denies carrying out the scheme. Oliver, however, realizes that Bascom and Wallace, who now claims to be a fast-thinking burglar himself, were in league to turn in Oliver to collect a ¬£10,000 reward for the Solitaire Man. He searches Wallace and finds the letter Bascom wrote telling the police about Oliver's travel plans. Overwhelmed by guilt, Bascom jumps from the plane to his death. From the Scotland yard-issue pistol Wallace was carrying, Oliver deduces that not only is Wallace a crook, but he covers up his own crimes by being a police informant. Helen notices that Wallace's pocket watch has a broken chain, and Oliver accuses Wallace of being the murderer of the dead inspector. Oliver again turns out the cabin lights and appears to have also jumped from the plane with the necklace, but when the lights are turned back on, he emerges from the cockpit. He agrees to give Wallace the Brewster necklace and confess falsely to the murder, returning the gun unloaded as part of the charade, if Wallace tells Scotland Yard that the others had no part in any of the crimes. The plane lands in Croydon and is boarded unexpectedly by police constables to detain the passengers for Scotland Yard. The \\"French Army escort\\" lands immediately behind them and turns out to be only a plane hired by Mrs. Hopkins' husband Elmer to bring him to England after he missed the flight. When Wallace identifies himself as \\"Inspector Wallace\\" to the officers and tries to leave to \\"file his report,\\" Oliver insists that it is he who is the inspector and Wallace the Solitaire Man to prevent it. The passengers are interrogated by Inspector Harris, who knows Wallace (acidly reminding the informant that he is not a detective) and is the former partner of the murdered inspector. Oliver tricks Wallace into exposing himself as the jewel thief and the murderer. Wallace tries to escape out a window using the gun but is shot by Harris, who does not realize the gun is empty. Oliver then reveals that when he went to the cockpit, he used the plane's radio to summon Scotland Yard to detain the arrivals. Harris accepts Mrs. Hopkins' corroboration of Oliver's explanation that he is only a legitimate jewelry dealer who offered to appraise the necklace when Wallace had tried to sell it to her on the plane. Oliver and Helen head off to start new lives as a quiet, happily married Devonshire couple.

Taistelupetankki is played with the same equipment as p√©tanque, but it can be played in more diverse terrain. In the game, a player (or a team) has two metal balls. On their turn, the player tries to get at least one of their balls closest to the jack. There are two ways to get one's ball closest to the jack: try to throw one's ball close enough in the first place, or try to knock an opponent's ball or the jack off with one's own ball. A popular tactic is to use one ball to knock an opponent's ball off and the other to get closest to the jack. If a player doesn't get even one of their balls closest to the jack on their turn, they drop out of the game. The game continues until only one player remains. Taistelupetankki players describe the game as \\"continuing where p√©tanque left off\\". Equipment * Two iron balls, discernible from others. Diameter 60 to 80 mm, weight 600 to 800 g. * Jack, usually made of wood. Diameter 20 to 40 mm. Course of the game One of the players, usually the winner of the last game or the youngest player, throws the jack to a place they deem worthy. After this, a combination shot happens, where every player throws both of their balls, one at a time, onto the playing field, every player at the same time. It is recommended to watch where the balls land. The first proper throwing round is started by the player who has either of their balls the furthest away from the jack. Both balls are thrown, one at a time, towards the jack so that at least one of them ends up closest to the jack. If the player fails to do this on their turn, he/she drops out of the game. The next throwing turn is for the player who has either of their balls the furthest away from the jack. This continues until all players have thrown their balls, and this order of throwing continues for the following rounds. =The throw= The player picks their ball up from the ground from between their feet and throws it where he/she stands. Contrary to normal p√©tanque, it is allowed to jump during the throw, provided that the player lands on the same spot where they started from. The ball must travel in the air at least 10 cm. =Duration= The game can last from five minutes to an hour, depending on the circumstances (skill, terrain conditions, weather, number of successful knocks, the players' mental state...) =Judges= The players act as judges themselves, in order to reach a consensus should controversial situations arise. Competitions The Finnish Taistelupetankki Association holds competitions open to everyone. There are competitions all year round, mostly based on the capital region.

Along with the Dacosta Cup contest for rural high school boys, the Manning Cup is one of the most watched football sporting events in Jamaica, rivaling the country's highest level football league (National Premier League) in popularity, . The competition remains a key showcase for talented players and serves as a launchpad into domestic and overseas club careers as well as call up opportunities to the Jamaica national football team. History =Pre Manning Cup years= Prior to the Manning Cup competition, most secondary schools across the island with active football teams competed in the ‚ÄúJamaica Inter-Scholastic Association Football Shield Competition‚Äù for the ‚ÄúOlivier Shield‚Äù. This competition began in 1909 and was played on a knock-out basis. Another major tournament featuring schoolboy teams during that period was the Martinez Shield. =Formation of the competition= By 1913, many of the secondary schools that were located in and around Kingston, felt that the competition format limited the number of possible games and preferred to change to a round-robin points based tournament which would guarantee each team at least two matches against each opponent. This format, however, would have significant logistical drawbacks for the single rural school Potsdam, located in St. Elizabeth, which would now have to travel extensively more so than the other participants. With these pros and cons in mind, on Dec 2, 1913, a meeting of representatives of the following four secondary schools took place at Sabina Park: *St. George's College (Rev Father O‚ÄôHare & I.J. Crutchley) *Jamaica College (R.H. Smith & J.M. Hall) *Wolmers Boys (J Roberts & F.C. Mercier) *Calabar High (Mr Brown) Also in attendance were: *JFA (Howard Turner) *W.P.C. Adam It was decided during this meeting that a separate competition would be created for the urban schools The competition‚Äôs format was set as round-robin home-away ties, with the team accumulating the maximum number of points at the conclusion of all matches deemed the champions and recipient of the Manning Cup trophy. The new tournament would be endorsed by the then Governor of the island, Sir William Henry Manning K.C.M.G. and referred to as The Manning Cup Football Competition. The Manning Cup champion would then contest for the Olivier Shield by playing in a two leg tie with Potsdam College. =1914 - Inaugural year= At the beginning of the 1914 school year, the following five schools were registered for the Manning Cup competition: *Jamaica College *Wolmer's Schools *Calabar High School *St. George's College *New College The number of entrants were soon reduced however, as New College withdrew early on, leaving the remaining four schools to compete over the course of 12 matches, with the title of champion going to the team accumulating the highest number of points.

First published anonymously in 1948, it has become one of the best-known Dutch novels and a staple of literary education for many Dutch school children. The novel, a Bildungsroman, is set in the Dutch East Indies, and tells the story of an anonymous narrator growing up on a plantation in the Dutch colony West Java. His childhood friend is a boy of the same age, but of native descent. As the narrator grows up he finds himself becoming estranged from his friend, as a result of the political and racial circumstances of colonial life. After having served in the army during World War II, he returns to his native land, only to be told that this is not where he belongs, and that he must leave. Background and publication Oeroeg was published in 1948, at a time of great anxiety in the Netherlands over the future of their colony in the East; after the end of World War II it became clear quickly that Indonesia would be independent one way or another, and that the Netherlands would have to reconsider their status as a colonizing nation and, thus, the attendant claims of intellectual and cultural superiority. Author Rob Nieuwenhuys writes that post-revolution Indies literature was often called a \\"literature of longing and homesickness\\", with childhood memories a common theme. The immediate impetus for the publication was the 1948 Boekenweek, the annual event held to promote Dutch literature; part of those festivities is the publication of a book given for free to the book-buying public. Hella Haasse, who had grown up in the Dutch East Indies and at this time was working in the cabaret and theater business in Amsterdam, submitted the manuscript for Oeroeg under the pseudonym Soeka toelis (\\"Like to write\\"); her name wasn't announced to the general public until after the novel was published, selected by an anonymous panel of 19 judges. With Oeroeg, her first publication in prose (she had already published a number of poems), her reputation was established at once. Plot The book starts in the preterite, \\"Oeroeg was my friend\\", and in reverse chronological order tells how the narrator came to that conclusion. The narrator grows up the child of a white Dutch family on Java, with Oeroeg, a native young man; as high-school students they live together in a boarding house. One crucial event is the death of Oeroeg's father, who died while saving the narrator from drowning. During World War II the narrator joins the Dutch army, and when he returns to Java finds that the world has changed: Indonesian nationalists have declared independence, and no longer accept the colonial overlord. In addition, the narrator's father is murdered, and he suspects his old friend, who has joined the Indonesian nationalist movement, of avenging his own father's death. At the end of the novel, the narrator has lost his friend, his identity, and his home country. Genre and themes As a Bildungsroman the novel partakes of the Dutch tradition of similar novels, such as Terug tot Ina Damman (\\"Return to Ina Damman\\") by Simon Vestdijk (1934) and Character by F. Bordewijk (1936). At the same time, as Henk Maier points out, the novel can also be read against the background of Indonesian novels such as Abdoel Moeis's Salah Asoehan (\\"Wrong upbringing\\", 1928), and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana's Lajar Terkembang (\\"With full sails\\", 1936), both novels \\"in which the relationship between the main protagonists, growing up in the colonial world, dissolves in conflict and death as often as it ends in a happy marriage\\". As a first-person narrative told retrospectively, Oeroeg, in which memory and experience are played off against each other, can be said to lack in the objective realism so often typical of the Bildungsroman; moreover, for its Dutch readership it was clearly a novel set in a remote and exotic location, albeit one with which the Dutch felt an important kinship, and is thus a colonial novel as well. In her autobiography Persoonsbewijs (Identity Card; 1967), Haasse described Oeroeg as \\"the dark side of herself living in the shadows she does not know\\".Quoted in Nieuwenhuys finds this patently obvious, based on Haasse's background. Born and raised in a Dutch complex in the Indies, Haasse (\\"a white girl brought up in Dutch surroundings\\") had little contact with the native residents of the archipelago. Agreeing with author Tjalie Robinson regarding incorrect assumptions and generalties present in the novel, he writes that Haasse should have \\"really gotten to know Urug before even starting to write\\". Reception Initially, the novel was not wholly uncontroversial; according to Maier, its publication was a painful experience for a number of Dutch readers, especially those who were wedded to the idea of the Netherlands as a colonial power and those who had lost friends, family, and possessions during World War II and the period of unrest and \\"rebellion\\" which followed, one which prompted military intervention from the Dutch army and would eventually lead to the independence of Indonesia. Criticism also came from the other side, the side of the colonized subject: Robinson criticized the novel and its author for pretending that the white, privileged colonizer could ever come to understand the humiliation and the desire for freedom on the part of the repressed other. The novel has proven to be a mainstay of Dutch literature: generations of Dutch schoolchildren have read it, and at the time of Haasse's death, in 2011, it had been reprinted more than fifty times. The novel was the centerpiece of a 2009 reading campaign organized by the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek, a Dutch organization of book sellers and publishers. Haasse went on to write one further book focusing with the Indonesian archipelago, Krassen op een rots (Scratches on a Rock; 1969), which detailed a trip to post-independence Indonesia‚Äîparticularly Java‚Äîand the archipelago also featured in her autobiographical works. Film In 1993 the novel was adapted into a film with the same name, in a collaboration between the Netherlands, Indonesia, and Belgium. Directed by Hans Hylkema and with a screenplay by Jean Van de Velde, the film starred Rik Launspach, Jeroen Krabbe, Martin Schwab, Ivon Pelasula, and Jose Rizal Manua. This adaptation was also released internationally under the title Going Home, with an English dub. The 1993 film version of the same name differs in some important details from the original; these changes, postcolonial scholars such as Pamela Pattynama argue, indicate important changes that occurred between the 1940s and the 1990s in the Dutch attitudes toward their former colony and themselves. For example, the novel's interaction with natives are seen from the colonialists' perspective, and speaks in generally negative terms about Indo-Europeans. The movie, on the contrary, portrays the colonizer as tortured by guilt, and contains imagery of burned-down native villages reminiscent of the imagery from the My Lai Massacre. By association, according to Pattynama, the film brought \\"long- silenced Dutch war crimes to the fore\\". On the other hand, Ario Sasongko from the Jakarta Arts Institute argues that Pattynama's analysis of the film can be doubted through the editing and cinematography, which \\"portrayed the burning villages merely as Johan's nightmare\\" and the characterization of Depoh, an Indonesian character, as having \\"servant attitudes\\". Sasongko concluded that the film is a form of \\"defense\\", based upon the orientalist viewpoint and Western superiority over the East, and tries to neutralize negative opinion regarding the military aggression into a postcolonial framework that is contextual for the era of the film's release.

She works for leading editorial publications globally on issues relating to women, population and war. She has lived in Damascus, Beirut, Kiev and New York City and is now based in London. As a photographic storyteller, Taylor-Lind's work has focused on long-form narrative reportage for monthly magazines. She is a National Geographic Magazine contributor, and other clients include Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, TIME, The New York Times, The British Journal of Photography, 6 Mois Bloomberg Business Week The Telegraph Human Rights Watch and Wired Magazine. Life and work Taylor-Lind was born in Swindon in 1981. and completed degrees in Documentary Photography from the University of Wales Newport (BA) and the London College of Communication (MA). In 2004 whilst studying for her degree she spent a month in Iraqi Kurdistan photographing female Peshmerga fighters, the Peshmerga Force for Women. She has since written about her experiences as a photojournalist for The New York Times, TIME LightBox, Nieman Reports and National Geographic. Taylor-Lind has been engaged with education, teaching at leading universities around the world. She is a TED fellow and gave a talk at the 2014 TED conference in Rio De Janeiro. Taylor-Lind is also Harvard Nieman Fellow 2016, where she spent a year researching war, and how we tell stories about modern conflict. She is also a Logan Fellow 2017 at The Carey Institute for Global Good. Her first book MAIDAN ‚Äì Portraits from the Black Square, which documents the 2014 Ukrainian uprising in Kiev, was published by GOST books the same year, reviewed in The British Journal of Photography and The Guardian. The Guardian's Sean O'Hagan wrote of the book > \\"Maidan ‚Äì Portraits from the Black Square is a powerfully concentrated > statement, both about the nature and cost of violent protest. It eschews the > familiar route of visceral, on-the-ground reportage for something more > restrained and considered. You look into the faces of these ordinary people > and you cannot help but wonder what it took to bring them to this point and > what has happened to them since.\\" She published her second monograph, The Devil‚Äôs Horsemen, in September 2018.https://thedevilshorsemen.com/product/devils-book/ A wide variety of organizations have recognized and supported her projects through awards such as the POYi, Sony World Photography Awards, Royal Photographic Society Bursaries and the FNAC Grant at Visa Pour L‚ÄôImage.

It is achieved by using known haplotypes in a population, for instance from the HapMap or the 1000 Genomes Project in humans, thereby allowing to test for association between a trait of interest (e.g. a disease) and experimentally untyped genetic variants, but whose genotypes have been statistically inferred (\\"imputed\\"). Genotype imputation is usually performed on SNP, the most common kind of genetic variation. Genotype imputation hence helps tremendously in narrowing-down the location of probably causal variants in genome-wide association studies, because it increases the SNP density (the genome size remains constant, but the number of genetic variants increases) thus reduces the distance between two adjacent SNPs. Context In genetic epidemiology and quantitative genetics, researchers aim at identifying genomic locations where variation between individuals is associated with variation in traits of interest between individuals. Such studies hence require access to the genetic make-up of a set of individuals. Sequencing the whole genome of each individual in the study is often too costly, only a subset of the genome can therefore be measured. This often means, first, only considering single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neglecting copy number variants, and second, only measuring SNPs known to be variable enough in the population so that they are likely to be also variable in the set of individuals under consideration. The most informative subset of SNPs is chosen based on the distribution of common genetic variation along the genome, for instance as produced by the HapMap or the 1000 Genomes Project in humans. These SNPs are then used to build a micro-array, thereby allowing each individual in the study to be genotyped at all these SNPs simultaneously. Motivation Genotyping arrays used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are based on tagging SNPs and therefore do not directly genotype all variation in the genome. Imputation of the genotypes to a reference panel that has been genotyped for a greater number of variants, boosts the coverage of genomic variation beyond the original genotypes. As a consequence, one can assess the effect of more SNPs than those on the original micro-array. Importantly, imputation has facilitated meta-analysis of datasets that have been genotyped on different arrays, by increasing the overlap of variants available for analysis between arrays. Tools There are several software packages available to impute genotypes from a genotyping array to reference panels, such as 1000 Genomes Project haplotypes. These tools include MaCH Minimac, IMPUTE2 and Beagle. Each tool provides specific pros and cons, in terms of speed and accuracy. Additional phasing tools such as SHAPEIT2 allow prephasing of input haplotypes, for improved imputation accuracy and computational performance. In early imputation usage, haplotypes from HapMap populations were used as a reference panel, however, this has been succeeded by the availability of haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project as reference panels, with more samples, across more diverse populations, and with greater genetic marker density. As of mid-2014, whole-genome sequence data is publicly available from the 1000 Genomes Project website for 2535 individuals from 26 different populations around the world.

He is best known as an opponent of Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, and for having written a broad examination of various theological theories, including extensive discussion of pandeism. Born into a Jewish family in Kovno (then Imperial RussiaThe Symbolic Universe: Geometry and Physics 1890-1930, page 104, by Jeremy Gray. 1999.), Weinstein translated James Clerk Maxwell's Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism into German in 1883,The Historical Development of Quantum Theory, page 33, by Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg, 2000. and taught courses on electrodynamics at the University of Berlin. While teaching at the Institute of Physics in the University of Berlin, Weinstein associated with Max Planck, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Hermann von Helmholtz, Ernst Pringsheim, Sr., Wilhelm Wien, Carl A. Paalzow of the Technische Hochschule in Berlin Charlottenburg, August Kundt, Werner von Siemens, theologian Adolph von Siemens, historian Theodor Mommsen, and Germanic philologist Wilhelm Scherer.Review of theology & philosophy - Volume 7, page 576, by Allan Menzies. 1912.  Criticism of Einstein's theory of relativity  Weinstein was among the first physicists to reject and criticize Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, contending that \\"general relativity had removed gravity from its earlier isolated position and made it into a \\"world power\\" controlling all laws of nature,\\" and warning that \\"physics and mathematics would have to be revised.\\"Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity, page 102, by Jeffrey Crelinsten. 2006. It was Weinstein's writings, and their impact driving public sentiment against Einstein's theories, which led astronomer Wilhelm Foerster to convince Einstein to write a more accessible explanation of those ideas. But, one commentator contends that Weinstein's summaries of relativistic physics were \\"tedious exercises in algebra.\\"Peter Galison, Science and Society: The History of Modern Physical Science in the Twentieth Century, p. 288, 2001.  Philosophical writings  In addition to his work in physics, Weinstein wrote several philosophical works. Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis (\\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\\") (1910) examined the origins and development of a great many philosophical areas, including the broadest and most far-reaching examination of the theological theory of pandeism written up to that point. A critique reviewing Weinstein's work in this field deemed the term pandeism to be an 'unsightly' combination of Greek and Latin,Otto Kirn, reviewer, Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis (\\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\\") in Emil Sch√ºrer, Adolf von Harnack, editors, Theologische Literaturzeitung (\\"Theological Literature Journal\\"), Volume 35, column 827 (1910): \\"Dem Verfasser hat anscheinend die Einteilung: religi√∂se, rationale und naturwissenschaftlich fundierte Weltanschauungen vorgeschwebt; er hat sie dann aber seinem Material gegen√ºber schwer durchf√ºhrbar gefunden und durch die mitgeteilte ersetzt, die das Prinzip der Einteilung nur noch dunkel durchschimmern l√§√üt. Damit h√§ngt wohl auch das vom Verfasser gebildete unsch√∂ne griechisch-lateinische Mischwort des ,Pandeismus' zusammen. Nach S. 228 versteht er darunter im Unterschied von dem mehr metaphysisch gearteten Pantheismus einen ,gesteigerten und vereinheitlichten Animismus', also eine popul√§re Art religi√∂ser Weltdeutung. Prhagt man lieh dies ein, so erstaunt man √ºber die weite Ausdehnung, die dem Begriff in der Folge gegeben wird. Nach S. 284 ist Scotus Erigena ein ganzer, nach S. 300 Anselm von Canterbury ein ,halber Pandeist'; aber auch bei Nikolaus Cusanus und Giordano Bruno, ja selbst bei Mendelssohn und Lessing wird eine Art von Pandeismus gefunden (S. 306. 321. 346.).\\" Translation: \\"The author apparently intended to divide up religious, rational and scientifically based philosophies, but found his material overwhelming, resulting in an effort that can shine through the principle of classification only darkly. This probably is also the source of the unsightly Greek-Latin compound word, 'Pandeism.' At page 228, he understands the difference from the more metaphysical kind of pantheism, an enhanced unified animism that is a popular religious worldview. In remembering this borrowing, we were struck by the vast expanse given the term. According to page 284, Scotus Erigena is one entirely, at p. 300 Anselm of Canterbury is 'half Pandeist'; but also Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno, and even in Mendelssohn and Lessing a kind of Pandeism is found (p. 306 321 346.)\\". though Weinstein did not coin the term, nor did he claim to have. The reviewer further criticises Weinstein's broad assertions that such historical philosophers as Scotus Erigena, Anselm of Canterbury, Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, Mendelssohn, and Lessing all were pandeists or leaned towards pandeism. Philosophically, Weinstein was attracted to what he called a psychical or spiritual monism, which he believed to be comparable to the pantheism of Spinoza, and wherein the essence of all phenomena could be found entirely in the mind.Entropic Creation: Religious Contexts of Thermodynamics and Cosmology, page 131-132, by Helge Kragh. 2008. . Though he could see no way around the eventual heat death of the Universe, Weinstein suggested that there existed a fundamental 'psychical energy,' of which a maximum-entropy world would ultimately consist. Weinstein wrote: From this premise Weinstein reasoned that the world must have both a beginning and an end, and that a supernatural force must have initiated it, and so could bring about its end as well: Though he rejected theistic formulations regarding such things, Weinstein found the origin of the Universe to be so problematic that he wrote: \\"As far as I can see, only Spinozist pantheism, among all philosophies, can lead to a satisfactory solution.\\"  Works  * Handbuch der physikalischen Maassbestimmungen.

Niccola Spinelli (born Turin, Italy 1865 ‚Äì died Rome 18 October 1909) was an Italian composer of operas. Born in Turin, the son of a jurist, he studied composition at the Naples Conservatory under Paolo Serrao.Philip J. Bone, The Guitar and Mandolin, biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott and Co., 1914, pages 287-288. His opera Labilia won the second-place prize in an 1890 opera competition organized by Milanese music publisher Edoardo Sonzogno, and premiered in Rome on 9 May 1890; the first prize went to Pietro Mascagni for Cavalleria rusticana. His most well-known work is A Basso Porto (At the Lower Harbor), which premiered in Cologne on 18 April 1894 to great popular acclaim. A Basso Porto A Basso Porto was first performed in England by the Carl Rosa Co., in March, 1899, at Brighton, and by the Queen's Hall Orchestra on October 11, 1900, under Mr. H. Wood. The opera focuses on the slums of Naples, where Spinelli used mandolins and guitars in several places in his orchestral score. The mandolinists were Florimond and Cesare Costers. The mandolins were an important part of the opera, accompanying the tenor song of the second act, and the finale of the third act. More importantly, Spinelli composed an Intermezzo for mandolins and orchestra, as a prelude to the third and last act, a departure from the customary instrumentation. Philip J. Bone said that the audience reaction to the Intermezzo \\"was extraordinary.\\" Bone, a music historian, added more detail about the use of mandolins by Spinelli, saying, \\"Spinelli makes good use of the mandolins, writing an elaborate cadenza in double stopping and rapid chromatic passages, which evidences a practical acquaintance with the instrument.\\" He also said that the parts of the Intermezzo that were written for mandolins were the sections most striking feature of the Intermezzo, along with the melody written for cello.

As NF Jaguar and then Peveril, between 1981 and 1998 she was operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company from Douglas, Isle of Man. History Built in 1971 as MV Holmia by Kristiansands Mekaniske Verksted, Norway for Silja Line, Finland, she was operated as ADS Meteor and then Pendaby by P&O; Ferries between Heysham and Belfast from February 1973. From May 1981, she was on bareboat charter to the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company operating between Douglas and Heysham in rivalry to the Manx Line, . The company purchased her in December 1982 and renamed her Peveril. Competition from the rival Manx Line led to the financial collapse of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and its subsequent amalgamation with Sealink-Manx Line. From 1 April 1985, the main UK port was to move from Liverpool to Heysham, severing connections with Liverpool after 155 years. Twelve shore staff staged a sit-in at Liverpool trapping the Peveril. She was only released on 8 April after redundancy payments totalling almost a quarter of a million pounds were agreed, adding to the costs of withdrawing from Liverpool. She continued on the route until 10 July 1998. In September 2000, she was sold to Marine Express Inc., Panama. As Caribbean Express, she left Birkenhead on 27 September. A few days, later she suffered an engine failure in the Bay of Biscay and required repair in Santander, Spain. In 2002, she was detained in Sotchi, Russia. Latterly under Cambodian flag, she was sold to Indian breakers and was scrapped in April 2009.

Concept 1984 Ducati 900 MHR, or Mike Hailwood Replica The motorcycle's concept by the Ducati designer Pierre Terblanche was a homage to the racing motorcycle Mike Hailwood rode to win the 1978 Isle of Man TT. The MH in MH900e is Hailwood's initials, and the e suffix is for evoluzione in Italian, evolution in English. In September 1998, the sketch was presented to the general public at the Intermot Show in Munich. Ducati decided to post a questionnaire on their website to test the interest of the MH900e fans. Federico Minoli and Massimo Bordi (General Manager of Ducati) produced a limited run of two thousand hand-built bikes. The first one thousand bikes would be produced in 2000 and the second thousand would be produced in 2001. Ducati made the decision to sell the new bike directly to the consumer exclusively via the Internet. The Ducati website opened for orders on January 1, 2000 at 00:01am GMT at a price of Euro15,000. The first 1,000 units were sold out in 31 minutes. The remaining bikes were sold over the next few weeks. Individuals made purchases from 20 different countries.

The contaminated whey products had been sold to third parties who use it to produce infant formula and sports drinks. Approximately 1,000 tonnes of consumer product was affected by the recall across seven countries, but no cases of sickened consumers were reported. China, which imports most of its powdered milk from New Zealand, instituted a temporary ban on the import of the ingredient from New Zealand. The scandal resulted in the resignation of Fonterra's head of its milk business division, Gary Romano. The bacteria were ultimately found not to be a botulism-causing strain. Background Based in New Zealand, Fonterra Cooperative Group is the world's fourth largest producer of dairy products, with a turnover of nearly NZ$ 20 billion (US$15.7 billion). The company was formed in 2001 following the merger of the country's two largest dairy cooperatives, and controls 95% of New Zealand's dairy market. New Zealand produces 15 million tonnes of dairy products annually, of which 5% is consumed domestically and 95% is exported to other countries. Dairy exports contribute NZ$11 billion directly to the New Zealand economy, or around 7% of the country's gross domestic profit. Because of New Zealand's excellent safety history, consumers are willing to pay a premium for its dairy products. Chinese manufacturers in particular are major buyers of Fonterra products as many citizens have concerns about the safety of domestic dairy products in the wake of the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, in which melamine sickened thousands of people. Botulism is a rare disease caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. A small number of the bacteria can cause severe poisoning leading to respiratory and muscular problems in adults. In infants, the toxin also affects the intestinal system. Recall On 3 August 2013, the Ministry for Primary Industries announced a recall of products sold by Fonterra. The contaminated products originated with three batches of whey protein concentrate weighing 38 metric tons (42 tons) produced in May 2012. A problem was first noticed by Fonterra in March 2013 when testing suggested the possible presence of Clostridium, a sometimes-dangerous class of bacteria which is often harmless. On 31 July 2013, tests revealed signs of Clostridium botulinum, leading to the recall. The contamination was blamed on unsterilised pipes used to move the whey during production. The whey had been sold to third party manufacturers who used it to produce infant formula, protein drinks, sports drinks, and other beverages; it had been mixed with other ingredients to produce an estimated 1,000 tons of consumer products by the time of the recall. No fresh dairy products were affected by the contaminated pipes. Manufacturers in Australia, China, Malaysia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Vietnam were affected by the recall, but the specific companies affected were not identified by the Ministry of Primary Industries. A Chinese consumer watchdog group said four domestic manufacturers ‚Äì Dumex Baby Food Company, two subsidiaries of beverage manufacturer Wahaha Group, and Shanghai Sugar, Tobacco and Alcohol ‚Äì had potentially imported contaminated products. Fonterra said that Coca-Cola's Chinese subsidiary was also affected. Coca-Cola said 4,775 out of of contaminated whey had been quarantined before being used. The remainder was used in a single batch of Minute Maid Pulpy Milk, which was recalled to reassure consumers even though it posed no health risk since the drink was heat treated to kill bacteria. Internationally, eight companies were affected - three food companies, two beverage companies, and three animal-feed producers. Danone Dumex Malaysia said tests on its products did not indicate any contamination, but announced a precautionary recall of four batches of infant formula. One affected product, Karicare formula made by Nutricia, was sold directly to consumers by Fonterra in New Zealand. On 9 August, it was revealed that Fonterra had donated a bag of the affected whey concentrate to Palmerston North Girls' High School, in the eponymous New Zealand city, for use in a science project back in February 2013. Around 25 students drank drinks made with the concentrate in April, but no ill effects were reported. Fonterra CEO Theo Spierings promised swift action to ensure that potentially dangerous products were not used by consumers. Since most of the consumer products affected are not manufactured by Fonterra, individual manufacturers are responsible for co-ordinating the recall efforts in their areas. Spierings travelled to China to deal with the fallout from the botulism scare. The Government reaction involved five ministers, with the Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce, known as the \\"Minister of Everything\\" or \\"Mr Fixit\\", in charge (he is also responsible for investigating the Novopay debacle). A Government inquiry is expected to be announced on Monday 12 August. Reaction =China= China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine ordered importers to recall any potentially infected products and demanded \\"that New Zealand take immediate measures to prevent problem products harming the health of Chinese consumers.\\" On 4 August, China temporarily blocked the import of all milk powder products from New Zealand. New Zealand's trade minister, Tim Groser, agreed with the decision calling it \\"absolutely appropriate\\". China imports US$1.9 billion of milk powder a year, 90 percent of which originates in New Zealand. Economists said an extended ban could cause a shortage of infant formula and other dairy products in China. =Thailand = Thailand ordered a recall of all Fonterra products imported since May. Reports by the RIA Novosti news agency indicated that Russia, which was not part of the official recall, also halted the import and sale of Fonterra products. Fonterra called the reports \\"unconfirmed\\". The company said that all affected batches of Nutricia are believed to have been secured before reaching consumers' hands. Groser said the government had serious questions about how the contamination occurred and why it went undetected for so long. =Sri Lanka= Health ministry of Sri Lanka issued an island-wide recall of all suspected milk stocks which were imported from New Zealand including Anchor. The Health Services Director General of Sri Lanka announced contaminated milk products ban under Food Act Number 26 of 1980 using his powers in consultation with the Food Advisory Committee. Also, on 8 August, the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka issued an Interim Order compelling the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to prevent Fonterra Brands Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., from publishing any advertisements. No cases of consumers being sickened have been reported. A statement by New Zealand prime minister John Key expressed doubt about Sri Lanka's testing methods (for DCD). =France= French food company Danone, which owns the Nutricia brand, was said to be seeking upwards of ‚Ç¨300 million in damages following the scare, despite Fonterra only setting aside $NZ14 million.Fonterra in talks with Nutricia owners . 3 News NZ. 2 October 2013. Aftermath Further testing showed that the bacteria found were Clostridium sporogenes, which do not produce botulism toxins. There was no actual health risk, and the crisis was a false alarm. The Ministry for Primary Industries brought four charges against Fonterra under the Animal Products Act concerning its risk-management programme and delayed notification of problems. Fonterra pleaded guilty to all charges and was fined NZ$300,000 in April 2014. A government investigation into the crisis and three other inquiries are continuing.

Life  Self-portrait of Ebba Tesdorpf (c. 1885) overlooking the town canal behind Stubbenhuk, a small side street in Hamburg Office of JC Jauch & Sons, Stadtdeich 9 (c. 1880) - one of the few watercolors by Ebba Tesdorpf Tesdorpf came from a Hanseatic family. She was the daughter of businessman Hans Peter Friedrich Tesdorpf and Antoinette Karoline Mohrmann (formerly Abendroth). Her ancestors include her great- grandfather Peter Hinrich Tesdorpf (1751-1832) and his great-grandfather, Peter Hinrich Tesdorpf (1648-1723), both mayors of L√ºbeck. She developed her talent for drawing in Hamburg. For a short time in 1898 she trained under Hermann Gross at the Academy in D√ºsseldorf. Her teachers were Mohrhagen Bernhard and Johann Theobald Riefesell who primarily taught drawing to women of the Hamburg high society. At the suggestion of Justus Brinckmann and Alfred Lichtwark, Tesdorpf drew a documentation of the old Hamburg cityscape during the demolition phase in the 1880s and 1890s. Recording Hamburg became a passion for Ebba Tesdorpf. In her paintings she captured everything from the mundane scenes of Hamburg, its streets, the old parts of the town and the new, the city harbor and the canals that ran through it. With the death of her parents Tesdorpf became financially independent. Around 1894 Tesdorpf grew tired of life in Hamburg and moved to D√ºsseldorf, where she lived from then on. She donated her drawings as well as her purchased collection of valuable Hamburgensien (works of art pertaining to Hamburg) to the Hamburg Museum of Arts and Crafts. These pieces were later moved to the Museum of Hamburg History and provide a unique documentary of the appearance of the city of Hamburg in the second half of the 19th century. Tesdorpf considered it her \\"mission\\" to capture the \\"old Hamburg\\" in images - often structures destined for demolition in the years of urban renewal. Her life's work included over 600 drawings, along with a few watercolors which she painted at the turn of the century. In D√ºsseldorf she mainly painted oil paintings. Tesdorpf died during a stay at a spa in Ahrweiler. The old orphanage in Hamburg.

The shoal is named after the ship HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen, which sank after striking the previously uncharted rock in November 1940. Nansenflua is the only obstruction in Rekvedbukta. The name Nansenflua was introduced in charts published by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1955, and is included as a recognized name in Anders K. Orvin's 1960 paper The place-names of Jan Mayen. It follows a convention based on two then in force Orders in Council, dated 28 April 1933 and 31 May 1957, of using the Nynorsk grammatical form. The suffix \\"-a\\" in the feminine definite form was chosen, as no local dialect existed on Jan Mayen. The last part of the name, \\"flu(a)\\", means \\"rock awash\\", or \\"sunken rock\\". The geographical location is given by Orvin as , with an exactitude of 1'. The rock, located two meters under the surface, has a small top area and vertical sides of about twenty meters. It is located about one nautical mile from Egg√∏ykalven and 1.7 nautical miles west-southwest of the peninsula Egg√∏ya. In anything but completely calm weather conditions, Nansenflua is visible by waves being broken against it. The rock is part of the remains of a crater. Shipwreck of HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen Under the command of the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy, the offshore patrol vessel HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen visited Jan Mayen in September 1940, in order to destroy and evacuate the weather station northeast of Egg√∏ya. The ship returned in November of the same year to disrupt German plans to re-establish a weather station on the island. Entering the bay of Rekvedbukta on 8 November 1940 in calm weather, the ship collided with the hitherto unknown shoal, rapidly heeling 45¬∞. The whole crew of 66 entered the lifeboats. The boats reached the shore during darkness, and by the next morning the ship had sunk. Four days later the shipwrecked crew was rescued by the naval trawler HNoMS Honningsv√•g and brought to Iceland. The wreck of Fridtjof Nansen, which had a length of and a displacement of , is probably still located near the rock.

Chumakov (; born on October 1, 1950) is a Russian philosopher, theoretician of science, scientific community organizer, and specialist in the fields of philosophy and the theory of globalistics.  Biography  Alexander N. Chumakov was born in 1950 to a fisherman's family of Severnoe village, Caspian District, Astrakhan region, USSR. In 1972, he graduated from an industrial, technical college in the city of Khadyzhensk in Krasnodar Krai. Between 1972 and 1975, he worked as a bore-hole drilling master in the nuclear testing areas in Semipalatinsk and Novaya Zemlya. In 1975, he was accepted into the preparatory division of the Department of Philosophy of Moscow State University (MSU), from which he graduated cum laude in 1981. He also completed his postgraduate studies at MSU, receiving his Candidate of Sciences in 1984 and his Doctor of Sciences in 1991. Chumakov's doctoral dissertation was on the topic of \\"Social and Philosophical Aspects of Global Problems.\\" Since 1990, Chumakov has been the leading research fellow and head of the group \\"Global Studies\\" at the Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences. He became a full professor in 1993, and since 2008, has worked as a professor of the Department of Global Processes at MSU. He currently teaches several specialized courses at the university, including a course entitled \\"Globalistics\\" (–ì–ª–æ–±–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞, \\"global studies\\"). Since 2009, Chumakov has also worked as the chair of the Department of Philosophy at the Finance University under the Government of the Russian Federation.  Scientific achievements  There are four main schools philosophical thought in post-Soviet Russia, namely, Marxism, postmodernism, liberal Orthodoxy, and globalism. Alexander Chumakov is the leading Russian spokesman for globalism, which he writes \\"represents a secular stream of thought that aims to formulate a worldview transcending the division between Russia and the West by providing a new philosophical basis for their integration and ultimate unity.\\" A book review of his book, Philosophy of Globalization, writes that Chumakov \\"devoted his career in philosophy to the study of globalization and authored more than 550 scientific works and seven scholarly books that have been published in Russian, English, German, French, Chinese, Polish and Czech.\\" In his writings, Chumakov \\"formulated the fundamental principles, which constitute the philosophical foundation of globalistics as a special field of philosophical knowledge.\\" His analysis of globalization reveals that it \\"represents an objective historical process and does not depend on the positive (or negative) intentions of separate countries or nations.\\" It centers on the conceptual triad of culture, civilization, and globalization, which in Chumakov's works \\"are analyzed as fundamental characteristics of various cultural civilizational systems, characteristics that are closely connected with each other.\\" Chumakov argues that real and productive dialogue among different nations is possible because the universal character of civilization serves as the unifying factor for humanity, \\"while cultural diversity is the basis of differentiation of various countries and nations.\\"  Scientific organizing activity  Chumakov has devoted a great deal of time to administrative and organizational activities in the fields of philosophy, culture, and education. Since 1991 he has served as the first vice-president of the Russian Philosophical Society. He has also been a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association of Professors of Philosophy since 2012, as well as an acting member of the Presidium of Russian Ecological Academy since 2013. In 2003, Chumakov organized a philosophical action that had great cultural significance in Russia and was widely publicized by the Russian media. During the 1920s the Soviet government expelled hundreds of prominent Russian intellectuals from the newly created Soviet Union, including many philosophers. Most of them were transported by boat to Germany and Turkey. In Russian historiography, this event is known as the \\"philosophers' ships.\\" Eighty years following the event, Chumakov organized a symbolic return of the \\"philosophers' ships\\" back to the motherland, which became open to freedom of expression and independent investigation of truth. To this end, he rented a ship, the Maria Ermolova, which sailed on route from Novorossiysk to Istanbul and back to Novorossiysk with hundreds of Russian philosophers on board to take part in the XXI World Congress of Philosophy in Istanbul in 2003. Chumakov participated in the last six World Congresses of Philosophy, in Brighton in 1988, in Moscow in 1993, in Boston in 1998, in Istanbul in 2003, in Seoul in 2008, and in Athens in 2013. Throughout the events, he delivered scholarly presentations, including plenary addresses, and also served as chair of various roundtables, panels, and sections. Chumakov was also one of the initiators and main organizers of the Russian philosophical congresses that have taken place every three years, starting in 1997 and up to the latest in 2015, which took place in Ufa.  Honors and awards  Chumakov was named laureate in the 2003 Russian publishers' \\"Book of the Year\\" contest in the nomination category of \\"Encyclopedist\\". He was awarded for the publication of his international encyclopedia, Global Studies, which had been published in Russian and English languages. In 2004, he was also named laureate of the international award named after N. K. Ba'bakov, bestowed by the International Fuel and Power Association (IFPA) \\"for great accomplishments in resolving the problems of stable development of the power engineering and society.\\" In 2006, Chumakov received a diploma for co-authoring the fourth edition of the textbook \\"Philosophy\\", one of the \\"300 best textbooks for higher education in honor of the 300th anniversary of Saint-Petersburg.\\" In 2015, Chumakov became Doctor Emeritus of the Bashkir State University. In 2015 Chumakov also became a recipient of the International Gusi Peace Prize.  Main publications  = Books =  Monographs  = Russian = *Chumakov, A. N.

She formally described 23 previously unknown species of fungi, publishing their type descriptions in the Botanical Gazette and Charles Peck's \\"Annual Report of the New York State Botanist\\". Career Banning is best known as the author of The Fungi of Maryland, an unpublished manuscript containing scientific descriptions, mycological anecdotes, and 174 13\\" by 15\\" watercolor paintings of fungal species. The New York State Museum describes these paintings as \\"extraordinary...a blend of science and folk art, scientifically accurate and lovely to look at.\\" Banning's manuscript took twenty years to complete (1868‚Äì1888). Although the Maryland State Archives, citing Stegman, asserts that \\"At this point in time, no one had written a book on American fungi,\\" and Haines states, \\"In 1868 there were no books from which to learn about American fungi,\\" neither assertion is technically correct: Schweinitz's Synopsis Fungorum Carolin√¶ Superioris was published in 1822. Nevertheless, had Banning's opus been published, it would certainly have been the first illustrated and popularly accessible fungal flora of the southern United States. She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1994. = Challenges as a female mycologist = Mary eventually became the \\"leading mycologist in her region\\". Despite this, she was a woman, and she had no formal higher education. Consequently, with the exception of her mentor Peck, she found herself largely ostracized by the educated male scientific establishment of the day. Her private letters reveal her deep dissatisfaction with this state of affairs. Unable to obtain funding and having to care for her invalid mother and sister, Banning \\"incurred increasing financial problems.\\" Conversely, her mycological pursuits led to several awkward encounters with fungus-fearing locals, many of which she recounts as asides in her scientific publications. On one occasion, she rode six miles in a crowded \\"public conveyance\\" holding a basket of Phallus duplicatus ‚Äî a particularly foul-smelling fungus with the common name \\"netted stinkhorn.\\" By the end of the ride, Banning states that \\"the smell had increased to such an extent that the flies nearly devoured me, in their eagerness to get at the fungus\\". The other passengers maintained a stony silence for the duration of the trip. On another occasion, a man approached her, asking if she had found any \\"frog stools\\" that day. When she replied that she had not, he answered, \\"And it's a blessed thing you can't find 'em!...Pison [sic] things...Better let frog stools alone! That's my advice to everyone.\\" The man then walked away, muttering about Banning: \\"Poor thing. Crazy, certain sure. Clean gone mad!\\" On yet another occasion, Banning had employed three young boys to collect mushrooms. When they brought their finds to the hotel where she was staying and asked where they might find the 'frog stool lady,' the waiter replied, \\"Off with you! Have you gone crazy? Who ever heard tell of a frog-stool lady?\\" In the preface to her unpublished manuscript, Banning discusses the origin of her project in terms recalling then-prevalent natural theology: :::\\"My first idea of drawing and painting the Fungi of Maryland had for its object educational training in a mission school.... I confess to a smile at my choice of a subject, feeling that for once I had stepped from the sublime to the ridiculous. :::Yet I feel satisfied with my undertaking, believing that the study of Natural Science in any of its departments has a refining influence‚Äîthat when used in its truest highest sense it is the Divinely appointed means of teaching faith as well as cultivating the minds and morals.\\" The outlook she here elucidates might explain some of her persistence in the face of manifold challenges.  Family life  Banning was born in 1822 in Talbot County on Maryland's eastern shore.\\"Mary Elizabeth Banning - Overview,\\" Ancestry.com, http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/10084269/person/-700507514 (Accessed July 15, 2011). She was the daughter of Robert Banning and Mary Macky, and was the youngest of her father's eight children (six from a previous marriage). The Bannings were a well-established Maryland family: Mary Elizabeth's grandfather was a representative at Maryland's ratification of the federal constitution, and her father was a military captain, Collector of the Port of Oxford, and Member of the Maryland House of Delegates.\\"Banning Family,\\" In Notable Southern Families Volume I, compiled by Zella Armstrong, 25, Chattanooga, TN: The Lookout Publishing Company, c.1918 https://archive.org/stream/notablesouthern00frengoog#page/n32/mode/2up (accessed Aug. 2 2013) In 1845, when Banning was 23, her father died. In 1855, Banning, her mother, and her sisters moved to Baltimore. By 1860, her mother and a sister had become chronically ill, and Banning became their caretaker. Throughout, she maintained an interest in natural history, finally gravitating to the study of fungi. With her own money, she bought a microscope and started to amass a scientific library and private herbarium. She also initiated a correspondence with Charles Horton Peck, A New York State Museum scientist who, by then, was well on his way to becoming \\"the dean of American mycologists\\".  Final years and legacy  Amanita banningiana, named for Mary Elizabeth Banning. By the end of the 1880s, Mary's immediate family had died, and she found herself nearly penniless, with fading eyesight and growing rheumatism. She moved into a boarding-home in Winchester, Virginia. In 1889, she ended work on her manuscript, dedicating it to Peck, with whom she had corresponded for 30 years but never met. In 1890, she shipped the manuscript to Peck at the New York State Museum, writing, \\"In parting from it I feel like taking leave of a beloved friend with whom I have spent many pleasant hours. Circumstances impel me to put it in a safe place.\\" Peck placed the manuscript in a drawer, where it would remain for the next 91 years. Banning died 13 years later, in 1903. She left her remaining money to the St. John's Orphanage for Boys. In 1981, John Haines, a mycologist attached to the New York State museum as associate scientist, discovered Banning's manuscript. The museum organized the watercolors into the exhibit \\"Each a Glory Bright\\", which has been loaned to museums around the United States. Plates from the work can be viewed at the New York State Museum's page for this collection.

A number of rumours grew up around these murders, and many blamed them on the South African Government which, according to various popular accounts, wanted repayment of loans it had given to the Malawi Government, either in human blood or by the enslavement of Malawians to work in South Africa. These rumours were politically damaging to the government of Hastings Banda, which cultivated friendly relations with South Africa's white minority government, and he treated the murders as a serious issue requiring urgent resolution. The murders were never fully solved. Several men were arrested in connection with the murders in 1969, but acquitted for lack of evidence. This caused popular outrage at the criminal justice system which, at that time, was still based on English law and practice. In 1970 another man, Walla Laini Kawisa, made several confessions admitting to some of the murders. He was condemned to death and probably executed in May 1972. It is unlikely that the murders were the work of a single individual, and various theories have been proposed, some linking them to opposition to Banda. Banda himself blamed the murders on ex- ministers involved in the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, and removed Gomile Kumtumanji, a Member of Parliament cabinet minister for the Southern Region from office and had him tried for treason, allegedly for complicity in them.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, pp. 91‚Äì2. The Murders Between September 1968 and March 1970, a large number of brutal murders occurred at night and in the victims' own homes in the suburbs of Malawi's largest city, Blantyre. At least 31 murders were said to have been committed by the same person or group, and they are collectively known as the Chilobwe murders. The murders were often accompanied by mutilation of the victims' bodies, and these mutilations were said to be suggestive of a belief in witchcraft or magic by whoever carried out the killings. Although these murders were particularly identified with the suburb of Chilobwe, they also took place in other areas. Many of the victims were poor and lived in housing with badly fitting doors and windows or unreliable locks, which offered little resistance to forced entry. The Government's failure to make any arrests caused panic and led to criticism of the police and government. One persistent rumour was that the Government was itself responsible for the murders, and had drained the victims' blood to send to South Africa.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, pp. 361‚Äì2. In 1969, five people were arrested and charged with one of the Chilobwe murders in the Nakulenga case (named after the lead defendant). The accused were said to have entered a house, killed a man and a woman and left another man seriously injured. At first, the injured man told the police that he could not identify the attackers, but eleven days later he claimed that he was now able to identify some of them. At the close of the prosecution in the High Court, the defence argued that there was no case to answer. Justice Bolt, the trial judge, observed that these inconsistent statements affected the main witness's credibility, and that other witnesses had also given inconsistent evidence. One of the charges against the defendants was dismissed because, although there was some evidence, it was clearly unreliable. The President made a statement saying that, if the judge had any conscience, he should resign.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, p. 362.M H Hara, (2007). The Independence of Prosecuting Authorities: The Malawi Experience, p. 14. www.publiclaw.uct.ac.za/Hara_IndependenceOfProsecutingAuthority.doc There were no further proceedings on the other charges, but the defendants remained in detention, because Banda said that lack of evidence was not proof of innocence.R Carver, (1990). Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi, p. 33. Parliamentary reaction was hostile, and several speakers, including ministers, openly suggested that European judges and the European- style legal system had allowed clearly guilty defendants to escape the punishment they deserved. One speaker suggested that expatriate judges were particularly unfitted to deal with cases involving witchcraft, which this case involved. It was also suggested that African custom and tradition did not require such conclusive evidence of guilt as systems based on English law did, as they did not involve such English law principles as the Presumption of innocence, the establishment of guilt beyond reasonable doubt and sufficient corroborating evidence. This criticism and the consequent resignation of Justice Bolt, the formation of Traditional Courts, where lawyers were generally prevented from appearing and the abolition of the right of appeal to the High Court led to the resignation of the other four High Court judges, all English, on the basis that justice was not adequately safeguarded under the new arrangements.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, pp. 362‚Äì3. The Legal Background From 1902, English law had been established as the normally-recognised legal code in Nyasaland, and a High Court was established on the English model. Customary law was allowed (but not mandatory) in cases involving Africans, if \\"native\\" law or custom was not repugnant to English legal principles.Z Kadzimira (1971), Constitutional Changes in Malawi, 1891‚Äì1965, p. 82. A form of Indirect rule was instituted in 1933, with the chiefs and their councils who became Native Authorities, which operated Local Courts with limited criminal jurisdiction and subject both to control by European District Officers and the right of appeal to the High Court.R I Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 48‚Äì50. Malawi has adopted \\"an administrative view of law\\": its courts are regarded as instruments for achieving the goals set forth by officials, as a White Paper of 1965 states: \\"The function of a judge is not to question or obstruct the policies of the Executive Government, but to ascertain the purpose of these policies by reference to the laws made by Parliament and fairly and impartially to give effect to those purposes in the Courts when required to do so.\\" The verdict in the Nakulenga case did not achieve the government's objective of finding guilty parties so, in these terms, the European-style legal system had failed to deliver the correct result.L Rosen, (1978). Law and Social Change in the New Nations, p. 14. After the Nakulenga case, the Local Courts became Traditional Courts with extended criminal jurisdiction, including in cases of murder, using \\"customary\\" rules of evidence and procedure. The President of Malawi and the Chief Traditional Courts Commissioner gained extensive powers to supervise the Courts and review cases. The law itself remained unchanged, but it was to be administered in a different way. From 1970 the Traditional Courts were given jurisdiction to hear all homicide and treason cases involving Africans. Each Court consisted of three traditional chiefs, a chairman who was also a chief and one lawyer.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, p. 363.M H Hara, (2007). The Independence of Prosecuting Authorities: The Malawi Experience, p. 14. www.publiclaw.uct.ac.za/Hara_IndependenceOfProsecutingAuthority.doc The Case against Kawisa Walla Laini Kawisa was arrested on 7 March 1970 after his fingerprints were matched to those at an attempted break-in, unconnected with any murder. Following his arrest, he was implicated in three of the Chilobwe murders in which eight people were killed. The police produced some evidence, amounting to the finding of items said to have been stolen from some victims at Kawisa's house, and of thumb- or palm-prints \\"similar\\" to his at two murder locations. His fingerprints were not found on a murder weapon recovered from one murder scene. The Prosecutor at his trial accepted that, without his confessions, there was nothing to link him to any murders other than these three.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, pp. 363‚Äì5. During 19 months in detention, Kawisa made three contradictory confessions, although in each of these he confessed to murder. In his first confession, he implicated Henry Chipembere, an ex-minister, and also a local Malawi Congress Party Chairman, and claimed to be part of a group of 13 killers. In the second confession, he said that he was one of four murderers, and in the last confession he claimed to have acted alone. In his last confession, he said that the police had forced him to give the names of associates, which he invented: he also retracted the names of the politicians he had mentioned.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, pp. 365‚Äì7. The case against Kawisa was heard by the Southern Regional Traditional Court on 19 October 1971. Kawisa had no legal representation, and he pleaded guilty to the three counts against him, involving eight murders. The Prosecutor told the Court that Kawisa had agreed to have other charges taken into account, but no evidence was produced in these other cases. Kawisa pleaded guilty to all the details of the three charges specified.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, p. 361. As Traditional Courts rely heavily on confession evidence, the Court had to choose from the three conflicting confessions. It accepted the last confession as being most consistent with the evidence, but it indicated that the murders may have been politically motivated. The court's decision that Kawisa had acted alone was greeted with outrage, and Banda expressed his disbelief that Kawisa could have acted alone. As one of the three counts against Kawisa involved the murder of three adults and two children without the neighbours being alerted, and as the murder weapon in this case bore fingerprints that could not be identified, this disbelief was reasonable.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, pp. 367‚Äì8. However, even after the review by the National Traditional Court of Appeal and its assertion that Kawisa could not have acted alone, no further action was taken to find any of his possible associates. Kawisa was almost certainly mentally abnormal, however according to traditional beliefs, this could have been caused by the misuse of magical substances (which Kawisa had claimed in his confessions to have used to silence his victims) and was no defence. If he were legally insane, the Traditional Court should not have found him guilty, but it relied on a brief medical statement that he was sane. Malawian Traditional Courts have generally been unwilling to accept the defence of insanity.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, pp. 369, 370-1. On 30 October 1971, Kawisa was found to be solely responsible for thirty-one murders and fifteen attempted murders. He was sentenced to death by hanging and the court denied him the possibility of an appeal, as he had pleaded guilty. The case was, however, reviewed by the National Traditional Court of Appeal, which upheld both conviction and sentence although it also suggested that Kawisa could not have acted alone. In June, 1972, there were rumours that Kawisa had been hanged in Zomba prison, although no public announcement was made.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, p. 369. Aftermath After the end of Kawisa's trial, no attempts were apparently made to track down any associates he might have had, and his execution (whenever it took place) prevented his being questioned further. Despite Banda's expressed disbelief in Kawisa acting alone, it was probably politically expedient, particularly from the point of view of relations with South Africa that further action was dropped. However, as the murders were probably not the work of a mentally unbalanced individual, there has been considerable speculation about any organisation that may have arranged the murders, if Kawisa did not act alone, and whether there was any political motivation behind the killings.P Brietzke, (1974). The Chilobwe Murders Trial, pp. 369‚Äì70. It has been suggested that the downfall in 1976 of Albert Muwalo, a cabinet minister who was later executed, and of Focus Gwede, Head of the Police Special Branch, (who was sentenced to death, but reprieved), resulted from their being implicated in the Chilobwe murders. Informers accused both men of trying to discredit Banda by spreading the politically damaging rumours of Malawi Government involvement in the murders. It was also claimed that Gomile Kumtamanji, as Minister of Health, had access to chloroform, used to silence the victims.J Power, (2010). Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi: Building Kwacha, pp. 158, 175, 193. Since the overthrow of Banda in 1993, some Malawian writers have suggested that the Chilobwe murders represented opposition to the Banda regime among urban workers, and that the murders were random and intended to destabilise Banda's government. These also argue that Gomile Kumtamanji at least did lead opposition to Banda, so that his trial was not merely a dictator's paranoid fantasy.J Lwanda, (2009).
