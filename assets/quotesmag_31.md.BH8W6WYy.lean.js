Biography  Robert was educated at the boys choir, or ma√Ætrise, of Notre Dame de Paris under the direction of Henry Fr√©mart, Jean Francois, and Cosset Veillot before being appointed master of music at the Senlis Cathedral in 1643. In 1650 he went to the Cathedral of Chartres before returning to Senlis in March 1652. On 28 April 1653, he was appointed music master of Notre Dame de Paris, replacing Valentin de Bournonville. Robert remained ten years as head of the ma√Ætrise.Sadie J.A. Companion to baroque music 1998 p. 466Sadie S. The New Grove dictionary of music and musicians, Volume 16 1980 p. 66Bianconi L. Music in the seventeenth century 1987 p. 149 In 1663, Louis XIV chose him with Henry Du Mont to occupy one of the four posts of Assistant Master of the Chapelle Royale. He initially filled this function in conjunction with Thomas Gobert, Gabriel Expilly and Henry Du Mont, though Gobert and Expilly resigned in 1668. Du Mont and Robert developed the grand motet, the characteristic genre of French baroque sacred music. Du Mont and Robert retired in 1682 when Louis XIV relocated the court to Versailles, and a competition was held to find four replacements among thirty five contenders; the four chosen were Michel Richard Delalande, Pascal Collasse and two minor composers Nicolas Coupillet, and Guillaume Minoret. Among those passed over were Paolo Lorenzani, Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, Jean- F√©ry Rebel, Henry Desmarets and Marc-Antoine Charpentier who withdrew from the competition because of illness.

Other types of meters used for routine servicing, including normal capacitance meters, cannot be used to measure a capacitor's ESR, although combined meters are available which measure both ESR and out-of- circuit capacitance. A standard (DC) milliohmmeter or multimeter cannot be used to measure ESR, because a steady direct current cannot be passed through the capacitor. Most ESR meters can also be used to measure non-inductive low- value resistances, whether or not associated with a capacitor; this leads to a number of additional applications described below. Need for ESR measurement Aluminium electrolytic capacitors have a relatively high ESR that increases with age, heat, and ripple current; this can cause the equipment using them to malfunction. In older equipment, this tended to cause hum and degraded operation; modern equipment, in particular switch-mode power supplies, is very sensitive to ESR, and a capacitor with high ESR can cause equipment to malfunction or cause permanent damage requiring repair, typically by causing power supply voltages to become excessively high.Example of high- ESR capacitors causing voltages to rise in a circuit and destroy components. High ESR capacitors cause \\"5V dropping quite low and causing every other voltage to go sky high (and doing things like frying the HDD with upwards of 15V rather than 12V, and frying the tuning agc transistor with upwards of 36V instead of 30V).\\" Electrolytic capacitors are, nevertheless, very often used because they are inexpensive and have a very high capacitance per unit volume or weight; typically, these capacitors have capacitance from about one microfarad to tens of thousands of microfarads. Capacitors with faults leading to high ESR often overheat and thereafter bulge and leak as the electrolyte chemicals decompose into gases, making them somewhat easy to identify visually; however, capacitors that appear visually perfect may still have high ESR, detectable only by measurement. Precise measurement of ESR is rarely necessary, and any usable meter is adequate for troubleshooting. When precision is required, measurements must be taken under appropriately specified conditions, because ESR varies with frequency, applied voltage, and temperature. A general-purpose ESR meter operating with a fixed frequency and waveform will usually be unsuitable for precise laboratory measurements. Methods of ESR measurement Measuring ESR can be done by applying an alternating voltage at a frequency at which the capacitor's reactance is negligible, in a voltage divider configuration. It is easy to check ESR well enough for troubleshooting by using an improvised ESR meter comprising a simple square-wave generator and oscilloscope, or a sinewave generator of a few tens of kilohertz and an AC voltmeter, using a known good capacitor for comparison, or by using a little mathematics. A professional ESR meter is more convenient for checking multiple capacitors in rapid succession. A standard measurement bridge, and many LCR and Q meters, can also measure ESR accurately, in addition to many other circuit parameters. The dedicated ESR meter is a relatively inexpensive special-purpose instrument of modest accuracy, used mainly to identify capacitors with unacceptably large ESR and sometimes to measure other low resistances; measurements of other parameters cannot be made. Principles of ESR meter operation Most ESR meters work by discharging a real electrolytic capacitor (more or less equivalent to an ideal capacitor in series with an unwanted resistance, the ESR) and passing an electric current through it for a short time, too short for it to charge appreciably. This will produce a voltage across the device equal to the product of the current and the ESR plus a negligible contribution from a small charge in the capacitor; this voltage is measured and its value divided by the current (i.e., the ESR) shown in ohms or milliohms on a digital display or by the position of a pointer on a scale. The process is repeated tens or hundreds of thousands of times a second. Alternatively an alternating current at a frequency high enough that the capacitor's reactance is much less than the ESR can be used. Circuit parameters are usually chosen to give meaningful results for capacitance from about one microfarad up, a range that covers typical aluminium capacitors whose ESR tends to become unacceptably high. Interpretation of readings An acceptable ESR value depends upon capacitance (larger capacitors usually have lower ESR), and may be read from a table of \\"typical\\" values, or compared with a new component. In principle, the capacitor manufacturer's upper limit specification for ESR can be looked up in a datasheet, but this is usually unnecessary. When a capacitor whose ESR is critical degrades, power dissipation as the ESR increases usually causes a rapid and large runaway increase, so go/no-go measurement is usually good enough as the ESR often rapidly moves from a clearly acceptable to a clearly unacceptable level; an ESR of over a few ohms (less for a large capacitor) is unacceptable. In a practical circuit, the ESR will be much lower than any other resistance in parallel with the capacitor, so it is not necessary to disconnect the component, and an in-circuit measurement can be made. Practical ESR meters use a voltage too low to switch on any semiconductor junctions that may be present in the circuit; this might present a low \\"on\\" impedance that would interfere with measurements. Limitations * An ESR meter does not measure the capacitance of a capacitor; the capacitor must be disconnected from the circuit and measured with a capacitance meter (or a multimeter with this capability). Excessive ESR is far more likely to be an identifiable problem with aluminium electrolytics rather than out-of-tolerance capacitance, which is rare in capacitors with acceptable ESR. * A faulty short-circuited capacitor will incorrectly be identified by an ESR meter as having ideally low ESR, but an ohmmeter or multimeter can easily detect this case, which is much rarer in practice than high ESR. It is possible to connect the test probes to an ESR meter and ohmmeter in parallel to check for both shorts and ESR in one operation; some meters both measure ESR and detect short-circuits. * ESR may depend upon operating conditions (mainly applied voltage, temperature); a capacitor which has excessive ESR at operating temperature and voltage may test as good if measured cold and unpowered. Some circuit faults due to such intermittent capacitors can be identified by using freeze spray; if cooling the capacitor restores correct operation, it is faulty. * An ESR meter can be damaged by connection to a capacitor with significant voltage across it, either because of residual stored charge or in a live circuit. Protective diodes across the input will minimise this risk, but then the meter can no longer be used to measure battery internal resistance. * When an ESR meter is used as a milliohmmeter, any significant inductance present between the test probes will make measurements meaningless. For example, an ESR meter is unsuitable for measuring resistance in transformer windings because of their inductive characteristics. This effect is significant enough that test probes with coiled cords should not be used due to their inductance. Other uses of ESR meters An ESR meter is more accurately described as a pulsed or high- frequency AC milliohmmeter (depending upon type), and it can be used to measure any low resistance. An ESR meter with no back-to-back protective diodes across its input can measure the internal resistance of batteries (many batteries end their useful life largely due to increased internal resistance, rather than low EMF). Depending upon the exact circuit used, an ESR meter may also be used to measure the contact resistance of switches, the resistance of sections of printed circuit (PCB) track, etc. While there are specialised instruments to detect short-circuits between adjacent PCB tracks, an ESR meter is useful because it can measure low resistances while injecting a voltage too low to confuse readings by switching on semiconductor junctions in the circuit. An ESR meter can be used to find short-circuits, even finding which of a group of capacitors or transistors connected in parallel by printed circuit tracks or wires is short-circuited. Many conventional ohmmeters and multimeters are not usable for very low resistances, and those that are often use too high a voltage, risking damage to the circuit being tested. Tweezer probes are useful when test points are closely spaced, such as in equipment made with surface mount technology. The tweezer probes can be held in one hand, leaving the other hand free to steady or manipulate the equipment being tested.

Vette (1978). \\"US Patent #4216424: Method and apparatus for testing electrolytic capacitors \\" under the Creative Electronics brand.

According to the 2008 census, this town has a population of 20,705.  Localities  The municipality is composed of two main cities, the city of Corso (chief town), and the agglomeration of Berrahmoune and several secondary agglomerations like Traykia, Haouch Mahfoud Ben Abdelkader, and Ouled Ben Bakhta.  Archaeology  The wilaya of Boumerd√®s represents an archaeological treasure thanks to the multitude of the historical sites which shelters its vast area of 1,456.16 km¬≤. Several centers of population were built during more than 20 centuries on these medium altitude grounds that form the current Lower Kabylie whose city of Boumerd√®s is the current chief town. The mausoleum of Blad Guitoun in the commune of Si Mustapha is an example of the archaeological sites that were still visible in Lower Kabylia at the beginning of the French colonization in 1837. The B√©nian NTAA Soumaa in the town of Thenia is another archaeological site that was wonderfully preserved until the middle of the sixth century. The Berber populations who lived around these archaeological sites before the French colonization preserved this cultural heritage and identity. The location of these archaeological sites on the banks of Oued Isser and Oued S√©baou as well as on the Mediterranean coast makes it possible to classify the wilaya of Boumerd√®s among the rich archaeological niches in Algeria. During the past centuries, the various floods of the Oued Isser and the Oued S√©baou, among other wadis of Basse Kabylie, have caused the overflow of these rivers to have buried the Numidian cities under the silt and the mud carried by the torrents. With a depth of about 3 meters, there have been several discoveries in the wilaya of Boumerd√®s including many remains and archaeological sites which were unearthed in 2009. In the village of Beni H'mida in the town of Legata, remnants of a statue were found alongside flat metal, pottery relics and human bones. At Ouriacha village in the commune of Naciria (La√¢ziv Za√¢moum), a jug containing more than 900 silver coins engraved in the name of Bolokin Abderrahmane was discovered. In the village of Titouna in Souk El Had, a polished chest-shaped stone engraved on its front face with a metalwork scene was also discovered 3 meters below ground during construction work, and filed at the wilayale direction of culture in Boumerdes.

Laporte, \\"Cissi\\", Encyclop√©die berb√®re It was known to medieval European geographers as Berengereto. By the 18th century, Djinet was a small port town serving the farmers of the surrounding lowlands, described by Thomas Shaw in the following terms: : ...we come to the little port of Jinnett, from which a great quantity of grain is shipped off yearly to Christendom. Jinnett is a small creek, with tolerably good anchoring grounds before it; and was probably Edrisi's Mers' el Dajaje, or Port of Hens. I was told that Jinnett, or Paradise, was given to this place, on account of a row-boat, which was once very providentially conducted within the creek, when the mariners expected every moment to have perished upon the neigbouring rocks.Thomas Shaw, 3rd ed. 1808 (1st ed. 1738), Travels Or Observations Relating to Several Parts of Barbary and the Levant: Illustrated with Copperplates, Volume 1, p. 88 Ecclesiastical history Roman Cissi was a Christian bishopric, suffragan to the metropolitan of Carthage. The names of two of its bishops are known: * At a Conference of Carthage (411) between Catholic and schismatic Donatist bishops, where their heresy was condemned as such, Cissi was represented only by a Donatist bishop named Flavosus. The Latin adjective referring to Cissi, Cissitanus, is applied to him in the account of that conference. In the 19th century, Morcelli took the adjective Cessitanus to refer to Cissi, and supposed instead that the name of the Cissi bishop at the conference was Quodvultdeus, whom Ferron rather attributed to the see of Cissita, which was in Africa Proconsularis and presently in Tunisia (Sidi-Tabet?). * In 484, Bishop Reparatus of Cissi was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom summoned to Carthage and then exiled like most Catholic bishops.Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa christiana, Volume I, Brescia 1816, p. 138 The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as the Catholic titular bishopric of Cissi ().Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 871 Its bishops have been: * Jean de Capistran Aim√© Cayer, OFM (1949.06.17 ‚Äì 1978.04.13) * Augusto Vargas Alzamora, SJ (1978.06.08 ‚Äì 1989.12.30) * Olindo Natale Spagnolo Martellozzo, MCCJ (1990.02.02 ‚Äì 2008.07.23) * Enrique Egu√≠a Segu√≠ (2008.09.04 to present), Auxiliary Bishop of Archdiocese of Buenos Aires Transport Djinet is connected to the rest of the country through a single main road: RN 24, a coastal road leading to Algiers in the west (via Zemmouri) and Bejaia in the east (via Dellys).Atlas Routier de l'Alg√©rie : Wilaya de Boumerd√®s  See also  * List of Catholic dioceses in Algeria  References =CitationsBibliography * GCatholic - (former &) titular bishopric * . * . * .

Registered in Malta, it is regulated by the Lotteries & Gaming Authority of Malta. History Intercasino was created on November 17, 1996. In 1996, InterCasino accepted the first genuine money wager online after the business was initially launched in Antigua by William \\"Billy\\" Scott, a former Ohio bookmaker. In 1998, he was charged by prosecutors in the US for illegally taking sports bets online and the business is now in the hands of new owners. InterCasino's online platforms are powered by WagerLogic software, a division of CryptoLogic. Thursday, 30 May 2019 In 2002, InterCasino launched InterCasinoPoker, a poker room. InterCasino is regulated by Malta The name was later shortened to InterPoker. The following year, Gambling Online magazine voted InterCasino as 'Top Online Casino', an accolade it also won in 2004 (jointly with Omnicasino), 2005 and 2006. In 2007 it came in second place after 888.com took the top spot. In April 2012, InterCasino's parent company, CryptoLogic, was acquired by the Amaya Gaming Group in a $35.8 million cash for shares takeover. Amaya subsequently sold Cryptologic's business-to-consumer facing subsidiary, WagerLogic, to Goldstar Acquisitionco Inc in a transaction valued at $70 million in February 2014. This sale included all of Cryptologic's consumer facing online gambling sites including InterCasino, InterPoker, and InterBingo. Payouts The then world's biggest online jackpot was won in December 2005 winning $1,768,518.49 playing InterCasino's Millionaires Club progressive slots. The record was then broken in May 2007 when a blacksmith with the player name of Obaesso won $8,000,000. Regulation Wagers from US players for InterCasino games stopped being accepted in October 2006 due to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. This made transactions from banks and similar financial institutions to online gambling websites a crime. As of November 9, 2011, InterCasino's services were not available to residents from the United States, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Turkey. In 2008, a series of online casino and poker TV adverts from InterCasino were banned by the ASA because they were deemed as using juvenile and slapstick humour that could appeal to young people and children. InterCasino's parent company at the time, Online Interactive Gaming Entertainment, defended the adverts, describing them as using \\"gentle slapstick humour reminiscent of old-fashioned routines by Charlie Chaplin or Benny Hill\\" and, as such, not designed to appeal to children or young persons.

Fossil remains of Uktenadactylus dated back to the Early Cretaceous period (Barremian to Cenomanian stages), from about 125 to 100 million years ago. Discovery and naming U. rodriguesae holotype In 1994, Yuong Nam-Lee named a new species within the genus Coloborhynchus: Coloborhynchus wadleighi, based on a partial snout found in 1992 in Albian layers in Tarrant County, holotype SMU 73058 (Shuler Museum of Paleontology, Southern Methodist University at Dallas). The specific name honors the collector of the fossil, Chris Wadleigh. The reference of the species to the genus Coloborhynchus was based on the fact that both C. wadleighi and the type species of Coloborhynchus, Coloborhynchus clavirostris, share the trait of having three pairs of teeth laterally placed within a broad snout tip. This would distinguish both from the species Criorhynchus simus and justify a revival of the genus Coloborhynchus that since an analysis by Reginald Walter Hooley in 1914 had generally been considered identical to the genus Criorhynchus or the genus the latter had again been sunk into, Ornithocheirus. As a result of the reappearance of the concept European workers referred many species discovered in South-America to Coloborhynchus, a practice rejected by most South-American researchers. In 2009 a study by the Brazilian paleontologists Taissa Rodrigues and Alexander Kellner concluded that Coloborhynchus comprised only a single species, its type species, C. clavirostris. Accordingly, in the same publication they created a new genus for C. wadleighi: Uktenadactylus. The genus name is derived from Uktena, a giant horned snake from the mythology of the Cherokee and Greek daktylos, \\"finger\\", a common element in the names of pterosaurs since Pterodactylus, referring to their typical wing finger. In 2020, Borja Holgado and Rodrigo P√™gas named a new species of Uktenadactylus, U. rodriguesae after Rodrigues, known from a snout fragment (cataloged as IWCMS 2014.82) found on the Isle of Wight. This specimen had previously been described in 2015 by David Martill as an indeterminate member of the genus Coloborhynchus on account of the anteriorly-projecting teeth at the snout tip. Holgado and P√™gas recognized that it shared features with U. wadleighi, and thus assigned it as a new species in the same genus. Description U. wadleighi holotype (I, J) compared with other anhanguerians The holotype and only specimen of U. wadleighi, the partial snout, has a length of about fifteen centimetres and consists of the front end of the skull, containing the premaxilla and a small part of the maxilla. On top the base of a crest is present, gradually curving upwards and ending at a height of , having attained at that point a thickness of . The snout broadens towards the front. On the left side eight tooth sockets or alveoli are visible, on the right side six. The first pair of teeth was located in the flat tip of the snout, pointing forwards. The alveoli at first increase in size from the tip towards the back, the third pair being the largest with a diameter of either or . The fourth pair is much smaller; to the back gradually the tooth sockets again increase in size. Thus a \\"prey grab\\" is formed. According to Rodrigues and Kellner the species has two unique traits: the presence of an oval depression above and in between the first pair of teeth and of a ventral medial depression between the second pair of teeth, a circular hollow positioned on the lower edge of the snout tip that Lee had interpreted as a possible pneumatic foramen. The holotype of U. rodriguesae shares the oval depression and also a bulbous projection on the palate with the holotype of U. wadleighi. However, it differs from from U. wadleighi in that the depression is shallower, the second pair of teeth projects more laterally, and the margins of the deltoid facet (an upturned region of the front palate) are concave as opposed to straight. Rodrigues and Kellner base the distinction between Uktenadactylus and Coloborhynchus clavirostris on several stratigraphical, methodological and phylogenetic considerations. There is a possible age difference of perhaps over thirty million years between the Berriasian-Valanginian British and the younger Albian-Cenomanian American form. Because both taxa are based on very limited remains, that however, even within these limits are clearly distinguishable on the species level, they reject a rash assumption of generic identity. Also the uncertain affinity with the closely related form Siroccopteryx would make such an assumption problematical. Rodrigues and Kellner identify only one shared derived trait for Uktenadactylus and Coloborhynchus clavirostris: an extreme enlargement of the second and third pairs of teeth. Differences between the taxa include the more forward position of the crest with C. clavirostris, beginning at the very tip of the snout; a deeper palatal groove and shallow grooves running parallel to the ridge of the front part of the palate; a depression located below the first alveoli and a more lateral position of the second, third and fourth tooth pairs whereas the fifth and sixth pair are to the contrary much closer to the midline of the skull. Both forms share some derived traits with Siroccopteryx: the second and third teeth pairs are larger than the fourth; the tip of the snout is flat causing the \\"prey grab\\" to be rectangular in cross-section and a similar thickness of the crest. The authors conclude from this that the three taxa likely formed an, as yet unnamed, clade together within the Anhangueridae. Classification In 2013, a topology by Andres & Myers placed Uktenadactylus within the family Ornithocheiridae, as the sister taxon of Coloborhynchus clavirostris, though in the analysis, Uktenadactylus was indentified as Coloborhynchus wadleighi. In 2019 however, a different topology by Jacobs et al. also recovered Uktenadactylus within the Ornithocheiridae, but as the sister taxon of several Coloborhynchus species.

Wigan was once a proud town with railway stations widely available across the borough, used by both freight and passengers. Many lines were originally built for freight then as the owners saw the profitability of allowing passengers to travel on their lines they soon became open to passenger trains. After the Beeching Report (1963), which led to a lot of rural railway lines and stations closing, the railways and stations around Wigan began to become unused. one of the last lines to close was called the Whelley loop line which was closed to both freight and passengers in 1972.  History  Railways were used as a more efficient way of transporting goods and resources more quickly around the country than the canals could. This benefit led to more and more pit owners creating private railways leading from the canals and main railway lines, right up to their pits.

During the reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180), Alexios accompanied his father Andronikos in exile, visiting, inter alia, the Kingdom of Georgia. The Georgian king George III, their relative, granted to Andronikos several castles in Kakhetia in the east of Georgia. Andronikos returned to Constantinople and attained to the Byzantine crown in 1183, only to be overthrown and killed in 1185. Alexios then fled to Georgia, where he was restored to his father's Georgian estates. At one point, he was even considered by some Georgian nobles as a candidate to become a consort of the queen regnant Tamar of Georgia.Toumanoff, Cyril (July 1940), \\"On the Relationship between the Founder of the Empire of Trebizond and the Georgian Queen Thamar\\", Speculum, Vol. 15, No. 3: pp. 299‚Äì312 According to the Georgian historical tradition, during Andronikos I's sojourn in Georgia, he left progeny in the country, which flourished and produced the noble family of Andronikashvili, i.e., \\"scions of Andronikos\\". Since Andronikos I had no sons by a Georgian mistress at this time, modern scholars trace the origin of this family to Alexios, but the exact origin of the family name is disputed, not least because the attested genealogy of the Andronikashvili does not commence until the 16th century. Michel Kur≈°anskis suggests that the family was possibly named after a son of Alexios. On the other hand, Cyril Toumanoff assumed that the line of the \\"provincial kings\\" of Alastani (‚Äì1348), known from the medieval Georgian sources and including one named Andronikos (), might have belonged to the Georgian Komnenoi/Andronikashvili. According to his view, followed by Konstantinos Varzos, Alexios had a son, George \\"the Great\\", who received the domain of Alastani to rule as his sub-kingdom, and that the name \\"Andronikashvili\\" only came about after Andronikos of Alastani, Alexios's great-great-grandson.

The fish is found throughout South Africa in a variety of aquatic environments. The species is notable for its two breeding seasons, which allows it to flourish despite a short lifespan. Identification The females () are larger than males (). They have blunt heads with a small mouth. A few beards reach down to the mouth. During the breeding season the males are brightly golden coloured, otherwise all the fish are a greyish green on the back with a small spot on the tail fin. Distribution The fish is widespread in rivers from the Highveld down to KwaZulu-Natal, former Transkei and the middle and upper parts of the Orange River. The species is also found in the bigger rivers of the Western and Eastern Cape. Habitat The fish prefers cooler water to live in and occur in a variety of habitats, from large lakes and rivers to small streams. They keep to dark waters where there are shadows, for example under fallen trees. They breed twice during the year, once between November and January and again from February to March. It is thought that the dual breeding seasons has allowed Barbus anoplus to be as successful as it is in entering various environments across South Africa. The female lays her eggs against the vegetation. The larvae hatch within three days and began to swim and feed after 6 to 7 days and reach maturity after one year. Most males are only two years old and females reach up to three years old. The species is omnivorous and eat insects, zoo plankton, green algae and diatoms.

The Description of Pembrokeshire, Gomer Press, 1994. The area however was a source of anxiety for the Tudor monarchy. Due to its location, it was exposed to attacks from Ireland, a convenient base from which England could be invaded via Wales.Jones, J Gwynfor. Wales & The Tudor State, Cardiff University of Wales Press, 1989. In 1405, the French landed in force having left Brest in July with more than 2,800 knights and men-at-arms led by Jean II de Rieux, the Marshal of France, in order to support Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellion. It was here that Henry Tudor landed with his uncle, Jasper Tudor, in 1485 before his march towards Lincolnshire, ending in the Battle of Bosworth. The Tudor era began to recognise the strategic importance of defence of the area, and Thomas Cromwell highlighted this fact to the Council of the Marches of Wales. Some 40 years later, this led to the construction of device forts at West Blockhouse and East Blockhouse. Milford Haven was one of the objectives during the Spanish Armada of 1597, and possible landing places were examined. George Owen had recommended the construction of forts at Dale Point, Thorn Island and Stack Rock, but no action was taken. Although a storm dispersed much of the Armada, some Spanish ships pressed on and landfall was made in the Cleddau. The arrival of Welsh militia and the dispersal of their fleet however soon forced the Spanish to retreat. One of the ships, a forty-ton caravel Nuestra Senora Buenviage which had been damaged in the storm attempted to flee but was boarded and captured by six Welsh boats and thus pillaged. The cargo included gold and silver and as a result a fight broke out amongst the pillagers in which one man was wounded. Piracy was also recognised as a problem, perhaps encouraged by the lack of fortification and nature of the landscape. The Queen's Remembrancer Roll of 1562 reported that: In April 1603, Martin Pring used the Haven as his departure point for his exploratory voyage to Virginia.Hoyt, Epaphras.

The land comprising the site of Milford, the Manor of Hubberston and Pill, was acquired by the Barlow family following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century. It acquired an additional strategic importance in the 17th century as a Royalist military base. Charles I ordered a fort to be built at Pill which could prevent re- enforcement of the Parliamentarian garrison of Pembroke Castle, and this was completed in 1643. On 23 February 1644, a Parliamentarian force led by Rowland Laugharne crossed the Haven and landed at Castle Pill. The fort was gunned from both land and water, and a garrison was placed in Steynton church to prevent a Royalist attack from the garrison at Haverfordwest. The fort was eventually surrendered, and quickly taken,1643-4: Civil War in Pembrokeshire Retrieved 18 January 2010 along with St Thomas a Becket chapel. Just five years later in 1649 Milford Haven was again the site of Parliamentarian interest when it was chosen as the disembarkation site for Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Ireland.

Although surrounding settlements at Steynton, Thornton, Priory, Liddeston and Hubberston/Hakin were established, they were little more than hamlets. The only man-made structures on the future site of Milford were the medieval chapel, and Summer Hill Farm, and its accompanying cottages. The 18th century ‚àí Foundation A plan of Milford Haven, 1758 Street plan of Milford Haven, 1868 By the mid 18th century, the lands had been inherited by Catherine Barlow of Slebech, who at the time was living in London. In 1758 she married Sir William Hamilton, and on her death in 1782, he inherited the land in the Hubberston and Pill area. He became interested in the Pembrokeshire Coalfield, and the idea of developing the land and harbour into a town.Wing Commander Ken McKay A Vision Of Greatness: The History of Milford 1790-1990, Brace Harvatt Associates, 1989. Hon. Charles Francis Greville, his nephew, was given responsibility for managing the project, and in 1790 an Act of Parliament was granted which made it possible to continue.BBC South West Wales website 'A Brief History of Milford', Jon Gower Retrieved 19 January 2010 In 1791, Mary Morgan visited Hubberston on a tour of Wales, and noted in her journal: There had been a Quaker population in Pembrokeshire since 1650, although its numbers had been in decline following emigration to North America. Greville, supported by Sir William Harcourt, proceeded to invite seven Nantucket Quaker families to settle in the new town, and in 1792 they arrived, led by the Starbuck family, with the intention of developing a whaling fleet to service the growing demand for street lighting.Allen, Richard C. Nantucket Quakers and the Milford Haven Whaling Industry, C. 1791‚Äì1821, Quaker Studies, Vol. 15, No. 1, 09.2010, p. 6-31. David Barnes. The Companion Guide to Wales, Companion Guides, 2005. Greville had highlighted the opportunities for trade with the Americas from the town to the New Englanders, and lobbied the Board of Trade to support the plan. A lack of suitable accommodation in the town encouraged building of residential properties on undeveloped land above the harbour, which had been organised into three long streets, terraced back one from the other, with intersecting side streets. The Front Street housed austere homes for the Quakers, which allowed them to look out to sea in keeping with the Nantucket style. The Middle Street became the commercial centre, and the back street housed artisans. The frequent claim that an American gridiron pattern was used may not have been as integral to the design as the fact that the topography of the landscape required it, the steep gradient preventing other designs. Several important Quaker families established large homes during this time, including Samuel Starbuck Sr at Priory Lodge and Uriah Bunker at Bunkers Hill, and by 1810 the town could boast 150 houses, businesses and a hotel. In 1797 the Navy Board established a dockyard which produced warships. Seven royal vessels were eventually launched from the dockyard, including HMS Surprise and .Edwards, Sybil, The Story of the Milford Haven Waterway, Logaston Press, 2009. Progress was rapid, and by 1802, Admiral Horatio Nelson had been invited to view the town in person as part of a tour to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of the Nile. He spoke glowingly during a banquet held in his honour, commenting on the number of whaleships sent to the Southern Oceans, Milford's status as a primary seaport on the west coast of Britain, and culminated in comparing the harbour with that of Trincomalee in Sri Lanka as to be the two best he had ever seen. Greville's plans were no less ambitious. At a site on high ground in Hakin, he planned to build \\"The College of King George the Third founded at Milford\\", whose centrepiece would be an observatory. Although the observatory was built, and indeed scientific instruments were delivered, the college never functioned as such. A church, dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria, was consecrated in October 1808. Located in the underdeveloped eastern side of the town, it remained a chapel of ease until 1891 when Milford became a parish, until that time competing with St Peter and St Cewydd in Steynton. By around the start of the 19th century, a mail coach was operating between London and Hubberston, arriving in the evening and returning the following day, connecting with the packet service to Ireland.Rees, Thomas, The Beauties of England and Wales, or, Delineations, topographical, historical, and descriptive, of each county, Vernor & Hood, 1803 ASIN: B0018X3YSI In 1800 the short-lived Milford and Pembrokeshire Bank was established by Thomas Phillips, operating from a branch in the town.

On 24 October 1889, the liner City of Rome, part of the Anchor Line fleet, arrived from New York City into the Haven.

Captain (and retired Admiral) Charles Holcombe Dare, to counter the activity of German U-boats off the coast of Pembrokeshire. The town welcomed many Belgian refugees from Ostend, many of whom had known the area through landing fish; they bolstered the fishing fleet, depleted by war service, and later erected a memorial in gratitude.Milford Haven War Memorials Pembroke County War Memorials, retrieved 03/01/2010 The early 20th century saw a period of increased urbanization of the area. The land immediately back from Hamilton Terrace, bounded by Robert St, Priory Road and Great North Road was now completely built upon. In the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built in a variety of locations, including estates at Hakinville, Prioryville, Glebelands and Prescelly Place. In 1926 the Urban District Council completed work on an electricity plant, thereby completing the electrification of the town, at a cost of ¬£70,000. A sewerage plant followed in 1930, the Prescelly Waterworks in 1932, and in the same year the original toll bridge linking Milford and Hakin was replaced with Victoria Bridge. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath. During the Second World War Milford Haven was chosen as a base for allied American troops, and roughly 1,000 American military personnel were housed in the town at this time. They manned an amphibious base which included a hospital built in Hakin and a docks complex at Newton Noyes. The base, initially commanded by Rear Admiral P. E. Phillips and from 1942 by Vice- Admiral Fairbairn, had a complement of 71 officers and 902 enlisted men, and played a role in preparations for D-Day.Experience Pembrokeshire - Milford Haven \\"Experience Pembrokeshire Website\\", accessed 14.11.09 A focus of activity for the base included mine sweeping of the Haven, which was subject to aircraft attack on 50 occasions. Milford town escaped serious damage from German bombings during the Second World War however, and bombs were seldom dropped on land. Despite its strategic importance as the home of a large fish market, a mines depot, a flax factory, and housing numerous military personnel, a co-ordinated attack on the town never materialised. In the summer of 1941 a bomb fell in fields near Priory Road, and later that year, a bomb damaged a house in Brooke Avenue. In neither instance were there casualties.Richards, Bill, Pembrokeshire Under Fire: The Story of the Air Raids of 1940-1, Paterchurch Publications, 1995. August 1941 saw the Meades Farm hit in an unsuccessful attack on Air Ministry underground petroleum tanks in Priory Pill, which resulted in non fatal injuries. Due to it strategic importance as a naval base, few children were evacuated from urban centres to Milford Haven. Requisition of the fishing fleet in August 1939 for naval duty meant that the number of trawlers in Milford dropped from 109 in July 1939 to 51 in December of that year. The Oil Age Aerial view of Milford looking west to Pill Milford looking east towards Hakin By the 1950s, the fishing industry was in decline, and unemployment in the area had reached 11%. The government had in fact scheduled it as a 'distressed' area.Hansard Extract - HC Deb 30 July 1959 vol 610 cc731-48 - INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, MILFORD HAVEN Retrieved 2 January 2011 Over-fishing coupled with national economic factors contributed to a significant decline in the fishing industry, resulting in smaller catches and fewer trawlers. By 1972, only twelve trawlers were registered at the port, and 1974 saw industrial and political action to save jobs related to the industry. There had been a housing boom however in the years following Second World War. The District Council took advantage of recently lifted restrictions, and built over 1,000 new homes to accommodate the rising population. The wide sheltered waterway, cheap land on either side of the Haven and government support contributed to the decision in 1957 to create a major oil port.John, Brian Pembrokeshire: British Topographical Series, David & Charles, 1976. Legislation was passed, and 1958 saw the establishment of the Milford Haven Conservancy Board. In 1960, the Esso Company completed work on an oil refinery near the town, which opened despite environmental objections.\\"Oil Refinery for Milford Haven\\". Article from The Glasgow Herald, 05.11.1957, Retrieved 2 January 2011 This was followed by similar developments by many other chief oil companies in a 10-year period.

In 1964 Texaco completed construction on a refinery a near Rhoscrowther, and 1968 saw the opening of the Gulf Refinery near Waterston. The Amoco Refinery near Roberston Cross was the last to be built, in 1973. All three refineries were linked to the main railway line by branch lines. In 1973, Pembroke Power Station came online, burning fuel from the surrounding refineries. In 1974, Milford could boast an oil trade of 58,554,000 tons, which was three times the combined trade of all the other ports of Wales. By the early 1980s, the Esso refinery was the 2nd largest in the UK.Hughes, Wendy.

A History of Wales, Penguin Books, 1994. The nature of large construction projects meant that workers were attracted from outside the local area, and the decline of the fishing industry was to a certain extent masked. However, this employment was not permanent. On completing the construction of construction projects such as the Esso refinery and the Cleddau Bridge, those who decided to relocate to the town were faced with what the Preseli District Council called in 1977 \\"the area's serious unemployment problem\\". In August 1983, a major boilover fire at the Amoco Refinery required 150 firemen, 50 fire engines and two days to extinguish.Amoco Refinery Fire 1983 www.fireservice.co.uk, accessed 07.04.16Boilover of a crude oil tank ARIA Article 6077, French Ministry of Environment, accessed 07.04.16 In 1984, a serious explosion on a tanker being repaired in the Haven resulted in three fatalities.British Tanker's Blasts Kill Three Sarasota Herald Tribune, 16.06.84 In 1996 the area hit the headlines internationally when the oil tanker Sea Empress ran aground, causing a substantial oil spill. Etymology Milford Haven is an Anglicization of an old Scandinavian name Melrfjordr that was first applied to the waterway - the Old Norse Melr, meaning sandbank, and fjordr, meaning inlet, developing into \\"Milford\\"; then later the term \\"Haven\\" was added.BBC Wales \\"What's in a Name?\\": Milford Haven Retrieved 20 January 2010 The town was named Milford after the waterway, and, as with the waterway, Haven was added later - in this case around 1868, when the railway terminus was built. The Welsh for Milford Haven, Aberdaugleddau, refers to the estuary which is the meeting point of the \\"White River Cleddau\\" (Afon Cleddau Wen) and the \\"Black River Cleddau\\" (Afon Cleddau Ddu). The term \\"Aber\\" is associated with the 'pouring out' of a river, hence the description of the two rivers meeting and forming an estuary. Cleddau itself may make reference to the action of a weapon or tool cutting through the land. From the 1970s onward, the term \\"Milffwrd\\" can be occasionally heard, having even appeared on tourist maps.

The hagiographical material asserts that he came to Cornwall from Ireland in the company of Breage and six others, but this is attested late. A chapel at Porthleven in Sithney parish, Cornwall, dedicated to Elwen, existed from the 13th century until 1549, and in Brittany several sites and placenames are associated with possibly related figures. History The name St Elvan is attached to a chapel at Porthleven in Sithney recorded as early as 1270.Orme, p. 112. This chapel was rebuilt c. 1510 but was destroyed in 1549.Cornish Church Guide (1925). Truro: Blackford; p. 185 Elwen appears in John Leland's extracts from a lost late-medieval Life of Saint Breage included in his Itinerary.

The text also refers to a Life of St Elwinus, evidently a lost hagiography of Elwin. A few medieval and early modern Cornish sources mention Elwen and his chapel, but little else is known of him there. One document mentions him in connection to an otherwise unknown Saint Gelvin, though this may be based on a mistake or a fraud.Orme, p. 124. In Brittany two apparently distinct saints with corresponding names are known. A Saint Elouan is said to have had his chapel at Saint-Guen, and to have been buried there, while a Saint Elven gave his name to the commune of Elven, Morbihan. It is unknown which, if either, may be identified with the Cornish Elwen. In modern times a Church of St Elwyn has been established at Hayle, probably inspired by the legend recorded in Leland's work that Elwen and company had landed there from Ireland.

Originally intending it in 1709 for country habitation, Peter the Great sought to expand the property as a result of his visit to the French royal court in 1717, inspiring the nickname of \\"The Russian Versailles\\". The architect between 1714 and 1728 was Domenico Trezzini, and the style he employed became the foundation for the Petrine Baroque style favored throughout Saint Petersburg. Also in 1714, Jean- Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond, likely chosen due to his previous collaborations with Versailles landscaper Andr√© Le N√¥tre, designed the gardens. Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli completed an expansion from 1747 to 1756 for Elizabeth of Russia. The palace-ensemble along with the city center is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Construction  The end of the Great Northern War resulted in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, ceding much of the Swedish Empire's claim to the Baltic Sea to the rising Tsardom of Russia. Peter the Great already began construction of his new capital St Petersburg in 1703 after successfully capturing Swedish provinces on the eastern coast. This strategic location allowed Russian access to the Baltic Sea through the Neva River that flowed to the Gulf of Finland. The island of Kotlin and its fortress Kronstadt northeast of St Petersburg provided a gateway and commercial harbor access owing to the shallowness of water closer to the city. Throughout the early 18th century, Peter the Great built and expanded the Peterhof Palace complex as a part of his goal to modernize and westernize Russia.  Monplaisir Palace (1714‚Äì1723)  Aerial view of Monplaisir Palace and gardens In 1714, Peter began construction of the Monplaisir Palace (French: \\"my delight\\") based on his own sketches. He \\"—Åhalked out not only the site but also the inside layout, some elements of the decorative finish, etc\\". Based in a Dutch style, this was Peter's summer retreat (not to be confused with his Summer Palace) that he would use on his way coming and going from Europe through the harbour at Kronstadt. On the walls of this seacoast palace hung hundreds of paintings that Peter brought from Europe and allowed to weather Russian winters and the dampness of the sea without heat. In the seaward corner of his Monplaisir Palace, Peter made his Maritime Study, from which he could see Kronstadt Island to the left and St. Petersburg to the right. Later, he expanded his plans to include a vaster royal ch√¢teau of palaces and gardens further inland, on the model of Versailles which would become Peterhof Palace. The initial design of the palace and its garden was done by the French architect Jean-Baptiste Le Blond.R.K. Massie, Peter the Great: His life and world (New York: Ballantine Books, 1986), p. 631. Layout The dominant natural feature of Peterhof is a 16-m-high bluff lying less than 100 m from the shore. The so-called Lower Gardens (Nizhny Sad), at 1.02 km¬≤ comprising the better part of Peterhof's land area, are confined between this bluff and the shore, stretching east and west for roughly 200 m. The majority of Peterhof's fountains are contained here, as are several small palaces and outbuildings. East of the Lower Gardens lies the Alexandria Park with 19th-century Gothic Revival structures such as the Kapella. Atop the bluff, near the middle of the Lower Gardens, stands the Grand Palace (Bolshoi Dvorets). Behind (south) of it are the comparatively small Upper Gardens (Verhnyy Sad). Upon the bluff's face below the palace is the Grand Cascade (Bolshoi Kaskad). This and the Grand Palace are the centrepiece of the entire complex. At its foot begins the Sea Channel (Morskoi Kanal), one of the most extensive waterworks of the Baroque period, which bisects the Lower Gardens. The Grand Cascade and Samson Fountain Peterhof: the Samson Fountain and Sea Channel. The Grand Cascade is modelled on one constructed for Louis XIV at his Ch√¢teau de Marly, which is likewise memorialised in one of the park's outbuildings. At the centre of the cascade is an artificial grotto with two stories, faced inside and out with hewn brown stone. It currently contains a modest museum of the fountains' history. One of the exhibits is a table carrying a bowl of (artificial) fruit, a replica of a similar table built under Peter's direction. The table is rigged with jets of water that soak visitors when they reach for the fruit, a feature from Mannerist gardens that remained popular in Germany. The grotto is connected to the palace above and behind by a hidden corridor. The fountains of the Grand Cascade are located below the grotto and on either side of it. There are 64 fountains. Their waters flow into a semicircular pool, the terminus of the fountain-lined Sea Channel. In the 1730s, the large Samson Fountain was placed in this pool. It depicts the moment when Samson tears open the jaws of a lion, representing Russia's victory over Sweden in the Great Northern War, and is doubly symbolic. The lion is an element of the Swedish coat of arms, and one of the great victories of the war was won on St Sampson's Day. From the lion's mouth shoots a -high vertical jet of water, the highest in all of Peterhof. This masterpiece by Mikhail Kozlovsky was looted by the invading Germans during the Second World War; see History below. A replica of the statue was installed in 1947. Perhaps the greatest technological achievement of Peterhof is that all of the fountains operate without the use of pumps. Water is supplied from natural springs and collects in reservoirs in the Upper Gardens. The elevation difference creates the pressure that drives most of the fountains of the Lower Gardens, including the Grand Cascade. The Samson Fountain is supplied by a special aqueduct, over in length, drawing water and pressure from a high- elevation source. The Lower Gardens A garden area. The expanse of the Lower Gardens is designed in the formal style of French formal gardens of the 17th century. Although many trees are overgrown, in recent years the formal clipping along the many allees has resumed in order to restore the original appearance of the garden. The many fountains located here exhibit an unusual degree of creativity. One of the most notable designs is entitled 'The Sun'. A disk radiating water jets from its edge creates an image of the sun's rays, and the whole structure rotates about a vertical axis so that the direction in which the \\"sun\\" faces is constantly changing. The same bluff that provides a setting for the Grand Cascade houses two other, very different cascades. West of the Grand Palace is the Golden Mountain (–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞—è –ì–æ—Ä–∞), decorated with marble statuary that contrasts with the riotous gilded figures of the Grand Cascade. To the east is the Chess Mountain (–®–∞—Ö–º–∞—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ì–æ—Ä–∞), a broad chute whose surface is tiled black and white like a chessboard. The most prominently positioned fountains of Peterhof are 'Adam' and 'Eve'. They occupy symmetric positions on either side of the Sea Channel, each at the conjunction of eight paths. The Grand Palace French style interior The largest of Peterhof's palaces looks truly imposing when seen from the Lower or Upper Gardens, but in fact it is quite narrow and not overly large. Of its approximately thirty rooms, several deserve mention. The Chesma Hall is decorated with twelve large paintings of the Battle of Chesma, a stunning naval victory of the Russo- Turkish War, 1768-1774. These were painted between 1771 and 1773 by the German artist Jacob Philipp Hackert. His first renderings of the great battle scenes were criticised by witnesses as not showing realistically the effect of exploding ships -- the flying timbers, great flames, smoke, and fireballs. Catherine II assisted the artist by exploding a frigate in the harbour of Livorno, Italy, for the benefit of Hackert, who had never seen a naval battle first-hand. Hackert also did not research the actual positions of the Russian and Turkish forces during the battle, so the scenes depicted are somewhat fanciful, but do effectively convey drama and destruction of naval warfare. The East and West Chinese Cabinets were decorated between 1766 and 1769 to exhibit objects of decorative art imported from the East. The walls were decorated with imitation Oriental patterns by Russian craftsmen, and hung with Chinese landscape paintings in yellow and black lacquer. Another room, positioned at the centre of the palace, bears the name of the Picture Hall. Its walls are almost entirely covered by a series of 368 paintings, mostly of variously dressed women, differing in appearance and even age, yet most were drawn from a single model. These were purchased in 1764 from the widow of the Italian artist P. Rotari, who died in St. Petersburg. Other features The Grand Palace is not the only historic royal building in Peterhof. The palaces of Monplaisir and Marli, as well as the pavilion known as the 'Hermitage', were all raised during the initial construction of Peterhof during the reign of Peter the Great. The Lower Gardens also contain a large greenhouse, and in the Alexandrine Park stands the palace of Nicholas I. Like the Lower Gardens, the Upper Gardens contain many fountains, distributed among seven broad pools. The landscaping, though, is entirely different; unlike the Lower Gardens (which are strictly geometric), the Upper Gardens are not. A few of the fountains have curious sculptures. History=1705-1755 The Ozerki Pavilion (1840s), by Yegor Meyer In the early 1700s, the original Peterhof appeared quite different from today. Many of the fountains had not yet been installed and the entire Alexandrine Park and Upper Gardens did not exist. What is now the Upper Gardens was used to grow vegetables, and its ponds, then numbering only three, for fish. The Samson Fountain and its massive pedestal had not yet been installed in the Sea Channel, and the channel itself was used as a grand marine entrance into the complex.Olgin Pond (1840s), by Yegor Meyer Perhaps the most important change augmenting Peter's design was the elevation of the Grand Palace to central status and prominence. The Grand Palace was originally called simply 'Upper', and was hardly larger than any of the other structures of the complex. The addition of wings, undertaken between 1745 and 1755, was one of the many projects commissioned from the Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli by Elizabeth of Russia. Likewise, the Grand Cascade was more sparsely decorated when initially built. The augmentation of Peterhof's original fountains and the addition of new ones continued well into the 19th century. 1941-Modern Day Peterhof, like Tsarskoye Selo, was captured by German troops in 1941 and held until 1944. In the few months that elapsed between the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the appearance of the German Army, employees were only able to save a portion of the treasures of the palaces and fountains. An attempt was made to dismantle and bury the fountain sculptures, but three quarters, including all of the largest ones, remained in place. Monument of the naval landing in Lower Gardens of Peterhof near the pier. On 23 September 1941 German troops captured Peterhof. Two weeks later, on 5 October 1941, Soviet troops tried to recapture the town and block the highway by naval landing. 510 marines of the Soviet Baltic Fleet landed on the beach of the neighboring park of Alexandria but faced a heavy fire from the Germans. The commander of the operation was killed, all landing troops became disorganised, one landing craft was sunk and another one missed. Despite Soviet attempts to cover the landing forces by coastal artillery from Kronstadt, they were quickly suspended because of lack of connection with the landing troops. Evacuation attempts also failed due to heavy German artillery shelling (only one marine was picked up from the water). The Peterhof landing operation failed and all landing troops were cut off from the shore and surrounded. Some of them reached the Lower Gardens and fought until the bitter end, including hand-to-hand combat. The last pockets of resistance were destroyed on 7 October. Several dozen German Shepherd dogs were released into the gardens to find the hiding marines. Many of the wounded marines were bitten to death and several were captured.http://centralsector.narod.ru/misc/desc/desc5.htm –ö–æ–ª—å—Ü–æ–≤ –Æ. –í. –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–≥–æ—Ñ—Å–∫–∏–π –¥–µ—Å–∞–Ω—Ç. –°–ø–±.:–ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ-–ø–æ–ª–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å ¬´–ì–∞–Ω–≥—É—Ç¬ª, 2010. In 1980 a memorial was erected near the pier of the Lower Gardens. The occupying forces of the German Army largely destroyed Peterhof. Many of the fountains were destroyed, and the palace was partially exploded and left to burn. Restoration work began almost immediately after the end of the war and continues to this day. The Lower Park was reopened to the public in 1945. The name was changed to \\"Petrodvorets\\" (\\"Peter's Palace\\") in 1944 as a result of wartime anti-German sentiment and propaganda, but the original name was restored in 1997 by the post-Soviet government of Russia. In 2003, Saint Petersburg celebrated its 300th anniversary. As a result, much of the building and statuary in Peterhof has been restored and new gilt-work abounds. The \\"purpose\\" of Peterhof was as a celebration and claim to access to the Baltic (while simultaneously, Peter the Great was also expanding on the Black Sea littoral). Thus Peterhof commemorates the imperial expansion (and modernization of Russia). Inside the Peterhof there are many paintings of sea battles by the famous Ivan Aivazovsky.

He is known for financing the Stockton to Darlington Railway. He was married to the Quaker preacher Hannah Chapman Backhouse. Biography Backhouse was born on 19 January 1779 to Jonathan Backhouse (1747‚Äì1826) and his wife Ann (1746‚Äì1826) daughter of Edward Pease (1711‚Äì1785) of Darlington. After his father died, Backhouse took over what was to become Backhouse's Bank. In 1811 he married Hannah Chapman GurneyW.H.Auden Family Ghosts , Stanford University, accessed January 2010 who had connection to several important Quaker families. Backhouse was involved with financing the Stockton and Darlington Railway. He raised ¬£125,000. Twenty thousand pounds were from his own resources and the largest contribution of ¬£80,000 came from his Quaker banker contacts. A story is told that when the Earl of Darlington's plot to bankrupt the Backhouse bank was discovered, Backhouse went to London to obtain gold to provide additional and urgent collateral. The plot was due to the Earl's anger that the new railway, financed by Backhouses's bank, was causing problems with the Earl's fox hunting. Backhouse was racing back to Darlington when he lost a wheel. It is said that he was able to continue the journey by moving the gold so that the chaise was still balanced and he was able to complete the journey with the wheel still missing.M. W. Kirby, ‚ÄòBackhouse, Jonathan (1779‚Äì1842)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 Jan 2010 Backhouse gave up banking in 1833 in order that he could concentrate on his Quaker ministry. He went to America with his wife where Hannah Chapman Backhouse toured and preached, although Backhouse had to return twice to the UK. Hannah travelled with Eliza MacBride (later Gurney) preaching in the southern states. She was shocked to see slave dealers travelling with their wares along the road. Hannah returned in 1935 and she would continue to preach in the UK for another ten years.

It was built in 1813 by Agatha Terrell Dicks, widow of Windsor chair-maker William Dicks. Agatha was the daughter of noted Lynchburg-area Quakers Micajah Terrell and Sarah Lynch. On August 6, 1812, Agatha Dicks' uncle John Lynch (Lynchburg's Founder) sold half-acre Lot Number 175 to Agatha for $1.00. History The dwelling that was built on the property is a -story three-bay Federal-style house. It is constructed of brick laid in three course American Bond, and is covered with a side-gable slate roof. First floor windows are six-over-nine double-hung sash, and upper-story windows are six-over-six double-hung sash. A pair of four-pane casement sash flank the chimney at the third, or garret, level. The front entrance is located in the middle bay, which is somewhat unusual for Lynchburg houses of the period. The six-panel door is accessed by a small frame porch that was constructed in the early 21st century. A -story, gable-roofed frame addition (built c. 2000) projects from the rear of the house, and a 2-story porch occupies the remainder of the rear facade. A small 1-story shed-rood addition projects from the northwestern elevation. According to insurance maps and physical evidence, the house originally had a -story, gable-roofed brick wing on this elevation. This wing was demolished in the early 20th century. A -story frame outbuilding dating to the early 21st century is located in the northwestern corner of the lot, which now measures approximately 1/12 of an acre.Architectural description by W. Scott Smith, Principal, HistoryTech, LLC While uncommon for three-bay houses of the period in Lynchburg, the interior floor plan is remarkably similar to plans of houses found in the Quaker communities surrounding Guilford County, North Carolina (William Dicks' home). Visitors entering through the front door immediately enter the primary chamber of the first floor, rather than a hallway or antechamber. A smaller room is accessed via a small hallway in the northeastern corner of the house. This hallway also contains a switchback winding staircase that serves all three floor levels. Combined with the wing that was demolished in the early 20th century, the house exhibited a modified three-cell plan that was typical for Quaker-built dwellings of the period. Trim details in the house are relatively spartan, and typically display Roman, rather than Greek, ovolo profiles. In 1814, Agatha Dicks sold the house to Peter Elliott, a builder from Richmond. Dicks then traveled with her children to Ohio to flee the slaveholding state of Virginia. In 1815, she married noted Quaker missionary Isaac Harvey. She died in 1828 and is buried at the Old Springfield Friends Meeting House in Wilmington, Ohio. Peter Elliott (1774‚Äì1863) was born in Gloucester County, Virginia. In the early 1790s, he moved to Richmond and began working for William McKim, a carpenter. In 1794, he served as a private in Captain John Stewart's Company, Major George Benn's Battalion, Colonel William Campbell's Regiment of Virginia Militia during the Whiskey Rebellion. In 1814, he moved to Lynchburg where he continued his profession of carpentry and building. In 1824, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky and added the blacksmith's trade to his repertoire. Around 1849, he moved to Evansville, Indiana to live with one of his sons, Joseph Peter Elliott. Peter Elliott died in Evansville, Indiana in 1863. A partial list of subsequent owners of the house includes Irish tobacconist James V. Knight (from 1836‚Äì1858), merchant John T. Murrill and family (from 1858‚Äì1891), and WWII (in the 1950s). The house was rental property from 1891‚Äì1952, and the family of Arthur Walkup occupied the house from about 1918‚Äì1943.

It is not connected to the London conservatoire with the same name, which was founded in 1822.

The brothers Prospero and Pietro Castrucci as well as Johan Helmich Roman and John Jones were violinists.Grano, John Baptist and Ginger, John. Handel's trumpeter: the diary of John Grano, p. 13-14. Pendragon Press, 1998. Bononcini was a cellist, he and Handel presumably accompanied the recitatives in all the operas.Dean, W. & M. Knapp, p. 307. Filippo Amadei, one of the composers of Muzio Scevola, also played cello, Pietro Giuseppe Sandoni, who would soon marry Francesca Cuzzoni, was the second harpsichord player. John Baptist Grano was the trumpeter, John Festing played oboe; Charles Frederick Weideman was the flautist and oboist and is also known from his appearance in The Enraged Musician. The first opera staged by the Academy was Numitore composed by Giovanni Porta, the second was Radamisto by Handel and the third Narciso by Domenico Scarlatti. Operas and singers A caricature of Margherita Durastanti, drawn while she was prima donna at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, Venice, between 1709 and 1712. Senesino, , engaged by the Academy for as long as possible. Extravagant fees were offered to entice the best performers from Italy. For Margherita Durastanti in the role of Radamisto, Handel wrote one of his favourite arias, Ombra cara di mia sposa. The great singers who were to be the brightest stars of the Royal Academy during the next few years, such as the castrato Senesino and the soprano Francesca Cuzzoni, had not yet arrived in London. Senesino had obligations to fulfill and arrived in September 1720, accompanied by a group of outstanding singers: the castrato Matteo Berselli, the soprano Maddalena Salvai and the bass Giuseppe Boschi. Handel used the libretto of Teofane for his Ottone, with Cuzzoni as prima donna. It became his most successful opera in the years of the Academy. In 1724 and 1725 Handel wrote several masterpieces: Giulio Cesare, (1724) with many da capo arias that became famous, and Anastasia Robinson as Cornelia. Not a castrato but a tenor, Francesco Borosini, sang the leading role of Bajazet in Handel's most powerfully tragic opera Tamerlano (also 1724). Insisting on adding the death of Bajazet he had a direct role in shaping the climax of the work. Charles Burney called the prison scene's \\"Chi di voi\\" in Rodelinda (1725) \\"one of the finest pathetic airs that can be found in all [Handel's] works.\\" Eventually Bononcini was dismissed, and went into private service, Robinson retired and Joseph Goupy may have been employed as a scene-painter. In February 1726 Handel revived his Ottone, which had been spectacularly successful at its first performances in 1723 and was again a hit at its revival, with a London newspaper reporting Francesca Cuzzoni (1696‚Äì1778). As the newspaper notes, full houses were by no means a regular occurrence by that time, and the directors of the Royal Academy of Music decided to increase audiences' interest by bringing another celebrated international opera star, Italian soprano Faustina Bordoni, to join established London favourites Francesca Cuzzoni and the star castrato Senesino in the company's performances. Many opera companies in Italy featured two leading ladies in one opera and Faustina (as she was known) and Cuzzoni had appeared together in opera performances in various European cities with no trouble; there is no indication that there was any bad feeling or ill-will between the two of them prior to their London joint appearances. The three stars, Bordoni, Cuzzoni and Senesino commanded astronomical fees, making much more money from the opera seasons than Handel did. The opera company would have been aware that the story of the two princesses in love with Alexander the Great chosen for the two prima donnas' first joint appearance in Handel's Alessandro was familiar to London audiences through a tragedy by Nathaniel Lee, The Rival Queens, or the Death of Alexander the Great, first performed in 1677 and often revived and it may be that they were encouraging the idea that the two singers were rivals. One of the agents who had arranged Faustina's appearances in London, Owen Swiny, explicitly warned against the choice of libretto as likely to cause \\"disorder\\" in a letter to the directors of the Royal Academy of Music, imploring them: The performances of Alessandro went off with no signs of animosity between Bordoni and Cuzzoni or their respective supporters, but it was not very long after that tension between the two erupted. As 18th century musicologist Charles Burney observed about the Cuzzoni / Faustina rivalry: Handel's next opera, Admeto, again with roles for both sopranos, was well-received and had nineteen performances in its initial run, a mark of success for those times. Faustina Bordoni (1697‚Äì1781). Many audience members were extremely enthusiastic about the singers. At the conclusion of one of Cuzzoni's arias at a performance of the original run, a man in the gallery called out \\"Damn her: she has got a nest of nightingales in her belly\\". However, some members of the London audience had become fiercely partisan in favouring either Bordoni or Cuzzoni and disliking the other and at the performance of Admeto on 4 April 1727 with members of the royal family present,elements of the audience were extremely unruly, hissing and interrupting the performance with cat-calls when the \\"rival\\" to their favourite was performing, causing public scandal. Cuzzoni issued a public apology to the royal family through one of her supporters: These sort of disturbances continued however, climaxing that June in a performance at the Academy of an opera by Giovanni Bononcini,Astianatte. With royalty again present in the person of the Princess of Wales, Cuzzoni and Faustina were onstage together and members of the audience who were supporters of one of the prima donnas were loudly protesting and hissing whenever the other one sang. Actual fist fights broke out in the audience between rival groups of \\"fans\\" and Cuzzoni and Faustina stopped singing, began trading insults and finally came to blows onstage and had to be dragged apart. The British Journal of 10 June reported: The performance was abandoned, creating an enormous scandal reported gleefully in newspapers and pamphlets, satirised in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera of 1728, and tainting the entire reputation of Italian opera in London with disrepute in the eyes of many. The most popular account of the onstage fight between the two prima donnas was The Devil To Pay at St. James's: Or, A Full And True Account of a Most Horrible And Bloody Battle Between Madam Faustina And Madam Cuzzoni, Etc, an anonymous poem in rhyming couplets. Despite this fiasco, both ladies continued to appear together onstage in several more operas presented by the Academy, among them Siroe by Handel, the first time he used a libretto originally by Pietro Metastasio. The Royal Academy of Music collapsed at the end of the 1728 ‚Äì 29 season,partly due to the huge fees paid to the star singers, and Cuzzoni and Faustina both left London for engagements in continental Europe. Handel started a new opera company with a new prima donna, Anna Strada. One of Handel's librettists, Paolo Rolli, wrote in a letter (the original is in Italian) that Handel said that Strada \\"sings better than the two who have left us, because one of them (Faustina) never pleased him at all and he would like to forget the other (Cuzzoni).\\" The death of George I caused the performance of Riccardo Primo to be postponed until the next season and prompted both librettist Paolo Rolli and composer to make significant changes to their work. They decided to give the patriotic drum a good thump by adding gratuitous references to British valour, justice and power.Dean, W. (2006) Handel's Operas 1726‚Äì1741, p. 67. In 1728 John Gay's The Beggar's Opera premiered at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and ran for 62 consecutive performances, the longest run in theatre history up to that time. It marked the beginning of a change in London musical taste and fashion, away from Italian opera in favour of something less highbrow, more home-grown, and more easily intelligible. The 1727‚Äì28 season boasted three new operas, but in 1729 the directors agreed to suspend activity after losing money. Not Handel, he had been the only one on their pay list. He immediately started a New or Second Academy of Music. The Royal Academy produced 461 performances, 235 were works by Handel: 13 operas. Eight operas were by Bononcini (114 performances) and seven operas by Ariosti (54 performances).Dean, W. & M. Knapp, p. 308-309. The New or Second Academy Sosarme, frontispiece to the score, 1732. In 1729 Handel became joint manager of the King's Theatre with the Swiss aristocrat John James Heidegger. Handel travelled to Italy to engage seven new singers. In Bologna he met with Owen Swiny, a former theatre manager from London. Back home he composed seven more operas. On his way back he visited his mother and probably met with Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, sent by his father, as the story goes. Johann Sebastian Bach, working only 20 miles away in K√∂then, arrived too late to meet with his famous colleague, who had left earlier that day.Johann Nikolaus Forkel (1802) √úber Johann Sebastian Bach: Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke, p. 63 (reprint 1950). Back in London Handel produced Ezio, an expensive disaster. Charles Burney ranked the score of his next opera Sosarme among his most pleasing; Dean states the opera does more honour to Handel as a musician than as a dramatist.Dean, W. (2006) \\"Handel's Operas, 1726‚Äì1741\\", p. 215 (The Boydell Press); Winton Dean: \\"Handel's Sosarme, a Puzzle Opera\\", in: Essays on Opera . Handel composed Partenope, Poro, and Orlando, but with mixed success with the public. In the long run Handel failed to compete with the Opera of the Nobility, who had engaged musicians such as Johann Adolf Hasse, Nicolo Porpora and the famous castrato Farinelli. Frederick, Prince of Wales and the anti-German faction of the English nobility who backed the Opera of Nobility sought to gain ground against the German court by attacking the foreigner Handel, little concerned about the paradox of the situation: the nationalistic faction fought with the weapon of the foreign Italian opera and summoned the aid of foreigners such as Hasse, himself an Italianized German like Handel.Bukofzer, M.F. (1948) Music in the Baroque Era. From Monteverdi to Bach, p. 325. Reprint 1983. Handel had composed about 30 operas for the Royal Academy.See the List of operas by Handel, numbers 12 till 42. and moved his productions to Covent Garden. The Opera of the Nobility took over the King's Theatre. The Academy survived until 1734, after which it encountered many difficulties: arguments between Handel and his singers, the dismissal of Paolo Rolli after quarrels with the directors, disagreement between the directors themselves, about the employment of new singers and squabbles on stage, but for all the Academy's problems, its success was enormous.Handel, A Celebration of his life and times, p. 111.

Both were common surnames, originally referring to someone with fair or red hair, respectively, and it may be that the two brothers were distinguished by their surnames as well as by their praenomina.Chase, p. 110. War with Clusium Following the expulsion of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last Roman king in 509 BC, Lars Porsena, the King of Clusium, resolved to conquer Rome, either to restore the Etruscan monarchy, or possibly for himself. The following year he went to war with Rome, and advanced with his army upon the city. After occupying the Janiculum on the west side of the Tiber, the Clusian army approached the Pons Sublicius, a wooden bridge leading into the city. The Roman forces withdrew to the eastern side of the river, as engineers began the work of destroying the bridge's supports. Three Romans remained on the bridge to fend off the Etruscans: Publius Horatius Cocles, Titus Herminius Aquilinus, and Spurius Lartius.Livy, ii. 10.Dionysius, v. 24, 25. Niebuhr suggests a symbolic importance to these three men: each represented one of the three ancient tribes making up the Roman populace: the Ramnes, or Latins, represented by Horatius; the Titienses, or Sabines, represented by Herminius, and the Luceres, or Etruscans, represented by Lartius.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. i, p. 542. The bridge was too narrow for more than a few of the approaching army to advance upon its defenders at once, and according to the legend, they held their ground until the bridge was about to collapse. Horatius then urged his colleagues to retreat to safety, leaving him alone on the bridge. There he remained, fighting off one attacker after another, until the bridge at last gave way and plunged into the river. Horatius then jumped into the river. Accounts vary as to whether Horatius survived and swam to shore, or was drowned in the Tiber; in most accounts he survived, but according to Polybius, he defended the bridge alone, and perished in the river.Valerius Maximus, iii. 2. ¬ß 1.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Poplicola\\", 16.Polybius, vi. 55. Lartius and Herminius appear again in the war with Clusium, commanding troops as part of a trap devised by the consul Publius Valerius Publicola to capture Etruscan raiding parties.Livy, ii. 11. Career Lartius was elected consul for 506 BC, the fourth year of the Republic, with Titus Herminius, his companion on the bridge, as his colleague. No significant events occurred during their year of office.Dionysius, v. 36. Their successors sent a delegation to meet with the envoys of Porsena, and established a treaty, by which the Etruscan King gave up his claims to Rome.Livy, ii. 15. Lartius served as legate under the consul Publius Postumius Tubertus against the Sabines in 505,Dionysius, v. 39.Broughton, vol. I, p. 7. and either he or his brother, Titus, was lieutenant to the consul Publius Valerius Poplicola in 504.Dionysius, v. 41.Broughton, vol. I, p. 8. Lartius was consul for the second time in 490 BC, with Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus.Dionysius, vii. 68.Chronography of 354.Broughton, vol. I, p. 18 (and note 1). In 488, he and Sulpicius were among five consulares sent to treat with Gaius Marcius Coriolanus as he advanced upon Rome.Dionysius, viii. 22.Broughton, vol. I, p. 19. In the following year, Lartius was Praefectus Urbi, or warden of the city.Dionysius, viii. 64.Broughton, vol. I, p. 20. In 482, he was the second of two interreges appointed by the senate to hold the consular elections. Lartius finished holding the comitia that his predecessor, Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, had begun; Sempronius had been unable to finish the elections as the office of interrex was limited to a span of five days.Dionysius, viii. 90.Broughton, vol. I, p. 23. The same year, Lartius advised going to war with the nearby Etruscan city of Veii.Dionysius, viii. 91.

Description The species reaches a maximum length of up to and a weight of up to . A more typical size is and . It is considered one of the largest extant cyprinids (surpassed by the giant barb), and may live for up to at least 17 years. It has a large head, with a toothlees mouth surrounded by four barbels. The silvery body is covered with small scales. There is only one dorsal fin, a pair of pectoral and ventral fins. The anal fin and tail they have yellowish tones. Distribution, habitat and behavior The mangar occurs in the drainage basins of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. Adults keep to larger bodies of water such as large rivers and reservoir, migrating to smaller inflows to spawn. The mangar has been recorded feeding on a wide range of animals, from zooplankton and invertebrate to fish and birds, but also phytoplankton. Fish typically make up about half its food. Conservation The species is currently classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Although no reliable population data are available, reports and catches have declined severely in recent decades, and it is believed that most populations are heavily overfished. Although some locations still show abundant numbers, widespread exploitation as a major target for inland fisheries is considered a cause for concern.

Description The jae barb is a small fish which grows to in length. They have red fins brighter in the males than in the females, while the body is predominantly beige-brown in colour. In addition the females are larger and bulkier than the males. Fish collected from different locations are known to vary in both colour and patterning, for example male fish from the River Nyong basin close to Sombo in Cameroon turn uniform blood red in colour when in breeding while fish collected around Awae, which is also in the Nyong but further upstream, only turn red on the rear half of the body. Individuals collected from other places within Cameroon such as the River Sanaga, River Ntem and River Dja exhibit similar, often subtle, differences. Further south in Gabon individuals have been recorded which have an almost completely grey body colour counterpointed with deep red to black dorsal and ventral fins in mature male fish. Habitat The jae barb lives in slow-moving, shallow, shaded rainforest streams and swamps with dense emergent vegetation. Distribution The jae barb is found from western central Africa from the River Wouri in Cameroon to the River Kouilou-Niari in the Republic of Congo and the River Chiloango basin. It is also found in the lower, middle and upper Congo River basin in Cameroon, Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Biology The jae barb is probably a micropredator feeding mainly on insect larvae and small crustaceans. Conservation status The Jae barb is a widespread species and no major threats have been identified, it has a wide range throughout central Africa and is assessed as Least Concern. Taxonomy The genus Barbus sensu lato contained over 340 putative species and was considered polyphyletic. It was proposed that only the European, Southwest Asian and North African representatives should be included in Barbus sensu stricto with around 20 species and that all of the species of Barbus sensu lato should be allocated to an already existing genus but if no previous genus has been allocated then they should be referred to as \\"Barbus‚Äù on an interim basis.

Instead, he travelled in his youth before meeting Eva Kemeny while in drug rehabilitation in the United States. On 16 October 1992, the couple married. In common with other members of the Rausing family, they settled in London (and Barbados), and donated millions of pounds to charities, in particular those concerned with drug awareness and addiction prevention.

She worked as a freelance writer and photographer on various magazines, books and newspapers, and as a lecturer on photography. Most of her photography was made for her personal interest but she undertook occasional commissions. During her lifetime Baker's photographs were published in two books and exhibited at The Photographers' Gallery, The Lowry and Salford Museum and Art Gallery. Life and work Born in Kersal,in north Salford, Lancashire, Baker was one of identical twins. They moved to Manchester when she was two, and her sister later boarded at Penrhos Girls' School in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, from where they were evacuated during the Second World War to Chatsworth House, in Derbyshire. Baker went on to study photography at Manchester College of Technology, and took other courses at Regent Street Polytechnic in London and the London College of Printing. Later in life she gained an MA in critical history and the theory of photography at the University of Derby in 1995. Baker started working as an industrial photographer for fabric manufacturers Courtaulds before working as freelance, as a photographer for other businesses and as a writer and photographer on various magazines, books and newspapers, including The Guardian. In 1960 she began work as a lecturer at the Salford College of Art. Whilst there, for the next fifteen years, she made candid, unposed, spontaneous photographs of people living in the area in Salford and Manchester during a time of massive slum clearance. She has said she was influenced by the work of Henri Cartier- Bresson, Robert Frank and Garry Winogrand. She also worked as a lecturer at Manchester Polytechnic. Baker had two books of her photographs published during her lifetime. Street Photographs: Manchester and Salford (1989) contains her photographs of people in Salford and Manchester in the 1960s and early 1970s. In the late 1990s she was commissioned by The Lowry to revisit the same places. The Lowry held an exhibition of her work and published a book, Streets and Spaces: Urban Photography ‚Äì Salford and Manchester ‚Äì 1960s‚Äì2000 (2000), with her older photographs juxtaposed against her new photographs, showing people in different periods, in a radically altered urban landscape, yet involved in similar activities. In the 1980s, when Baker's doctor husband's work took them to London for a time, she photographed punks in and around Camden Lock and Camden Market. She also photographed in Japan, New York and the French Riviera. In 1987 she undertook a project on the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital supported by Viewpoint Gallery, Salford. In July and August 1987 she completed a commission to photograph at Manchester Airport for the Documentary Photography Archive (DPA). Baker's work at the airport was featured in a Granada Television programme on the work of the DPA and broadcast as part of its \\"Celebration\\" series on 23 October 1987.

Ainslie is an American psychiatrist, psychologist and behavioral economist. Unusual for a psychiatrist, Ainslie undertook experimental animal research in operant conditioning, under the guidance of Howard Rachlin. He investigated inter-temporal choice in pigeons, and was the first to demonstrate experimentally the phenomenon of preference reversal in favor of the more immediate outcomes as the choice point between two options, one delivered sooner than the other, is moved forward in time. He explained this in terms of hyperbolic discounting of future rewards, derived from ideas that Rachlin and others had developed from Richard Herrnstein's matching law. Ainslie then integrated these ideas with earlier experimental and theoretical work on inter-temporal choice, for example the studies of Walter Mischel on delay of gratification in children. In his book Picoeconomics (1992) he attempted to account for these ideas, and also facts about addiction that he was concerned with from his clinical work at the Veteran Administration Medical Center, Coatesville, Pennsylvania (where he rose to become chief psychiatrist),Elster, J. (Ed) (1999). Addiction: Entries and Exits. New York: Russell Sage Foundation (see Notes on Contributors). by supposing that different parts or aspects of the personality are in conflict with one another. He grounded this idea in the Freudian theory of id, ego and superego; it became important in behavioral economics in the form of Richard Thaler's \\"multiple selves\\" theory of saving behavior. Many of Ainslie's ideas have proved to be foundational within behavioral economics, and his work (along with that of Drazen Prelec) formed a key conduit by which ideas and data from operant conditioning joined the current of work on decision making to challenge the rational choice theory that had dominated economic thinking. In addition to his work at the Veterans Administration, Ainslie has held a position as a Clinical Professor at Temple University in Philadelphia Picoeconomics Picoeconomics is a term used by George Ainslie in order to describe the different implications of an experimental discovery: the tendency for people to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs, where the tendency increases the closer to the present both payoffs are. Given two similar rewards, humans show a preference for one that arrives sooner rather than later. Humans are said to discount the value of the later reward, by a factor that increases with the length of the delay. Just as classical economics describes negotiation for limited resources among institutions, and microeconomics describes such negotiation among individuals, so picoeconomics describes interactions that resemble negotiation among parts that can be defined within the individual for control of that individual's finite behavioral capacity. A large number of experiments have confirmed that spontaneous preferences by both human and nonhuman subjects follow a hyperbolic curve rather than the conventional, exponential curve that would produce consistent choice over time.Ainslie, G. (1992). Picoeconomics: The Strategic Interaction of Successive Motivational States Within the Person. New York: Cambridge University Press. For instance, when offered the choice between $50 now and $100 a year from now, many people will choose the immediate $50. However, given the choice between $50 in five years or $100 in six years almost everyone will choose $100 in six years, even though that is the same choice seen at five years‚Äô greater distance.

Description The papermouth has a silvery body with orange coloured fins. The dorsal fin is serrated and its scales are marked with radial striations. It grows to a maximum length of 40 cm and a weight of 1.4 kg. The mouth is positioned terminally. It has a protractile mouth. Distribution The papermouth is found in southern and central Africa from the Congo Basin through Angola south to the Limpopo, including the upper Zambezi. It can also be found in artificial impoundments in southern Africa. Biology The papermouth is a benthopelagic, potamodromous fish which occurs naturally in the larger pools of perennial rivers, which are cooler than the shallows. It is common in artificial lakes such as reservoirs and farm dams and is often introduced into these. It is an actively predatory species, feeding on small planktonic crustaceans and insects when it is juvenile and preying on small fish when adult. It will also feed on the seeds of water lilies, algae and aquatic plants. In turn, the papermouth is a prey species for birds, otters, large catfish and larger conspecifics. After the first summer rains, the papermouth migrates upstream in the flooded rivers to spawn. This species matures at three years old and the oldest recorded fish was 9 years old. Human interactions The papermouth is and aggressive fish and this makes it a popular target for anglers and fly fishers and is harvested for human consumption. In some parts of its range it is thought to be declining, but the IUCN class the species as being of \\"Least Concern\\", although they note that there are potential threats from pollution and overfishing. Taxonomy The name Barbus mattozi was originally applied to specimens taken from the Cuanza and Cunene in Angola and Namibia. The specimens taken in the Limpopo were named as Barbus rapax. The status of the papermouth in the Zambezi, where it is a rare species, is uncertain, the species has been widely introduced to dams in Zimbabwe and the specimens taken in the Zambezi may be escapes from these artificially stocked populations. Some authorities, therefore, consider that Enteromius mattozi and Enteromius rapax should be treated as separate species.

Thereafter, he reeled off an even dozen triumphs over enemy planes; all but one were over enemy fighters. His final tally was a balloon and ten airplanes destroyed, four of which were shared, and four enemy airplanes driven down out of control. Honors and awards Distinguished Flying Cross Lieut. (A.

Rome was once the world's main epicentres of Classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. The Romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Rome's cityscape is also widely Neoclassical and Fascist in style. Ancient Rome The Colosseum During the Roman Republic, most Roman buildings were made of concrete and bricks, but ever since about 100 BC and the Roman Empire, marble and gold were more widely used as decoration themes in the architecture of Rome, especially in temples, palaces, fora and public buildings in general. Most buildings, just like in Classical Athens, had caryatids and atlantes supporting balconies or structures, mainly representing standing women or muscular men. The caryatids found in ancient Roman architecture were mainly copies of the Greek ones, just like in the Forum of Augustus. Roman temples were usually built on a high podium. They had a portico and a triangular pediment above columns. Romans mainly utilized the Greek classical orders, but also created a new Composite order, which was used in the Arch of Titus. Domes, vaults, aediculae (small shrines designed as small temples) and coffers were also popular elements of Classical and Imperial Roman architecture. The Colosseum is the most prominent example of ancient Roman architecture, but also the Roman Forum, the Domus Aurea, the Pantheon, Trajan's Column, Trajan's Market, the Catacombs, the Circus Maximus, the Baths of Caracalla, Castel Sant'Angelo, the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Ara Pacis, the Arch of Constantine, the Pyramid of Cestius, and the Bocca della Verit√† are renowned ancient monuments. Romanesque Cosmatesque pavement in the Basilica of Saint Praxedes Rome has a rich and diverse Romanesque heritage. Many of the first Christian churches in the world were constructed in Rome, and Byzantine churches were mainly based on the Roman basilica. They were often oblong or geometric, with three naves and full of rich golden mosaics. Later Romanesque churches in Rome were more round, using the Roman arch. Examples of buildings from this period include the Torre delle Milizie, the Torre dei Conti, and the churches of Santi Quattro Coronati, Santa Prassede, Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Elaborate tabernacles were popular especially in the 13th century, and basilicas were often full of rich mosaics. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Cosmati family was famous for their mosaics and elegant decoration. They created beautiful marble floors with mosaics, often with inlays of green and red porphyry. Their designs in Rome became so popular that they were known as Cosmatesque. Renaissance Rome is widely regarded as being the second Renaissance capital of Italy after Florence, and was one of the most important architectural and cultural centres of the time. It derived its main designs from the Classical models. Loggias, or open-sided galleries, were fashionable, and palaces, or palazzi often had rusticated blocks decorating the grand entrances to their houses. In churches, especially in St. Peter's Basilica, baldacchini or column-supported canopies, were widely used. Examples include the Palazzo del Quirinale (now seat of the President of the Italian Republic), the Palazzo Venezia, the Palazzo Farnese, the Palazzo Barberini, the Palazzo Chigi (now seat of the Italian Prime Minister), the Palazzo Spada, the Palazzo della Cancelleria, and the Villa Farnesina. The St. Peter's Basilica Baroque Rome is widely regarded as being the epicentre of Baroque architecture, and was profoundly influenced by the movement. Roman baroque architecture was widely based on Classical symmetry, but broke many of the architectural rules, creating a far richer and more elaborate style, preferring grandiosity and opulence rather than Renaissance classicism and elegance. Putti, or child cupids and cherubs, were popular in Baroque architectural design. The city is famous for its many huge and majestic Baroque squares (often adorned with obelisks), many of which were built in the 17th century. The principal squares are St. Peter's Square, Piazza Navona, Piazza di Spagna, Campo de' Fiori, Piazza Venezia, Piazza Farnese and Piazza della Minerva. One of the most emblematic Baroque structure is the Trevi Fountain by Nicola Salvi. Notable 17th-century Baroque palaces are the Palazzo Madama, now the seat of the Italian Senate and the Palazzo Montecitorio, now the seat of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy. Neoclassical Rome Altare della Patria, the best-known symbol of Roman neoclassical architecture In 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new Kingdom of Italy. During this time, neoclassicism, a building style influenced by the architecture of classical antiquity, became a predominant influence in Roman architecture. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best- known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the Victor Emmanuel II Monument, or \\"Altare della Patria\\", where the Grave of the Unknown Soldier that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located. Fascist architecture EUR, Rome, Guglielmo Marconi square The Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 developed an architectural style that was characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. The most important Fascist site in Rome is the E.U.R district, designed in 1938 by Marcello Piacentini. It was originally conceived for the 1942 world exhibition, and was called \\"E.42\\" (\\"Esposizione 42\\"). The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940. The most representative building of the Fascist style at E.U.R. is the Palazzo della Civilt√† Italiana (1938‚Äì1943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic or Square Colosseum. After World War II, the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning (London Docklands and La D√©fense in Paris). The Palazzo della Farnesina, the current seat of Italian Foreign Ministry, was also designed in 1935 in Fascist style.

One of the particular focuses of her work was on how rape and rape culture is used as a political weapon, and was not considered a criminal offense in Haiti until 2005.  Early life  Merlet was born in Les Cayes, Haiti. Merlet was the second youngest of six siblings: an older brother and four sisters. In the 1970s, Merlet left Haiti, growing up in France and Italy. In 1975, Merlet moved to Montreal, Canada, where she lived for eleven years. In 1985, while living abroad, she received her M. Sc. in Economics from University of Quebec at Montreal. While at the University of Quebec, she studied women's issues, political sociology, and feminist theory.  Career  In July 1986, six months after the end of the Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship, Merlet returned to Haiti at the age of 29. She wrote a personal essay entitled \\"The More People Dream\\" in the collection Walking on Fire: Haitian Women's Stories of Survival and Resistance, where she described her struggles for identity as a Haitian woman living in exile and her desire and decision to be part of the solution, which was part of her motivation to return to Haiti. Merlet worked to raise the profile of women in Haiti and abroad, founding EnfoFanm, an organization that raises awareness about the challenges facing women in Haiti, and campaigning for several Haitian streets to be named after women. In 2001 Merlet reached out to Eve Ensler in an effort to bring The Vagina Monologues to Haiti. In 2007, Ensler visited Haiti and performances were held in Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitian. Vagina Monologue founder, Eve Ensler, wrote a 2011 spotlight monologue entitled \\"Myriam\\" as a tribute and rallying cry to the work that Myriam accomplished in Haiti. The monologue describes how Eve called her friend's cellphone, \\"believing the ring would find you and wake you, your cell gripped in your buried hand.\\" Merlet participated in the creation and was a longtime spokeswoman for the Coordination Nationale pour le Plaidoyer des Femmes (CONAP), for which she famously battled against sexism in the publicity industry, especially on billboards. Merlet also played a key role, with other Haitian feminists and members of the government, in helping change the Haitian legal status of rape. Until a new law was pass in 2005, rape was not considered a crime in Haiti, but a public decency offence. From 2006 to 2008, Merlet was Chief of Staff of Haiti's Ministry for Gender and the Rights of Women (Minist√®re a la Condition Feminine et aux Droits des Femmes (MCFDF)), and continued as an advisor until her death in 2010. In 2010, Merlet participated in V-Day's 10-year anniversary, V TO THE TENTH, at the Superdome in New Orleans, where she participated in the parade and gave a talk at the Superlove event called \\"Power to the Women of Haiti\\" with fellow activists Elvire Eugene and Ann Val√©rie Timothee Milfort. Merlet also led a campaign to name streets after famous Haitian women.  Personal life  In 2010, Merlet died in the Paco neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as a result of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. After the earthquake, it was reported that she was able to respond and ask for help via mobile phone but rescue was unsuccessful. She was later found trapped in the collapse of her home.

British troop transport ships were bombed by the Argentine Air Force (FAA) whilst unloading, with significant damage and casualties. Background By 1 June, British forces on the Falkland Islands were bolstered by the arrival of 5,000 new troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade. Major General Jeremy Moore now had sufficient force to start planning a full-scale assault on Port Stanley. Advance parties of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment moved forward and occupied Fitzroy and Bluff Cove, when it was discovered to be clear of Argentine forces. Units of the Welsh Guards and Scots Guards were to be sent in to support them. After the sinking of the transport Atlantic Conveyor there was only one British heavy-lift helicopter available, an RAF CH-47 Chinook, Bravo November.McCann, Carol and Pigeau, Ross (2000). The human in command: exploring the modern military experience. Springer, p. 59. Therefore, supplies and reinforcements would have to be transported by ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary,Bolia, p. 68 which were manned by civilian sailors. Air strikes While unloading on 8 June, the British ships were attacked by two waves of A-4 Skyhawks from the Argentine Air Force's 5th Air Brigade, each of them loaded with three 500 lb retarding tail bombs of Spanish design.Moro, Rub√©n Oscar (1985). La guerra inaudita: historia del conflicto del Atl√°ntico Sur. Pleamar, p. 462. . The airstrikes had been called in by Argentine commandos of 602 Commando Company after they spotted the ships from their position on Mount Harriet.http://www.santotodigital.com.ar/2017/03/31/foremny- vamos-a-recuperar-malvinas-aunque-lleve-decadas-o-generaciones/ The fighters departed from R√≠o Gallegos airbase, which at the time was monitored by the British nuclear submarine HMS Splendid.West, Nigel (2010). Historical Dictionary of Naval Intelligence. Scarecrow Press, p. 36. The first package, originally made of eight aircraft, was reduced to five when three Skyhawks returned to base due to refuelling problems.West, p. 38 On their way to Bluff Cove, the package overflew a Scout helicopter from 656 Squadron; the Scout, XR628, was forced to make a hard landing on McPhee Pond. The aircraft was eventually written off. Six Argentine IAI Dagger fighters simultaneously took off from airbase at R√≠o Grande for a complementary mission, led by a Learjet which provided navigation information. One of the Daggers subsequently returned to base due to refueling issues. The attacking aircraft were preceded by four Mirage III fighters which took off from R√≠o Grande airbase to carry out a decoy mission over the north of the islands in order to draw away the British Sea Harriers and allow the Skyhawks and Daggers to carry out their attacks unmolested, while the Argentine destroyer ARA Sant√≠sima Trinidad broadcast interference signals to jam the frequencies used by the Royal Navy's air controllers directing Sea Harrier operations.West, p. 37https://smallwarsjournal.com/documents/bolia1.pdf The nuclear submarine HMS Valiant, on picket duty off R√≠o Grande, was able to track the six Dagger fighters that took off from the airbase there, but the report from the submarine failed to reach the British forces at Bluff Cove.West, p. 39 First strike At approximately 14:00 local time the ships RFA Sir Tristram and RFA Sir Galahad were badly damaged by five A-4Bs of Grupo 5. Three A-4s targeted Sir Galahad, which was hit by three bombs released from the Skyhawk flown by First Lieutenant Carlos Cach√≥n. The second Skyhawk was unable to drop its bombs, and the third overshot the British ship. The remaining two aircraft attacked Sir Tristram, which was struck by two bombs released by package leader Lieutenant Daniel G√°lvez; the bombs of the last A-4 fell short. The explosions and subsequent fires killed 48 men aboard Sir Galahad, of whom 32 were soldiers from the Welsh Guards, 11 were other army personnel, and five were crewmen of the Sir Galahad, among them two Hong Kong Chinese sailors. The attack on Sir Tristram killed two crewmen, both of them Hong Kong Chinese sailors.Casualty Lists of the Royal Navy, 1980‚Äì89 Second strike At 16:50 a second wave, composed by four A-4Bs of Grupo 5 hit and sank the Landing Craft Utility (LCU) Foxtrot-4 from HMS Fearless in Choiseul Sound.Schofield, Frank (1999). The Falklands watcher. Brewin, 114. The landing barge was ferrying the vehicles and communications equipment of the 5th Brigade's headquarters from Darwin to Bluff Cove. Six Royal Marines on board were killed. However, this time the Sea Harrier combat air patrol was already on scene and responded; three Skyhawks were shot down and their pilots, First Lieutenant Danilo Bolzan, Lieutenant Juan Arrar√°s, and Ensign Alfredo Vazquez were killed. Bolzan and Vazquez were shot down by Flight Lieutenant David Morgan while Arrar√°s was shot down by Morgan's wingman, Lieutenant David Smith.Chant, Christopher (2001). Air War in the Falklands 1982. Osprey Publishing, pp. 90-91. The fourth aircraft, which was flown by First Lieutenant H√©ctor S√°nchez, suffered combat damage and lost a large amount of fuel, but returned to the mainland assisted by a KC-130 tanker. A third wave, by A-4Cs of Grupo 4, arrived minutes later and struck ground targets without visible success.Moro, Rub√©n Oscar (2003). La guerra inaudita: historia del conflicto del Atl√°ntico Sur. Buenos Aires: Edivem. . Attack on HMS Plymouth In a separate incident, the frigate HMS Plymouth endured the sudden attack of the Daggers from Rio Grande, which struck her with four 1,000-pound bombs. The warship sustained severe damage, and five crewmen were injured. Although all the bombs were duds, the attack caused the explosion of at least one depth charge on her flight deck.Chun, Clayton K S. (2001). Aerospace power in the twenty-first century: a basic primer. Diane publishing, p. 235. Aftermath A total of 56 British servicemen were killed, and 150 wounded. The incident marked the greatest loss of life among British forces in a single incident since World War II, and accounted for one-fifth of British fatalities in the entire Falklands War. Sir Galahad was damaged beyond repair and scuttled, but her sister ship survived to be re-built post-war. American author Robert Bolia blames the disaster on the use of large LST ships instead of LCUs and other small vessels. BBC television cameras recorded images of Royal Navy helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships. These images were seen around the world. However, General Mario Menendez, commander of Argentine forces on the islands, was told that hundreds of men had been killed. He expected a drop in British morale, and their advance to slacken.Anderson, Duncan (2002). The Falklands War 1982. Volume 15 of Essential histories. Osprey Publishing, p. 61. In fact, the attacks delayed the scheduled British advance on Port Stanley by just two days, and Argentine forces on the Falkland Islands surrendered six days after the incident.https://home.bt.com/news/on-this-day/june-8-1982-56-die-at-bluff- cove-as-argentine-jets-bomb-sir-galahad-and-sir-tristram-11363985293359 According to Brigadier Julian Thompson; Among the wounded was Simon Weston, who later featured in a BBC documentary showing his treatment for the appalling injuries he received. Weston endured 75 operations in 22 years, after 25% of his skin suffered third degree burns. In a subsequent documentary, filmed in Argentina, he met the pilot who bombed his ship, Carlos Cach√≥n, then retired with the rank of Captain. After a later visit of Cach√≥n and his family to Weston's home in Liverpool, they have become great friends.\\"I'm honoured.

Located in northeastern France between √âpinal and Besan√ßon, the primary line was built in the late 19th century to deal with advances in artillery that had made older defensive systems obsolete.  History  Vauban's citadel in Belfort. Belfort has been a fortified place since the Middle Ages, when a castle was built in 1226. After withstanding seven sieges, the medieval fortifications were modernized between 1637 and 1648 by the Comte de la Suze. Vauban added hornworks and a barracks to the castle, and enclosed the city in a new wall according to Vauban's \\"second system.\\" These fortifications successfully resisted a siege in 1815. As armies made greater use of artillery, it became necessary to extend city defenses to keep the enemy sufficiently distant to prevent bombardment of the city from neighboring high ground. The first ring of forts was built at the direction of General Fran√ßois Nicolas Beno√Æt, Baron Haxo, beginning in 1817. The forts of La Miotte, La Justice and the Le Vallon camp were built, and the city walls were improved. Further increases in the range of artillery caused the construction of more forts to the south and east, resulting in Fort Bellevue, Fort des Barres and the Forts des Perches. These forts formed a rough ring about 1200m to 1500m from the town walls. They successfully resisted attack in 1870‚Äì71. Shortly after France's traumatic defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, Belfort, an important road and railway node, and the frontier cities of √âpinal, Toul and Verdun were chosen to constitute the first line of defense against an enemy incursion from the annexed former French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. The fortifications were part of an extensive network of new forts proposed and carried out by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res. The fortified region of Belfort runs between Fort de Giromagny, part of the High Moselle line, and Fort Lachaux of the defensive network of Lomont. The object of the program was to transform the Belfort area into a fortified camp. The fortified camp concept concentrates artillery into permanent forts built around the city, with distances calculated to place enemy artillery out of range of the city, while allowing for mutual support between forts. At the end of the 19th century the fortified camp of Belfort included the original fortified belt built between 1793 and 1870, and the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res forts built between 1874 and 1886, with numerous smaller batteries. Inter-war Following the First World War, French defense policy was re-examined at the order of Marshal Philippe P√©tain. The 1919 study recommended the creation of a mobile army that could carry war to the territory of an enemy, supported by frontier defenses that would prevent an enemy from penetrating French territory. The second part of the recommendation was to involve the creation of fortified regions (regions fortifi√©s) in which an enemy could be confronted. The initially recommended fortified regions included: * The Rhine frontier, with two fortified regions, one to the south of Mulhouse and a northern region defending the Alsace plain to the frontier on the Lauter. * An area to the west of the Rhine to prevent an incursion across the land frontier with Germany onto the Alsace plain. * An area in Lorraine to defend the coal-mining regions in the Sarre basin. The regions were to provide locations in which to confront an enemy and from which to launch an offensive to carry the battle onto enemy territory. The previous fortifications of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of the 1880s were designed to defend the frontiers of France that existed following the Franco-Prussian War, in which France had lost Alsace and Lorraine. With the recovery of these territories following World War I, most of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res forts were deep in the interior of northeastern France and not useful. However, the Belfort region had remained in French hands and had therefore been fortified already.Mary, Tome 1, p. 12 A renewed RF Belfort was again proposed in 1922 by the Territorial Defense Commission (commission de d√©fense du territoire), which identified potential invasion routes from Germany into France at three locations: the Belfort Gap, between the Vosges Mountains and the Rhine, and across the Lorraine plateau The committee's final report proposed a continuous fortification from the Swiss border north to the Lauter, and west to Longwy, with the area of the Sarre, which faced the demilitarized area of the Saarland, left unfortified. The final report recommended three fortified regions: * The Fortified Region of Metz-Thionville-Longwy * The Fortified Region of the Lauter * The Fortified Region of Belfort The report did not make specific recommendations on the location or character of the defenses.Mary, Tome 1, p. 13 The Commission on Defense of the Frontiers (commission de d√©fense des frontiers) was established on 31 December 1935 by Prime Minister Paul Painlev√©, to once again consider the question of the frontiers. The commissioned was charged with formulating specific recommendations for defenses and for the incorporation of the existing defenses of Metz and Belfort. The report recommended the creation of a line of defenses about to the east of Belfort, with heavier fortifications to the north and lighter positions to the south. A second line to the rear was to be constructed after a mobilization of the army. The forts at Giromagny, Mont Bart and Chaux were to support the fortification lines with artillery.Mary, Tome 1, pp. 13‚Äì14 World War II In the 1930s, several forts were included in the eastern extension of the Maginot Line fortifications along the line of the Rhine. While not officially part of the new Maginot defenses, the older positions were integrated into the fortress unit command structure of the French army and were designated the Fortified Region of Belfort, with rough equivalence to an army corps. A more ambitious 1926 plan proposed more extensive improvements, although still short of Maginot standards. In practice, a few positions were improved and some new blockhouses were built in the spaces between the forts. The Fortified Region of Belfort was under the command of the 8th Army, Army Group 3 in 1940, with subordinate sectors including the Defensive Sector of Montb√©liard, Defensive Sector of Altkirch and the Fortified Sector of the Jura. The RF Belfort became the 44th Fortress Corps (CAF) from 16 March 1940, losing the Jura sector to the 45th CAF.Mary, Tome 1, pp. 14‚Äì15Mary, Tome 3, pp. 150, 152 Fort du Salbert (Photo:Bresson Thomas) The forts *Citadel of Belfort, built and expanded in stages from the Middle Ages, eventually mounting 100 artillery pieces. The citadel was the command post for the Belfort fortifications until 1940. Forts built between 1792 and 1870: *Fort de la Miotte (17..-1835), also known as Fort Kl√©ber *Vallon rampart (1831‚Äì1842) connecting Miotte and la Justice, blocking the Alsace road and forming a place of refuge and assembly for a field army. *Fort de la Justice (17..-1842), also known as Fort Lecourbe *Fort des Hautes Perches (1815‚Äì1870) *Fort des Basses Perches (1815‚Äì1870) *Fort Bellevue (1870) ‚Äì Fort demolished at the beginning of the 20th century *Fort des Barres (1865‚Äì1870), also known as Fort Hatry S√©r√© de Rivi√®res forts built between 1874 and 1886 *Fort du Salbert (1874‚Äì1877), also known as Fort Lefebvre, located in Belfort at an elevation of 650 meters, the highest of the forts. It was later known as Ouvrage G and Station Ma√Ætre Radar 60/921, part of the French military radar surveillance network. *Fort de Roppe (1875‚Äì1877), also known as Fort Ney, in the commune of Roppe. *Fort de Bessoncourt (1883‚Äì1886) *Fort de V√©zelois (1883‚Äì1886), also known as Fort Ordener, located between the communes of Meroux and V√©zelois. *Fort du Bois d'Oye (1883‚Äì1886), also known as Fort Ebl√©, located in the commune of Bermont. *Fort du Mont Vaudois (1874‚Äì1877), located in Valdoie. *Fort des Hautes Perches (1874‚Äì1877) ‚Äì Reconstruction of the fort first completed in 1870, located in the town of P√©rouse. *Fort des Basses Perches (1874‚Äì1877) ‚Äì Reconstruction of the fort first completed in 1870, located in the commune of Danjoutin and Belfort. The two Perches forts of the original belt were retained and rebuilt by S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, by reason of their strategic value during the final stage of the Siege of Belfort in 1870‚Äì71. Following a decree by Minister of War Georges Boulanger in 1887, the military structures were renamed with more \\"glorious\\" names, preferably relating to local military events. However, the local people did not always adopt these new names. Presently, the greater portion of the sites are no longer under military usage and are abandoned. Strategic railroad The Chemins de fer strat√©gique du Territoire du Belfort served the belt of forts using a 600mm narrow-gauge railway according to the P√©chot system, which was used for a number of similar military supply systems. Part of the system was considered permanent, while the Decauville line was easily disassembled. Construction took place from 1889 to 1893. The trains transported materials, supplies, munitions and personnel, with traction supplied by a P√©chot-Bourdon steam engine. The principal forts relying on the railway were Roppe, Bessoncourt, Ch√©vremont, V√©zelois, Meroux, Bois d'Oye, Salbert, les Barres, the Forts des Perches and Mont-Vaudois.

Her manuscript lay dormant for almost a century.My Life. University of Ottawa press Historically, little attention has been paid to Sofia who, acting in the capacity of literary assistant, translator, transcriber, and editor, played an important role in the development of her husband's career. Tolstaya's story takes us from her childhood through the early years of her marriage, the writing of War and Peace and Anna Karenina and into the first year of the twentieth century. She paints an intimate and honest portrait of her husband's character, providing new details about his life to which she alone was privy. She offers a better understanding of Tolstoy's character, his qualities and failings as a husband and a father, and forms a picture of the quintessential Tolstoyan character which underlies his fiction. My Life also reveals that Tolstaya was an accomplished author in her own right‚Äîas well as a translator, amateur artist, musician, photographer, and businesswoman‚Äîa rarity in the largely male-dominated world of the time. She was actively involved in the relief efforts for the 1891‚Äì92 famine and the emigration of the Doukhobors in 1899. She was a prolific correspondent, in touch with many prominent figures in Russian and Western society. Guests in her home ranged from peasants to princes, from anarchists to artists, from composers to philosophers. Her descriptions of these personalities read as a chronicle of the times, affording a unique portrait of late-19th- and early-20th-century Russian society, ranging from peasants to the Tsar himself. My Life is the most important primary document about Tolstoy to be published in many years and a unique and intimate portrait of one of the greatest literary minds of all time.-Tolstaya [= Tolstaja], Sofia.

PA is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous, although the two groups are not affiliated. PA uses the book There Is A Solution: The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Pills Anonymous (), created as a combined text and study guide for pill addicts to use in their recovery, and to further their understanding of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions and apply them in their daily lives. The PA book was published in August 2013. As of 2013, there are several thousand PA members in the United States, Canada and other countries attending over 60 meetings per week. On-line meetings exist as well.  The program  The only requirement for membership is \\"a desire to stop using pills\\", and members \\"meet regularly to help each other stay clean\\", where \\"clean\\" is defined as complete abstinence from all mood- and mind- altering substances (including alcohol). Membership in P.A. is free, and there are no dues or fees. The foundation of the Pills Anonymous program is the twelve steps and twelve traditions. Pills Anonymous \\"has no opinion on outside issues\\", including those of politics, science, or medicine, and does not endorse any outside organization or institution. The fellowship does not promote itself, but rather attracts new members through public information and outreach. P.A. groups and P.A. World Service supply outside organizations with factual information regarding the P.A. program, and individual members may carry the P.A. message to hospitals and institutions, such as treatment centers. The nature of addiction P.A. describes addiction as a progressive disease with no known cure, which affects every area of a pill addict's life: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. P.A. suggests that the disease of addiction can be arrested, and recovery is possible through working the P.A. twelve-step program. The steps never mention drugs or drug use; rather, they refer to addiction to pills and all other mind-altering substances, to indicate that pill addicts have a disease of which pill use is one symptom. Other symptoms include obsession, compulsion, denial, and self- centered fear. Many pill addicts first come to P.A. after reaching a \\"bottom\\" in their life, a point at which life feels completely unmanageable, sometimes characterized by \\"unemployability, dereliction and destruction\\" and centered around the getting and using and finding ways and means to get more pills. Every P.A. member reaches a different bottom, which can be wherever the pill addict chooses to stop using. In practice, it is pill use and the extreme consequences associated with its abuse that bring most pill addicts to their bottom, many of them sliding along 'this bottom' for many years and often never finding a way out.  Meetings  Regular meetings, hosted by P.A. groups, are the basic unit of the P.A. Fellowship. Meetings are held in a variety of places such as church or synagogue meeting rooms, libraries, hospitals, community centers, parks, or any other place that can accommodate a meeting. Members who attend the same meeting on a regular basis to establish a recovery network and reliable routine understand this to be their \\"Home Group\\". Group members are able to participate in the group's business, and play an important role in deciding how the group's meetings should be conducted. Formats There are two basic types of meetings, \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\". Anyone is welcome to attend an open meeting, while closed meetings are limited to pill addicts and to people who think they may have a problem with drugs. Meeting formats vary, but often include time devoted to the reading aloud of P.A. literature regarding the issues involved in living life clean and sober which is written by and for members of P.A. Many meetings also include an \\"open sharing\\" component, where anyone attending has the opportunity to share. There is usually no direct feedback during the 'share', thus only one person ever speaks at any given time during this portion of the meeting. Some groups choose to host a single speaker (such meetings are usually denoted \\"speaker meetings\\") to share for the majority of the meeting time. Other meeting formats include round-robin (in which sharing goes around in a circle or each speaker picks the next person to share). Some meetings focus on reading, writing, and/or sharing about one of the Twelve Steps or some other portion of P.A. literature. Some meetings are \\"common needs\\" (a.k.a. special interest) meetings, supporting a particular group of people based on gender, sexual identity, age, language or other characteristic. These meetings are not exclusionary, as anyone with a desire to stop using pills is welcome at any P.A. meeting. PA Communities will often make an effort to have an open meeting run at the same time for members who don't identify with the common needs meeting. During the meeting, some groups allot time for P.A.-related announcements, and many meetings set aside time to recognize \\"anniversaries\\" or \\"birthdays\\" of clean time. Individuals are sometimes given an opportunity to announce their clean and sober time to the group. In some meetings, and for certain anniversaries, medallions, which denote various amounts of clean time, are distributed to those who have achieved those milestones. In some areas, the pill addict who is celebrating an \\"anniversary\\" will be able to conduct the readings for the meeting, and s/he will be the speaker to carry the P.A. message. Then s/he will have his or her sponsor, a friend, or a family member present a medallion, at which time the presenter will share some of the celebrating pill addict's achievements from the last year, or from during the entire course of his or her recovery. Then the pill addict celebrating his or her anniversary can share his or her experience, strength, and hope with the group on how they achieved their recovery. \\"Each group has but one primary purpose‚Äîto carry the message to the addict who still suffers\\" (Pills Anonymous' Fifth Tradition). Therefore, the newcomer is considered to be the most important person in any meeting. The message of Pills Anonymous is hope: that there is another way to live and we can recover one day at a time from our addiction.  Service  P.A. literature suggests that service work is an essential part of a program of recovery. Service is \\"doing the next right thing\\" and is the best example of \\"good will\\", which is the basis for the freedom promised by the P.A. program. Service work usually consists of chairing a meeting, but may be as simple as cleaning up after the meeting, putting away chairs, or answering a phone. Additionally, there are basic, formalized service positions at the group level to help the group perform its function‚Äîfor example, treasurer, secretary, and World Service Delegate (who represents the group in the larger service structure).  Spirituality  Pills Anonymous calls itself a spiritual program of recovery from the disease of pill addiction, but does not require membership in any religion. The P.A. program places importance on developing a working relationship with a \\"higher power\\". The literature suggests that members formulate their own personal understanding of a higher power. The only suggested guidelines are that this power be \\"loving, caring, and greater than one's self.\\" Members are given freedom in coming to an understanding of a higher power that works for them. Individuals from various spiritual and religious backgrounds, as well as many atheists and agnostics, have developed a relationship with their own higher power. P.A. also makes frequent use of the word \\"God\\"; some members who have difficulty with this term substitute \\"higher power\\" or read it as an acronym for \\"Good Orderly Direction.\\" The twelve steps of the P.A. program are based upon spiritual principles, three of which are honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness, embodied in the first three steps. According to PA members, these principles, when followed to the best of one's ability, allow for a new way of life. P.A. meetings often close with the Third Step Prayer (\\"Take my will and my life. Guide me in my recovery. Show me how to live.\\") or the Serenity Prayer.  Sponsorship  One pill addict helping another is an essential part of the P.A. program. It is therefore highly recommended that members of Pills Anonymous find a sponsor. A sponsor is a P.A. member who helps another member by sharing his or her experience, strength, and hope in recovery, and who serves as guide through the Twelve Steps. P.A. members often choose a sponsor with experience in applying the Twelve Steps of Pills Anonymous. For stronger identification, many P.A. members have sponsors of the same sex, although members are free to choose any other member as a sponsor. It is also suggested that one should find a sponsor who has not only worked the 12 steps of Pills Anonymous, but who also has an understanding of the 12 traditions of Pills Anonymous. Sponsors also maintain the continuity of the fundamental message that Pills Anonymous works, has worked for others for many years, and continues to work.  Anonymity  The Twelfth Tradition of Pills Anonymous states that \\"anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.\\" Many P.A. members identify themselves in meetings by their first name only. The spirit of anonymity is about placing \\"principles before personalities\\"; affirming that no individual pill addict is superior to another; and recognizing that individual pill addicts do not recover without the fellowship or its spiritual principles. The Eleventh Tradition states that P.A. members \\"need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.\\" History PA's beginnings are not fully known. The longest-running known group, which is located in New York City, dates back to 1972. Dr. Paul O., a well known AA speaker, has also talked about starting a meeting in the 1970s. There are several references to Pills Anonymous in books such as The Recovery BookThe Recovery Book by Al J. Mooney, Arlene Eisenberg, Howard Eisenberg (January, 1992) and Young, sober & free: experience, strength, and hope for young adults.Young, sober & free: experience, strength, and hope for young adults By Shelly Marshall On October 1, 2008, Pills Anonymous World Service was incorporated as a 501(c)3 charitable organization in the state of Arizona, as a result of two conferences held earlier that year. One of the conferences was held in Las Vegas, Nevada in March, the other in Tempe, Arizona in September. During the Tempe Conference, the Delegates voted to Incorporate Pills Anonymous World Service. They also voted to accept, as the organization's guide moving forward, the Pills Anonymous World Service Manual, which contains the Twelve Steps of Pills Anonymous; the Twelve Traditions of Pills Anonymous;the Twelve Traditions of Pills Anonymous and many suggestions as how the group should be run. In June 2009, in Ontario, California, the Pills Anonymous Local Service Manual was introduced and voted to be conference- approved. The Manual is intended as a guide to help individual Groups form meetings, an important part of the PA program. In October 2010, in Mesa, Arizona, the Pills Anonymous World Service Public Information Guide was introduced. The 2010 Conference quickly approved this guide, which provides guidance to P.A. groups and the World Service in attracting newcomers to the program. The 2010 conference also approved the use of \\"press releases\\" to send the message of recovery to the media. In October 2011, in Mesa, Arizona, the conference approved the formation of the Pills Anonymous World Service Office Board of Directors to incorporate the WSO and shepherd production of the PA Book and key tags. In July 2012, the official PA logo received its trademark registration number. In August 2013, the PA Book, There is a Solution: The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Pills Anonymous, was published.

He first appeared in Strange Adventures #1 (August 1950), and was created by David V Reed and Paul Norris. Publication history The first Darwin Jones story appeared in Strange Adventures #1 (August 1950), written by creator David V Reed, (better known for his war and fantasy stories), and drawn by artist Paul Norris and inker Bernard Sachs. This was a single appearance as opposed to the start of a series - there were no further stories until Strange Adventures #48 (September 1954). His further appearances in the 1950s were irregular - Strange Adventures #58 (1955), #66 and #70 (1956), #76, #77, #79 and #84 (1957), then #88 and #93 (1958), after which no Darwin Jones stories were published until he eventually re-appeared in Strange Adventures #149 (February 1963) and a last story in Strange Adventures #160 (January 1964). Although he utilised many of the classic National writers and artists of the day, Strange Adventures Editor Julius Schwartz made no attempt at continuity with the production team on the stories. In thirteen stories Darwin Jones was penned by no less than eight authors: his creator David V Reed, Gardner Fox, Sid Gerson, Bill Finger, Joe Samachson, Otto Binder, John Broome, and Ed Herron, and an equally large number of artists, including Carmine Infantino, Sy Barry, Gil Kane, John Giunta, Joe Giella and Murphy Anderson. An oddity of the series is that none of the stories were actually headlined as Darwin Jones tales, and many do not even mention him until part way through the story. Since then there have been no further Darwin Jones stories as such; he has only made a small number of minor appearances in other titles - Daring New Adventures of Supergirl #7 (May 1983), a cameo role in the DC Comics cross-over story Crisis on Infinite Earths #9 (1985), the out-of-continuity DC staff round robin adventure DC Challenge #4-6 (February 1986 - April 1986), Power of the Atom #15 (August 1989), Action Comics #683 (November 1992) and Underworld Unleashed: Patterns of Fear #1 (December 1995). The character resurfaced during the Final Crisis storylineOn p4 of 'Know Evil' (Final Crisis #3, September 2008), Father Time, the Commander of the Super Human Advanced Defense Executive (S.H.A.D.E.) has an off-page conversation with an unseen 'Darwin'. Although this has not actually been confirmed as Darwin Jones, the two are contemporaneous heads of U.S. Government Agencies (covert or otherwise), both responsible for investigating threats to the country so a link is likely. and is referred to in the recent Justice League series JL: Cry for Justice (2009). Fictional character biography As originally created, Darwin Jones \\"science detective\\" was the Chief of Staff of D.S.I. (The Department of Scientific Investigation), a top secret U.S. Government Bureau which is 'called on to solve the unsolveable...to explain the inexplicable...and to understand the things that few men on this Earth have understood.' Strange Adventures #1 (August 1950) In his first known case he investigated the puzzle of a famous film star who could not die, finding that a radioactive pool in Mexico that she had swum in while filming may have been the cause. 'The Girl who Couldn't Die' , Strange Adventures #1 (August 1950) His later investigations mostly involved investigating aliens, most notably rampaging alien snowmen, 'Invaders From the Ice World' , Strange Adventures #79 (April 1957) although an eyeless creature from inside the Earth, 'The Radar Man' , Strange Adventures #48 (September 1954) a robot from ancient Atlantis, 'The Robot From Atlantis' Strange Adventures #76 (January 1957) and an evil super-intelligent gorilla (actually a hoax by aliens bent on world domination) 'The Gorilla War Against Earth' , Strange Adventures #88 (January 1958) also featured. Later Darwin was made Director of the D.S.I. 'The Would Be King of Earth' , Strange Adventures #149 (February 1963) He had also made the acquaintance of a group of youths called the Young Scienceers, who had made him an honorary member, and together with the club President, Tommy Dane, Jones once again defeated an alien plot. 'Captives of the Eclipse' , Strange Adventures #160 (January 1964) After this, nothing is known of his exploits until he was contacted by Lois Lane to help the Metropolis police solve a murder. 'Reflection of Murder' , Daring New Adventures of Supergirl #7 (May 1983). Note: this tale is marked as no longer in continuity in some online indexes, although there appears to be no reason for this - it is possible that the indexer was confused by the Lois Lane story appearing as a backup in a Supergirl title which is no longer regarded as part of DC continuity. Later, during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, he was one of the team of superheroes and scientists investigating the time and space anomalies caused by the Anti- Monitor.Crisis on Infinite Earths #9 (December 1985) By 1989 Jones and other scientists had created a computer mind, 'The Gestalt' - a 'revolutionary brain implant that links our minds to the Gestalt and each other' so they can share their knowledge directly. Unfortunately the Gestalt began working autonomously, creating a cyber-villain, Humbug which took The Atom to defeat. 'All In the Mind' , 'Power of the Atom' #15 (August 1989) He next encountered Superman while investigating cattle mutilations and a mysterious plane crash in Ohio, 'The Trail of The Jackal' , Action Comics #683 (November 1992) his last actual appearance to date.but see note #1 above References=Notations * Who‚Äôs Who Update Vol 1 #2 (DC Comics, 1987) * Who's Who of American Comic Books * Grand Comics database External links * Toonopedia: Darwin Jones * DCU Guide: Darwain Jones Category:Characters created by Paul Norris Category:Comics characters introduced in 1950 Category:DC Comics superheroes Category:Fictional scientists Category:Fictional detectives Category:Fictional paranormal investigators ","title":"Darwin Jones"},{"id":"25881100","text":"Xeromphalina campanella is a species of mushroom. The common names of the species include the golden trumpet and the bell Omphalina. The genus name Xeromphalina means \\"little dry navel\\" and campanella means \\"bell-shaped\\", respectively describing the mature and young shapes of the pileus, or cap. The mushroom is also called fuzzy-foot. Description The fruit body of X. campanella has a small umbrella-shaped cap and a thin brown stalk with yellow hairs at the base. The gills are pale yellow to pale orange. The stalk is thick, dry, yellow at the apex, is dark reddish brown below, and the base has long orangeish hairs. The spore print is pale buff. Xeromphalina kauffmanii resembles the species, but it grows on decaying wood of broad-leaved trees. Xeromphalina brunneola also resembles the species, except for the odor, taste, color of the cap, and by the smaller, narrowly elliptical spores. When the species is young, their caps are bell-shaped. As they mature, the outer part of the cap expands and rises which leaves the center depressed, resembling a navel. Edibility Although the species is not poisonous, the mushrooms are small and bitter tasting with no value as edibles. David Arora suggests that the mushroom is a small morsel that is hardly worth eating. Despite many authors calling the mushroom inedible, author Bill Russell knows people that eat the mushroom frequently. Habitat The fruiting occurs in clumps or very dense clusters on decaying logs, stumps, and woody debris of coniferous trees. The species is commonly found in North America. At times, the species almost entirely covers old tree stumps. The species can be found in any wet season of the year.

The 1st Armoured Regiment () was an armoured regiment of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II, part of the 1st Armoured Division. France 1939 The 1st Polish Armoured Regiment of the 1st Polish Armoured Division has its origins in France. After the Russian Army invaded from the East, with the German Army invading from the West, the Polish government went into exile and the Polish Army in units, and as individuals, made their way to France to regroup. Some Polish soldiers came from Poland through enemy territory. Others took a roundabout route through neighbouring countries by any means available, some after being interned for a period of time. They all made their way to the camp at Co√´tquidan in Brittany. This camp became the centre of the Polish Army in exile. Additional Poles came from the large √©migr√© community in France and Belgium to enlist.1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946 On 20 November 1939, the Armoured Group was formed under the command of Major L. Furs-≈ªyrkiewicz. It was made up mostly of soldiers from the former armoured units of Poland. The 1st Tank Battalion was formed from these former armoured units on 2 December 1939 and left the camp at Co√´tquidan for the village of Campen√©ac. On this day, it became an independent unit. Its name would change (65th Tank Battalion,LEXICON OF WORLD WAR II ARMED FORCES VOL. 1 - POLISH ARMOURED FORCES 1939-1945 ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF BATTLE, page 40 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Armoured Regiment), but it could trace its roots to this date as its birth. Living conditions at both camps were poor. The soldiers' morale was low because of the harsh winter conditions, lack of equipment, and poor living quarters. During February 1940, the Battalion left Campen√©ac for St. C√©cile-les-Vignes. Here the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade was formed from all the armoured units. The Battalion fell under the Brigade in the chain of command. Soon afterwards, the first Renault FT tanks arrived, and training with these vintage and obsolete World War I tanks began. The German offensive on 10 May caused the Battalion to accelerate its preparations and training for battle. On 27 May 1940, under the command of Major Stanis≈Çaw Gli≈Ñski, it moved to Versailles, where it received modern tanks and equipment. Also on this day, the 1st Company was transferred to airfield protection duties and the Finnish Company took its place. The Battalion had only ten days to learn how to operate the new Renault R35 and R39 tanks. On 8 June 1940, the Battalion was deployed to Champagne, where the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, under the command of General Maczek, was located. The situation at the front, as a result of the German offensive on 10 June, was hopeless. The Germans had infiltrated behind the French lines. Champagne and Burgundy were being surrounded from the west. The units in this pocket were being systematically destroyed from the air. The Battalion, from the day it arrived in Champagne on 12 June 1940, sustained heavy losses, due to German air attacks. Enemy aircraft broke the Battalion's first attack attempt. In the chaos that ensued, the Battalion retreated to the south while under constant assault from the air. Lt-Col. Tadeusz Majewski took command of the Battalion on 15 June 1940. The Battalion was made the Brigade's spearhead for the breakout from the pocket created by the enemy. The attack began on the night of 16 June 1940 with the 4th Motorized Division in the town of Montbard in Burgandy. As a result of heavy losses inflicted during the night, the enemy withdrew from Montbard. This victory was short-lived, however, for the Battalion was out of ammunition and fuel. The next day, orders were issued for the crews to destroy their tanks, to prevent them falling into enemy hands, and disband The men were ordered to make their way south as best they could. The temporary disbandment of the Battalion ended its part in the French campaign. The fates of these men were varied. The French people often risked their lives to help. Some made it across the German lines and reached French ports, in time to leave on the last ships leaving for England. Some were taken prisoner. Some were interned in the Spanish concentration camp of Miranda del Ebro after crossing the Spanish border. Others made it to North Africa, where they were interned and forced to work on the construction of the Trans-Sahara Railroad. The majority, however, after overcoming many obstacles (lack of money, lack of papers, lack of transportation etc.), in some cases taking years (some made their way through Russia to Japan to the U.S./Canada/South America to England; literally travelling around the world), made it back to their units regrouping in Britain. Britain 1940 The arrival in Great Britain was in stark contrast to their previous arrival in France from Poland. They were welcomed into people's homes till permanent quarters were arranged, which were an improvement over those in France. The living conditions alone were enough to boost morale. This would aid them during the 4 years it would take to prepare and train for the upcoming battles on the continent. The Battalion reported to Crawford in Lanarkshire. The camp was located in the Clyde River valley in Scotland. During its 4 months there, the Battalion was reorganized and brought to full strength by the return of 1st Company, but it still lacked equipment. Maj. Henryk ≈öwietlicki took command in August 1940. The start of the Battle of Britain highlighted the threat of invasion of the British Isles. The Battalion was now on a high state of alert. It patrolled the area and established guard posts in the surrounding hills. On 22 October 1940, the Battalion was moved to Blairgowrie in Pertshire, where it was stationed for 17 months. A close bond formed between the soldiers and the local population. Blairgowrie became the adopted home of the Battalion. Its men would never forget the kindness and hospitality of the people. Infantry training took place during the winter of 1940 and preparations made for the anticipated invasion. Tanks finally arrived in the spring of 1941. The first to arrive were Valentines. A few months later, they received Mark I's. Their arrival boosted morale. In the summer of 1941, the Battalion's duties included: protecting nearby airfields; guarding Broughty Ferry on the Scottish East Coast; and building anti-invasion obstacles around Dundee. In addition to their military duties, the Battalion assisted the local population with the harvesting of wheat and potatoes. During the autumn of 1941, the Battalion received the new 40-ton Churchill tanks. The Churchill was later followed by three other tank models. As a result, the Poles were experienced in various types of armoured vehicles (not just tanks). On 27 September 1941 the Battalion was renamed the 65th Tank Battalion. During December 1941, volunteers arriving from the United States and South America were inducted into the Battalion. In early April 1942, the Battalion left Blairgowrie for Camp Langton near Duns in Berwickshire. The local population, here again, welcomed the soldiers of the Battalion into their homes. In both Blairgowrie and Duns, the Battalion left commemorative plaques, thanking the local population for their hospitality. Shortly after arriving at Camp Langton, the Battalion's Churchills were replaced by Covenanters. On 25 March 1942, General Maczek was appointed Division Commander. The 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade and 16th Armoured Brigade formed the core of the division.1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, pages 39-40 Maj Boles≈Çaw Soko≈Çowski assumed command of the Battalion in June 1942.1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, page 40 On 12 August 1942, 16th Tank Brigade was renamed 16th Armoured Brigade. As a result, the 65th Tank Battalion on 13 August 1942,1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, page 26 as a result of the formation of the 1st Polish Armoured Division, the Battalion was renamed the 1st Armoured Regiment. In the autumn of 1942, Crusader tanks arrived. Now training was mainly focused on the Covenanter tanks and the Crusaders. During 1943, more Polish soldiers arrived from the Middle East. These men, making their way from Russian internment camps under General Anders, helped to make up the shortfall in manpower in the division. From May till the end of September 1943, the Regiment participated in Divisional manoeuvers in south-east England near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk. Afterwards, the regiment returned to Camp Langton. On 21 September 1943, the 16th Armoured Headquarters was absorbed into the 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade.1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, pages 49 On 12 October 1943, the combined Brigade was renamed the 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade. The 1st Armoured Regiment was now under the 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade.1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, page 52 Maj Aleksander Stefanowicz assumed command of the Regiment in November 1943. At this time, the Regiment had begun to receive its final allocation of equipment, which included Sherman and Stuart tanks. The winter of 1943 was spent training on these new tanks. This included practice on the gunnery range at Kirkcudbright. In May 1944,1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, page 28 the Regiment left Duns for Bridlington in Yorkshire, where it remained for 2 months. In mid July 1944, it moved to Aldershot, south west of London. This was the Regiment's last staging area for the continent. Having made the final preparations and received its final equipment, the Regiment left for the marshalling area in Portsmouth for embarkation. France 1944 Unit Flash of the 1st Polish Armoured Regiment located on the left rear and right front of its vehicles.The Regiment disembarked at the artificial Mulberry Harbor near Arromanches in Normandy. On 1 August 1944, the Regiment assembled in France. The Regiment's first battle on the continent occurred on 8 August 19441ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, page 30 south east of Caen. As part of the 1st Polish Armoured Division, it was ordered to attack the heavily defended German lines at Falaise. The regiment distinguished itself in the battle for Renemesnil on 9 August 1944. Around 1200hrs, it received heavy artillery and mortar fire in the neighbourhood of the church. Between 1220 and 1255hrs, the Regiment reached the western outskirts of Cauvicourt. In area 84 (S Renemesnil), Tiger tanks appeared with very effective supporting artillery fire. Attacking, the Regiment took Hill 84 by about 1600hrs, but was stopped on the south slope by very fierce anti-tank defences. At 1300hrs, the Commanding Officer of the Regiment decided to attack Hill 111 (along the axis 84 Chein Hausse). Second Squadron of the Regiment captured the hill. The enemy had put up a very heavy fire of mortars, artillery and anti-tank guns. The 1st Armoured Regiment had broken the German defences by the Laison River and reached Hill 111. In this operation, the Regiment suffered heavy losses: 3 officers killed (including the 2 in command) and 10 other ranks; 4 officers wounded and 11 other ranks; 1 officer missing and 7 other ranks. During the action on Hill 111, the 1st Armoured Regiment freed from the Germans about 100 Canadian soldiers who had been without food and ammunition for 2 days. Captured German prisoners confessed that the attack had demoralized the German infantry garrison.1st Armoured Division Operational Reports, 7 August- 6 October 1944 On 15 August, the Regiment took part in the crossing of the Dives River near Jort. On 16 August 1944, 3rd Rifle Brigade less 8th Rifle Battalion held the bridgeheads in Jort (1st Mountain Rifle Battalion) and Morieres (9th Rifle Battalion) reinforced by the 1st Armoured Regiment, which reconnoitered in the direction of the woods of Courcy. On 18 August 1944, 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade Command ordered the 1st Armoured Regiment to attack in the direction of Bourdon to enable the resupply of Lt- Col. Koszutski's group . This did not occur due to Allied aircraft mistakenly bombing them. On 19 August 1944 by 1539hrs, the 1st Armoured Regiment reported that with all their forces, they had taken the area of Coudehard and they were heavily engaged with Panther tanks and heavy enemy artillery fire. By nightfall, the 1st Armoured Regiment, 1st Mountain Rifle Battalion, and one anti-tank battery occupied both Hill 262 and Hill 252 (Maczuga). The 1st Polish Armoured Division had borne the whole burden of battle this day against a superior enemy force consisting of units of the 1st and 2nd SS Corps. The enemy attacked the 1st and 2nd Armoured Regiments the entire day of 20 August 1944 from all sides. The Germans attacked from the West, where they were trapped in the gap, and from the East where the 21st Panzer Division tried to open a path for their comrades trapped in the gap. The battle closed to a distance of 50 meters. That night, Lt-Col. Stefanowicz, doubtful of his men's chances of survival due to lack of food and ammunition, told his men: \\"Gentlemen. Everything is lost. I do not believe the Canadians will manage to help us. We have only 110 men left, with 50 rounds per gun and 5 rounds per tank... Fight to the end! To surrender to the SS is senseless, you know it well. Gentlemen! Good luck ‚Äì tonight, we will die for Poland and civilization. We will fight to the last platoon, to the last tank, then to the last man.\\" TANK TACTICS; FROM NORMANDY TO LORRAINE, page 201 On 21 August 1944, a platoon of the Regiment's 3rd Squadron reconnoitred the German positions below the Zameczek ( a hunting lodge on the ridge of Hill 262's northern slope). By 1045 hrs, the Canadians had linked up with the 2nd Armoured Regiment. In the afternoon, a Canadian Brigade arrived in the area of Hill 262 MACZUGA. They brought supplies for the armoured regiments. The final German effort was launched at around 1100hrs by SS remnants that had infiltrated through the wooded hills to the rear of the 1st Armoured Regiment's dressing station. This \\"suicidal\\" assault was defeated at point-blank range by the 9th Infantry Battalion, with the 1st Armoured Regiment's tanks using their anti-aircraft machine guns in support. The machine gun's tracer set fire to the grass amongst the German troops, killing the wounded men on the slope. As the final infantry assaults melted away, the German artillery and mortar fire targeting the hill finally subsided as well. On 22 August 1944, the disposition of the 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade consisted of: 1st Armoured Regiment, 24th Lancers, 1st Mountain Rifle Battalion, 10th Dragoons and one Anti-Tank Battery. Their area of responsibility consisted of Mount Ormel, Hill 262, and Chambois. Their task was: to defend the area to the East and the North; to link up and maintain contact with the 4th Canadian Armoured Division in St Lambert Sur Dives and to link up and maintain contact with the American troops South of Frenes. In the evening, General Crear of the Canadian Army Command commended the 1st Armoured Division for their actions. The period between 19 and 21 August 1944 saw a life and death struggle for the Germans trapped in the Falaise Pocket and for the Regiment. It had to fend off the desperate attacks of infantry and tanks of the elite German armoured divisions of the 1st SS and the 12th SS. The hllform known as 'the Mace' was a very bloody scene of carnage and destruction. The roads leading to it were covered with dead German soldiers; dead horses; and hundreds of destroyed vehicles, tanks, and guns. Here the Poles had their revenge on the Germans for the invasion and destruction of their homeland. The seizure and defence of the Mace denied the Germans the north-eastern routes of retreat. The battle of the Mace was a total defeat for the Germans. The German forces in the Falaise Pocket were destroyed. Field Marshal Montgomery later described the Mace as the cork in the bottle that was the Falaise Pocket. The American, British and Canadian forces were the bottle and the Polish forces were the cork that kept the Germans from escaping. The 2 weeks, from 16‚Äì23 August 1944The 1ST Armoured Regiment in Action from Caen to Wilhelmshaven, page 8 were highly successful, but at a high cost in men and equipment. For this reason, 19 August, the day the Regiment seized the Mace in the region of Coudehart near Chambois,1ST Polish Armoured Regiment IN THE YEARS 1939-1946, pages 1,5,7The 1ST Armoured Regiment in Action from Caen to Wilhelmshaven, pages7- 8 became the Regimental Day afterwards. Due to its heavy losses, the Regiment was relieved on 23 August 1944 to recover. It was able to reconstitute its manpower from the POWs it had captured during the battle of the Mace. Among the POWs were Poles who had been conscripted to serve in the German Army. They quickly volunteered to join in the defeat of the Axis and the liberation of Poland. This pattern was followed throughout the war. This was the only reserve available to the entire 1st Armoured Division. If not for these conscripted soldiers, the 1st Armoured Division would have been broken up and its men used as replacements in other British units. After a few days, the pursuit of the German Army continued. During the Regiment's pursuit, it engaged the rear-guard of the fleeing German Army. It fought for the crossing of the Somme River below Abbeville. The 1st Armoured Regiment was part of the vanguard for this action. At 1200hrs on 1 September 1944, the vanguard moved out under the command of Major Zgorzelski, 10th Dragoons, which also consisted of 10th Dragoons minus one squadron, one Battery Artillery Support, and one Battery Anti-Tank Support. At 1835hrs due to enemy resistance, supported by artillery, the vanguard engaged the enemy. At 1930hrs, the vanguard crossed the bridge at Blangy. Belgium 1944 The town of St. Nicolas adopted the men of the 1st Polish Armoured Regiment and gave them the right to wear the coat of arms on the right sleeve of their uniforms.It then fought its way to the Neuf Fosse Canal, where it entered Belgium on 6 September 1944. At 2200hrs, 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade, 1st and 2nd Armoured Regiments, 10th Dragoons, 10th Mounted Rifles, 10th Coy Engineers, two batteries Anti Tank Support moved to a protected night bivouac 3 kilometers northeast of Ypres. On this day, 1st Armoured Regiment bypassed Ypres, thus cutting off the retreat of the Germans, who were still occupying the town. Attacking with the entire brigade, Ypres was captured. The following 2 days were spent fighting for Roullers (now Roeselare). After bypassing Thielt (the town Tielt), the Regiment engaged the enemy in the Ruysselede (Ruiselede) area on September 8, 1944. It had advanced 524 km in 12 days. In the process, it had destroyed many German columns and captured large numbers of prisoners. The following week, it fought in the area of St Nicolas. It entered the town on 12 September 1944. It captured Stekene. On 19 September 1944, patrols of the 1st Armoured Regiment detached in the direction of Axelsche ‚Äì Sabuek encountered enemy forces along the Spun ‚Äì Kreek Canal. Holland 1944 It entered Holland to assist in capturing Axel and reached the mouth of the Scalde River. At this point, the Regiment was ordered to St Gilles, Belgium to recover. They were welcomed by the local population. After a few days rest in nearby St Nicolas, Belgium, they were ready to resume their duties. On 28 September 1944, east of Antwerp, the Regiment engaged the enemy along with units of the 3rd Infantry Brigade. The country-side was heavily wooded and mined. The Germans defense consisted of many anti-tank guns and artillery. The odds were in the enemy's favor. They captured Baarle-Nassau and Alphen after a battle that lasted for 5 days. On 4 October 1944 at 1415hrs, 9th Rifle Brigade plus one Anti-Tank Battery and one squadron from the 1st Armoured Regiment captured the western outskirts of the forest near Baarle- Nassau. With the capture of Alphen, a temporary stalemate followed. For the next 3, weeks the Regiment consolidated its position. On 27 October 1944, the Regiment executed its orders for the capture of Breda. After 8 days of battle, Breda was taken. The Regiment was able to recover there for a few days afterwards. It was then ordered to capture Made, which it did. The final stage of the offensive was reaching the Maas River. At this point, from 9 November 1944 to 7 April 1945, the Regiment maintained a defensive position along the river. During this time, the Regiment stayed in Wagenberg, Oosterhout, and Udenhout respectively. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1945, the Regiment took up positions on the peninsula of St Philipsland and the island of Tholen, where there was heavy enemy activity. In late February 1945, the Regiment returned to the district of Dongen-Oosterhout, where the tanks were the advance guard. During this time, the Regiment was frequently on the move and engaged in minor skirmishes, but not without losses. A constant threat 24 hours a day, throughout this time, were the thousands of V-1, buzz bombs. They constantly flew by overhead and sometimes exploded nearby. Germany 1945 The 1811 kilometer route taken by the 1st Armoured Regiment from landing in Normandy to the end of the war in Germany. The Regiment, on 7 April 1945, realized one of its goals. It left Dongen and after covering 240 km in 34 hours, crossed the Rhine River at Rees. On 14 April 1945, the Regiment relieved the Canadians at the heavily defended K√ºsten Canal. After the canal was bridged by other units of the division, the Regiment launched an attack on Aschendorf. It was captured on 20 April 1945, after overcoming the many obstacles imposed by the terrain (the tanks had to keep to the roads along the dikes as the surrounding terrain was unsuitable for armor) and the enemy's anti-tank guns. For the following 2 days, the Regiment battled the enemy north of Papenburg and seized the communication center of Ihrhove-Ihren. A week later, it crossed the Leda River to open the road for the 3rd Infantry Brigade. It passed Leer, Loga, Filsum, Hesel, and Moorburg. After overcoming numerous obstacles and demolished roads and bridges, it captured the village of Halsbek. Here at 0800 hours on 5 May 1945, a cease fire was ordered. Germany had surrendered. The next morning, the Regiment was ordered north to Clevern. It passed by many German columns, which were proceeding to assembly areas as ordered by the Allies.

On 8 May 1945, the Regiment was ordered to Wittmund, 25 km from Wilhelmshaven. Here the Regiment began its occupation duties. The Regiment had covered 1811 km from the time it had landed on the continent. It celebrated its first Regimental Day on 19 August 1945. On 3 March 1946, St Nicolas presented the regiment with its colors. With the adoption of the Regiment by the town of St Nicolas, the soldiers of the Regiment were given the right to wear the town's coat of arms on their uniforms. The victory was bittersweet for the Polish soldiers. They had defeated the Germans, who had started the war by invading Poland, but they had failed to liberate Poland. This was especially true for those who had been interned by the Russians, at the start of the war. They already realized that they had traded the German occupation for a Russian occupation. They had experienced the Russian occupation of eastern Poland, when Russia was allied with Germany at the start of the war. This occupation would not end till 1990 and the end of the Cold War with the first free elections where Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa was elected President.

The line closed in 1956 and today forms part of a popular cycling and walking route. Origins In 1823 the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway had opened its line connecting Princetown with a wharf on the River Plym near Plymouth. The original intention of encouraging agricultural development of the moor had been frustrated, but the line was carrying considerable traffic in granite from quarries a little below Princetown. It used horses for pulling the wagons and had a distinct track gauge of 4 ft 6in (1,372 mm). It did not convey passengers. In 1852 business interests were formulating the prospectus of the South Devon and Tavistock Railway Company (SD&TR;), which was to connect Tavistock with the main line railway near Plymouth. They wrote that arrangements would also be made, if found desirable, to form a branch line to Government establishments at Princetown.G H Anthony, The Tavistock, Launceston and Princetown Railways, Oakwood Press, Salisbury, 1973 reprinted 1981, The Government establishments were of course Dartmoor Prison, then recently re-opened as a convict prison. The proposed branch was not proceeded with, and the SD&TR; opened its line on 22 June 1859. It left the Exeter - Plymouth line of the South Devon Railway near Marsh Mills and ran northwards to Tavistock, passing through a tunnel under Roborough Down, near the settlement of Yelverton. In 1874 an independent company proposed a branch line from Yelverton to Princetown, with a short branch there to the prison. This scheme failed to gain support. By now the Great Western Railway (GWR) had taken over the SD&TR; line, and proposed a Princetown branch from Yelverton; it obtained powers by Act of Parliament on 13 August 1878, by which a nominally independent company, the Princetown Railway, was incorporated. The GWR was to work the line when built, and to have a controlling interest. Notwithstanding GWR sponsorship, the line was to be built on the standard gauge (4 ft 8¬Ωin, 1,435 mm).Anthony R Kingdom, The Princetown Branch, Oxford Publishing Co Ltd, Oxford, 1979, Princetown Railway overbridge at 18 milepost looking north-eastThe line was to be 10¬º miles in length from Yelverton Siding (on the Plymouth to Tavistock line, at the south end of the tunnel) to Princetown. Adopting part of the route of the 1814 Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway and joining with the GWR, it made working arrangements with those companies and received subscription support from them towards its authorised capital of ¬£60,000, with borrowing powers of ¬£20,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The Company purchased the upper section of the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway (P&DR;) for ¬£22,000, in order to use the P&DR; trackbed. It did so for much of the route, but it ran to the east of Yennadon Down. There were also a number of local realignments where very sharp tramway curves had to be smoothed for locomotive operation. The line was evidently partly supported by the Home Office, as a financial grant towards the construction was expected to be made. It was also anticipated that convict labour might be used for the construction, but this was abandoned as impractical.Minutes of Board meetings quoted in Kingdom, pages 64 and 66 On 7 July 1883 Colonel Yolland of the Board of Trade made an inspection of the line, but found several issues to be unsatisfactory, and he refused the sanction to open. He made a second visit after alterations had been made, and the line opened without ceremony on 11 August 1883. Operation Map of the Princetown Railway in the year of openingOn opening passenger trains ran from through to , as there was only a goods siding at Yelverton. Yolland had required that either a junction station should be provided at Yelverton, or that Horrabridge station should be extended to accommodate interchange traffic. For the time being Horrabridge served as the junction station, but the GWR opened a station at on 1 May 1885, and from that time the branch passenger trains operated to and from that point.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Branch Lines to Launceston and Princetown, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1998, The Tavistock line had been equipped with mixed gauge track (standard and broad gauge rails) to accommodate the trains of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) and the Princetown branch trains were able to use the standard gauge rails; they also travelled through to Plymouth for servicing. The ruling gradient was 1 in 40, rising almost continuously to Princetown, with short-radius curves, making locomotive operation difficult. The branch line left Yelverton in a southerly direction and curved sharply east on a steeply rising gradient. Immediately at the platform end there was a spur siding which led back to a 23 ft 6in turntable. Normal operation in the twentieth century was that an arriving train (from Princetown) would unload and then be propelled empty up the gradient past the siding connection. The engine would then move into the spur and the coaches would be gravitated into the platform under the control of the guard. Stations on the branch were: * Dousland station; it was a block post and had a single platform. * Burrator & Sheepstor Halt; it was opened on 4 February 1924, the area having become an attraction for ramblers. Burrator reservoir is nearby. * Ingra Tor Halt; it opened on 2 March 1936. * King Tor Halt; opened 2 April 1928 * Princetown; the terminus was at an altitude of 1373 feet above sea level. Near Foggintor looking south-west to the lower alignment below Kings TorThere was a 23 ft 6 in turntable at Princetown. The motive power on the line in the twentieth century was almost exclusively the 44XX class of 2-6-2T; mixed train operation was commonly used. Traffic Most of the traffic came from carrying prisoners, prison officers, and supplies for Dartmoor Prison, with some traffic from the quarries near the line, and also some excursion traffic. In 1924 Burrator Platform was opened for workmen employed on the raising of the Burrator and Sheepstor Dams. Prisoners destined for the prison were no longer conveyed by the route after 1930 except during and just after World War 2, as the Southern Railway route to Tavistock and a road connection were more convenient. Two more halts (King Tor and Ingra Tor) were opened (in 1928 and 1936 respectively) to counter competition from local bus services and encourage tourist traffic. In 1949 the service from Yelverton to Princetown comprised three passenger and two mixed traffic trains daily from Monday to Saturday, with an additional passenger train on Saturday. The service from Princetown to Yelverton comprised four passenger trains, with an additional passenger train on Saturday. There was also a mixed traffic train (Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays), and a freight train (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) which stopped only at Swell Tor siding (if required), Dousland, and Yelverton, before running on to Horrabridge. Ownership The line was operated by the Great Western Railway, but owned by the Princetown Railway until 1 January 1922 when the Company amalgamated with the GWR. The line passed to British Railways in 1948 and closed on 3 March 1956. The route today Today, the disused track is a popular walking destination across the moor. Much of the line now forms the route of the Dousland to Princetown Railway Track walkway and rough cycle track.

There was a public outcry because the law was seen as being biased in favour of the burglar instead of the victim. Personal background Munir Hussain, 53 years old at the time, is married to Shaheen Begum, 49, has two sons Awais, 21 and Samad, 15, and two daughters, Farah, 25 and Arooj, 18. His brother Tokeer Hussain, 35, was also jailed for 39 months for taking part in the attack on the burglar. (Ages in 2009.) Hussain trained as an engineer and runs Soundsorba Ltd, a High Wycombe-based business which employs 9 people and turns over ¬£2.4 million per year. He had been chairman of the Wycombe Race Equality Council and chairman of the Asian Business Council, which he helped found.http://www.asianbusinesscouncil.co.uk/#/our-team/4533141876 In 2004 Hussain won the Business Link small business of the year award. Hussain was considered a leading figure in the town's voluntary organisations and was a major force in setting up the Green Street Community Centre in Desborough Street. Confrontation with intruders and imprisonment On 3 September 2008, during Ramadan, Mr. and Mrs. Hussain, their two sons and daughter Arooj, returned home to their house in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England, from their mosque, when they were confronted and tied up by three masked intruders. Samad broke free, fleeing upstairs pursued by two of the masked men, and managed to raise the alarm. Meanwhile, Munir turned on the remaining intruder Walid Salem. Munir chased him off the premises and was joined by his brother Tokeer Hussain, who lived a few doors away. Munir and Tokeer brought Salem to the ground in a neighbour's front garden. Salem was then subjected to a ferocious attack which left him with a brain injury and a fractured skull. Witnesses said about four Asian men were seen battering Salem with implements including a hockey stick and cricket bat. One witness pleaded with the attackers to stop, telling them that they were going to kill the man on the ground, but she was disregarded.http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/4794317.Munir_and_Tokeer_Hussain_sentencing__Judge_s_remarks/ At Reading Crown Court on 14 December 2009, Judge John Reddihough sentenced Munir Hussain to 30 months in prison whilst sentencing Tokeer to 39 months in prison (full transcript of judgement). Tokeer was given a harsher sentence because the judge said he had not faced as much provocation as his brother. On 20 January 2010 the Court of Appeal reduced Munir's sentence to one year, suspended for two years, which meant he was immediately freed. Tokeer's sentence was reduced to two years, but not suspended, which meant he remained in prison. This ruling was criticised by some lawyers as paying too much attention to media attention and public outcry, and they claimed that the law worked well as it stood. Others, including Chris Grayling, the Conservative shadow Home Secretary, considered that the law should be changed. It was later claimed that the motive for the break-in was not burglary, but that a man who (wrongly) believed his wife had had an affair with Munir Hussain had hired the three intruders to carry out an 'honour' attack. The wife stated there was no affair and that her only relationship with Munir was a business one, but her husband had become jealous because she had been happy at work. The wife is under police protection. The reports came as a surprise to the Hussains who believed the motive was robbery. However, during the Hussains' first trial, John Price QC, prosecuting, noted: On 29 March 2010 at Reading Crown Court, Wahleed Hussain, Munir's nephew, was freed after the jury were unable to reach a verdict over a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent relating to the attack on Salem.http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/localnews/wycombe/5414955.No_retrial_for_man_accused_of_attacking_intruder/ After the trial had ended (the last involving members of the Hussain family) Munir Hussain spoke out against his treatment: Contentious issues The contentious issue is the reasonableness of the force used, related to the delay between Munir Hussain's breaking free and the attack on Walid Salem, and the degree of force used. Judge Reddihough made this clear in his original judgement, and the then director of public prosecutions, later leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer QC, said after the conviction of Munir. Hence if there had been no time gap, and Salem had been subjected to a ferocious attack, or even killed, whilst Munir was breaking free, Munir would probably not have been charged. On the other hand, if Munir had had time to reflect on what had happened, and had then looked for Salem and beaten him up, his appeal would probably not have been successful, because it would have been considered a revenge attack. Unfortunately for Munir, English law treats the initial escape by Munir and the subsequent attack on Salem as two different incidents, although from Munir's point of view it could be argued there was no separation. The appeal succeeded (partially) because Intruders In September 2009, Walid Salem, then 57, was given a two-year non-custodial supervision order to the charge of false imprisonment of the Hussain family, as he was considered unfit to plead due to brain damage caused by the attack by Munir and Tokeer Hussain.http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1526219?UserKey= On 4 January 2009 Salem was arrested for a further five offences he was accused of committing after he had recovered from the attack. However, on 21 December 2009 he received an absolute discharge because he was deemed unfit to plead. The other two intruders have not been apprehended.

Team Rubicon identifies itself as a disaster response organization that leverages the unique skillsets of veterans and first responders to help disaster victims while using service and camaraderie to help veterans gain community, a sense of purpose, and identity to promote transition to civilian life. History Team Rubicon formed in January 2010 following the Haiti earthquake, when William McNulty and Jacob \\"Jake\\" Wood led a medical team into Port-au-Prince three days after the earthquake. The first Team Rubicon was an initial team of eight. They gathered funds and medical supplies from friends and family and flew into the Dominican Republic. They rented a truck, loaded their gear, and headed west to Haiti. The team treated thousands of patients, traveling to camps deemed ‚Äútoo dangerous‚Äù by other aid organizations. They ventured outside the traditional scale of disaster response, focusing on those who would be overlooked, untreated. That experience was the beginning of Team Rubicon. Team Rubicon wanted to solve two problems: (1) Inadequate disaster response which is often slow to respond, has an antiquated infrastructure, and is not using the best technological solutions or well-trained members and (2) inadequate veteran reintegration into civilian life. Military veterans' training, skills, and experience make them well suited to disaster response while helping others can promote healing and community to alleviate some of the reintegration issues that drive a high suicide rate among veterans. The death of fellow Rubicon member Clay Hunt from suicide redoubled Team Rubicon's organizational mission towards veteran reintegration. The team's role in domestic disasters is both to provide humanitarian assistance and to provide veterans an opportunity to continue to serve. The name Rubicon is from the phrase \\"crossing the Rubicon,\\" an idiom to mean passing a point of no return. The red and dark gray logo is made up of a sideways cross, a traditional symbol of first aid but here on its side as a departure from the traditional, with a river running through the logo, as a symbol of the gap between disasters and disaster relief. Wood and his work with Team Rubicon were profiled alongside fellow vet Eric Greitens and The Mission Continues founder as the subject of Time columnist Joe Klein's 2015 book, Charlie Mike. J.J. Watt, defensive end for the Houston Texans, raised an unexpected $37 million towards the Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, and so consulted SBP, a disaster relief organization based in New Orleans, and Team Rubicon for how to best spend the funds.  Scope of work  Since the Haiti earthquake, Team Rubicon has deployed on over 500 operations including international operations in Pakistan (2010 Pakistan floods), Chile (2010 Chile tsunami), Burma (2010 Thai-Burma border conflict), Sudan, Ecuador, Nepal, Greece, and Turkey and Hurricane Dorianin the Bahamas. Domestically, Team Rubicon has responded to large scale disasters such as Hurricane Matthew, Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Debby, Hurricane Isaac, Hurricane Sandy, the tornado destruction of Moore, Oklahoma., Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Florence, and Hurricane Michael. In 2019, Team Rubicon's Operation Heartlander responded to Winter Storm Ulmer that caused widespread damage across the American Midwest and provided assistance in eastern Nebraska, western Iowa, and on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. Many of Team Rubicon's hundreds of responses are to more localized disasters such as catastrophic snowstorms, smaller tornadoes, and flooding. With the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, Team Rubicon USA expanded its operational focus to include feeding programs in conjunction with Food Lifeline and Feeding America and Meals on Wheels and to take individual initiative, called \\"Neighbors Helping Neighbors\\", to safely assist their fellow community members. Team Rubicon also conducts wildfire mitigation operations that both serve as training opportunities and help protect vulnerable communities by removing potential fuels. In 2018 Team Rubicon became the first NGO in North America to receive WHO Emergency Medical Team Type 1 Mobile certification.  Leadership  In 2013, General (Ret.) David Petraeus joined Team Rubicon's Board of Advisors. Petraeus promoted the work of veteran reintegration, citing its importance to soldiers returning from war. Three years later, in 2016, civil rights expert Ehsan Zaffar joined the Board of Advisors. Additional high- profile advisors are General Stanley McChrystal, USA (Ret.) and former New York Stock Exchange CEO Duncan Niederauer, who serves on the board of directors. General James T. Conway, USMC (Ret.) and Lt Gen Russel L. Honor√©, USA (Ret.) as well as private sector business people Andy Bessette from Travelers Insurance, Jeff Dailey, CEO of Farmers Group, Gregg Lemkau from Goldman Sachs, John Pitts from Kirkland & Ellis, Richard Serino, former Deputy Administrator of FEMA, and Jeff Smith from FedEx serve as advisors to Team Rubicon. Many are former military or have logistical expertise that helps guide Team Rubicon. Additional high-profile supporters are former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. The George W. Bush Center included Team Rubicon as one of the case studies in its research on veteran serving nonprofits (VSNP).  Partnerships  Team Rubicon is or has partnered with many US corporations to support its mission including (list is not complete): * Got Your 6 . * Palantir Technologies. * Home Depot. * CASE Heavy Equipment. * Tough Mudder. * Jack Links. * Pepsi and Mountain Dew. * Carhartt. * Merrell.  Clay Hunt Fellows Program  The Clay Hunt Fellows Program is a leadership development fellowship created by Team Rubicon. It is named after Clay Hunt, one of the original members of Team Rubicon who suffered from PTSD and depression and committed suicide in 2011. It was founded in 2013 as a 12 month program, but has since been changed to a 6 month program.

It is now celebrated as the marque that won the inaugural Monte Carlo Rally, but in its prime it was also known for Grand Prix racing and for producing The Car of the Connoisseur. Prior to World War I it was closely associated with the Lorraine- Dietrich company. 1906 Turcat-M√©ry History 1903 Paris-Madrid race; Henri Rougier driving a Turcat-M√©ry 45 hp finished 11th overall, and 9th in the heavy car class In 1895 Alphonse M√©ry of Marseille bought a Panhard et Levassor and a Peugeot. His younger brother Simon M√©ry and his brother in law L√©on Turcat, both engineers, decided to improve on both models with their own design, a 2.6-litre, four-cylinder, five-speed car with electric ignition, radiators at each end of the engine and two speeds in reverse. Thus in 1899, when the car was ready for sale, they founded Turcat-M√©ry & Cie. They then established a partnership with Baron Adrien de Turckheim of the De Dietrich and Lorraine-Dietrich, and produced cars whose slogan was The Car of the Connoisseur. Henri Rougier became the Paris agent and chief publicist for both Turcat-M√©ry and Lorraine-Dietrich which he achieved by a long and successful career in motor racing and rallying. Turcat-M√©ry's liaison with Lorraine- Dietrich lasted until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Turcat-M√©ry ceased production in 1928. Models The 1899 Turcat-M√©ry had a 2.6-litre four- cylinder engine with magneto ignition. It also had a radiator at each end of the engine, chain drive and a five-speed gearbox with two speeds in reverse. Some Turcat-M√©ry designs were produced by the De Dietrich. In 1907 Turcat-M√©ry produced their first six-cylinder model, but the four-cylinder models from 2.6 to 6.3 litres continued until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. After World War I production concentrated on the 15/25 hp (RAC rating of 15.9 hp) with a 3-litre, four-cylinder long-stroke, fixed head engine. It also had a cone clutch and a foot-operated transmission brake. In the early/mid-1920s, Turcat- M√©ry introduced an advanced, overhead-camshaft engine. In the mid-1920s Turcat-M√©ry attempted to find new markets by switching to smaller-capacity proprietary-engined models, but it was unsuccessful so they ceased car production in 1928. Motor racing Henri Rougier and the victorious 45 hp Turcat-M√©ry before the inaugural Monte Carlo rally Henri Rougier was the main dealer for Turcat-M√©ry motor vehicles, and like most other manufacturers he used racing and competition as both a technical development and publicity aid for marketing. In May 1903 Rougier finished 11th overall in the Paris-Madrid race driving a 45 hp Turcat-M√©ry. He was also classified 9th in the heavy car class. On 17 June 1904 Rougier competed in the Gordon Bennett Cup race in Germany driving a 45 hp Turcat-M√©ry. Kaiser Wilhelm II had decreed that the race start from Bad Homburg in the Taunus mountains. Rougier finished in third place, taking 6 hours 46 minutes 31 seconds to complete the . Monte Carlo rally In 1909 the Automobile Club de Monaco (Sport Automobile Velocipedique Monegasque) started planning a car rally at the behest of Albert I, Prince of Monaco. The Monte Carlo Rally was to start at points all over Europe and converge on Monte Carlo. In January 1911 23 cars set out from 11 different locations and Rougier was among the nine who left Paris to cover a route. The event was won by Henri Rougier in a Turcat-M√©ry 45 hp. The rally comprised both driving and then somewhat arbitrary judging based on the elegance of the car, passenger comfort and the condition in which it arrived in the principality. The outcry of scandal when the results were published changed nothing, so Rougier was proclaimed the first winner. Rougier ‚Äî Turcat-M√©ry Share of the Ateliers de Construction d'Automobiles Turcat-M√©ry SA, issued 1 November 1921 After World War I Henri Rougier purchased a limited number of completed 1913/14 Turcat-M√©ry chassis which he then had reworked to improve the engines and 4-wheel brakes using Henri Perrot's latest drum/shoe brake design. The chassis were then bodied by coach builders such as Million-Guillet in Levallois-Perret, Paris, and the exclusive finished models were badged and registered as 'Rougier'. Notes a. Henri Perrot was a French engineer who patented his designs for drum brakes and shoes. In 1924, after meeting at a European auto show, Vincent Bendix acquired the license to manufacture Perrot's shoe-brake patents.

He works on live performances in the United States and elsewhere, including choreography, digital media, cross-disciplinary collaborations, and social enterprise. Education Originally from Ithaca, New York, Bokaer trained in dance at Cornell University, and subsequently graduated from University of North Carolina School of the Arts as a North Carolina Academic Scholar (Contemporary Dance/Performance, 2000). Recruited for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company at the unprecedented age of 18, Bokaer pursued a parallel degree in Visual & Media Studies at The New School (2003‚Äì2007), where he received the Joan Kirnsner Memorial Award. Additional studies in media and performance occurred at Parsons The New School for Design, NYU Performance Studies, and through self-taught explorations into digital media and 3D animation: such studies led to the development of a rare, multi-disciplinary approach to choreography, addressing the human body in relation to contemporary technologies. Dance and choreography As a dancer, Bokaer has worked with Merce Cunningham (2000‚Äì2007), John Jasperse (2004‚Äì2005), David Gordon (2005‚Äì2006), Deborah Hay (2005), Tino Sehgal (2008), and many others. He has also interpreted the choreography of George Balanchine as restaged by Melissa Hayden. Bokaer is also a frequent choreographer for Robert Wilson (2007‚ÄìPresent). Bokaer is the author of 30 original choreographies, produced in Belgium, Canada, Cuba, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, India, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Recent engagements include the Attakalari Performance Biennale (Bangalore 2009), the Rotterdamse Schouwburg (Holland 2010), Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (Becket, MA 2011), Festival d'Avignon (Avignon, 2012), BAM Next Wave Festival, and a commission from the National Academy of Sciences (Washington, D.C.). Activism and social enterprise Under the leadership Bokaer in 2002, a group of artists and choreographers formed Chez Bushwick, an adventurous arts organization that has significantly impacted a new generation of dance artists, choreographers, and performers in the United States, and beyond. Founding artists developed a series of public programs that have become emblematic of a new way of working in New York City: across borders, across disciplines, employing variable aesthetic signatures, and overturning divisions between choreographer, curator, producer, and audience member. Through strategies of collaboration, activism, and public dialogue, these cultural strategies have achieved economic justice during a challenging real estate and funding climate in NYC. Chez Bushwick was recently awarded by the Rockefeller Foundation NYC Cultural Innovation Fund. Bokaer is a co-founder of the Center for Performance Research (CPR), a nonprofit organization in collaboration with John Jasperse/Thin Man Dance. CPR's L.E.E.D.-certified green building, the first in Brooklyn, provides affordable space for rehearsal and performance, arts programming, education and engagement with the community. Writing Bokaer's writings have been published in Artwurl, The American Society for Alexander Teachers, Critical Correspondence, AADIAL Magazine, Goldrush Dance Magazine, ITCH, Movement Research Performance Journal, and NYFA Current.

BOB's goal according to its website is \\"to support local business development and increase job opportunities for inner-city residents by championing an inclusive revitalization process\\". Creating BOB Vancouver's inner city. The dark grey areas are where BOB's efforts are focused as per the Vancouver Agreement. The creation of BOB came as a direct result of the Vancouver Agreement an urban development initiative between the governments of Canada, British Columbia, and the City of Vancouver. BOB's role as defined by the agreement is to promote business development, offer mentoring and employment training as well as administering a loans program to inner-city small businesses. In the time since its creation the organization has developed from being seen largely as an employment agency into being recognized as a credible and reliable source for a variety of information on the DTES. Separating itself from the legacy or failures of PEACH, the economic development and job creation organization that BOB was created to replace and distinguishing itself as a separate and unique entity has been a challenge to the organization. While some of the people and resources from PEACH were transferred to BOB the organization was created as a comprehensive new service to address the needs of business and employment. Fast Track to Employment (FTE)another organization active in the DTES has remained its own agency working in tandem with BOB. With a mandate to create employment opportunities by working with employers and residents FTE operates within the BOB offices as an affiliated or sister charitable organization sharing the same board of directors as BOB. BOB as an organization has made efforts in the media to clarify its role in the DTES while addressing a diverse range of policy and planning issues relevant to Vancouver's inner-city such as STIR (Short Term Incentives for Rental Housing)Stir is a step in the right direction, Shirley Chan, Vancouver Sun, 2009 https://vancouversun.com/opinion/STIR+step+right+direction/2373405/story.html homelessness and economic developmentStephanie Levitz, Hope and despair in Vancouver's Eastside, The Canadian Press, CTV, Monday December 28, 2009 http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news-centre/newsid=23996.html and industry clusteringClustering in Action, Robert Matas, Globe and Mail, December 18, 2009 http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20091218.escenic_1406276/BNStory/National/ Though becoming more widely recognized in 2008 and 2009 the organization has struggled to overcome obscurity concerning its past and present work. Directly related to its support of clustering in Vancouver's inner-city, BOB has also been noted for its co-working space made available for bloggers, independent media/social media, as well as independent contractors and consultants working in Vancouver's DTES.(Downtown Eastside) The BOB co-working space is also utilized as an art gallery and presentation space and is an official host gallery of the 2010 Winter Olympics' Cultural Olympiad. The organization has also been noted for placing focus on social enterprise in the inner-city and was instrumental in the support and creation of the SOLEFood Inner City Farm Project along with Seann Dory of United We Can, and local property owners Gudy and Pal Sahota. BOB and the Millennium CBA (Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village) BOB was involved in the creation of Vancouver's first Community Benefits Agreement centred on the construction of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village. While this development has been criticized for going over- budgetOlympic village $130 million over budget: audit, Miro Cernetig,Vancouver Sun, October 6, 2009 https://vancouversun.com/business/Vancouver+Olympic+Village+million+over+budget+report/2072466/story.html the CBA may potentially serve as a valuable example of the emerging potential between investors, developers and social enterprise in urban planning. The CBA was a collective effort between the City of Vancouver, BOB, VANOC and Millennium Development Corporation focusing on job creation for local residents and encouraging direct procurement of goods and services from the Downtown Eastside as per the needs of the Olympic Village development. Other major partners included Bell, VanCity Credit Union, the Province of British Columbia and the Federal Government (as represented through the Vancouver agreement)as well as the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation and the Vancouver Regional Construction Association. Criticism of BOB BOB has been the recipient of criticism from both activists who view the organization as a potential agent of gentrification and from other individuals active in the DTES. The organization has made efforts to clarify its role in the DTES in response to these criticisms. PEACH (Partners for Economic and Community Health) having been proven largely ineffective in its approach was dismantled and its funding halted. BOB, though supporting a different development model and with different roles has also been viewed by some in Vancouver's DTES as not serving its primary purpose or being effective enough in job creation. Kim Kerr, executive director for the Downtown Eastside Residents Association and Vancouver employment councilor Ruth Meta are examples of vocal critics. Meta and BOB CEO Shirley Chan both commented on BOB's role and work in the DTES through a series of articles in the Vancouver Courier in 2009 It is rumored that Meta reconciled with BOB after this exchange.

Wrigley, a chewing gum manufacturer and owner of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, materialized his idea as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the World War II military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players. Ann Harnett became the first girl signed by the league for its inaugural season, being followed by Claire Schillace, Perlick and Shirley Jameson.Northern Indiana Center for History AAGPBL career Perlick enjoyed many firsts in her illustrious baseball career. She was one of the original 60 players in the league, and her team, the Racine Belles, won the first AAGPBL Championship Title in 1943, defeating the Kenosha Comets three games to none. She also became the first left fielder to be included in the All-Star Team, a distinction that she repeated in 1947 and 1948.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Teams In an eight-season career, Perlick was a .240 hitter in a pitching-dominated league. In her rookie season, she batted a career-best .268, which was the league's 12th highest average among regular players.

Usually, she led the Belles in runs batted in, driving in a career-high 63 runs in 1944 to set a Racine season- record, leading again led the Belles in 1945 (41), 1948 (51), 1949 (41) and 1950 (59).

Baseball Historian But at the end of 1950 the Belles lacked the financial resources to keep the club playing in Racine, Wisconsin. Before the 1951 season, when the team moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, Perlick, along with original Belles Eleanor Dapkus, Maddy English, Sophie Kurys and Joanne Winter, were disappointment and decided not to make the move. During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, always like a family away from home. Perlick and teammates thought that all would be different, like a new team, maybe a new manager and, specially, a new location.A League Of My Own: Memoir of a Pitcher for the All-American Girls ‚Äì Patricia I.

Perlick returned to Chicago and played fast-pitch softball for two years with the Admiral Music Maids of the National Girls Baseball League. Milestone In 1980, former AAGPBL player June Peppas motivated a group of friends and began assembling a list of names and addresses of her former pals. Her initiative turned into a newsletter and resulted in the league‚Äôs first- ever reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. Stemming from that reunion, a Players Association was formed in 1987 and many former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1998.SABR Biography Project, by Jim Sargent In November 1988, Perlick, along with her former teammates and opponents, received their long overdue recognition, when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York dedicated a permanent display to the All American Girls Professional Baseball league. The association was largely responsible for the opening of the exhibition. Private life After being married in 1952, she also played under the name Edie Keating or Edie Perlick Keating. At age 30, she left the game, raised her daughter, Susan, and worked in Chicago for manufacturing firms A.B. Dick Company and Teletype Corporation. She had two grandsons, Danny and Jeff. After moving to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, she worked another 25 years for Harris Corporation, a computer systems company. She retired in 1993 and moved to Pompano Beach, Florida, where she died at the age of 80.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports ‚Äì David L. Porter. Publisher: Greenwood Press, 2000.

She may have been murdered by Alexander's first wife, Roxana, in 323 BC. Early life After her father's murder in 338 BC, her brother Arses ruled briefly, before being succeeded by their second cousin, Darius III, in 336 BC.Garthwaite (2005), p. 39. It is likely that after her father's death, Parysatis and her sisters continued to live at the Persian court. During Darius's campaign against the invasion by Alexander the Great, Parysatis and her sisters, along with many other members of the Persian elite, accompanied the Persian army. Following the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, Parysatis and many of her relatives were captured in Damascus by Macedonian general Parmenion.Carney (2000), p. 110. Alexander III of Macedon It is possible that Parysatis remained at Susa with the women of Darius's family while Alexander led a campaign in India. According to Arrian, in 324 Parysatis married Alexander at Susa. On the same day, Alexander married Darius's eldest daughter, Stateira. By wedding both women, Alexander cemented his ties to both branches of the royal family of the Achaemenid Empire.O'Brien (2001), p. 197. The marriage celebration lasted five days. During that time, 90 other Persian noblewomen were married to Macedonian and other Greek soldiers who were loyal to Alexander. After the marriage, there are no further written accounts that refer to Parysatis by name; however, some historians, including Elizabeth Donnelly Carney, believe that in an account of the death of Stateira, Plutarch misidentified Parysatis as Stateira's sister Drypetis. In Plutarch's history, after Alexander's death in 323 BC, his first wife, Roxana, ordered the murder of Stateira and her sister in order to cement her own position and that of her son, Alexander. Carney maintains that Parysatis \\"makes more sense as a murder victim\\". If Parysatis were Alexander's wife, then, like Stateira, there was a possibility that she could be ‚Äì or could claim to be ‚Äì pregnant with his child, and thus pose a threat to Roxana.

Production Down the Line is a spoof radio chat show broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 2006 and 2013 which satirises populist radio phone in shows. Following its success, writers Higson and Whitehouse looked to transfer the format to television; however, it was apparent that the phone-in format would not work, so they decided instead to satirise the celebrity travelogue such as David Dimbleby's How We Built Britain and Alan Titchmarsh's British Isles ‚Äì A Natural History. In the television programme, radio talk show host Gary Bellamy travels around Britain in his Triumph Stag 'personality vehicle' meeting the people of Britain and trying to find out what makes them tick. The show's working title was Bellamy's Kingdom. The show was Higson and Whitehouse's first television appearance together since Swiss Toni in 2004. Whitehouse's characters included 23-stone Graham Downes who rarely left his bed. On 13 May 2010, the BBC announced that they would not be commissioning a second series of Bellamy's People.

He was briefly the brother-in-law of Octavian (the future emperor Augustus) trought Octavian's marriage to his sister Clodia Pulchra. Biography=Early life Publius, who was the son of Publius Clodius Pulcher and Fulvia, had one full sister Clodia Pulchra, and three half-brothers, Gaius Scribonius Curio, Marcus Antonius Antyllus and Iullus Antonius from his mothers later marriages to Gaius Scribonius Curio (married in 52 BC) and Mark Antony (married in 49 BC). His father Clodius might have been married to a woman named Pinaria Natta before Fulvia, but there are no children known from this possible match.Wilhelm Drumann, Geschichte Roms vol. ii, p. 370. It is not known exactly when he was born, but he was still referred to as a \\"boy\\" (puer) in 44 BC and he was likely born no earlier than 60 BC.Lyubimova O. Octavian's Marriage to Livia: Benefits or Risks? // Bulletin of ancient history. - 2016. - No. 1 . - P. 96. In 59 Publius's father (who was born as a patrician) was adopted by a man of plebian status named Publius Fonteius and changed the spelling of his own name from Publius Claudius Pulcher to Publius Clodius Pulcher. If Publius was born after this he might have been born under the name \\"Clodius\\", although it is known that he reverted back to the patrician spelling at some point after his father's death. In 52 BC when his father was killed by Titus Annius Milo and his followers, there were accusations that Milo had also had a slave abduct the boy from his father's villa in Alba and bring him to see the body of his father and to demand that he allow them to cut up Clodius's body. At his father's funeral he was not considered old enough to deliver a funeral oration. Around this time he was referred to as a parvulushttps://www.jstor.org/stable/311008 which would mean \\"little child\\".https://books.google.se/books?id=rtVGAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA189&dq;=%22parvulus%22+years+old&hl;=sv&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjB54jfw- rrAhXzAhAIHWKYD5YQ6AEwAnoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q;=%22parvulus%22%20years%20old&f;=false Publius appears to have been raised by his mother's last husband Mark Antony. As a young man he likely asked for Antony to recall the exiled Sextus Cloelius (sometimes called \\"Sextus Clodius\\") as a favour. Sextus had been a major supporter of his father. His younger sister Clodia married Octavian around 43-41 BC but when relations between Octavian and his mother Fulvia broke down about a year later the marriage was broken off. Fulvia died of illness in 40 BC in Greece after traveling with her children following battles with Octavians forces. Career Valerius Maximus regarded Publius as a lethargic nonentity who only rose to the Praetorship after 31 BC under the Second Triumvirs and died young amid scandals of luxurious excess and an obsessive attachment to a common prostitute.Valerius Maximus III.5.3 Besides his praetorhip he was also a quaestor and a member of the priestly college of the augurs.ILS 882 It is possible that he survived the Battle of Actium and went over to Octavian's side after the defeat of his step-father Mark Antony, later making a further career under the emperor.Tatum J.

An inscription of ownership on an expensive Egyptian alabaster vase once owned by him has survived to attest to his short official career, and includes an unusual triple filiation which confirms the literary evidence to the effect that Clodius' own filiation was: Ap. f.

The inscription is = ILS 882 Family He seems to have had at least one son, Appius Claudius Pulcher. The son may have been born some time in the 20s BC. There has also been some speculation among historians such as George Patrick Goold that he might have been the father of Claudia Pulchra who was the daughter of Augustus' niece Claudia Marcella Minor. Some historians such as Ronald Syme have rejected this proposal while others like Susan Treggiari are open to the possibility.https://books.google.se/books?id=Kx6DDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT291&dq;=marcella+pulcher+conceivably&hl;=sv&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj00-_Q7errAhXtAxAIHS2VAbIQ6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q;=marcella%20pulcher%20conceivably&f;=false Another interpetation put forth is that Claudia Pulchra was indeed Publius daughter, but by Claudia Marcella Major, the elder sister of Claudia Marcella Minor. Goold argues that an engagement between Publius and Marcella would have fit the political climate around 43 BC when Octavian himself was marrying Clodia. He conjectures that the future emperor might have reasoned that bethroding his niece to a son of plebian hero would have its advantages after his experience with the Pseudo-Marius.

Background  \\"Mind Your Own Business\\" was recorded on March 2, 1949, at Castle Studio in Nashville. During the same session, Williams also recorded \\"You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)\\", \\"My Son Calls Another Man Daddy\\", and \\"Honky Tonk Blues\\". He is backed by Dale Potter (fiddle), Don Davis (steel guitar), Zeke Turner (lead guitar), Clyde Baum (mandolin), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), and probably Ernie Newton (bass). Content In the song, the narrator admonishes a local busybody for snooping and gossiping. While the delivery is light and breezy, the song's lyrics were likely inspired by the singer's own tempestuous relationship with wife Audrey Williams and the buzz it created. The opening lines seem to reference this: \\"If the wife and I are fussin', brother that's our right/'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a licence to fight...\\" His delivery is measured, laconic, and dry. The day before, Hank had cut several duets with his wife Audrey, who by all accounts had limited singing talent. Introducing it in October 1949, he told his radio audience that it was a \\"little prophecy in song\\", and indeed it would prove to be.

History Palermo‚Äôs founders, Gaspare (Jack) Fallucca and his wife, Zina, immigrated to the U.S. They settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and had three sons, Peter, Giacomo, and Angelo. The company began in 1964 as an Italian bakery on Milwaukee‚Äôs East Side. Initially selling Italian breads, cookies, and cannoli, they later added Italian soups and sandwiches. Soon they acquired the hardware store next door and expanded. Jack and Zina opened a pizzeria & restaurant in 1969. A local grocery store owner, impressed with their Pizza products, urged Jack and Zina to go into the frozen food business. The company began making frozen Pizza and Pizza bread in an old bakery that was renovated into a manufacturing facility in 1979. These Pizzas and Pizza breads were sold under the Palermo‚Äôs brand name, and Jack Fallucca soon became known as ‚ÄúPapa Palermo.‚Äù In fall 2009, Palermo Villa Inc. announced plans to expand its existing company headquarters in the Menomonee River Valley.Daykin, Tom. \\"Private-label pizza growth helps Palermo expand\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Milwaukee, December 26, 2009.

Trademark infringement claim In March 2007, Palermo Villa Inc. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Trader Joe's in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee. The frozen pizza manufacturer claimed the grocery chain was trading the Palermo's Pizza brand unfairly under the name Pizza Palermo. The two companies reached a settlement in July 2007 leading Palermo Villa to pursue no further action. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed to the public.Daykin, Tom. \\"'Palermo' pizza trademark dispute settled\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Milwaukee, July 18, 2007. Labor dispute On June 1, 2012, about 100 or half of Palermo's workers went on strike to protest the firing of nearly all 89 immigrant workers lacking necessary documentation in what striking workers claim to be retaliation for signing a petition to form a union, as well as what they said were poor wages and working conditions. Activist groups such as the Overpass Light Brigade, and Voces de la Frontera have supported and picketed with the strikers, as well as Labor unions across the United States who called for a boycott of Palermo's products. Progress On August 31, 2012, Palermo CEO Giacomo Fallucca and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka met to discuss issues and concerns, but the meeting yielded no progress on the strike. Palermo's officials counter strikers' claims saying that the company acted to terminate employment of workers lacking specific documentation in response to warnings it had received from federal immigration authorities to fire unauthorized workers or face hefty fines. In November 2012, the National Labor Relations Board ruled in the 5-month-old strike that it had found that the company acted lawfully when it terminated 75 workers as part of an immigration audit and did not use the audit as retaliation for the workers' efforts to form a union, but that Palermo's did violate federal law when it fired nine workers, including two temporary workers, in retaliation for engaging in or supporting the strike and union activity.

Contrary to the common view that cultural evolution has made human biological evolution insignificant, Hawks believes that biological evolution has sped up in recent history. Biography Hawks graduated from Kansas State University in 1994 with degrees in French, English, and Anthropology. He received both his M.A. and Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Michigan where he studied under Milford Wolpoff. His doctoral thesis was titled, \\"The Evolution of Human Population Size: A Synthesis of Paleontological, Archaeological, and Genetic Data.\\" After working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah, he moved to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he is currently a member of the Anthropology department, teaching courses including Human Evolution, Biological Anthropology, and Hominid Paleoecology. In 2014, Hawks launched an online course on Coursera under the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison banner, on \\"Human Evolution: Past and Future\\". Areas of interest Hawks believes that human evolution has actually sped up in recent history in contrast to the common assumption that biological evolution has been made insignificant by cultural evolution. He covers recent developments on this topic at his blog. Hawks has predicted introgression including the Neanderthal admixture hypothesis which gained further evidence by the Neanderthal genome project in May 2010. Hawks believes that contemporary human mitochondrial genetics, including lack of any human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups from Eurasian archaic Homo sapiens may be in part due to natural selection of mtDNA on metabolic or other factors, rather than simple total replacement and genetic drift. Hawks has also discussed the cladistic classification of the Hominidae and has criticized the proliferation of terms like hominin. The John Hawks Blog The John Hawks Weblog is a widely read and referenced science blog as measured by Technorati's ranking. The blog deals primarily with Paleoanthropology. The blog provides analysis of current research in Paleoanthropology, discussing the significance and implications of fossils related to human evolution, genetics and genomics of hominid populations (alive and extinct), archaeological topics, as well as general commentary and review of both scientific and popular literature. Hawks has also written extensively about the experience of blogging about one's field while working in academia. He is one of few academics to publish both a widely read daily blog and remain an active researcher and professor at a major research university, though he notes that this trend seems to be changing.

The Court found that police do not have the right to perform a sniffer-dog search (to use dogs to conduct random searches) of public spaces when such search is not specifically authorized by statute. In this case, a student's section 8 rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\\"Charter\\") were violated when a police officer sniffer-dog searched his unattended backpack in the gymnasium of his school finding drugs in his possession. Background On November 7, 2002, at St. Patrick's Catholic High School in Sarnia, Ontario, the police accepted a long-standing invitation by the principal of a high school to bring sniffer dogs into the school to search for drugs. The police had no knowledge drugs were present in the school and would not have been able to obtain a warrant to search the school. While all the students were confined to their classrooms, the principal told the students to leave their backpacks in their lockers. The students who had come in late had to put their backpacks in the gym. After passing the lockers, the officer then had a drug-sniffing dog sniff the unattended backpacks lined up against a wall in the gymnasium. The dog reacted and bit one of the backpacks. Without obtaining a warrant, the police opened the backpack and found illicit drugs. They charged the student who owned the backpack with possession of marijuana and psilocybin for the purpose of trafficking. Lower court rulings=Trial Court At trial, the accused brought an application for exclusion of the evidence, arguing that his rights under section 8 of the Charter had been violated. The trial judge allowed the application, finding two unreasonable searches: the search conducted with the sniffer dog and the search of the backpack. He excluded the evidence and acquitted the accused. Court of Appeal On appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed with the trial judge and upheld the acquittal. No school authority requested the presence of police on that day, and no school official played any active role in the search. The \\"standing invitation\\" to the police to conduct a sniffer-dog search of the school did not render this search a \\"search by school authorities\\". Supreme Court Ruling The Court found that students are entitled to privacy in a school environment. Since there was no authority in the statutes or at common law for the sniffer dog search in this case, the search violated section 8 of the Charter. Consequently, the evidence should be excluded as it would interfere with the fairness of justice under section 24(2) of the Charter. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed. The following issues were put to the Court: # whether dog sniff constituted search of content of student backpack # if so, whether the search was reasonable. # if the search was unreasonable and the appellant's rights were violated, whether the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; # whether common law powers of police to investigate crime include use of sniffer dogs. Opinion of the Court The majority agreed that the dog sniff amounted to a search within section 8 of the Charter because by use of the dog, the police officer could \\"see\\" through the concealing fabric of the backpack, and students are entitled to privacy in a school environment. Since there was no authority in the statutes or at common law for the warrantless sniffer dog search in this case, the search violated section 8 of the Charter. Expectation of privacy standard Teenagers expect the contents of their backpacks not to be open to the random and speculative scrutiny of the police. This expectation is a reasonable one that society should support. The guilty secret of the contents of the accused's backpack was specific and meaningful information, intended to be private, and concealed in an enclosed space in which the accused had a continuing expectation of privacy. Although a warrantless sniffer dog search is available where reasonable suspicion is demonstrated, the sniffer dog search of the students' belongings in this case violated their Charter rights under section 8. The dog sniff search was unreasonably undertaken because there was no proper justification. The youth court judge found that the police lacked any grounds for reasonable suspicion and excluded the evidence. The Court agreed that his exclusion of the evidence should not be interfered with. Reasonable suspicion standard In the context of a routine criminal investigation, the police are entitled to use sniffer dogs based on a \\"reasonable suspicion\\". If there are no grounds of reasonable suspicion, the use of the sniffer dogs will violate the section 8 reasonableness standard. In this case, the search was executed unreasonably, and thereby constituted a Charter breach, on the basis of which the evidence obtained may be excluded. The importance of proper tests and records of particular dogs will be an important element in establishing the reasonableness of a particular sniffer dog search. Sniffer dog context In sniffer dog situations, the police are generally required to take quick action guided by on the spot observations. In circumstances where this generally occurs, it is not feasible to subject the \\"sniffer dog‚Äôs\\" sniff to prior judicial authorization. Both the subject and his suspicious belongings would be long gone before the paperwork could be done. In the particular context of sniffer dogs, there is sufficient protection for the public in the prior requirement of reasonable suspicion and after the fact judicial review to satisfy the \\"reasonableness\\" requirement of section 8. The trade-off for permitting the police to deploy their dogs on a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" standard without a warrant is that if this procedure is abused and sniffer dog searches proceed without reasonable suspicion based on objective facts, the consequence could well tip the balance against the admission of the evidence if it is established under section 24(2) of the Charter that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Dissent Bastarache, Deschamps and Rothstein JJ dissented. Deschamps and Rothstein JJ found there was no need to determine whether section 8 of the Charter was violated because the dog sniff of the backpack at the school did not amount to a search. Hence, there was no need to determine whether the evidence should be excluded pursuant to section 24(2) of the Charter. Bastarache J found that the police possess a common law power to search using drug sniffer dogs on the basis of a Charter compliant standard of generalized suspicion and that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence pursuant to section 24(2) of the Charter. Rothstein J in held that the combination of the school's advertised \\"zero-tolerance\\" drug policy, the drugs in schools and the unattended state of the suspect's backpack reduced his privacy expectation to zero.

Some roads change names or route numbers across town borders, resulting in occasional confusion. For example, the road known as Apache Boulevard in Tempe continues east as Main Street in neighboring Mesa and then as Apache Trail in Apache Junction. Although Broadway Road maintains the same name through Goodyear, Avondale, Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa, and Apache Junction, each town uses a different reference point for address numbers. Baseline Road Baseline Road is a significant east-west arterial road. This road is so named because it runs along the length of the primary baseline for Arizona as given under the Public Land Survey System. This line runs east-west from the \\"zero point\\" atop a hill near the confluence of the Gila and Salt rivers, on Avondale Boulevard (115th Avenue) at Baseline Road. This site is next to Phoenix Raceway. Avondale Boulevard is laid out atop the north-south base meridian, called the Gila and Salt River meridian. Due to natural obstructions, Baseline is not continuous. The longest continuous stretch of Baseline Road is approximately 43 miles. The road is located in Maricopa County and Pinal County. There is also a rural road named Baseline Road in southern La Paz County close to the Colorado River which is located near Arizona's baseline. Because of the grid plan used by cities in Arizona, the name for the road is applied for non-contiguous sections and is theoretically reserved for future east-west roads built at the same latitude. Route description Starting from east, the road begins in Apache Junction in Pinal County, named Baseline Avenue and is a small segment of thoroughfare in a residential neighborhood at the foothills of the Superstition Mountains. The route picks up again and runs due westward, running parallel to US 60. At the Maricopa County border, the road enters Mesa and is named Baseline Road. It becomes a major arterial road as it passes through Gilbert and Tempe. In Tempe, it intersects Loop 101 and then Interstate 10. Continuing, the road runs through south Phoenix and the major arterial segment of the road terminates in the Gila River Indian Community, approximately where the Salt River joins the Gila River. The road reappears on the other side of the Gila River at an orthogonal junction with Perryville Rd. as CR-85 and continues westward through central Buckeye. From there, it continues through farmland in western Maricopa county in various non-continuous segments. The segment of Baseline Road farthest west in Maricopa County is just past 547th Avenue. Due to the ease of navigation on this extremely long route, as well as the significant number of municipalities that the route encompasses, it is a favorite street for those electing not to use Phoenix's many freeways such as I-10 and US 60.  Landmarks  Notable locations along or near Baseline Road include Arizona Mills and Phoenix International Raceway. Baseline Road runs through the historical farming community of Laveen. Bell Road The Scottsdale Spire, located in the southeast corner of Bell and Scottsdale Roads. Bell Road is a major east-west arterial road in northern metropolitan Phoenix. Bell Road is one of the few roadways to cross the Agua Fria River in the northern part of the metro area, providing a vital link between the growing suburb of Surprise with Phoenix. As a result, the portion of Bell Road passing through Surprise and Sun City is the busiest arterial road in the state of Arizona. Route description The main segment of Bell Road, approximately in length, begins at the corporate boundaries of Phoenix and Scottsdale at its intersection with Scottsdale Road; east of Scottsdale Road, the roadway curves to the southeast and becomes Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard. Traveling west, the road intersects with State Route 51 and Interstate 17 in Phoenix, the western leg of State Route 101 in Peoria, and U.S. Route 60 and State Route 303 in Surprise. West of the Beardsley Canal, the roadway curves around the White Tank Mountain Regional Park, becoming the Sun Valley Parkway through northern Buckeye. East of 66th Street, Bell Road takes a south- easterly bend and, at its intersection with Scottsdale Road, becomes Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard, named in recognition of architect and designer Frank Lloyd Wright. This alignment was built in the mid-1970s during the construction of the CAP canal. In this area of Scottsdale, a non-contiguous segment of Bell Road approximately long exists north of Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard, which includes an intersection with the eastern leg of State Route 101. Landmarks Prominent locations on or near Bell Road include the Scottsdale Municipal Airport, Turf Paradise, Arrowhead Towne Center and the Peoria Sports Complex. Bell Road also forms the boundary of the original town site of Surprise. Camelback Road Camelback Mountain The Arizona Biltmore Hotel Camelback Road is a prominent street in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The street stretches continuously for approximately 33 miles from Scottsdale in the east to Litchfield Park in the west, and in the process runs through the city of Phoenix. Scottsdale Fashion Square is located at the corner of Camelback and Scottsdale Roads. Camelback Road runs directly south of Phoenix's famous Camelback Mountain and the Phoenician Resort. Further west, the upscale Biltmore district of Phoenix is located along Camelback Road, including the Arizona Biltmore Hotel (just to the north), Biltmore Fashion Park, as well as one of Phoenix's primary business districts (sometimes called the Camelback Corridor). In Litchfield Park, Camelback Road passes the historic Wigwam Resort, built in 1918.http://www.wigwamresort.com/ West of Litchfield Park, Camelback Road skirts the southern boundary of Luke Air Force Base. Central Avenue The Brophy College Chapel Central Avenue extends from South Mountain Park to North Mountain in Phoenix. The Central Avenue Corridor, roughly from Camelback Road to McDowell Road, is one of Phoenix's most heavily trafficked stretches of roadway. The Central Avenue Corridor bisects the area known as Midtown, Phoenix, a collection of neighborhoods north of Downtown and south of the North-Central and Sunnyslope areas. For the most part, Central Avenue marks the \\"zero\\" point of east/west addresses in the Phoenix area. Grand Avenue Rehbein Grocery built in 1920 and located in 1227-1231 Grand Ave. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, reference: #85002895. The portion of U.S. Route 60 that enters Phoenix from the northwest Valley is known as Grand Avenue, a street which slices through west Phoenix at a 45-degree angle. This makes it instantly recognizable on any City of Phoenix map, and it represents the final leg of US 60 into the heart of Phoenix. Although US 60 departs Grand Ave. at an interchange with 27th Avenue, Grand Ave. itself continues southeast towards the intersection of 7th Avenue and Van Buren Street. As of 2006, Lower Grand Avenue, between Roosevelt Street on the north and Van Buren Street on the south, has been experiencing a renaissance, as art venues, bars, cafes and small businesses have emerged amid the work being done to restore historic properties, including decaying warehouses. On the first and third Fridays of every month, Grand Avenue hosts cultural events. Some of the venues associated with the Grand Avenue art scene include the Trunk Space, the Lodge Art Parlor, ShopDevious, the Icon Gallery, the Chocolate Factory, the Paisley Violin, La Melgosa Complex: Deus Ex Machina, the Phoenix Fall Space, Stop n' Look & Comet's Corner, the Annex: Soul Invictus, the Lucky Rabbit & Gallery Marsiglia, Lady Luck Tattoo, and other design houses and studios. As a result of this revitalization the Grand Avenue Merchants Association (GAMA) formed to address a \\"Grand New Vision\\" and to bring the Grand Avenue community together with other neighborhood associations to form an arts, culture and small business district with a mind towards adaptive reuse of historical buildings, infill projects and both small business and community based outreach. In 2011, the City of Phoenix was chosen as one of five U.S. capitals to receive federal design assistance through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greening America‚Äôs Capitals program, with the goal of creating a more environmentally and economically sustainable design along the lower Grand Avenue corridor. Indian School Road Historic Phoenix Indian Schoolmission-revival style Memorial Hall built in 1922 as part of the Phoenix Indian School Indian School Road runs continuously east/west for approximately 41 miles with the Salt River Pima- Maricopa Indian Community at the east end and Buckeye & Maricopa County White Tank Mountain Regional Park at the west end. It intersects with Arizona State Route 101, Arizona State Route 51, Interstate 17, US 60/Grand Avenue and Arizona State Route 303. Though running predominantly through the metro Phoenix area, Indian School Road does continue west of the White Tank Mountains from approximately 27600 West to 41100 West (411th Avenue being an overpass and access to Tonopah and Interstate 10) to 46700 West, and from 48700 West to Harquahala Valley Road (52000 West).

Hayden, the Hayden Mill lends its name to Mill Avenue in Tempe, AZ. In the foreground is Tempe Town Lake, a popular recreation area. Mill Avenue is a historic street in Tempe. In north Tempe near Arizona State University, the street runs through a popular, pedestrian-friendly shopping and nightlife district. Mill Avenue was originally centered around the Hayden Flour Mill, which, while disused, still stands on the north end of the Avenue. Today, the avenue plays host to many bars, designer shopping stores, as well as many fairs, and city festivals. It was described in 2010 by a New York Times reporter as \\"a bohemian commercial strip next to Arizona State University\\".\\"Republican Runs Street People on Green Ticket\\" article by Marc Lacey in The New York Times September 6, 2010, accessed September 7, 2010 At the northern end of the shopping district, the two Mill Avenue bridges cross the Salt River at Tempe Town Lake. One bridge was completed in 1931, the other in 1994.  History  Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium After the founding of Fort McDowell on the east side of central Arizona‚Äôs Salt River Valley in 1865, farmers moved into the area. These early settlers further developed the irrigation canals that the Hohokam people originally created and built new ones to carry Salt River water to their farms. Agriculture in the Salt River valley soon gave food to Arizona‚Äôs military posts and mining towns. In 1871, Hiram C. Hodge commented that there were two stores and a population of about 100 in Tempe. A substantial addition to the Tempe economy was established in 1877, when Charles T. Hayden, a business man from Connecticut,Bio: Charles Trumbull Hayden - Tempe, Arizona opened a flour-mill operation that was supplied with water from the Tempe Irrigating Canal. Charles T. Hayden, and his family operated the mill for three full generations, and it was crucial to Tempe's community industry. Also in 1877, Charles' son Carl Hayden, who was to become a congressman and then senator from Arizona, was born in the Hayden family home, a building which, after spending around 60 years as a restaurant, began restoration to its 1924-era state in 2014. The Hayden's Ferry Post Office was renamed the Tempe Post Office in 1879. In 1889, the new Phoenix and Maricopa Railroad linked Tempe with Phoenix. In 1894, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors incorporated the town of Tempe. Tempe finally became a city after being inhabited for over 30 years. In 1962, the Laird and Dines Drug Store closed after 68 years of operation at the corner of Mill Avenue and Fifth Street. This drug store was one of the original fixtures on the commercial district of Mill Avenue. Tempe‚Äôs commercial center along Mill Avenue declined during these years. In 1964, construction of the Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was completed at the intersection of Mill Avenue and Apache Boulevard on the campus of Arizona State University. Prompted by Tempe‚Äôs centennial in 1971, Mill Avenue was revitalized into an entertainment and shopping district that attracts people from throughout the Phoenix Valley. In 1997, the Hayden Flour Mill closed after 123 years of continuous operation. The mill's last operator was Bay State Milling, which had purchased it in 1981. It is significant as the oldest continuously used industrial site in the Salt River Valley.  Theaters  The Valley Art Theater (now the College Theatre) is located at 505-509 South Mill Ave. The Valley Art Theater (operated by Harkins Theatres) is located on Mill Avenue as a comfortable single screen theater that typically shows art house and occasionally foreign films. The current building was built in 1938, although it underwent substantial internal renovations in the 1990s. AMC Centerpoint, an 11-screen complex, is also located on the avenue. It was originally owned by Harkins; however, with the completion of the Tempe Marketplace, which provided a more modern building, Harkins closed it in January 2008. AMC reopened the Centerpoint in April 2014. Sun Valley Parkway Sun Valley Parkway is mainly located in Buckeye, with a small portion extending into Surprise, Arizona. Built in the 1980s, the four-lane divided parkway traverses approximately 30 miles of what was once open desert about 35 miles west of downtown Phoenix. It extends north-south from Interstate 10 at exit 109 (Sun Valley Parkway / Palo Verde Road) in Buckeye, turns after about 12 miles or so to become an east-west road, and leads eastward to Surprise, where the road connects to and becomes Bell Road through Surprise and other West Valley suburbs (and eventually the City of Phoenix itself).  Developments  There are a number of master-planned communities located along this roadway in Buckeye (after no development in the area for several years after the road was built). Currently being built are Tartesso and Sun City Festival. Other communities in the planning stages include Sun Valley, Sun Valley South, Spurlock Ranch, Elianto, Trillium in Buckeye and Douglas Ranch.

Entropic gravity, also known as emergent gravity, is a theory in modern physics that describes gravity as an entropic force‚Äîa force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to quantum-level disorder‚Äîand not a fundamental interaction. The theory, based on string theory, black hole physics, and quantum information theory, describes gravity as an emergent phenomenon that springs from the quantum entanglement of small bits of spacetime information. As such, entropic gravity is said to abide by the second law of thermodynamics under which the entropy of a physical system tends to increase over time. At its simplest, the theory holds that when gravity becomes vanishingly weak‚Äîlevels seen only at interstellar distances‚Äîit diverges from its classically understood nature and its strength begins to decay linearly with distance from a mass. Entropic gravity provides the underlying framework to explain Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND, which holds that at a gravitational acceleration threshold of approximately , gravitational strength begins to vary inversely (linearly) with distance from a mass rather than the normal inverse-square law of the distance. This is an exceedingly low threshold, measuring only 12 trillionths gravity's strength at earth's surface; an object dropped from a height of one meter would fall for 36 hours were earth's gravity this weak. It is also 3,000 times less than exists at the point where crossed our solar system's heliopause and entered interstellar space. The theory claims to be consistent with both the macro- level observations of Newtonian gravity as well as Einstein's theory of general relativity and its gravitational distortion of spacetime. Importantly, the theory also explains (without invoking the existence of dark matter and its accompanying math featuring new free parameters that are tweaked to obtain the desired outcome) why galactic rotation curves differ from the profile expected with visible matter. The theory of entropic gravity posits that what has been interpreted as unobserved dark matter is the product of quantum effects that can be regarded as a form of positive dark energy that lifts the vacuum energy of space from its ground state value. A central tenet of the theory is that the positive dark energy leads to a thermal-volume law contribution to entropy that overtakes the area law of anti-de Sitter space precisely at the cosmological horizon. The theory has been controversial within the physics community but has sparked research and experiments to test its validity. Origin The thermodynamic description of gravity has a history that goes back at least to research on black hole thermodynamics by Bekenstein and Hawking in the mid-1970s. These studies suggest a deep connection between gravity and thermodynamics, which describes the behavior of heat. In 1995, Jacobson demonstrated that the Einstein field equations describing relativistic gravitation can be derived by combining general thermodynamic considerations with the equivalence principle. Subsequently, other physicists, most notably Thanu Padmanabhan, began to explore links between gravity and entropy. Erik Verlinde's theory In 2009, Erik Verlinde proposed a conceptual model that describes gravity as an entropic force. He argues (similar to Jacobson's result) that gravity is a consequence of the \\"information associated with the positions of material bodies\\". This model combines the thermodynamic approach to gravity with Gerard 't Hooft's holographic principle. It implies that gravity is not a fundamental interaction, but an emergent phenomenon which arises from the statistical behavior of microscopic degrees of freedom encoded on a holographic screen. The paper drew a variety of responses from the scientific community. Andrew Strominger, a string theorist at Harvard said \\"Some people have said it can't be right, others that it's right and we already knew it ‚Äì that it‚Äôs right and profound, right and trivial.\\" In July 2011, Verlinde presented the further development of his ideas in a contribution to the Strings 2011 conference, including an explanation for the origin of dark matter.E. Verlinde, The Hidden Phase Space of our Universe, Strings 2011, Uppsala, 1 July 2011. Verlinde's article also attracted a large amount of media exposure,The entropy force: a new direction for gravity, New Scientist, 20 January 2010, issue 2744Gravity is an entropic form of holographic information, Wired Magazine, 20 January 2010 and led to immediate follow-up work in cosmology, the dark energy hypothesis,It from Bit: How to get rid of dark energy, Johannes Koelman, 2010 cosmological acceleration, cosmological inflation, and loop quantum gravity. Also, a specific microscopic model has been proposed that indeed leads to entropic gravity emerging at large scales. Entropic gravity can emerge from quantum entanglement of local Rindler horizons. Derivation of the law of gravitation The law of gravitation is derived from classical statistical mechanics applied to the holographic principle, that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as N bits of binary information, encoded on a boundary to that region, a closed surface of area A. The information is evenly distributed on the surface with each bit requiring an area equal to \\\\ell_\\\\text{P}^2, the so-called Planck area, from which N can thus be computed: :N = \\\\frac{A}{\\\\ell_\\\\text{P}^2} where \\\\ell_\\\\text{P} is the Planck length. The Planck length is defined as: :\\\\ell_\\\\text{P} = \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{\\\\hbar G}{c^3} where G is the universal gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant. When substituted in the equation for N we find: :N = \\\\frac{A c^3}{\\\\hbar G} The statistical equipartition theorem defines the temperature T of a system with N degrees of freedom in terms of its energy E such that: :E = \\\\frac{1}{2} N k_\\\\text{B} T where k_\\\\text{B} is the Boltzmann constant. This is the equivalent energy for a mass M according to: :E = Mc^2. The effective temperature experienced due to a uniform acceleration in a vacuum field according to the Unruh effect is: :T = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar a}{2\\\\pi c k_\\\\text{B}}, where a is that acceleration, which for a mass m would be attributed to a force F according to Newton's second law of motion: :F = ma. Taking the holographic screen to be a sphere of radius r, the surface area would be given by: :A = 4\\\\pi r^2. From algebraic substitution of these into the above relations, one derives Newton's law of universal gravitation: :F = m \\\\frac{2\\\\pi c k_\\\\text{B} T}{\\\\hbar} = m \\\\frac{4\\\\pi c}{\\\\hbar} \\\\frac{E}{N} = m \\\\frac{4\\\\pi c^3}{\\\\hbar} \\\\frac{M}{N} = m 4\\\\pi \\\\frac{GM}{A} = G \\\\frac{m M}{r^2}. Note that this derivation assumes that the number of the binary bits of information is equal to the number of the degrees of freedom. :\\\\frac{A}{\\\\ell_\\\\text{P}^2} = N = \\\\frac{2 E}{k_\\\\text{B} T} Criticism and experimental tests Entropic gravity, as proposed by Verlinde in his original article, reproduces the Einstein field equations and, in a Newtonian approximation, a 1/r potential for gravitational forces. Since its results do not differ from Newtonian gravity except in regions of extremely small gravitational fields, testing the theory with earth-based laboratory experiments does not appear feasible. Spacecraft-based experiments performed at Lagrangian points within our solar system would be expensive and challenging. Even so, entropic gravity in its current form has been severely challenged on formal grounds. Matt Visser has shown, to appear in JHEP that the attempt to model conservative forces in the general Newtonian case (i.e. for arbitrary potentials and an unlimited number of discrete masses) leads to unphysical requirements for the required entropy and involves an unnatural number of temperature baths of differing temperatures. Visser concludes: For the derivation of Einstein's equations from an entropic gravity perspective, Tower Wang shows that the inclusion of energy-momentum conservation and cosmological homogeneity and isotropy requirements severely restrict a wide class of potential modifications of entropic gravity, some of which have been used to generalize entropic gravity beyond the singular case of an entropic model of Einstein's equations. Wang asserts that: Cosmological observations using available technology can be used to test the theory. On the basis of lensing by the galaxy cluster Abell 1689, Nieuwenhuizen concludes that EG is strongly ruled out unless additional (dark) matter like eV neutrinos is added. A team from Leiden Observatory statistically observing the lensing effect of gravitational fields at large distances from the centers of more than 33,000 galaxies, found that those gravitational fields were consistent with Verlinde's theory. Using conventional gravitational theory, the fields implied by these observations (as well as from measured galaxy rotation curves) could only be ascribed to a particular distribution of dark matter. In June 2017, a study by Princeton University researcher Kris Pardo asserted that Verlinde's theory is inconsistent with the observed rotation velocities of dwarf galaxies. Accessed 2017-06-22. Sabine Hossenfelder argues that \\"one should interpret these studies [comparing dark matter gravitational studies with EG] with caution\\" because \\"approximations must be made to arrive at [the to be tested EG] equation[s]\\" and it's not yet clear that the approximations are themselves correct. In 2018, Zhi-Wei Wang and Samuel L. Braunstein showed that, while spacetime surfaces near black holes (called stretched horizons) do obey an analog of the first law of thermodynamics, ordinary spacetime surfaces ‚Äî including holographic screens ‚Äî generally do not, thus undermining the key thermodynamic assumption of the emergent gravity program. Entropic gravity and quantum coherence Another criticism of entropic gravity is that entropic processes should, as critics argue, break quantum coherence. There is no theoretical framework quantitatively describing the strength of such decoherence effects, though. The temperature of the gravitational field in earth gravity well is very small (on the order of 10K). Experiments with ultra-cold neutrons in the gravitational field of Earth are claimed to show that neutrons lie on discrete levels exactly as predicted by the Schr√∂dinger equation considering the gravitation to be a conservative potential field without any decoherent factors. Archil Kobakhidze argues that this result disproves entropic gravity, while Chaichian et al. suggest a potential loophole in the argument in weak gravitational fields such as those affecting Earth-bound experiments.

The Siple II station used a 300 kW Kato square wound generator powered by a Caterpillar D353 engine to power the VLF (Jupiter) transmitter which transmitted to a receiver in Roberval, Canada. At the time, the Siple II station had the world's longest dipole antenna. Originally long, it was subsequently increased to and then a second antenna running at 90 degrees was added, resulting in a total antenna length of approximately 50 miles and allowing for phased VLF transmissions. Utah State also conducted a high-frequency radar experiment for a few years at the Siple II station. The Siple II station's house power was provided by two 110 kW generators (one active, one standby) powered by 3306 Caterpillar engines. The Siple II building complex was a metal Wonder Arch structure approximately long, wide and tall. During winter-over operation the facility stored a maximum of approximately of DFA (Diesel Fuel Arctic) in three fuel bladders. Siple Station was named after Paul Siple, who, as a Boy Scout, was a member of two Byrd expeditions and other Antarctic explorations. The station was closed in 1988 following completion of the program.

A typical performance of the set lasts about nine and a half minutes.[ Allmusic] The set is dedicated to Chopin's friend Stefan Witwicki, a minor poet, ten of whose poems Chopin set to music as songs. Composition Classical Archives Structure The order here is the order in the first German edition. The first French and English editions placed the A flat major mazurka first rather than last.Internet Chopin Information Centre Mazurka in C# minor, Op. 41, No. 1Description= The first mazurka is in C-sharp minor and has a time signature of 3/4. It also has the tempo marking: Maestoso. The Mazurka op.41 no.4 in C sharp minor should really have a subtitle: in the Phrygian mode for this is the special quality of its main theme and the crowning climax at the end. How Chopin incorporates the mode into the piece is fascinating: The mazurka starts with an outlining of the Phrygian scale as a solo right hand melody, only then repeating it with harmonization and then subjecting it to harmonic development in E major. Various episodes introduce new key areas, all very clearly marked off from one another, many developing the dotted rhythm idea from the main theme. The big dominant build-up to the climax is quite awe-inspiring both in its length (14 bars) and its ubiquitous use of dotted rhythms. In the 13 bar coda Chopin takes us back to C sharp minor and we enjoy the minor scale without the characteristic flattened supertonic of the Phrygian mode. =Musical analysisMazurka in E minor, Op. 41, No. 2Description= The second mazurka is in E minor and has a time signature of 3/4. It also has the tempo marking: Andantino. =Musical analysisMazurka in B major, Op. 41, No. 3Description= The third Mazurka is in B major and has a time signature of 3/4.

The case that shook South America involves the prosecution of Argentina to the former military officer Iv√°n Vel√°zquez for having ridden a para-state Secret Service and conspiring politically to overthrow the government of Argentina through supporting the protests of peasant sectors against the Argentine government of President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, as well as having tried to overthrow the defence minister of that country, Nilda Garr√© in order to put in his place to the then Interior Minister An√≠bal Fern√°ndez. Vel√°zquez, who remains in Uruguay after this country refused to the extradition requested by Argentina, after being in prison for nearly a year pending the determination of their resolution, which has been finally determined it as a purely political offense (Reason for no extradition between the two countries under a treaty of 1800) and after that the intelligence service of Uruguayan police had detected and aborted an operation mounted by Argentine agents to assassinate former Argentina's intelligence hierarch, was also accused of having spied several governments in South America and of involvement in arms trafficking operations to African countries. He is currently director of the firm ICG GROUP (Counsulting Intelligence Group), a private firm with subsidiaries in several countries in South America and Africa. While the accusations by the Argentine government could not be substantiated, since Vel√°zquez by refusing to be extradited to his country and the constitution does not allow for the trial in absentia, there is some suspicion that the charges against the former military and spy would motivated by refusing to carry out domestic spying (Prohibited by the constitution of this country) at the request of the presidents N√©stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern√°ndez, which would become the persecution by the presidential marriage to the former spy chief who also have been responsible for the creation of a mega spy intel system known as \\"Vampire Project\\" whose aim would have the same objective as the American ECHELON.

George Grimston Cookman was born in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, England, on October 21, 1800, to George and Mary Cookman. He joined a Methodist society in 1820 and in 1821 he visited the United States for the first time, on business for his father. Later, upon the advice of minister friends, he determined to go to the United States to minister. He boarded the Orient on March 28, 1825, landing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Sunday, May 16, 1825. During his months at sea he read Bishop Watson's Apologies, Mason on Self-Knowledge, Jenyn's Views of the Internal Evidences of Christianity, Lord Lyttleton's Arguments for Christianity, Baxter's Gildas Salvianus and Saint's Rest, and Butler's Analogy, while proselytizing to the seamen on board.Hints To An Emigrant, by George Grimston Cookman.  Ministry  His first year in the United States, he served St. George‚Äôs Church in Philadelphia. In 1826 he was appointed to the Kensington and St. John churches in Philadelphia. At this point in his life, he hoped to go as a missionary to Africa, but this did not happen. Following his marriage in the spring of 1827, he was appointed to the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, circuit (comprising Lancaster, Columbia and Reading), the Cookmans lived in Columbia, Pennsylvania, along the Susquehanna River, during this time. In 1828 he was stationed at New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his preaching drew much public acclaim. In 1829 he was sent to the circuit in Talbot County, Maryland, where a long-held dream of preaching to the black population was first realized. His ministry and advocacy of emancipation garnered the praises of Frederick Douglass. His next appointments were to St. George‚Äôs in Philadelphia, for two years and then to Newark, New Jersey for a year. Cookman was then transferred to the Baltimore conference where he served all of the congregations in that city except Fells Point. Then he was called to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, just as the Methodists were revitalizing Dickinson College. In 1838 he was sent to Wesley Chapel in Washington, D.C. His preaching there led to his being proposed as Chaplain of the Senate (1839).

He attended a Nizhny Novgorod Realschule, subsequently graduating from a veterinary institute in Kharkov in 1898. Underground efforts Bobrovsky became active in the Russian socialist movement during his student years in Kharkov and, in autumn 1898, established connections with a Moscow Social Democratic group affiliated with future Mensheviks Cherevanin and Avilov through an engineer named Shomet. Arrested on 20 January 1900 in connection with this group, Bobrovsky remained imprisoned until March. Remaining under the watch of the police in Kharkov after his release, Bobrovsky was rearrested in November 1900. Jailed again, he remained in custody until February 1901, following which he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) committee in Kiev. Arriving in Moscow to avoid the Kiev authorities, he was rearrested in February and sent back to Kiev to be tried alongside other socialists associated with the political newspaper Iskra and the party's Kiev group, but after months of imprisonment succeeded in fleeing abroad through an escape carried out by eleven activists. He affiliated with the RSDLP's Bolshevik faction after the intra-party split in 1903, staying in contact with the Bolsheviks during his period abroad in Geneva, Switzerland after the Kiev prison-break.¬´–ü–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞ –í. –ò. –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ –∏ —Ä—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏–º—ã—Ö –∏–º —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –†–°–î–†–ü —Å –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–π–Ω—ã–º–∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è–º–∏. 1903-1905 –≥–≥.¬ª (V.

Retrieved 20 January 2010. In autumn of 1904 Bobrovsky left Tiflis in order to carry out party work in Baku and took part in the organization of strikers during the winter. Again facing arrest on charges of spreading communist propaganda, Bobrovsky gave the police a fake name, and released from prison in September 1905. Subjected to the additional penalty of five years of internal exile (he was sent to the northern city of Arkhangelsk rather than Siberia as a result of the exceptional circumstances of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905), Bobrovsky was freed by a group of protesting workers in Rostov during the journey and immediately went to join the Bolsheviks in Moscow. After another arrest followed by internal exile, Bobrovsky arrived in Kostroma and came to lead the local Bolshevik propaganda efforts and organizing of peasant committees. In 1907 he took part in the organization of the printing presses for the distribution of illegal Marxist literature in Ivanovo-Voznesensk. His health, already weakened by the many periods of imprisonment, began to decline noticeably after he and other suppressed May Day demonstrators were attacked and subjected to flogging with whips. Again arrested by the authorities in Moscow, Bobrovsky faced another sentence of political repression through imprisonment, internal exile, and police monitoring, but was subsequently permitted to take up residence in Moscow following this period. Bobrovsky remained connected with the Bolsheviks and took part in the organizing of a legal newspaper, Rabochiy Trud, in 1914. War and revolution Like Vladimir Lenin and others in the Bolshevik current, Bobrovsky assumed an internationalist position towards the hostilities between the European imperialist powers during World War I, arguing that no Marxist movement could credibly lend support to a devastating intra-capitalist conflict, but was nonetheless drafted into the Imperial Russian Army as a veterinary doctor on the home front. Bobrovsky exploited the situation by using his proximity to the conscripted Russian soldiers to advance Marxist propaganda and the Bolshevik cause among the soldiers in Serpukhov in 1915-1917; following the February Revolution of 1917 he was elected a representative of the troops from a soldiers‚Äô soviet (council), whose newspaper Bobrovsky also edited after helping organize its production in May 1917. As the Russian participation in the First World War lingered following the advancement of Alexander Kerensky to head of the Provisional Government after the overthrow of Czar Nicholas II, Bobrovsky was directed to assume work in Moscow as a military veterinarian. Following the dispersal of the Kerensky government through the October Revolution of 1917 Bobrovsky participated in a workers‚Äô control soviet, carried out administrative work as a supervisor of the city‚Äôs slaughterhouses, and worked in the veterinary subcommittee of the Moscow city soviet, the sanatorium division of Moscow‚Äôs Health Department, and in the Central Veterinary Directorate of the People's Commissariat for Agriculture prior to assuming an executive role in the State Institute for Journalism in early 1924.

The first use of the name was probably by Furzebrook Farm. Furzebrook became the centre of the clay industry as all the local Purbeck Ball Clay was taken there to ripen by exposing. The clay was repeatedly turned for six months. As the ball clay ripened it acquired plasticity and became suitable to mix with various other clays which made them more plastic. At Furzebrook there are several narrow-gauge railway tracks; these converged from outlying local mines and claypits, the Furzebrook Railway. A further narrow-gauge line ran to Ridge Wharf. As the Wareham to Swanage branch line of the London and South Western Railway was built it passed through Furzebrook and therefore a lot of clay was transferred via the mainline trains.

It features fresh, seasonal and simply-prepared ingredients from Roman Campagna.Boni (1930), pg. 13. These include peas, globe artichokes and fava beans, shellfish, milk-fed lamb and goat, and cheeses such as Pecorino Romano and ricotta.Boni (1930), pg. 14 Olive oil is used mostly to dress raw vegetables, while strutto (pork lard) and fat from prosciutto are preferred for frying. The most popular sweets in Rome are small individual pastries called pasticcini, gelato (ice cream) and handmade chocolates and candies. Special dishes are often reserved for different days of the week; for example, gnocchi is eaten on Thursdays, baccal√† (salted cod) on Fridays, and trippa on Saturdays. History Classic Roman spaghetti alla carbonara. Rome's food has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical center during the ancient age. Ancient Roman cuisine was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture. Subsequently, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning, the differences between social classes were not very great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth. Later, during the Italian Renaissance, Rome became well known as a center of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this could be Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a chef working for Pius IV in the Vatican kitchen, reaching fame with his cookbook Opera dell'arte del cucinare, published in 1570. Here he lists approximately 1000 recipes of Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork. Roman and all Italian cuisine were transformationally influenced by the introduction of new world crops by the Spanish, especially the tomato. Traditional cucina Romana The Testaccio rione, Rome's trade and slaughterhouse area, is the place where Rome's most original and traditional foods can still be found. The area was often known as the \\"belly\\" or \\"slaughterhouse\\" of Rome, and was inhabited by butchers, or vaccinari.Eyewitness Travel (2006), pg. 312 - 313 The most common or ancient Roman cuisine included the \\"fifth quarter\\". Popular foods include pig's trotters, brain, and the genitals of other animals, which were often carefully cooked and richly spiced with different savouries, spices and herbs. The old- fashioned coda alla vaccinara (oxtail cooked in the way of butchers) is still one of the city's most popular meals and is part of most of Rome's restaurants' menus. Lamb is also a very popular part of Roman cuisine, and is often roasted with spices and herbs. There is a considerable Jewish influence in Roman cuisine, since many Jews lived in the city, and some of the traditional meals of the ghetto date back over 400 years. Such include the carciofi alla giudia (Jewish-style artichokes) and Jewish courgettes. Pasta in Rome Pasta is one important element of Roman cuisine. Famous pasta sauces include amatriciana, carbonara, (a sauce made with pancetta or guanciale - pig's cheek -, cheese and egg), cacio e pepe and gricia (like carbonara but without eggs). Alfredo (invented by the chef of restaurant \\"Alfredo alla Scrofa\\") is famous abroad, but not considered traditional and mostly unheard of in Rome. There used to be a pasta museum in Rome called the Museo Nazionale della Paste Alimentari (the National Museum of Pasta), but now there is a hotel there. Rome's most common pasta shape is spaghetti, but there are many other forms. Beverages The city is known as a center of white wine, especially with the warm territory. Frascati and Castelli Romani have been called the best ones in the city.Eyewitness Travel (2006), pg. 314 - 315 Other elements of Roman food There are also many other dishes in Roman cuisine, including several desserts and sweets, many of which are made with ricotta cheese. Typical of Rome is the grattachecca.

She has written both fantasy and non-fantasy novels, including the paranormal series Need. Jones has received multiple awards and appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list. Personal life and education Carrie Jones was raised in Bedford, New Hampshire. She moved to Lewiston, Maine to attend Bates College. Initially considering a career as a lawyer, she later became an award-winning reporter and editor for newspapers, which led to her winning numerous Maine Press Awards and eventually a Maine Literary Award for nonfiction and another for children's writing. In 2007, Jones graduated from Vermont College's MFA program for writing, prior to which she completed the first draft of what would become her debut novel. She was presented with the program's Distinguished Alumn Award. She resides in Maine. Career Jones's 2007 debut novel, Tips on Having a Gay (ex) Boyfriend, introduces a girl named Belle, whose longtime boyfriend Dylan eventually informs her that he is gay. The revelation leaves Belle torn between her resentment toward Dylan's secrecy, and her concern as he adjusts to his new identity in their town. Jones has labeled it a story of \\"self-discovery and understanding and all the different kinds of love out there.\\" The novel was based in part on an experience that Jones had during high school. While exploring Belle's situation, the author felt compelled to reveal that \\"negative feelings aren‚Äôt all the feelings possible when your boyfriend comes out. You can feel proud of him. You can feel sad that he was afraid to tell the truth for so long. You can feel used sometimes. You can feel angry sometimes, but eventually, lots of the time you still love him. You still care about him. You want the best for him. In Tips I really wanted those positive feelings to eventually come out.\\" While reviewing the novel, Dana Rudolph of Bay Windows called it a story of \\"personal discovery,\\" for both Dylan and Belle. Rudolph also stated that the book \\"explores the broader ramifications of homophobia and closetedness without resorting to stereotypes.\\" She went on to declare it \\"an insightful, funny read about first love and first heartbreak.\\" A review from Publishers Weekly stated that \\"the author's poetic prose ably captures her heroine's emotional upheavals.\\" Additionally, Tips on Having a Gay (ex) Boyfriend won the 2008 Maine Literary Award for children's fiction, and the Independent Booksellers Award.

To cope with her difficulties, she writes messages to her hero, deceased movie actor John Wayne, and bonds with a friendly romantic interest from her school. In July 2008, the novel received recognition from The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents. The review stated that the story was \\"raw and real,\\" also commending it for an ability to \\"empower readers.\\" A fantasy novel about a haunted town, titled After Obsession was released in 2011, and was announced in 2010. The book is a collaborative novel by Jones and author Steven E. Wedel. Need Jones's most well-known work, the fantasy series Need, debuted in autumn 2008. She has described the story as being \\"about multiple things,\\" including \\"finding yourself, finding love, solving a bit of a mystery,\\" and \\"not getting dead.\\" The novels follow a girl named Zara, who is drawn into a struggle against a group of malicious pixies. As the story progresses, Zara makes several new friends and allies, including a werewolf named Nick. In addition to the central conflict, Need explores themes surrounding integrity and personal phobias, while also examining strong-willed heroines and Norse mythology. The series has largely been met with critical acclaim, while the initial entry was also listed as one of VOYA's best speculative fiction books of 2008.

It will fulfill a need for many.\\" The second book in the series, Captivate, debuted at #7 on the New York Times Best Seller list in the \\"Children's Books‚ÄîChapter Books\\" subcategory. Recurring elements Jones's characters are sometimes involved with Amnesty International, which the author has also participated in. While discussing this in a 2008 interview, she cited a desire for her heroines to care about more than \\"boys and clothes.\\" In addition, her works regularly feature small communities with close-knit residents. The author has claimed to draw inspiration from her own city of Ellsworth, Maine while writing. Musicians have also appeared more than once in her stories, with the characters Belle and Liliana (the protagonist of Girl, Hero) both having an interest in music. Jones has stated that she plays piano in private, and that she participated in a song-and-dance company, along with comedian Sarah Silverman, while in junior high school. Writing approach During a 2009 interview, Jones was asked about the appeal of the young-adult genre, and how the lines between fantasy and the real world blurred in her writing.

It was founded in the 13th century. Currently it is not functioning as a church. History Among Tbilisi Armenians Krtsanis Surp Astvatsatsin church was also called Tsiranavor and Geghardavank. First was an epithet referring to the Holy Virgin and second refers to the great spear, which was brought here and stayed for some time. Krtsanisi village was close to Tbilisi, which greatly contributed its economic development. According to Sargis Jalalyants, current citizens moved to Krtsanisi from the town-fortress Samshvilde. If it took place indeed, it must have been in second half of the 13th century ‚Äì first half of the 14th century, because the document dated from 1392 mentions the village as belonging to Mtskheta Catholicos House having \\"merchant of the city\\". By that time the village had a number of Armenian population based on the fact there was already an Armenian church in it. Armenian manuscript colophon dated 1436 says: \\"This [book] is written in Armenian summer of 885 [1436 AD] in the country of Georgia closest to capital Tpkhis [Tbilisi] village Krtsanis, in the shade of Cathedral of the Holy Virgin\\". Here catholicoses of Armenia, Albania are mentioned (Constantine and Matheos), Archimandrite (the leader of the Armenians of Georgia) Iezekiel and Georgian king Aleksander I. According to the writer it was \\"hard and painful times\\" when \\"evil truthless Shahrukh and the country has caused great destruction. Based on words of Tovmas Metsopetsi in the 15th century Armenian population of Ararat Valley had to leave and moved to Georgia to Beshken Orbelyan, who treated them well. The second stream of emigrants is supposed to arrive then. Tovmas Metsopetsi himself was a refugee from Gandzak, who after return from Jerusalem pilgrimages moved to his home town to see his brother and relatives. Together with him \\"a number of caravans\\" of refugees moved, who in Agstev had been ruined by \\"cavalry of Jagataians\\". The local inhabitants met the newcomers, \\"Christians came forward and covered our nakedness\\", so they arrived the place of the new settlement, where Tovmas started copying of the manuscript received from Tbilisi Holy Virgin Cathedral monk Sargis. In Krtsanis church he had his brothers beside ‚Äì monk Jordan and priest Stepanos Krtsanetsi. In XVI-XVII the village population rapidly decreased and the church was almost ruined. It was reconstructed in 1778 again. The Register of Armenian churches of Tiflis Krtsanis Surp Astvatsatsin was mentioned number 33 with the following description: \\"Built funded by city population in Armenian summer of 1227 [1778] and renewed by daughter Anna of Amiran Sulents from Krtsanis funded by city budget\\". The only known note on the church walls is found on the side baptismal: in the center part the scene of baptism is shown with the following note in the sides: \\"This baptismal is in memory of Gregoriy Mamulyan in Geghardavank of Tsiranavor. 1861\\" Current status The church is rebuilt to a residential house. Currently no talks about church history reopening is held neither by Armenian nor by Georgian church.

The MP Co headquarters was located at West Plains, Missouri and a detachment was located at Springfield, Missouri. Since federal recognition, the company was activated in Panama and deployed to the Middle East to support combat actions and has also performed humanitarian and security missions within the United States. History The 1138th Military Police Company (MP Co) was federally recognized and assigned to West Plains, Missouri with a detachment in Doniphan, Missouri on 15 January 1968. Company headquarters, one platoon, and the machine gun section were located at West Plains and the detachment at Doniphan was made up of the remaining two platoons. On 1 July 1993 the platoons at Doniphan were realigned to the 735th Support Battalion at Poplar Bluff, Missouri. The 1138th then added a detachment at Springfield, Missouri. Although it was planned to move the 1135th MP Co to West Plains to replace the 1138th in connection with this reorganization, the plan was cancelled and the West Plains company kept its 1138th number. On 1 October 1996, a second detachment of the company was assigned at Mountain Grove, Missouri. In 1998 the Mountain Grove detachment was inactivated. The 1138th MP Co was reorganized as a combat support military police company on 1 October 1996. On 1 October 1998, the 1138th MP CO was once again organized as an Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW) Company; the only EPW Company in the state of Missouri. Support for civilian emergencies On 20 June 1993 the company was mobilized for state emergency (Flood) duty. While mobilized, the unit served in northeast Missouri for approximately three months maintaining law and order. After the attacks of 11 September 2001, the 1138th was mobilized as part of Operation Noble Eagle, a military operation providing military support for increased security at potential terrorist targets. The company served on active duty from 1 October 2001 through 21 September 2002, performing law and order duties at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. On 31 August 2005, the company deployed with the 175th MP Bn to Jefferson Parish, Louisiana to support relief operations after Hurricane Katrina. While deployed in Louisiana, the 1138th performed law and order operations and area security missions, returning on 21 September 2005. In 2009, while preparing for yet another active duty deployment to Iraq, the Ozarks region of rural Missouri was hit by a harsh wave of winter weather and in January, the unit deployed a contingent to aid winter storm victims in Southeast Missouri for Operation January Ice. Combat support deployments In December, 1989, the company was called into active service for Operation Just Cause (Panama). It was the first Army National Guard unit to be activated since the Vietnam War. As part of its traditional internment and resettlement mission, the 1138th established a detainee camp at Empire Range, Panama where it handled both civilian and military detainees. On 15 November 1990, the unit was mobilized and deployed to Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm. It remained in Saudi Arabia for five months guarding EPWs. The 1138th deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, serving on active duty from 10 February 2003 through 21 December 2003. Upon arrival in the Middle East, the unit conducted customs, physical security, and law and order missions throughout Kuwait and in Doha, Qatar. After Operation January Ice concluded in 2009, the company began its preparation for a detainee operations mission in Baghdad, Iraq. While preparing for deployment, nearly fifty 1138th soldiers were transferred to the 1140th MP Co, another Missouri Army National Guard unit preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. The 1138th backfilled its ranks with \\"In-Lieu-Of\\" military policemen from twenty-three other Missouri Army National Guard units. On 21 May 2009, the unit reported to Camp Clark, Missouri for pre-mobilization training. The unit then reported for post-mobilization Training at Fort Bliss, Texas and after completing a twenty-day-long mission evaluation exercise, deployed to Iraq, to support Operation Iraqi Freedom 09-10.

They are exempt from prospectus requirements and hence require less disclosure than a prospectus offering. To sell a security in the exempt market, an issuer must ensure that the investor qualifies under a specific exemption contained in the Instrument. Common exemptions include: * issue an offering memorandum * sell only to accredited investors; * sell only to family, friends and business associates; * or sell a minimum of $150,000 per transaction. Exempt market securities may involve a higher level of risk. There are no established secondary markets for exempt market securities and they are illiquid. Notably, unlike publicly traded companies, issuers of exempt market securities are not required to provide continuous disclosure to investors. Exempt market securities may be sold by an Exempt Market Dealer or Investment Dealer, or, in certain provinces, directly by an issuer under the North-Western Order, which is an exemption from registration requirements, with some conditions. Due Diligence Issues Exempt market securities may or may not have detailed disclosure depending on the exemption relied on so it is important for potential investors to ensure that they perform appropriate due diligence of their own (arguably this is necessary for any investment regardless of whether it is offered under prospectus or not). The following is a non-exhaustive list of some due diligence issues to address: # Experienced management team ‚Äì Work with teams that have a track record at both the investment management level and at the operational level ‚Äì there is NO substitute for a track record of successful investment and operation in the business area by the team you are trusting to act on your behalf. # Clear investment premise ‚Äì The investment premise should be based on sound fundamental analysis that is simple to understand and clearly laid out in the presentation. Avoid momentum-based investments where the core rationale is effectively that ‚Äúeveryone else is doing it‚Äù. # Tax efficient structure ‚Äì Tax can have a major effect on your returns. Make sure that all reasonable and credible steps have been taken by the management team to manage tax obligations. # Audited financial statements ‚Äì Management must provide annual audited financial statements. A past failure to do so should act as a red flag. # Regular operational reporting ‚Äì Management must be open and available to answer your questions about the business. # Clearly defined hold period ‚Äì Make sure that the hold period is clearly defined and cannot be arbitrarily changed or extended by the management team. You need to know how long your investment will be committed and exactly when you can expect repayment. # No non-arms length transactions ‚Äì Situation where the management team acquires the target assets first and then sells them to the fund for an upfront profit. Even if disclosed in the offering documents this is a poor practice and creates a mismatch between the economic interests of the management team and the interests of the investors. # No acquisition fees - Fees where the management team gets paid a portion of all capital deployed. This creates a mismatch between the economic interests of the management team and the interests of the investors, as acquisition fees are not tied to returns. # No fee escalation ‚Äì Management fees should not be tied to appraised or calculated asset value that is an unrealized gain. The only valuations that matter are the purchase price and the sale price. Management should receive the bulk of their fees based on gains that are actually realized for investors. # Incentives reward ACHIEVED performance ‚Äì Favor investments where the manager makes the bulk of his return only when you make a return. This fee structure is commonly referred to as ‚Äúsuccess based‚Äù. Lifts, acquisition fees, escalating annual management fees are not success based.

It is the oldest formal educational institution of any kind in Zimbabwe. Together with sister institutions of Dombodema High School (Mission) in Plumtree and Tennyson Hlabangane High School (formerly known as Hope Fountain Mission) in Hope Fountain, Inyathi High School is privately owned by the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa (UCCSA) which is itself an offshoot of the London Missionary Society (LMS). History The current district of Inyathi arose around the mission established by the London Missionary Society, and Inyathi High School began as the Inyathi Mission School in 1896. When the LMS sought to establish a mission in Zimbabwe, King Mzilikazi granted them land near his capital in Bulawayo, enabling him to monitor their activities, and forbade them from proselytizing the Matebele people. As such, Christianity did not spread amongst the Matebele until the fall of the Matebele nation in 1893. There were many reasons for this. Firstly, the fact that these missionaries brought diseases that decimated the livestock of the Matebele was taken as a sign of an ill omen by the hosts. Secondly, failure of the missionaries to respect rituals and traditions of the Matebele meant that they were viewed with suspicion and their preaching unwelcome. Thus, the first Matebele convert to come into the Christian fold in 1892, Mathambo Ndlovu was killed by locals who could not stand for his \\"conversion\\". Establishment of Inyathi Mission School in 1896, 40 years after the mission station was first established has to be a clear measure of slowness with which Christianity first spread amongst the Matebele. With the Matebele nation having fallen in 1893 it is little wonder then that 1896 offers a date stamp from which we can reasonably conclude with some certainty that the Matebele Nation had indeed fallen, making it possible for Christianity thus, to spread amongst the folk. The establishment of the school would suggest that by then, a critical mass of the \\"converted\\" local folk had now been attained. Their enrollment in the school also suggests that it must have now been safe for them to receive the teachings of the missionaries openly. Inyathi Mission evolved from a modest site consisting of a church of red bricks, built by Moffat, which still stands to this day. Today, Inyathi Mission Complex comprises a church, a primary-day school, a secondary-boarding school, a farm and a graveyard for its founding missionaries. The most current records show the school intake to consist of 294 boys, 316 girls and 33 teachers; 1 boarding master, 1 boarding mistress, an accounts clerk and a bursar. They also suggest that the boarding-school farm was decoupled from the Inyathi Mission complex soon after political independence in 1980. Inyathi Mission became the first centre for academic excellence as we know it today, in 1896, taking students from what is now Zimbabwe and as far afield as Malawi and Zambia. Format Inyathi High School is a traditional academic institution following an academic training route of its students. It has an academic streaming system that channels students towards either the Sciences (A-stream) or Arts (B-stream) routes after the first two years of secondary schooling. Between 1975 and 1978, the school uniform for boys were grey shirt, grey long trousers in the winter, grey short trousers in the summer, Grey knee length socks, Mauve jumpers, Mauve blazer (Badged), black shoes, and a scarf with the student's house colour. For girls, it was a lilac and white thin striped tunic, white ankle socks, Mauve jumpers, Mauve blazer (Badged) and black shoes. House system Welfare management of students is by a rigid traditional four house system. The houses are named after the school's founders and assigned colours as follows: * Moffat House: Blue (in honour of Dr Robert Moffat) * Reese House): Green(in honour of Dr Bowen Reese) * Thomas House: Red (in honour of Morgan Thomas Morgan) * Sykes House: Yellow (in honour of William Sykes) Accommodation arrangements in the dormitories and sitting arrangements in the Dining Hall (DH) are based strictly on the School House System. The school has a traditional prefect system, consisting of a head boy and head girl, each with a deputy. Each intake of students is followed by a randomised draft system into the respective houses, with siblings also falling prey to the random house allocation. Once drafted, each student remains with the house throughout their stay in the school. Each house is headed by a House Master from the academic staff, a Boys House Captain, and a Girls House Captain supported by a complement of boy and girl prefects (amaPoro) elected by each stream of the academic year in the first 2 years. All other senior prefects are selected by the academic staff with criteria for selection remaining a prerogative for the staff. Most competitions in the school are based on inter-house rivalry, with each house tending to dominate depending on the sport in question and the complement and giftedness of its new recruits. Healthy inter-house rivalry remains a source of tension, amusement and pride equally throughout a student's career at the school. Staff The officers of the school are the Headmaster (who does not belong to any house), the deputy Headmaster (who in 1975 & 1976 was Thomas House Master), The Bursar (who does not belong to any house), Heads of Academic Departments, House Masters, Teachers, The Boarding Master (who does not belong to any house), Boarding Mistress, who doubles as the School Nurse (who does not belong to any house), laboratory technicians (who do not belong to any house). The school was also served by a Farm Manager (who does not belong to any house) and a complement of 3-4 Cooks (who do not belong to any house). The school has separate domotories for Boys (BD) with Media Rooms and girls (GD) with Media Rooms, Dining Hall, a Dispensary, Classrooms and a Tuckshop. Athletics Inyathi students enjoy on-going inter-school rivalries on many fronts with neighbouring schools as well others further afield. Graveyard The original missionary graveyard saw its first burial in 1860 and holds the remains of some of the original team of missionaries that established the Inyathi Mission Station. The burial plot is a small, dignified and maintained plot not in routine use. It has been extended recently by the UCCSA to honour the first black Headmaster to the Secondary-Boarding School, Mr. Mzingaye Dube who died suddenly whilst still in office in 1979. His wife, (Nursing) Sister Dube, who tragically followed him soon after as a result of the trauma and heartbreak of his loss, is also buried next to him. May they both rest in eternal peace. Another notable burial is that of a member of one of the influential Inyathi families, long-standing local politician and businessman Mr. Micah Bhebhe whose remains were interred on this site on 1 August 2003. Inyathi High School, The UCCSA and the local community recently marked 150 years since the establishment of the Missionary Settlement. The UCCSA recently announced plans to extend its contribution to Zimbabwe's Education Sector by building a University within boundaries of its Inyathi Mission Farm, a stone's throw away from the High School.

It is the third largest manufacturer of pasta in the world. History The company was founded in 1886 by the De Cecco brothers in the small town of Fara San Martino in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. Nicola De Cecco originally produced flour at his stone mill before establishing the pasta factory. In 1908, the company adopted a country girl with a wheat stacks as its trademark. After World War II the factory was rebuilt after being destroyed by German bomb attacks. In 1950 De Cecco completed a new factory in Pescara to meet the increased demand that occurred after the war. In 1980, a new production facility was opened in Fara San Martino, doubling the company's production output. In 1986 the company began to diversify its offerings by establishing its olive oil brand. De Cecco offerings have since expanded to sauces, grains and tomato based products. As of 2013, De Cecco is the third largest pasta producer in the world.

Her Sea Horse Sundial (1922) - a winged cherub joyfully riding a seahorse hobby-horse (while the toy's stick casts its shadow on the sundial) - was widely praised, and received awards from the National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and elsewhere. She also had a success with her life-size, three-quarter-length, bas relief portrait of William Dean Howells (1926), for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. About 1920, sculptor Anna Hyatt and Putnam rented an apartment and studio at 49 West 12th Street, Manhattan.Myrna G. Eden, Energy and Individuality in the Art of Anna Huntington, Sculptor and Amy Beach, Composer(Scarecrow Press, 1987), p. 22. Hyatt married millionaire Archer Milton Huntington in 1923 - their wedding took place at the studio - and the Huntingtons became great patrons of the arts. In 1931 they founded Brookgreen Gardens, a vast sculpture garden in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. A more modern aesthetic Puck (1930-1932, replica 2002), Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, D.C. Putnam grew dissatisfied with conventional academic sculpture. Her desire to pursue \\"a more modern aesthetic\\" brought her to Italy in 1927, where she studied under Libero Andreotti, and later under Alexander Archipenko in New York City. She collaborated with architect Paul Philippe Cret on the Art Deco Puck Fountain (1930‚Äì1932), for the west garden of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. Inscribed below her Figure of Puck is the elf's famous line from A Midsummer Night's Dream: \\"What fooles these mortals be.\\" The marble sculpture, damaged by acid rain and vandalism, was removed in 2001, restored, and placed inside the library.

Putnam had made the stylistic transition from Academic to Art Deco, but she was no fan of post-war Modernism. In 1952 the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced its intention to expand its holdings of contemporary sculpture. On behalf of the conservative National Sculpture Society (of which she was a fellow), Putnam vehemently advocated that The Met purchase realist works.Alan Filreis, Counter-revolution of the Word (University of North Carolina Press, 2012), pp. 225-26.

Family  Bouzes was a native of Thrace. He was likely a son of the general and rebel Vitalian. Procopius identifies Coutzes and Venilus as brothers of Bouzes. An unnamed sister was mother to Domnentiolus.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 254-257 and Lillington-Martin (2012), p 4-5 and 2010.  Iberian War =Battle of Thannuris (or Mindouos)  Map of the Roman-Persian frontier area Bouzes is first mentioned in 528, as joint dux of Phoenice Libanensis together with his brother, Coutzes. (Their province was part of the wider Diocese of the East and contained areas to the east of Mount Lebanon). Bouzes was stationed at Palmyra, while Coutzes at Damascus. Both brothers are described as being young at the time by Procopius. Their first known mission sent the two brothers to the front lines of the Iberian War against the Sassanid Empire, reinforcing Belisarius at Mindouos. Belisarius was attempting to construct a fortress at this location. \\"When the emperor (Justinian I) heard this, inasmuch as Belisarius was not able to beat off the Persians from the place with the army he had, he ordered another army to go thither, and also Coutzes and Bouzes, who at that time commanded the soldiers in Libanus. These two were brothers from Thrace, both young and inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy. So both armies were gathered together and came in full force to the scene of the building operations, the Persians in order to hinder the work with all their power, and the Romans to defend the labourers. And a fierce battle took place in which the Romans were defeated, and there was a great slaughter of them, while some also were made captive by the enemy. Among these was Coutzes himself. All these captives the Persians led away to their own country, and, putting them in chains, confined them permanently in a cave; as for the fort, since no one defended it any longer, they razed what had been built to the ground.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 13 (cf. Lillington-Martin, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2013). Battle of Dara Bouzes survived the defeat. He is next mentioned taking part in the Battle of Dara (June, 530). He served in command of the cavalry alongside Pharas the Herulian. Among his attendants was Andreas, who distinguished himself in the first day of the battle. \\"The extremity of the left straight trench which joined the cross trench, as far as the hill which rises here, was held by Bouzes with a large force of horsemen and by Pharas the Erulian with three hundred of his nation. On the right of these, outside the trench, at the angle formed by the cross trench and the straight section which extended from that point, were Sunicas and Aigan, Massagetae (Huns) by birth, with six hundred horsemen, in order that, if those under Bouzes and Pharas should be driven back, they might, by moving quickly on the flank, and getting in the rear of the enemy, be able easily to support the Romans at that point.\\" \\"In the late afternoon a certain detachment of the horsemen who held the right wing [of the Sassanids], separating themselves from the rest of the army, came against the forces of Bouzes and Pharas. And the Romans retired a short distance to the rear. The Persians, however, did not pursue them, but remained there, fearing, I suppose, some move to surround them on the part of the enemy. Then the Romans who had turned to flight suddenly rushed upon them. And the Persians did not withstand their onset and rode back to the phalanx, and again the forces of Bouzes and Pharas stationed themselves in their own position. In this skirmish seven of the Persians fell, and the Romans gained possession of their bodies; thereafter both armies remained quietly in position.\\" \\"But one Persian, a young man, riding up very close to the Roman army, began to challenge all of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain wrestling school in Byzantium. Through this it came about that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the barbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his spear on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a sacrificial animal as he lay on his back, and a mighty shout was raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army.\\" \\"But the Persians were deeply vexed at the outcome and sent forth another horseman for the same purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a youth, for some of the hair on his head already shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the whip with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by Hermogenes. So both rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons, driven against their corselets, were turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from the Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the paean, went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark. Thus both armies passed that night.\\" Siege of Martyropolis In 531, Bouzes was unable to participate at the Battle of Callinicum (19 April, 531). He was reportedly stationed at Amida, an illness preventing him from campaigning. Zacharias Rhetor mentions that Bouzes tasked his nephew Domnentiolus with leading an army to Abhgarsat. This location is only mentioned by Zacharias. The Byzantine forces faced the Sassanid army and were defeated. Domnentiolus himself was captured by his enemies and transported to the interior of the Sassanid Empire. In 532, the Eternal Peace was concluded between the two powers. Domnentiolus was released \\"in an exchange of prisoners\\"Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 413 In September/October 531, Bouzes and Bessas were joint commanders of the garrison at Martyropolis. The city was besieged by a strong Sassanid force. The death of Kavadh I resulted in the premature end of the siege. Procopius details: \\"And the Persians once more invaded Mesopotamia with a great army under command of Chanaranges and Aspebedes and Mermeroes. Since no one dared to engage with them, they made camp and began the siege of Martyropolis, where Bouzes and Bessas had been stationed in command of the garrison. This city lies in the land called Sophanene, two hundred and forty stades distant from the city of Amida toward the north; it is just on the River Nymphius which divides the land of the Romans and the Persians. So the Persians began to assail the fortifications, and, while the besieged at first withstood them manfully, it did not seem likely that they would hold out long. For the circuit-wall was quite easily assailable in most parts, and could be captured very easily by a Persian siege, and besides they did not have a sufficient supply of provisions, nor indeed had they engines of war nor anything else that was of any value for defending themselves.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 1, Chapter 21 \\"Thus then Chosroes secured the power. But at Martyropolis, Sittas and Hermogenes were in fear concerning the city, since they were utterly unable to defend it in its peril, and they sent certain men to the enemy, who came before the generals and spoke as follows: \\"It has escaped your own notice that you are becoming wrongfully an obstacle to the king of the Persians and to the blessings of peace and to each state. For ambassadors sent from the emperor are even now present in order that they may go to the king of the Persians and there settle the differences and establish a treaty with him; but do you as quickly as possible remove from the land of the Romans and permit the ambassadors to act in the manner which will be of advantage to both peoples. For we are ready also to give as hostages men of repute concerning these very things, to prove that they will be actually accomplished at no distant date.\\" Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans. It happened also that a messenger came to them from the palace, who brought them word that Cabades had died and that Chosroes, son of Cabades, had become king over the Persians, and that in this way the situation had become unsettled. And as a result of this the generals heard the words of the Romans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns. The Romans therefore straightway gave as hostages Martinus and one of the body-guards of Sittas, Senecius by name; so the Persians broke up the siege and made their departure promptly. Armenian revolt Bouzes resurfaces in 539, when he succeeded the deceased Sittas in command of Roman Armenia. He was tasked with ending an ongoing Armenian revolt. His efforts included the assassination of John, a descendant of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. John was survived by his son Artabanes. \\"After the death of Sittas the emperor commanded Bouzes to go against the Armenians; and he, upon drawing near, sent to them promising to effect a reconciliation between the emperor and all the Armenians, and asking that some of their notables should come to confer with him on these matters. Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust Bouzes, nor were they willing to receive his proposals. But there was a certain man of the Arsacidae who was especially friendly with him, John by name, the father of Artabanes, and this man, trusting in Bouzes as his friend, came to him with his son-in- law, Bassaces, and a few others; but when these men had reached the spot where they were to meet Bouzes on the following day, and had made their bivouac there, they perceived that they had come into a place surrounded by the Roman army. Bassaces, the son-in-law, therefore earnestly entreated John to fly. And since he was not able to persuade him, he left him there alone, and in company with all the others eluded the Romans, and went back again by the same road. And Bouzes found John alone and slew him; and since after this the Armenians had no hope of ever reaching an agreement with the Romans, and since they were unable to prevail over the emperor in war, they came before the Persian king led by Bassaces, an energetic man.\\" The events led to a new conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 3 In 540, Justinian I appointed Belisarius and Bouzes joint magistri militum per Orientem. Bouzes would personally command the area between the Euphrates and the Persian border. He also temporarily held command over Belisarius' areas. Belisarius had just been recalled from the Gothic War and was still in the Italian Peninsula. He would not reach his new post until the spring of 541. \\"The emperor had divided into two parts the military command of the East, leaving the portion as far as the River Euphrates under the control of Belisarius who formerly held the command of the whole, while the portion from there as far as the Persian boundary he entrusted to Bouzes, commanding him to take charge of the whole territory of the East until Belisarius should return from Italy.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 6 In the spring of the same year (540), the Sassanids invaded Byzantine areas. They avoided the fortresses of Mesopotamia, heading for the easier targets of Syria and Cilicia. Bouzes was stationed at Hierapolis at the beginning of this campaign season. By mid-summer, the Sassanids had captured Sura. Bouzes left Hierapolis at the head of his best troops. He promised to return if the city came under Persian threat, but Procopius accuses Bouzes of simply vanishing, with neither the Hierapolitans or the Sassanids able to locate him.Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapters 5-6 \\"Bouzes therefore at first remained at Hierapolis, keeping his whole army with him; but when he learned what had befallen Sura, he called together the first men of the Hierapolitans and spoke as follows: \\"Whenever men are confronted with a struggle against an assailant with whom they are evenly matched in strength, it is not at all unreasonable that they should engage in open conflict with the enemy; but for those who are by comparison much inferior to their opponents it will be more advantageous to circumvent their enemy by some kind of tricks than to array themselves openly against them and thus enter into foreseen danger. How great, now, the army of Chosroes is, you are assuredly informed. And if, with this army, he wishes to capture us by siege, and if we carry on the fight from the wall, it is probable that, while our supplies will fail us, the Persians will secure all they need from our land, where there will be no one to oppose them. And if the siege is prolonged in this way, I believe too that the fortification wall will not withstand the assaults of the enemy, for in many places it is most susceptible to attack, and thus irreparable harm will come to the Romans. But if with a portion of the army we guard the wall of the city, while the rest of us occupy the heights about the city, we shall make attacks from there at times upon the camp of our antagonists, and at times upon those who are sent out for the sake of provisions, and thus compel Chosroes to abandon the siege immediately and to make his retreat within a short time; for he will not be at all able to direct his attack without fear against the fortifications, nor to provide any of the necessities for so great an army.\\" So spoke Bouzes; and in his words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was necessary he did nothing. For he chose out all that portion of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off. And where in the world he was, neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was able to learn.\\" He is mentioned again later that year at Edessa. The local citizens were attempting to pay ransom for the safe return of prisoners held at Antioch. Bouzes prevented them from doing so. \\"Chosroes ...wished to sell off all the captives from Antioch. And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an unheard-of zeal. For there was not a person who did not bring ransom for the captives and deposit it in the sanctuary according to the measure of his possessions. And there were some who even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing. For the harlots took off all the adornment which they wore on their persons, and threw it down there, and any farmer who was in want of plate or of money, but who had an ass or a sheep, brought this to the sanctuary with great zeal. So there was collected an exceedingly great amount of gold and silver and money in other forms, but not a bit of it was given for ransom. For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain. Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 13 Lazic War Map of Lazica The hostilities of 540 gave way to the long-running Lazic War (541-562). In 541, Bouzes is recorded as one of the various Roman (Byzantine) commanders gathering at Dara to decide on a course of action. He was among those in favor of an invasion into Sassanid areas. Procopius mentions: \\"At this time Belisarius had arrived in Mesopotamia and was gathering his army from every quarter, and he also kept sending men into the land of Persia to act as spies. And wishing himself to encounter the enemy there, if they should again make an incursion into the land of the Romans, he was organizing on the spot and equipping the soldiers, who were for the most part without either arms or armour, and in terror of the name of the Persians. Now the spies returned and declared that for the present there would be no invasion of the enemy; for Chosroes was occupied elsewhere with a war against the Huns. And Belisarius, upon learning this, wished to invade the land of the enemy immediately with his whole army. ... And Peter and Bouzes urged him to lead the army without any hesitation against the enemy's country. And their opinion was followed immediately by the whole council. \\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 16 While Bouzes probably served under Belisarius in this campaign, his specific activities are not mentioned. The Byzantine invasion force failed to capture Nisibis, though they did capture Sisauranon. In the campaign season of 542, Khosrau I once again invaded Byzantine-held areas. Bouzes, Justus and others retreated within the walls of Hierapolis. He was one of the co-writers of a letter asking Belisarius to join them there. Belisarius instead moved towards Europum, summoning the other leaders there. Procopius narrates: \\"At the opening of spring Chosroes, the son of Cabades, for the third time began an invasion into the land of the Romans with a mighty army, keeping the River Euphrates on the right. ... The Emperor Justinian, upon learning of the inroad of the Persians, again sent Belisarius against them. And he came with great speed to Euphratesia since he had no army with him, riding on the government post-horses, which they are accustomed to call \\"veredi,\\" while Justus, the nephew of the emperor, together with Bouzes and certain others, was in Hierapolis where he had fled for refuge.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 20 \\"And when these men heard that Belisarius was coming and was not far away, they wrote a letter to him which ran as follows: \\"Once more Chosroes, as you yourself doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident, except indeed that we hear he is very near, and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as possible, if indeed you are able to escape detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself may be safe for the emperor, and that you may join us in guarding Hierapolis.\\" Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: \\"If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits.\\" And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others with the rest of the army came to Europum.\\" Falling out of favor In the Summer of 542, Constantinople was affected by the so-called Plague of Justinian. The emperor Justinian himself caught the plague and there were discussions of an imminent succession. Belisarius and Bouzes, both absent in campaign, reportedly swore to oppose any emperor chosen without their consent. Theodora took offense and had them both recalled at Constantinople to face her judgement. Bouzes was captured upon his return. He reportedly spent two years and four months (late 542-early 545) held in an underground chamber, located below the women's quarters of the palace. While eventually released, Procopius suggests that Bouzes continued to suffer from a failing eyesight and ill health for the rest of his life. Procopius narrates: \\"The plague which I mentioned in the previous narrative was ravaging the population of Byzantium. And the Emperor Justinian was taken very seriously ill, so that it was even reported that he had died. And this report was circulated by rumour and was carried as far as the Roman army. There some of the commanders began to say that, if the Romans should set up a second Justinian as Emperor over them in Byzantium, they would never tolerate it. But a little later it so fell out that the Emperor recovered, and the commanders of the Roman army began to slander one another. For Peter the General and John whom they called the Glutton declared that they had heard Belisarius and Bouzes say those things which I have just mentioned. The Empress Theodora, declaring that these slighting things which the men had said were directed against her, became quite out of patience. So she straightway summoned them all to Byzantium and made an investigation of the report.\\"Procopius, Secret History, Book 2, Chapter 4 \\"She [Theodora] called Bouzes suddenly into the woman's apartment as if to communicate to him something very important. Now there was a suite of rooms in the Palace, below the ground level, secure and a veritable labyrinth, so that it seemed to resemble Tartarus, where she usually kept in confinement those who had given offence. So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as he sat there in the darkness, he could [not] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And straightway it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly.\\" \\"Such was the experience of Bouzes. As for Belisarius, though he was convicted of none of the charges, the Emperor, at the insistence of the Empress, relieved him of the command which he held and appointed Martinus to be General of the East in his stead, and instructed him to distribute the spearmen and guards of Belisarius and all his servants who were notable men in war to certain of the officers and Palace eunuchs. So these cast lots for them and divided them all up among themselves, arms and all, as each happened to win them. And many of those who had been his friends or had previously served him in some way he forbade to visit Belisarius any longer. And he went about, a sorry and incredible sight, Belisarius a private citizen in Byzantium, practically alone, always pensive and gloomy, and dreading a death by violence.\\" Later years In either the late summer or early autumn of 548, Germanus confided to Bouzes and Constantianus about the ongoing conspiracy of Artabanes, a plot to assassinate Justinian. While Justinian had the conspirators arrested, Germanus and his sons also came under suspicion for their contact. In particular, they had to explain why they alerted generals loyal to Justinian but failed to inform the emperor himself. Bouzes, Constantianus, Marcellus and Leontius testified under oath to the innocence of Germanus.Bury (1958), p. 68 In spring 549, Bouzes was once again active on campaign. He led (along with Aratius, Constantianus, and John) an army of 10,000 cavalry men. They were sent to assist the Lombards against the Gepids. This campaign was short-lived as the two opponents concluded a peace treaty, making the presence of Byzantine forces unnecessary. This is the last time Bouzes is mentioned by Procopius. He is next mentioned by Agathias c. 554-556 as one of the generals in charge of the army in Lazica. In 554, Bessas was the chief commander in this area. Martin, magister militum per Armeniam, seems to have been the second-in-command. Justin served as a deputy to Martinus and was apparently third in line. Leaving Bouzes as fourth in the chain of command. Agathias reports that all four men were veterans of previous wars.Greatrex & Lieu (2002), pp. 120, 122Evans (1996), p. 168 Bessas was dismissed from office in 554/555, leaving Martin as the chief commander. Bouzes is explicitly said to be third-in-command. In September/October, 555 the three of them and the sacellarius Rusticus went to meet Gubazes II of Lazica. Justin and Bouzes reportedly thought that they were to discuss a planned attack on the Sassanid forces in Onoguris (a local fort). Martin and Rusticus had Gubazes murdered, reportedly shocking Bouzes. However, he soon suspected that Justinian himself had ordered the assassination. He thus held his tongue from too much protesting. Preparations for an attack at Onoguris continued, but Sassanid reinforcements started arriving. Bouzes suggested that they should deal with the new arrivals first, postponing the planned attack. He was overruled. The Byzantines lost the battle of Onoguris. Bouzes is credited with successfully guarding a bridge crossing, during the subsequent retreat. His efforts saved the lives of many soldiers who crossed the bridge to safety. In early 556, Bouzes was ordered to defend Nesus (a minor island) at the River Phasis. He was later joined there by Justin. The two continued guarding the island, while the rest of the army was campaigning against the Misimiani (a local tribe). He is not mentioned again.

Before Spanish colonization, the site was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Payaya Indians were likely those who encountered the first Europeans. The \\"Villa de Bejar\\" was founded by Spanish explorers on May 5, 1718, by then Governor Martin Alarcon, at the headwaters of the San Pedro Creek. The mission San Antonio de Valero was established on the east bank of the creek and a presidio was 3/4 of a league downstream. Development of the Spanish colonial city followed. A trading post was also established near the presidio and the town developed as the capital of Tejas, a province of colonial Spain. It was the northernmost settlement associated with the Hispanic culture of the Valley of Mexico. After Mexico achieved independence in 1821, Anglo-American settlers entered the region from the United States. In 1836, Anglo-Americans gained control of Texas in the fighting that gained independence for the Republic of Texas. In 1845 Texas was annexed by the United States, and became a state. Early history After thousands of years of succeeding indigenous cultures, the historic Payaya Indians coalesced as a distinct ethnic group. They lived near the San Antonio River Valley, in the San Pedro Springs area, which they called Yanaguana, meaning ‚Äúrefreshing waters‚Äù. In 1536, √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, a shipwrecked Spanish explorer who was enslaved by Native Americans for a period, visited the interior of what would later be called Texas. He saw and described the river later to be named the San Antonio.Web site of the San Antonio River Walk, May 26, 2011. He eventually rejoined Spanish colleagues in Mexico City. Several expeditions to the region of Texas, an area of great strategic importance to the Spanish crown, were organized from the Convent of Quer√©taro. With that goal in 1675, an expedition formed by Fray Antonio de Olivares, Fray Francisco Hidalgo, Fray Juan Larios and Fernando Orozco Josu√© Hern√°ndez y hay hete su√©ter is Natalia Orozco, were sent to explore and recognize the country beyond the borders of the Rio Grande, to test the possibilities of new settlements in the area. In 1691, a group of Spanish explorers and missionaries came upon the river and Native American settlement (located in the area of present-day La Villita) on June 13. As it was the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padua, Italy, they named the place and river San Antonio in his honor. In 1709, the expedition headed by Pedro de Aguirre, together with Fray Antonio de Olivares and Fray Isidro de Espinosa was undertaken which consisted of exploration of the territory where the present city of San Antonio is located and extended to the Colorado River. The same year he traveled to Spain to convince the authorities to establish and maintain new missions on the bank of the San Antonio River at the present-day city of San Antonio. In 1716, Fray Antonio de Olivares wrote to the Viceroy of New Spain, telling their hopes and plans for the future mission, and urged him to send families of settlers to found a town. In the same letter he stressed that it was necessary for some of these families to be skilled in the useful arts and industries, \\"to teach the Indians all that should be required to be useful and capable citizens\\" . Finally, perseverance of Fray Antonio was answered and the Viceroyalty gave formal approval for the mission in late 1716, and assigned responsibility for their establishment to Mart√≠n de Alarc√≥n, the governor of Coahuila y Tejas. Spanish settlement Misi√≥n de San Antonio de Valero San Antonio (Tejas). Fray Antonio de Olivares was organizing the founding of the new mission, from the next Mission San Francisco Solano, turning often met with the Indians of the area (Payaya Indians), gradually earning their love and respect. It remained only at the site of the mission for some time organizing everything with the Indians, the group finally stood straw structure, branches and mud near the head of San Antonio River. This mission was called San Antonio de Valero, a name derived from \\"San Antonio de Padua\\" and Viceroy New Spain, Marquess of Valero. The mission was located near a community of Coahuiltecan and was originally inhabited by indigenous three to five converted from Mission San Francisco Solano. Unfortunately, his work was suspended for some time, suffered an accident while crossing a bridge, the foot of the animal he was riding slipped into a hole, falling violently to the ground and breaking his leg. When he could walk again, mission changed place, transferring it to the west bank of the river, where floods were less likely. On orders of his religious order, Fray Antonio de Olivares transferred the Mission San Francisco Solano to the new mission of San Antonio de Valero. He also built the Presidio San Antonio de B√©xar, on the west side of the San Antonio River, approximately 1 mile from the mission. It was designed to protect the system of missions and civilian settlements in central Texas and to ensure the representation of Spain in the region of the aggression of French, British and Americans. The presidio consisted of an adobe building, thatched with grass, with soldiers quartered in brush huts. As settlers concentrated around the presidio complex and mission, began to form the town of Bejar or Bexar, convert it in the cornerstone of Spanish Texas. Being located in the center of several operating systems mission Bejar suffered not the needs and anxieties of other presidios. Despite occasional Indian attacks, the defense of the presidio walls were never completed or was deemed necessary, as the mission was complemented later converted into the main unit of walled defense. The operating complex was completed with the construction of the first ditch of Texas (Acequia Madre de Valero), 6 miles long, built to irrigate 400 hectares and supply of the inhabitants of the new facilities built. It was vital to the missions to be able to divert and control water from the San Antonio River, in order to grow crops and to supply water to the people in the area. This particular acequia was the beginning of a much wider acequia system. Acequia Madre de Valero ran from the area currently known as Brackenridge Park and southward to what is now Hemisfair Plaza and South Alamo Street. Part of it that is not viewable by the public runs beneath the Menger Hotel. The acequia was restored in 1968 and that year was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, San Antonio (Texas). Fray Antonio de Olivares was aided by Payaya Indians to build the bridge that connected the Misi√≥n de San Antonio de Valero and Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, and the Acequia Madre de Valero. On May 1, 1718, according to a statement certified to be preserved, Don Martin de Alarcon gave possession to Fray Antonio de Olivares of the Misi√≥n de San Antonio de Valero, later known as \\"The Alamo\\", based officially the mission. On May 5, was founded the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, on the west side of the San Antonio River, the source of the present city of San Antonio Texas. The event was chaired by Martin de Alarc√≥n, settling around 30 families in the surrounding area. On July 8, 1718 held at the new Mission San Antonio de Valero the first baptism, as reflected in the baptismal register of the mission. On February 14, 1719, the Marquess of San Miguel de Aguayo made a report to the king of Spain proposing that 400 families be transported from the Canary Islands, Galicia, or Habana to populate the province of Texas. In June 1730, 25 families come to Cuba, and 10 families were sent to Veracruz. Under the leadership of Juan Leal Goraz, the group marched overland to the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, where they arrived on March 9, 1731. The group joined the military community that had existed since 1718, forming the first government of the city and taking as headquarters building Presidio of San Antonio de B√©jar. In 1719, Margil obtained permission from the Marqu√©s de San Miguel de Aguayo to found a second mission at San Antonio. However, Father Olivares he opposed it. Despite of it, the Zacatecan Franciscans founded Mission San Jos√© y San Miguel de Aguayo, next to the San Antonio River, on February 23, 1720. San Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas. After the failure of Spanish missions to the north of the city, San Antonio became the farthest northeastern extension of the Hispanic culture of the Valley of Mexico. The city was for most of its history the capital of the Spanish, later Mexican, province of Tejas. From San Antonio the Camino Real, today's Nacogdoches Road, ran to the American border at the small frontier town of Nacogdoches. The Texas Revolution After Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, Anglo American settlers, at the invitation of the Mexican government via Empresarios such as Stephen F. Austin, began to settle in Texas in areas east and northeast of San Antonio. When Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, after being elected President of Mexico in 1833, rescinded the Mexican Constitution of 1824, violence ensued in many provinces of Mexico. In Texas the Anglo settlers joined many Hispanic Texans, who called themselves Tejanos, in demanding a return to the Constitution of 1824. In a series of battles the Anglo Texans, who called themselves Texians, supported by a significant number of Tejano allies, initially succeeded in forcing the Mexican military to retreat from Texas. Under the leadership of Ben Milam, in the Battle of Bexar, December, 1835, Texian forces captured San Antonio from forces commanded by General Martin Perfecto de Cos, Santa Anna's brother-in-law. Forces opposing Santa Anna took control of the entire province of Texas. Today Milam Park and the Cos House in San Antonio commemorate this battle. Battle of the Alamo The Alamo as it appears today. After putting down resistance in other regions of Mexico, in the spring of 1836, Santa Anna led a Mexican army back into Texas and marched on San Antonio. He intended to avenge the defeat of Cos and end the Texan rebellion. Sam Houston, believing that San Antonio could not be defended against a determined effort by the regular Mexican army, called for the Texan forces to abandon the city. A volunteer force under the joint command of William Barrett Travis, newly arrived in Texas, and James Bowie, and including Davy Crockett and his company of Tennesseans, and Juan Seguin's company of Hispanic Texan volunteers, occupied and fortified the nearby deserted mission, the Alamo. They were determined to hold the Alamo against all opposition. The defenders of the Alamo included Anglo and Hispanic Texans who fought side by side under a banner - the flag of Mexico with the numerals \\"1824\\" superimposed. This was meant to indicate that the defenders were fighting for their rights to democratic government under the Mexican constitution of that year. During their siege, the Texas Congress declared an independent Republic of Texas. The [Battle of the Alamo] took place from February 23 to March 6, 1836. At first the battle was primarily a siege marked by artillery duels and small skirmishes. After twelve days Santa Anna, tired of waiting for his heavy artillery, determined to take the Alamo by storm. Before dawn on March 6, he launched his troops against the walls of the Alamo in three separate attacks. The third attack overwhelmed the defenses of the weak north wall. The defenders retreated to the Long Barracks and the Chapel, where they fought to the last man. Most historians agree that a handful of the defenders were captured, but were quickly executed as rebels on the specific orders of Santa Anna. The deaths of these \\"Martyrs to Texas Independence\\" inspired greater resistance to Santa Anna's regime. The cry, \\"Remember the Alamo,\\" became the rallying point of the Texas Revolution. Aftermath The Cenotaph in Alamo Plaza, a memorial to the Alamo defenders Texas won its independence at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21. Juan Segu√≠n, who had organized the company of Tejanos who fought and died at the Alamo, was with Sam Houston when it fell. Acting as a courier from the besieged fort, he had delivered a message from Travis to Houston, who forbade his return. Segu√≠n would later earn fame for leading a company of Tejano volunteers at the Battle of San Jacinto. After independence, he was elected to the Texas Senate. He later was elected as mayor of San Antonio. In 1842, he was forced out of that office at gunpoint by Anglo-American politicians. The next Hispanic to be elected as mayor of the city was Henry Cisneros in 1981.Gonzalez, Juan. Harvest of Empire. New York: Penguin, 2000. As the city of San Antonio has grown, the Alamo, which in 1836 was separated by the San Antonio River from downtown, has become an integral part of the modern center city. Alamo Plaza contains the Cenotaph, a monument built in celebration of the centenary of the battle. It bears the names of all known to have fought there on the Texas side. Since 2011, Alamo Trust, Inc., a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, has been the official partner of the Texas General Land Office in managing the Alamo complex. Surrounded by many hotels and tourist attractions, it is San Antonio's best-known landmark, featured in the city's flag and seal, and the most visited tourist attraction in the state. San Antonio is nicknamed the \\"Alamo City.\\" Its yearly Fiesta Week in April commemorates the Texian victory at San Jacinto. Annexation of Texas by the United States Lithograph of San Antonio in 1886. In 1845 the United States annexed Texas (with its concurrence) and included it as a state in the Union. This, after some incitement by United States troops along the Mexican border, led to the Mexican War between the United States and Mexico, which concluded with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848). Under this treaty Mexico ceded to the United States not only Texas but all of what is now the American Southwest, excluding a small portion of Arizona and New Mexico. The war was devastating to San Antonio. By its end the city population had been reduced by almost two thirds, to 800 inhabitants. Further population reduction occurred in a Cholera epidemic outbreak, which killed hundreds of resident in 1849. Peace and economic connections to the United States restored prosperity to the city, and by 1860, at the start of the Civil War, San Antonio had grown to a city of 15,000 people. From the late 1840s and the period of the German revolutions, many people immigrated to Texas from Germany. They tended to strongly oppose slavery as they had been fighting for justice and freedom. The most successful of the city's German merchants developed houses in the King William district, just south of downtown. Visitors heard German on the streets nearly as frequently as English and Spanish. The Germans created the beer and brewing industry in Texas. The Guenther Flour Mills, Gebhardt's Chili Powder, and Mahncke Park, are local institutions that recall San Antonio's German heritage. Civil War and postbellum Texas During the Civil War, San Antonio was not deeply involved in the secessionist cause. Many of the city's residents, notably those of ethnic German, African and Mexican ancestry, supported the Union. After the war, they supported the Republican Party for decades, as well as the Populist Party, which coalesced a multiracial political base in the late nineteenth century. After regaining power in the state legislature, white Democrats passed a poll tax in 1901. It effectively disenfranchised minorities and poor whites. With ethnic minorities and the lower classes of San Antonio and Texas society unable to vote, the Republican Party lost its competitive edge in most areas of the state. After the war, San Antonio prospered as a center of the cattle culture. Anglo Americans learned the Spanish and Mexican techniques of herding cattle on horseback, creating a new generation of cowboys. The major cattle trails for driving stock to markets and railroads, including Chisholm Trail, began in San Antonio. The business promoter \\"Bet a Million\\" Gates chose San Antonio to demonstrate the value of his barbed wire in the herding of cattle. In 1876 he fenced off Alamo Plaza with the new invention and had cowboys drive a herd of cattle into the wire. When the wire held the cattle, many of the ranchers in attendance quickly placed orders for the new product. San Antonio was crucial during both the beginning and end of the open-range period in American ranching culture. During the postbellum period, San Antonio remained a frontier city. Its isolation and diverse array of cultures gave it the reputation of being an exotic place. When Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect who two years later designed Central Park in New York City, visited San Antonio in 1856, he described the city as having a \\"jumble of races, costumes, languages, and buildings,\\" which gave it a quality, which only New Orleans could rival, of \\"odd and antiquated foreignness.\\" Much of the mystique that makes San Antonio a tourist destination has its origins in the uniqueness of the city. In 1850, San Antonio became the largest city in Texas with 8,235 people, taking the lead from Galveston. Bolstered by the construction of its first railroad in 1877, and a horrible hurricane that had struck Galveston, San Antonio reemerged as the state's largest city in 1900. It remained in the top spot until 1930, when Dallas and Houston overtook the Alamo City.\\"San Antonio, TX\\". Texas State Historical Association. Retrieved December 10, 2013. It connected the city to major markets and‚Äîincreasingly‚Äîthe mainstream of American society. San Antonio was often frequented by gun fighters and robbers of the Old West and is particularly associated with Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid members of the Wild Bunch, who often used Fannie Porter's brothel as a hideout. Modern times Aerial view of the city, San Antonio, December 4, 1939 At the beginning of the 20th century, the streets of Downtown, the old Spanish and Mexican city, were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic. In the process many historic building were destroyed. These included the Veramendi House, the home of the prominent family into which Jim Bowie had married when he came to the city. Standing on the southwest side of the intersection of Houston and Soledad Streets, this building was a massive quadrangle built of adobe around a central courtyard in the typical Mexican style. When the street was widened by 20 feet, the building was leveled. Like many municipalities in the Southern United States, San Antonio has had steady population growth since the late twentieth century. The city's population has nearly doubled in 35 years, from just over 650,000 in the 1970 census to an estimated 1.2 million in 2005 through population growth, immigration, and land annexation (considerably enlarging the physical area of the city).

The short was released on August 30, 1952, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. The title is a pun on the song \\"A Bird in a Gilded Cage\\". Plot Sylvester is at a store called Stacy's, where he notices Tweety in the window stand. Going through the package slot, he closes the curtains and climbs up to Tweety's cage, who asks him what he's going to do. After asiding to the audience, \\"How naive can ya get?\\", Sylvester replies that they're going to play a game called Sandwich, involving Tweety getting sandwiched in two pieces of bread and nearly eaten (\\"I don't wike dat game!\\"). Tweety flees, with Sylvester in hot pursuit. The cat is forced to stack mannequins on top of each other to reach the canary, who is hiding in the lighting. Tweety climbs down and puts skates on the mannequin statue to push the structure down some stairs. He returns however, and the chase resumes, leading him to a hat sale, where he begins trying on hats. He finds the one with Tweety on top, and tries to smash him, instead hitting himself. Tweety then hides in a dollhouse, which eventually ends with Sylvester shooting his own finger. A final sequence involves a gun in a hole gag, where as Sylvester shoves his gun in a hole in the wall, another is aimed at his rear. Predictably, this ends in Sylvester getting his buttocks shot. Tweety then goes through the pneumatic tubes of Stacy's, with Sylvester going to the other end to catch him. However, Tweety comes out a different hole, and puts a stick of dynamite in. Sylvester swallows it, thinking he has gotten Tweety, but as he strolls out, it explodes, leaving him blackened. He then decides to cross off birds from his diet, saying to himself that \\"That one sort of upset my stomach!\\". Trivia * Sylvester would check birds off his diet list in two other cartoons, Tweet Zoo and Trip for Tat. * Mel Blanc's voice for Tweety was raised to an extra pitch in this cartoon and would stay at that pitch until Muzzle Tough released in 1954.

Writings Goldman‚Äôs most influential work appeared in 1952: Rendezvous with Destiny: A History of Modern American Reform, covering reform efforts from the Grant Administration into the Truman years . For decades it was a staple of the undergraduate curriculum in history, highly regarded for its style and its exposition of modern American liberalism. According to Priscilla Roberts: : Lively, well-written, and highly readable, it provided an overview of eight decades of reformers, complete with arresting vignettes of numerous individuals, and stressed the continuities among successful American reform movements. Writing at the height of the Cold War, he also argued that the fundamental liberal tradition of the United States was moderate, centrist, and incrementalist, and decidedly non-socialist and none-totalitarian. While broadly sympathetic to the cause of American reform, Goldman was far from uncritical toward his subjects, faulting progressives of World War I for their lukewarm reception of the League of Nations, American reformers of the 1920s for their emphasis on freedom of lifestyles rather than economic reform, and those of the 1930s for overly tolerant attitude toward Soviet Russia. His views of past American reformers encapsulated the conventional, liberal, centrist orthodoxy of the early 1950s, from its support for anti-communism and international activism abroad and New Deal-style big government at home, to its condemnation of McCarthyism.Priscilla M.

October 26, 1976) is the basis for the legal requirement in Alberta that, where a separate school jurisdiction exists (they exist in only some of Alberta), members of the minority faith that established the separate school jurisdiction must be considered and treated as residents, electors, and ratepayers of the separate school jurisdiction. This decision was handed down prior to the enactment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and it has not been appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada so it is not ultimately determinative of the issue. Significance Schmidt is a civil rights case, pre-Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The key question is whether there was an illegal expression of discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs, contrary to the Alberta Individual Rights Protection Act, 1972 (Individual's Rights Protection Act, 1972 (Alta.), c.2, s.3(b) - School Act, R.S.A. 1970, c. 329, ss. 53,142, 143). It is also a constitutional law case, relating to the provisions that enshrine the rights of those who choose to establish and operate separate schools in Alberta. (British North America Act, 1867, s. 93 - Alberta Act, 1905 (Can.), c.3, s. 17 - Individual's Rights Protection Act, 1972 (Alta.), c. 2, ss.1(2), 3(b)) History The applicant, Mr. Schmidt, was Roman Catholic, and the father of two young (school-aged) children. The parents had earlier lived in Ontario, where they had enrolled their daughters in a public school, although a Roman Catholic school was available to them. In Ontario, members of the minority faith have the option of being residents, electors, and ratepayers of the public school system. Mr. Schmidt's employer transferred him to Calgary, where he sought to enroll his children in the public school system (as he had done in Ontario). Staff of the Calgary Board of Education advised Mr. Schmidt that he must either pay a non-resident tuition fee for each child or first enroll his children in the separate school system and negotiate with that system to have them transfer the children to the public school system (the Calgary Board of Education) and pay tuition. Mr. Schmidt objected to this process, on the basis that the parents of the children should have the direct opportunity to enroll their children in the public school system. (Mr. Schmidt, although a Roman Catholic, supported public school education and preferred to have his daughters educated in a public school.) Mr. Schmidt lodged a complaint with the Alberta Human Rights Commission. A Board of Inquiry, organized pursuant to the Individual Rights Protection Act, 1972 (Alberta), found against him and upheld the proposition that, in Alberta, wherever a separate school jurisdiction exists, members of the minority faith that established the separate school jurisdiction must be considered and treated as residents, electors, and ratepayers of the separate school jurisdiction. The Board of Inquiry concluded that Mr. Schmidt would have to enroll his children with the Calgary Roman Catholic Separate School District and ask the Separate School District to enter into a tuition agreement with the Calgary Board of Education so that it (CBE) would enroll his child. Mr. Schmidt appealed the decision of the Board of Inquiry, by commencing an action before the Court of Queen's Bench, Alberta. The Court of Queen's Bench found in his favour, overturning the decision of the Board of Inquiry. The Calgary Board of Education appealed, and the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench was overturned on appeal to the Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division. Main Findings Mr. Justice Moir, speaking for the Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division (now the Alberta Court of Appeal), made several findings. Primary among these are: :* Once a religious minority has established their own school jurisdiction, all members of that faith become members and are excluded from the public jurisdiction. The law makes it clear that there \\"is no machinery for getting out so long as you are of the religious faith of the minority who have acted to establish the separate school district.\\"Re Schmidt and Calgary Board of Education (1976), 72 D.L.R. (3d) 330 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.) Furthermore, \\"[t]he majority of the minority have the right to compel the entire minority to join the separate school division.\\" :* Paying taxes to a public jurisdiction does not make an individual a resident of that jurisdiction if there exists separate school jurisdiction in which they should be a resident. Justice Moir states, \\"The fact that Schmidt is paying his taxes to the public school board must be by error in law as I can find no authority for it. In my opinion it cannot effect Schmidt's residence.\\" :* School jurisdictions are permitted to ask the faith of those parents who enroll their children in the jurisdiction. Justice Moir states, \\"As soon as the minority opted out of the public school system (be it Protestant or Catholic) it was necessary to ask 'Are you a Roman Catholic of a Protestant?'\\" He continues, \\"In order to have two separate school systems it is necessary to have a legislative method of dividing or separating the minority from the majority.\\" He offers the following example: \\"it is essential in legislation dealing with 'Indians' that Parliament be able to define the class to which the legislation is to apply. Likewise if separate schools are to be permitted a mechanism for separating the group had to be found.\\" :* Minority faiths (meaning Roman Catholics and Protestants) have guaranteed rights to separate school jurisdictions that cannot be superseded by any act of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Justice Moir states, \\"The existence of two systems is guaranteed to the minority.... This is the situation as it was in 1901, and in 1905 and the way it is in Calgary today. In my opinion there is no legislative authority in Alberta to abolish that scheme...\\" He continues, \\"It is elementary to say that the provisions of a statute of Alberta are incapable of affecting the validity of the British North America Act, 1867, or of the Alberta Act. The scheme having been approved of by the Imperial Parliament, the Parliament of Canada, as well by the Legislature of Alberta, is binding. In my opinion it cannot be held inoperative by reason of the Individual Rights Protection Act.\\" The text of the full decision is available in most Canadian legal databases; however, a free and openly accessible copy of the decision is available on the website of the Public School Boards' Association of Alberta.

He was a working associate of Sleepy John Estes and Hammie Nixon. He was similar to Estes in his guitar-playing style. According to the music journalist Jim O'Neal, \\"the music to one of Bonds's songs, 'Back and Side Blues' (1934), became a standard blues melody when Sonny Boy Williamson I, from nearby Jackson, Tennessee, used it in his classic \\"Good Morning, School Girl\\".

He was also billed on records as \\"Brownsville\\" Son Bonds and Brother Son Bonds. Sleepy John Estes, in his earlier recordings, was backed by Yank Rachell (mandolin) or Hammie Nixon (harmonica), but by the late 1930s he was accompanied in the recording studio by either Bonds or Charlie Pickett (guitar). Bonds also backed Estes on a couple of recording sessions in 1941. In return, either Estes or Nixon played on every one of Bonds's own recordings. In the latter part of his career, Bonds played the kazoo as well as the guitar on several tracks. According to Nixon's later accounts of the event, Bonds suffered an accidental death in August 1947. While sitting on his front porch late one evening in Dyersburg, Tennessee, Bonds was shot to death by his nearsighted neighbor, who mistook him for another man, with whom the neighbor was having a protracted disagreement.

He is known by his nickname, The Korean Hawk. Chang took the tough road to becoming a world champion. In Chang's 15th pro fight, he faced former WBA flyweight champion Alfonso Lopez. Chang knocked out Lopez in the 3rd round. Next, Chang faced future IBF flyweight champion Jong-Kwan Chung, stopping Chung in the 6th round. In his 18th fight, and last before challenging for his first world title, Chang scored a 10 round unanimous decision over former WBC light flyweight champion Amado Ursua. In Chang's first world title try, he lost to Hilario Zapata of Panama by a 15 round split decision in 1982, by scores of 148-145, 142-144 and 144-147. However, in a rematch held in Seoul, he avenged that loss and became WBC light flyweight world champion by knocking out Zapata at 2:46 of the 3rd round. Chang then went on to establish a then-world record for the most defenses as world light flyweight champion, defending the title successfully 16 times between 1983 and 1988 when he retired. In his first defense, he defeated Masaharu Inami and followed it with a win over future champion German Torres. In 1984, he defeated future champion, Sot Chitalada, former champion Katsuo Tokashiki and Tadashi Kuramochi. He started 1985 with a narrow majority decision in a rematch with German Torres. The outcome was determined by a single point on one judge's scorecard. Later in the year, he defeated Francisco Montiel and Jorge Cano. In 1986, Chang faced Torres in a third meeting, this time defeating him by unanimous decision. He followed it with a rematch victory over Francisco Montiel and a knockout over future champion Hideyuki Ohashi. After securing victories over Efren Pinto and Agustin Garcia in 1987, he faced future champion Isidro Perez. In a hard fought battle, Perez dropped Chang in the opening round, however, the referee failed to rule it as such. Chang was ultimately awarded a close unanimous decision victory. After a TKO victory in a rematch over Hideyuki Ohashi in 1988, Chang announced his retirement. However, financial difficulties pushed him back into the ring in 1989 when he challenged and lost to Humberto Gonz√°lez, who was the WBC light flyweight champion at the time. After moving up to the flyweight division, he challenged WBC flyweight champion Sot Chitalada who he had defeated several years prior. In a closely contested bout, Chang lost a disputed majority decision. Chitalada would go one to lose his title to Muangchai Kittikasem in his very next fight, prompting Chang to challenge the newly crowned champion. Chang dropped the champion three times, however, Kittikasem rallied back to stop him in the final round. Chang announced his retirement immediately after.https://www.boxingmonthly.com/stories/jung-koo-chang-the-best-fighter- youve-never-heard-about/ Chang's record for successive title defenses in the 108-pound division would soon be broken by fellow South Korean boxer Yuh Myung-Woo, who successfully defended his WBA light flyweight title 17 times in his first reign between 1985 and 1991. Chang had a record of 38 wins and 4 losses, with 17 wins by knockout. On June 2010, Chang and 12 other boxing personalities were inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He became the first Korean boxer to be inducted in the prestigious boxing hall of fame, and the 5th Asian boxer to receive the honor.

It is located in the Western part of the island, on the Ciutadella de Menorca-Mah√≥n road, approximately 3 miles out from Ciutadella, and 200 m south of the road. It stands on slightly rising ground in a sloping valley. Currently the Naveta d'Es Tudons is open to the public for visits (except for its interior as a measure of protection). It is one of the main tourist attractions of Menorca.  History In Menorca and Majorca there are several dozen habitational and funerary naveta complexes, some of which similarly comprise two storeys. Navetas (navetes in Menorqu√≠) are chronologically pre-Talaiotic (i.e. prior to the Talaiotic age) constructions. Navetas were described in the early 19th century but not excavated until the 20th, notably during the 1960s and 1970s. Navetas were first given their name by the rather imaginative Dr Juan Ramis in his book Celtic antiques on the island of Menorca (1818), from their resemblance to upturned boats. The Naveta d'Es Tudons is the largest and best preserved funerary naveta in Menorca. The Naveta d'Es Tudons served as collective ossuary between 1200 and 750 BC. The lower chamber was for stashing the disarticulated bones of the dead after the flesh had been removedPhil Lee, The Rough Guide to Menorca, Rough Guides, 2001, 288 p. 187. while the upper chamber was probably used for the drying of recently placed corpses. Radiocarbon dating of the bones found in the different funerary navetas in Menorca indicate a usage period between about 1130-820 BC, but the navetas like the Naveta d'Es Tudons are probably older. Pre-Talaiotic constructions are dated using an uncalibrated radiocarbon chronology from 1640 to 1400 BC. The navetas used for communal burial rituals are dated to the late second millennium and early first millennium BC. Although listed in the Spanish heritage register on 3 June 1931 (RI-51-0003442), the naveta d'Es Tudons was excavated and restored by archaeologist Llu√≠s Pericot Garc√≠a in 1959-1960. It was found to contain the remains of at least 100 skeletons (one with trepanned skull). Various recovered objects like bronze bracelets or bone and ceramic buttons are today on display in the Museu de Menorca in Mah√≥n. Restoration works were carried out and the two or three missing courses at the top were put back in place. For protection, it was surrounded at a distance by a recently restored modern dry stone field wall.Dominique Auzias, Jean-Paul Labourdette, Bal√©ares, Ibiza ‚Äî Minorque ‚Äî Majorque, Le Petit F√ªt√©, 2012, 336 p., p. 281 : \\"Inutile de vous extasier sur le mur de pierre s√®che qui entoure la Naveta, il est de construction r√©cente\\" (\\"There is no need for one to enthuse about the dry stone wall surrounding the Naveta, its construction is recent.\\")  Architecture  Plan and section of the unrestored naveta (1912): (a) low door, (b) narrow slab-roofed passage, (c) long rectangular chamber. The shape of the Naveta d'Es Tudons is that of a boat upside down, with the stern as its trapezoidal fa√ßade and the bow as its rounded apse. Its groundplan is an elongated semicircle. Externally, the edifice is 14.5 m long by 6.5 m wide and 4.55 m high but it would originally have been 6 m high. It is orientated SWS/ENE, the entrance being at the SWS, in the centre of the slightly slanted (or battered) fa√ßade. The front, side walls and apse of the edifice consist of successive horizontal corbelled courses of huge rectangular or square limestone blocks dressed with a hammer and fitted together without mortar, with an all-round foundation course of blocks of even greater size laid on edge. The narrow, low entrance doorway (0.57 m x 0.75 m) is rebated to receive a closing slab. The once sealed-off entrance leads by a short, flag-roofed passage to an antechamber 1.3 m long and then another short passage to the main or lower chamber (7.45 m x 2.45 m), the ceiling of which is made of giant horizontal slabs inserted into the side walls, with an average span of 1.5 m c. 2.25 m above the floor. Above this is an upper chamber which is accessible from the upper part of the antechamber. It is slightly shorter (7.10 m) and narrower (1.90 m) than the lower chamber, with a similar although much lower (0.85 m) ceiling of horizontal slabs. These have holes in them, presumably for ventilation. The edifice at dawn, behind its modern wall  Folklore  According to Phil Lee, the author of The Rough Guide to Menorca, folkloric memories of the navetas' original purpose may have survived into modern times, for the Menorcans were loath to go near these odd-looking and solitary monuments until well into the 19th century. A modern tragic lore tells that two giants were competing for the love of a girl. They agreed that one would build a naveta and the other would dig a water well and the first to finish would marry the girl. As the giant who was building the naveta was about to lay the last stone, the other struck water. Mad with jealousy, the first giant threw the last stone (the one that is missing from the top of the fa√ßade) into the well, killing the other giant. Then, feeling remorse, he killed himself. It is said that the girl died a spinster and was buried in the naveta.

History There has been a coach interchange at the junction of the M1 since April 1989, constructed by Buckinghamshire County Council (as the highway authority). By the early 2000s, the original building had become worn out and plans were begun to replace it with a new building, with funding support from the government. Details on Major Growth Developments in Milton KeynesMilton Keynes Council, June 2008 In 2006 works were carried out on the M1 Junction 14 to widen the M1 slip road at the junction, install new traffic signals, create a dedicated left-turn lane from the A509 to the northbound M1, widen the southbound A509 to three lanes between J14 and Northfields roundabout and create a new access road from the A5130 to the (then) proposed new 500 space park-and-ride site. This work was in advance of the planned re-development of the coachway and park and ride site. Plans for the new coachway were released in April 2008 and services were moved on a temporary basis to Silbury Boulevard. At that time it was expected that work would be completed by spring 2009. Facilities at the temporary site included a waiting room, caf√©, ticket office, toilets, a shop with taxi booking facilities and approximately 60 adjacent parking spaces with CCTV and 24-hour on-site security. All local services along this section of Silbury Boulevard stopped at the temporary coachway. In March 2009 it was announced that work would be delayed with completion expected in 'spring/summer 2010' due to higher than expected tender prices requiring the council to source a further ¬£600,000. Construction was managed by Milton Keynes Council until it was passed to the Homes and Communities Agency in September 2010. Work on the structure was underway by October 2009 when the steel frame could be seen from the motorway. The final fitting out was undertaken by National Express who operate the station on behalf of the council and the agency. The new interchange opened on 13 December 2010. The cost of the project was ¬£2.6 million funded by the Milton Keynes Partnership and the Growth Area Fund via the Department for Transport. Facilities The coach station building has a caf√©, a shop, toilets, cycle racks and facilities to book taxis and National Express Coaches.

In 1991, he received both a Juris Doctorate from Harvard and an MA in philosophy from Boston College. After clerking for Judge Cecil F. Poole at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, he pursued a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in 1996, where he was a student of the Heidegger scholar Hubert Dreyfus. From 1994 to 1996 he was a teaching fellow at Stanford Law School. He taught at Brigham Young University from 1996 to 2006 (first in the political science department, then from 1999 in the philosophy department). From 2006 to 2017, he was a professor at the University of California, Riverside. Philosophical work Wrathall's main interests include phenomenology, existentialism, the phenomenology of religion, and the philosophy of law, but he is best-known for his work on Martin Heidegger. Wrathall has also contributed to the philosophy of popular culture, editing a book on the philosophical themes found in the music of U2 and publishing essays on film and philosophy. Wrathall's work on popular culture intersects with his interests in religion. He draws on Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche to describe how secularism and technology undermine belief in objective eternal meanings and values. But Wrathall thinks nihilism also \\"opens up access to richer and more relevant ways for us to understand creation and for us to encounter the divine and the sacred.\\" Books 2000 Heidegger, Coping and Cognitive Science (MIT Press) - editor with Jeff Malpas 2000 Heidegger, Authenticity and Modernity (MIT Press) - editor with Jeff Malpas 2000 Appropriating Heidegger (Cambridge University Press) - editor with James E.

The FDF works with and supervises the National Defence Training Association of Finland in the training of troops. Territorial Forces are composed of Territorial Companies, each of which is under command of military province of their area (sotilasl√§√§ni, four in total, divided into 19 military districts, aluetoimisto), in total there are 28 companies. Sometimes the name is rendered as local defence units or volunteer reserve units. Most important duties for Territorial Forces are protection, guarding, oversight and defence of certain targets and the area of their respective military district in general. In addition, Territorial Forces are tasked to provide assistance upon request to police and/or fire departments and other officials. During war, Territorial companies will fall under direct command of their respective headquarters of their respective Military province just as they are in peacetime. Members of the Territorial Forces have their personal equipment (excluding combat items such as vests, ballistic protection & helmets and weapons) at home on loan from the FDF, allowing quick mobilisation of troops in case of crisis since they only need to add combat equipment, vehicles, signalling equipment and supplies to be completely ready. These will be provided by garrisons and/or other military installations within or at least near to the military district the company in question is located in. Companies are always composed of reservists from area of certain military district within military province in question, providing an advantage of knowing the area of operations. Troops are trained regularly and their physical abilities are tested annually with conditions of suitability for troops set higher than basic expectations for professional soldiers of FDF. Creation The Territorial Company (maakuntakomppania) of Satakunta, participating in the national parade of the Finnish Defence Forces in Pori on the Defence Forces Flag Day 2009. In 1990, Finland declared the military restrictions of the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947 obsolete, which among other things had forbidden the military training outside of the FDF. In 1993, the National Defence Training Association of Finland was founded to guide and organize the voluntary defence training; the legal basis was established in 1994. In 2001, it was decided to develop the voluntary defence training. In 2002, a ministry- level working group was created to study the matter. The group released its report in 2004, calling for creation of what would become Territorial Forces. On 14 February 2007, the Finnish parliament passed the Act on Defence Forces 551/2007 which allowed the creation of the Territorial forces; President Tarja Halonen signed the law on 11 May. Critics During TF formation, left-wing political parties and other political groups criticized Territorial Forces for being too close to White Guard, abolished after World War II, while some civilian organizations such as the Finnish Red Cross said that Territorial Forces shouldn't take a part in operations that fall under their area of expertise, such as peacetime volunteer rescue service.

OYE is dedicated to the development of at-risk Honduran youth through an integrated academic scholarship program, a youth capacity- building and communication program. The final goal is the creation of youth leaders with a social conscience that are agents of positive change in the Honduran population. Origin OYE was founded in 2005, inspired by a vision of a society where young people have a powerful voice, and the knowledge and resources to effectively use it to create change in their lives. After spending many years volunteering with youth in El Progreso and witnessing first-hand the challenges facing them, Justin Eldridge-Otero and Ana Luisa Ahern piloted programs aimed at empowering young, low-income Hondurans to become active, responsible leaders in their community. As a critical first step, they started a scholarship program to help students who would otherwise be denied an education due to economic barriers. They quickly saw that access to a formal education was just the beginning and started developing an integrated leadership curriculum that is now broken up into three programs: Youth Capacity Building and Leadership, Community Engagement, and Institutional Strengthening. From the beginning, OYE‚Äôs founders recognized that in order to be a sustainable program, OYE must be led by representatives of the constituency it serves ‚Äì Honduran youth. OYE is established as a 501(c)3 charity in the United States, and all of its programs are carried out in Honduras. History Ana Luisa Ahern and Justin Eldridge-Otero volunteered at a home for disadvantaged children in El Progreso, Honduras since their adolescence and have developed a close relationship with the community. Justin and Ana Luisa spent many of their summer vacations teaching art classes, painting murals, and playing soccer with the kids. After graduating from Columbia University in 2004, Ana Luisa and Jessica Mockrin, decided to return to El Progreso and worked full-time. OYE began to grow through the progression of art programs in orphanages, the inclusion of various large-scale murals and after-school programs, and photography classes accompanied by general creative and artistic expression. After numerous pilot programs, they decided to focus their attention on education. 2005-2006 The three founded the Organization for Youth Empowerment (OYE) in the fall of 2005, turning their work in El Progreso, Honduras into a sustainable scholarship program. Together, these three founders built an organization that would equip and empower youth with what their families were denied: the opportunity to rise out of the poverty cycle through education. OYE, legally constituted in 2005, is structured as a U.S. not-for-profit 501(c)3 public charity organization. The organization's board of directors include veterans in international development and professionals in the U.S and Honduras. It was also supported by Oxfam International, Care International, Accion International, Kodak, and many more local and international organizations. In the following years, OYE completed several photography workshops with local youth. With these photos they organized a traveling exhibit called \\"Fotos de Mi Pueblo\\" which premiered in El Progreso, and went on to be featured in San Pedro Sula, and the capital, Tegucigalpa. Fotos de Mi Pueblo has also been featured across the United States by OYE volunteers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Amherst, Mass, Los Angeles and Washington, DC. OYE sold several prints to benefit the program. In November 2006, OYE received the YouthActionNet Award given by the International Youth Foundation, recognizing young social entrepreneurs who have founded sustainable development projects across the globe. OYE also created a weekly Youth Group, made up of teenage girls from an orphanage and the local community. This group created a space to analyze the needs of the youth. OYE also had a daily Sports and Youth Development Program facilitating soccer practice and tournaments, motivational games, and involving the youth group at the athletic facility to encourage a healthy lifestyle. 2007-2008 In 2007, OYE went through considerable changes in administration and operation. OYE, with a new central office, hired local and international staff aiming to expand OYE's potential. Beginning in the fall of 2007, the Organization for Youth Empowerment began a long and involved selection process to find fifty motivated and engaged youth that would become part of the growing scholarship program. At the end of each selection process, OYE honored its recipients with a ceremony welcoming the entire community. OYE's multi-faceted selection process helped the Scholarship Program reach out to a strong and diverse group of youth that would lead OYE's programming for 2008 and carry it into the future. OYE was selected by the International Youth Foundation as a winner of the 2008 Starbucks Social Entrepreneurs Fund Award. During 2008, the scholarship program grew. Students who were unable to use a computer mouse were suddenly editing radio programs and teaching other students to do the same. Students who could not articulate their desires or express themselves were now interacting with peers, local staff and international volunteers to communicate their situation and call for change in their communities. Once again, OYE began a rigorous application process and started 2009 with 75 vibrant and eager youth. In 2011 OYE's scholarship number has grown to 91 young people. Youth in Honduras Youth from many hardship situations go to OYE determined to improve their lives and communities. During the interview process students express a strong desire to continue studying despite the economic difficulties and family demands. A large portion of the students come from single-parent homes, where they face challenges of income, education, and overall development. Over half of the scholarship recipients are young women; those coming from single-parent homes are often obligated to tend to the household, caring for seven or more family members. Male recipients are asked to sacrifice academic studies in pursuit of minimal wage employment. The average monthly family income of many grant recipients is between 2,000 and 3,000 Lempiras (approximately 100-160 dollars) for families of seven or more. OYE believes that education will empower these students to create a positive and nurturing environment in their personal and professional lives. OYE students constantly express their hopes to improve themselves so that in the future they are prepared to offer the same support to others in their situation. The young women and men who make up OYE are driven to overcome and improve their situations through education. OYE trains students to excel in academic settings and leadership positions, helping them take control of their personal development by participating in OYE projects. Still, Honduran youth face many challenges, including growing family disintegration, gang membership, violence, human trafficking, and teen pregnancy. Since 2005, OYE has helped young people break these cycles by empowering youth leaders to pursue their academic interests, form solutions to social problems early in life, and advocate for the improvement of their communities. OYE's Programs= Academic Scholarships  Scholarships are at the core of OYE‚Äôs programs, providing an educational stipend that helps at-risk youth overcome the financial barrier that interrupts their formal education. Scholarships are awarded to students with leadership potential to continue their academic education at local schools and to further their development through OYE's Capacity Building & Leadership Program and Community Engagement Programs. Students become eligible in the 6th grade (about 12 years old) and can continue receiving their scholarship as long as they are enrolled in school, provided they meet academic achievement guidelines and actively participate in OYE‚Äôs programs. Scholars come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, with approximately half of all OYE families making less than $210 per month. Only 11% of youth have a parent who completed high school. In 2011, OYE had 60 returning students and 31 new students, bringing the total number of active scholarship recipients to 91. Since 2005, 339 students have received life- changing OYE scholarships, the majority of whom have been young women and girls. Currently 40% of OYE scholars are male, and 60% are female. In 2011, OYE incorporated 31 new scholars. Education is essential to personal and social development. OYE advocates that the most sustainable change is created through education. OYE's Academic Scholarship Program offers young women and men with limited resources support and access to a formal education. The number of scholarships has grown more than 36% every year. OYE's students are equipped with the resources to complete their high school and university studies through the generous support of donors who contribute to their scholarships. OYE recipients hope to not only create a better future for themselves and their families, but to also gain the tools to create a better future for their country. Capacity Building & Leadership Program To fill the gaps left by the Honduran education system, OYE created a capacity- building program, training youth to establish personal goals, build self- esteem, seek solutions for social problems, understand sexual and reproductive health and develop study skills. The first four months of every year consist of weekly meetings where the students participate in a wide range of activities and exercises. The lessons of capacity building enrich and motivate students to become visible leaders within their community. Community Engagement Program After the Capacity Building Program, the scholarship recipients are given the opportunity to participate in several youth-created, youth-produced projects: a magazine Revista Jovenes, an art initiative Arte La Calle, and environmental awareness campaign Preservando Paraiso, a sports tournament COPA OYE, a Cultural Exchange Project and a community radio program OYE El Ritmo. Our scholarship recipients design and lead these projects in order to articulate and express opinions towards their community. These outlets provide a safe, nurturing and empowering space for these students. =OYE el Ritmo- Youth Radio Program= \\"OYE el Ritmo\\" is OYE's radio program, which consists of 15 students, is completely youth recorded, executed and produced. Students research creative, insightful ways to address issues and share ideas. With the guidance of local radio youth professionals these youth are preparing to launch a bi-weekly show that provides a platform to voice their opinions and insights. It is an energetic group of students that infuse the radio with excitement and fresh ideas. =Jovenes- Youth Magazine Program= OYE‚Äôs youth magazine, J√≥venes, works to teach OYE students to think critically about their realities and articulate their understandings. It is with this training that they write, design, and distribute a magazine focused on informing, educating and entertaining their peers. Magazine topics have included local corruption, environmental concerns, Honduran culture, health and much more. The first edition was distributed in May 2009 and was a major triumph for OYE and students. They have since distributed more than 6,000 magazines in their communities, high schools and universities. =COPA OYE- Youth Sports Tournament= In an attempt to bring together the youth of El Progreso through sports, OYE launches an annual soccer and volleyball tournament between competing high schools and other youth organizations. Approximately thirteen teams participate in this city-wide event to exchange ideas, practice teamwork, meet new friends, and ultimately familiarize themselves with the organization. OYE uses sports to create a space needed for young students to speak, listen, share and create new methods of expression that allow them to develop personally, therefore preparing them to serve as role models and leaders in their communities. During COPA OYE, OYE advocates and implements the importance of fair-play and teamwork. OYE expects and encourages participants to use the game as a platform to practice good sportsmanship and expand ideas of leadership. =La Calle- Art Outreach Program= La Calle is a realization of OYE's belief that artistic expression has the power to build confidence, inspire hope, and transform lives. The 25 students involved in La Calle meet every week to learn the elements and principles of art and design, art history, and participate in group critiques. Students learn techniques such as drawing, painting, coloring, collage, screen-printing, woodcuts, and sculpture. Students also partake in community murals and art demonstrations in local schools. Local and international volunteers help guide conversation and creative exploration, but each piece is created and executed by the students, whether individually or in small groups. OYE students use art projects to inspire the community and teach non-OYE students the skills they learned in La Calle. The La Calle group also includes a few members of the magazine program. During the magazine meetings, students learn digital photography and the use cutting-edge design software, Adobe Creative Suite 4 to develop magazine layouts and advertisements. With the support of local businesses, La Calle works to create visually stunning and informing art work. The goal is to create a space for students to join together and articulate issues in a public forum that will encourage dialogue and new understandings. Through these activities the students grow individually, learn group cooperation, and generate change in the society. Volunteer= OYE Alternative Spring Break Trips  OYE offers week-long Alternative Spring Break Trips for groups of 15‚Äì20 students. Trips are focused on immersion and understanding of the Honduran educational system, challenges that face youth and how to make a sustainable difference. Trips also complete a community service project, gain a basic understanding of Honduran culture, and experience the beauty of Honduras first hand. James Madison University, American University, George Washington University, and Mary Baldwin College have participated in trips and internships with OYE. Internships Internships for academic credit are offered with participating universities.

Synopsis Amber is a young woman who works at a butchery and dreams of escaping her small town existence and her alcoholic, widowed mother. Lately, meat and blood have started to upset her and her sleep is plagued by unsettling dreams in which she's either confronted by bloodthirsty creatures, or she runs at breakneck speed, something she excels at in everyday life, too. After learning she's been adopted, Amber decides to leave her old life behind and move to Chicago, but the owner of the apartment she plans to rent requires an advance deposit to be delivered before the following day at noon. Amber asks her best friend Susie to accompany her, and the road trip is eventually joined by Susie's boyfriend Peter, their friends Fiona and Ray, and Eric, a shy boy who's into Amber and contributes the means of transport for the group. Unfortunately, Eric's truck breaks down along the road. A friendly truck driver named Bernard stops by, and upon hearing he's also going to Chicago, Susie convinces him to give them a ride in the back of his semi, while Eric is selected to ride in the cabin with Bernard. Amber and her friends become concerned when Bernard refuses to stop and they discover that his cargo consists of hundreds of cartons of blood. Concern turns into panic and terror when Bernard ends up taking them into an abandoned meat-packing plant that is soon revealed to be the training ground for a group of bloodthirsty creatures. Ray, Peter and Fiona are in turn attacked by the creatures, who dismember them. Amber and Susie manage to escape the first assault thank to an improvised Molotov; while trying to reach a safe area, they stumble upon a wounded Eric, who's been taken from the truck's cabin to be used as bait. Amber tries to rescue Eric but he ends up thrown down a tall metal structure by the creatures, who possess a supernatural ability to run, climb and jump. Amber and Susie overhear the leader of the creatures, Veronica, talking with her second-in-command and Bernard. Veronica refers to the creatures as her children, and aims to make them learn how to hunt human prey; to this goal, she has coaxed Bernard into helping her find fresh victims, which are usually junkies. Following another attack, Amber and Susie are separated; Amber manages to pin down and interrogate one of the creatures, a young man who admits he's never hunted before, and tells Amber that Veronica is not their actual mother but she nonetheless takes care of them. In the end, Amber ends up surrounded by dozens of the creatures and by Veronica herself; trying to escape, she suddenly climbs up a wall in the same way the creatures do. Confused and frightened, she's recognized by Veronica as one of them, a \\"late bloomer\\" who was abducted by mistake. Veronica welcomes her warmly among her children, gives her some of the blood from the cargo, then offers her a captured Susie as her first true meal. Amber refuses to kill and eat her friend, and ignites a large gasoline spill, jumping away with Susie in her arms right in time to avoid the catastrophic conflagration. Veronica orders the survivors to let Amber go, being sure she'll be back once she'll have accepted her true nature. Amber takes Susie to safety, then attacks and devours a homeless man who was going to assault Susie, while the latter watches in terror. After she's finished with her \\"meal\\", Amber reassures Susie she's still her friend and they'll be okay. CastProduction After Dark Films began with the shooting of the splatter film in August 2009 in Sofia, Bulgaria. After Dark produced the film in association with Dobr√© Films and in cooperation with Lionsgate and NBC Universal‚Äôs fantasy Channel Syfy. Release The film premiered on September 4, 2010 and the theatrical release occurred in January 2011. The DVD was released in April 2011. Reception The film has received mixed reviews. Matt Withers, who reviewed the film for JoBlo.com, praised both 'the cast, and the character development'. He stated that Courtney Hope is a 'believable' leading lady and that 'Bruce Payne shows up as a trucker in a throwaway role that he makes anything but'. Another reviewer stated that 'though this was a quick, basic and entertaining piece that could have been a run-of-the-mill movie with different direction, less measurement and passion put into, not to mention it's a simple story that only has a few conventions tweaked around and isn't the most original out there, but the way it carried itself was turned into an effective experience that urges forward'. Boston Haverhill stated that the film 'is a refreshing, brutal, nasty, enjoyable piece of work'. A different reviewer stated that 'the movie was good on most levels, but it is just the same old boring storyline that I have seen so many times with nothing to make it stand out'. Frank Fulci stated that the director and his team managed to make the 'beautiful cast of youngsters work to his advantage' and also managed 'to take the overly popular vampire subgenre and shake things up a bit'. Fulci commented that 'never have we seen a vampire film like this and it still amazes me that this can be said almost 200 years after the first literary appearance of a vampire, in John William Polidori‚Äôs 1819 novella, The Vampyre'. Scott Weinberg stated that the film was 'not bad' and a 'mash-up of the \\"isolation stalker\\" concept and a \\"night of the hungry vampires\\" pitch'. Heather Wixson gave the film three out of five stars and stated that 'when the movie picks up the pace during the second and third acts, director Syversen knows how to keep the tension and body count building until the film's deadly climax'. R.L. Shaffer gave the film five stars out of ten and stated that while it is 'run-of-the-mill is nearly every way, at least Prowl is scary on occasion'.

The Goon An orphan raised by his Aunt Kizzie, a strong-woman for a carnival. When wanted gangster Labrazio made the carnival his hiding place, Goon snuck into his trailer after hearing about the man's reputation for viciousness. Labrazio showed the young Goon a book containing the names of his enemies, people who had done him favors, and people who owed him money. The police managed to track Labrazio down, however, and surrounded the trailer. In the resulting shoot-out, Goon's Aunt Kizzie, while trying to protect her nephew, was gunned down by stray bullets from Labrazio's firearm. When Labrazio dismissed Kizzie as a \\"stupid broad\\" for getting in the crossfire, the young Goon snapped and beat the mobster's skull in with a rock. Figuring the late gangster owed him something, Goon took Labrazio's book (and the man's hat) and took over the entire operation, collecting money and offing deadbeats, all the while insisting that Labrazio was still alive and the Goon was merely his \\"enforcer.\\" The Goon is a hulking figure, normally wearing green pants, a white or black shirt, and the hat he removed from Labrazio. Occasionally he wears a faded blue shirt with green stripes on the sleeves‚Äîthe uniform from his football days. The left side of his face is horribly scarred, caused in a fight with a Triad leader who could turn himself into a dragon by the use of dark magic (as explained in The Goon graphic novel Chinatown). His eyes are blue, with the scarring on the left side of his face rendering his left eye blind. He has brown hair cropped short, almost always covered by his trademark cap. Franky After killing Labrazio, the Goon met Franky, a cowardly kid who was continually picked on by bullies. They became fast friends after the Goon beat up a kid who tormented him. The Goon involved Franky in his criminal business, setting out to burn down a barbershop which refused to pay protection to \\"Labrazio\\". During the arson attempt, they were attacked by zombies. Franky, not believing he could, killed one in self-defense, at which time he underwent a change in personality, adopting a haughty \\"tough-guy\\" persona similar to the Goon's, and taking up the position of the Goon's right- hand man. Franky normally wears brown pants with suspenders, a white tank-top, and a brown fedora on his bald head. Franky's eyes are drawn without pupils, similar to the comic strip character Little Orphan Annie or Jiggs from Bringing Up Father. Franky is nowhere near the Goon's level in combat prowess, but he has proven himself useful many times, if nothing else than to watch the Goon's back and act as another set of hands. His signature move is the \\"knife to the eye\\". The Priest Arch-nemesis of the Goon, the Priest is a mysterious man who dwells on Lonely Street, protected on all sides by his undead hordes. The Zombie Priest (also called The Nameless Man and other variations) is steeped in the occult, and seems bent on building up his rotting army, perhaps to one day conquer humankind. He is grizzled and almost zombie-like in appearance himself, sporting a top hat decorated by the flayed skin of a face. The Priest's chief creations are the greenish animated corpses that occupy much of Lonely Street, but he has also succeeded in reanimating an enormous chimp more than once. Evil appears drawn to him, as vicious hags and giant bats provide extra protection for his stronghold, and goat-like demons advise him in his undertakings. The Zombie Priest was recently revealed to be a demonic creature himself, and perhaps the inspiration for the folk tale \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\", as he spent a thousand years in hell after a princess discovered his name. The Priest's true name is his most closely guarded secret, as anyone who knows it has power over him. Due to the recent reappearance of the Buzzard and the efforts of the Goon, the Zombie Priest's undead hordes have dwindled to nearly nothing. Faced with oblivion at the hands of his enemies, the Nameless Man has taken drastic measures to rebuild his army. Resurrecting one last zombie known simply as \\"Mother Corpse\\", the Zombie Priest plucked out one of his own eyes to imbue her with a special power: procreation. With a termite-like abdomen that fills an entire room, Mother Corpse spawns countless miniature demons who are grown and lethal within six hours of birth. With a new legion of monsters at his command, the Zombie Priest is far from being defeated; the full cost of this new power, however, has yet to be seen. The Priest has fallen from grace, however, with the arrival of another of his kind, dressed as an Indian warrior. This creature cut out the Priest's remaining eye to somehow create or bring back Labrazio. The Priest spends his days now writhing in pain, being tortured, and enduring endless humiliations from his successor. After Labrazio was defeated by the Goon, the Priest was then freed by Buzzard after being held captive, to be used as a weapon against Labrazio. He has recently taken the eye of The Cat and begun to make preparations for the Indian Warrior's return, saying: \\"He'll bring the others when he comes back ... But this town is mine!\\" The Coven A clan of supernatural entities from the same inhuman race as the Priest. Called sorcerers, priests, demons, and witches, they are referred to as 'magpies' by the Goon and his crew. The Coven plots to exploit the power of the curse lying over the town to restore their race to its former greatness. Their arrival in town sparked an all-out war with the Goon. The Coven each have bizarre animal familiars with misshapen human heads, like the Priest's cat familiar, who vanish when they are slain. They regard the Priest as the least of them, and look upon him with disdain after having cast him out long ago. The Priest has allied himself with the Goon to destroy the Coven, revealing their powers and weaknesses to his former enemy. * The Arab ‚Äì The leader of the Coven. He plans to break Goon's spirit and then kill him, adding to the power of the curse over the town which he intends to command. * Longfingers ‚Äì Described as the 'general' of the Coven. A sadistic, ghoulish monster with an inhuman appearance, Longfingers feeds on stolen children and the suffering of their parents. He may have inspired the 'Boogeyman' legend as the Priest inspired the legend of Rumpelstiltskin. Longfingers has a tall, thin body and his hands can sprout vicious nails. He is able to fight physically on par with the Goon, with neither opponent being able to defeat the other. Of all the Coven, Goon wants to kill Longfingers the most. * Spade ‚Äì A being claiming to have the power to see through the eyes of men. He was killed by Willie Nagel with a shotgun blast to the head ‚Äì as an eyeless zombie, Nagel was immune to Spade's power. * Spindle ‚Äì An old woman with the power to turn herself and the other Coven members to fog. Goon countered her power by throwing acid bottles into her fog form, causing her to be burned by the fumes and forcing her back into her physical form. Goon then killed her by pouring acid on her. * Stone ‚Äì A member of the Coven with unknown abilities. He was killed by the Goon with an axe. * Rake ‚Äì A member of the Coven with unknown abilities. He was killed by Longfingers after a falling out among the Coven over the Arab's machinations. Claire Buckley (Buzzard) Former sheriff of a Western town where the Zombie Priest came as a \\"missionary\\". As Buzzard was the only doubter of the Priest's unholy wisdom, he was shunned by his people and spiraled into an alcohol-fueled despair. Meanwhile, the town was stricken by a virulent plague that killed the townfolk, then brought them back from the grave. After being mocked by the Zombie Priest for failing to protect his citizens, the sheriff became consumed by vengeance and rode through the town, slaughtering zombies and storming the Nameless Man's camp. The terrified Priest attempted to use his necromancy on the sheriff, but rather than turning him into a zombie, it had a reverse effect. He became a living man with an insatiable hunger for the flesh of the dead, which garnered him the name, \\"Buzzard.\\" In the years that followed, he tracked the Priest across the countryside in a single-minded quest to avenge the town he didn't protect. As the trail led Buzzard into the city, he met the Goon and Franky in the midst of a zombie ambush. After telling the men his story, he informed them both he was going to storm the Nameless Man's tower. Despite the protests of the Goon, he continued his hunt into the very stronghold of his enemy. Upon reaching Lonely Street, Buzzard found himself surrounded. As the zombies closed in, he continued firing until both his handguns were empty, and the panel fades to black. Seemingly dead, he was forgotten for months. He was, however, imprisoned in the tower of his enemy, tortured for months and starved to a near-skeletal state. Buzzard then managed to send a message to the Goon through a small spirit he befriended in his cell. The Goon gathered a rescue party and stormed Lonely Street and, with the help of Hieronymous Alloy and his robot Bruno, Buzzard was freed from torment. The last words yelled from the Zombie Priest were a reminder to Buzzard how he had failed in his mission to protect the town where he was once the Sheriff. The knowledge of his defeat drove him to despair and he attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head. However, the Zombie Priest's curse kept him alive. After regaining strength, Buzzard buried himself alive beneath a tree on the outskirts of town. His mind wandered as he lay entombed, and the spirits in the woods told him many secrets, including the origin of the Zombie Priest, and the Goon's destiny as the only one who could triumph against the Nameless Man. His purpose renewed, Buzzard clawed his way free of the roots and soil to aid the Goon in his fight. Buzzard now guards the city's graveyards, preventing the creation of new zombies. During the attack by Labrazio, Buzzard enslaved the Priest as a weapon against the resurrected mobster. After the battle was over, Buzzard commanded the Priest to reverse his curse, only to be told that the spell has evolved, making Buzzard an unknown type of creature that even the Priest does not understand, and that there may be no cure. Labrazio Seemingly returned from death by the dark magic of the Priest's people, Labrazio has seized control of the Lonely Street gang and begun a vicious offensive on the Goon, already having killed Norton's mother and one of the two Mudd Brothers. His nature is debatable, given that he has extreme supernatural powers of shapeshifting and he is colored blue. Also, Goon found his body naturally rotting in the grave he had been buried in, leaving little doubt that, whatever the new Labrazio, he is not the one the Goon killed. During a climatic battle on Lonely Street, it was revealed that the spirit of the original Labrazio was channeled into changeling creatures created by the Mother Corpse, a spell done by the Priest. It was revealed that the mysterious turbaned old man who commanded the Priest to resurrect Labrazio was a friend of his. Before being finally killed by the Goon, Labrazio revealed that the people of the turbaned man will be coming to the town, mockingly warning the Goon that he would rather be dead than face them. Recurring characters=Hieronymous Alloy A brilliant scientist whose attempts to help the public have nearly all back-fired, one of them landing him in debt to the Goon after wrongfully sending one of his murderous robots after him. Alloy then turned his attentions to more virtuous pursuits, such as destroying zombies on Lonely Street and defeating a giant Spanish-speaking lizard poised to destroy the city. Alloy has golden, metallic skin‚Äîan apparent side-effect of his extensive alchemical research. Recent campaigns (caused by the molecular break-down of his body, and ensuing insanity) to annihilate everyone with his robot army for not believing that his gene-modified creamed corn was superior, have landed him back in prison, where he has decided to stay for his own edification as well as the safety of humanity. He has recently sent the Goon some two-way radios in the fight against Labrazio, as Alloy felt that he could never fully repay his debt to the Goon. Norton Norton is the bald and mild-mannered bartender of Norton's place, the Goon's favorite hangout. While of little importance to the story overall, Norton can be depended on for pretty much anything the Goon needs. After his mother's death, Norton has evolved into a major character, taking up his mother's gypsy ways and marrying the leader of her rival clan. The Little, Unholy Bastards A group of juvenile delinquents who first made their appearance with the intention of breaking the Goon out of prison. They live at the McGreg Home For Illegitimate, Wayward and Possibly Homicidal Youth. Though they aided Goon in his prison break and later discovered Merle's betrayal and passed it on to the Goon, they have proven to be little more than a nuisance, the Goon having no need for kids in his operation. He allowed them to spy for him saying if they die it would be better than living in the cursed town. He seems to have warmed up to them, as of late, going out of his way to save the kids when they were attacked by a hobo deity. They are Smitty (the leader), Specs, Charlotte, and Peewee. During Labrazio's attack on the town, Specs was shot by the inhuman mobster. Specs reappeared in the next issue sporting his arm in a sling. Most recently, in The Goon No. 34, The Little Unholy Bastards were saved by The Goon when he, in a drunken stupor, fought a demon in the form of a girl, forcing her into a nearby cemetery where she perished. Mirna A singer at Norton's Place. She has shown interest in the Goon, though he feels that he is too hideous for any woman to be genuinely interested in him. However, she has never shown any signs of duplicitous behavior. Her brother's death disturbed her greatly however, and she came to despise Goon. His resurrection as a zombie left her mentally unhinged. Mirna came back to the town to investigate the return of Skinny, only after his second death, became even more confused, but was convinced by the Goon to help Bella, injured by an attack by Labrazio. Upon learning that Bella had a son with the Goon, Mirna went into a state of rage and left town again. Cat A small orange cat with a jowelled and weathered human face. The Cat is perhaps the Zombie Priest's most loyal minion, and is given to long-winded speeches on the subject of his master's greatness. Lazlo and the Graves have great contempt for the creature, but the Cat has proved himself useful enough to keep around, even giving one of his eyes to his blind master, although this was an unexpected action by the Priest. It is suggested in the recent story arc that the cat is the Priest's familiar spirit. Willie Nagel Besides Lazlo, he is the only other zombie in the Goon's world to speak coherently. However, Willie has chosen to distance himself from the Zombie Priest. Willie has more than a passing similarity to Spider since they both wear bowler hats, are scam artists, and hang around the Goon despite being constantly abused by him. Unlike Spider, he has actually proven himself useful to the Goon, even if it was for a price. Willie believes the reason he retained his personality as a zombie is due to him living life to the fullest when he was still alive. Skinny/Mr. Wicker Skinny was Mirna's younger brother, a piano player and stockboy at Norton's Place. His determination to be somebody, coupled with his unprovoked hatred of the Goon, led him to become the mysterious Mr. Wicker. Using a book of magic stolen from Momma Norton, Skinny transformed himself into a hulking figure of twisted branches, able to engulf himself in deadly flames. As the Goon battled for his life against Mr. Wicker, Franky destroyed the book, and the Goon accidentally killed the boy as he became Skinny once more. He was resurrected as a zombie, with his Wicker powers intact, to work for Labrazio, only to be killed by the Goon again. El Hombre de Lagarto  Formerly a Godzilla-like monster, after being defeated by the Goon he has been reduced to acting as a manservant to Dr. Alloy. Though his behavior has been curbed by drugs, the second incarceration of Alloy led to a lapse in his medication and a resultant rampage through the more quaint parts of Goon's turf. Lagarto speaks Spanish, but with little regard to grammar or coherence. Spider A giant talking spider who wears a bowler hat. Spider has the rare distinction of being a criminal that the Goon dislikes but hasn't killed. He can be seen skipping out on child support, cheating at cards or hustling others at Norton's Bar. He's also the victim of violence from the Goon and others, having been beaten mercilessly simply for being a talking spider or for owing the Goon five bucks. He is shown to have an acidic bite, but when rallying any men he could, the Goon dismissed Spider as \\"useless.\\" In Drawing On Your Nightmares, Spider's real name was revealed as Percival Goodbody. The same story also revealed that his children are ashamed of him and apologize for his actions repeatedly. Momma Norton The seemingly crazy gypsy mother of pub owner Norton. Though her advice has often aided Goon, it usually comes in the form of eccentric behavior. She was recently shot to death by the returned Labrazio, who feared her gypsy magic as a threat. Lazlo Lazlo is the green-skinned zombie assistant of the Zombie Priest. He differs from most other zombies in that he can form complete sentences. He has been seen in flashbacks as having once looked far more human. When Labrazio takes over, Lazlo seems to have no compunctions with the change in leadership, and happily participates in the beating of his former master. During the final battle on Lonely Street between Goon and Labrazio, Lazlo's head was blown to pieces by Franky. The Mudds Bill and Charlie Mudd are a pair of Bog Lurk brothers that work as enforcers for the Goon (and Franky for a short time while Goon was in prison). They have a penchant for breaking legs for not meeting debt payments (often regardless of when the payment is made). They are rightfully regarded as moronic but brutal, so they have their uses in the world of the Goon. Unfortunately, Bill Mudd was murdered by Labrazio's gang after Merle ratted them out. Charlie, in a state of grief, now travels around with a tree stump he believes to be Bill. He has gone into vicious fits of rage since Bill's death, even savagely murdering Joey the Ball, who had put a hit out on the Mudds. Fishy Pete Leader of a vicious gang of fish-men that patrol the city's harbor. Fishy Pete has a special hatred for the Goon, the man responsible for his dual peg legs and hook hands. Pete's mother is the legendary Sea Hag who \\"seduces\\" stranded mariners, much to her son's embarrassment. Fishy Pete speaks in typical pirate brogue, and is fond of quoting Quint's lines from Jaws. Jimmy Turtle Another rarely seen friend of the Goon's, although he did appear in person in time for Franky to smash a beer bottle into his face. A professional scam artist with a penchant for smashing rocks over people's heads, Jimmy Turtle once helped Franky in a quest to find the Legendary Boxcar of Well-Made Ladies Shoes. Merle Merle was a werewolf and part-time gunrunner for the Goon. In human form he usually dresses in a vest and beat-up cowboy hat, and has brown fur in werewolf form. The Goon calls him in from time to time to help out in a fix. Merle is also a chronic alcoholic, and has a severe phobia of midget hands. Merle eventually ratted out the Mudd Brothers to Labrazio and paid for it with his life. Upon discovering his betrayal the Goon tortured him sadistically, taking advantage of his werewolf ability to endure punishment that would kill a human, finally ending his life with a silver bullet. His bastard son, a werewolf like his father, came to kill the Goon in revenge, but failed and ended up adopted as a pet by the Little Unholy Bastards. The Psychic Seal A seal wearing a turban that can speak the future and reads omens, the Seal has made two appearances to date. He speaks in the usual \\"Ark! Ark!\\" of seals, but anyone listening can understand him perfectly. He has an unfortunate habit of \\"Ark\\"-ing insults about his clients' mothers, which led to his receiving a savage beating at the hands of Franky and the Goon. The Graves A family of three sickly men, a father and twin sons. Each of the three men is afflicted with leprosy, the price the eldest Grave paid for making a pact with the Zombie Priest. They often get beaten or blown up by the Goon on their body-snatching raids for the Zombie Priest. Despite being unable to communicate normally, the twins are capable of speaking Hobo, thus saving them from the wrath of the Hobo Jungle's many cannibals. During the creation of Mother Corpse, the Graves, finally having found the Nameless man's acts too depraved to handle, abandoned their service to him and left the town. Mother Corpse Due to Buzzard's and the Goon's efforts, the Zombie Priest's corpse fueled army has almost completely been destroyed. As a result, he was forced to turn to magic‚Äînamely Mother Corpse‚Äîwho is capable of birthing hordes of miniature demons (\\"Chugheads\\") that can combine themselves into a larger monster. Mother Corpse was made from the body of a dead pregnant woman and hallucinates the Chugheads as normal human children. The miniature demons were revealed to be containing the spirit of Labrazio, leading to Mother's spell being shut down by the Priest, under Buzzard's control. Charlie Noodles The oft-mentioned but never seen friend of the Goon and Franky. Almost all of their anecdotes involve Charlie Noodles at some point, and the Goon always refers to the man as \\"good people\\". Joey the Ball An early gang rival of the Goon, Joey the Ball has the odd distinction of his right hand being permanently stuck inside a bowling ball. Due to this unbalanced weight training, the otherwise midget-sized Joey has one gargantuan, hyper- muscular arm. He strives to commit all his crimes with a sense of panache, and always speaks in the third-person narrative. Joey the Ball arranged to murder Bill Mudd for Labrazio, and was subsequently killed in retaliation by Charlie Mudd. Peaches Valentine This odd character has appeared in several issues (including the Christmas special where he played Tiny Tim). Recognizable by his 'Chick Magnet' shirt, Peaches is mentally retarded and prone to making messes with his own feces. He has been shot in the face several times by Franky, but always reappears no worse for wear.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Design The neoclassical exterior closely matches that of the Riggs National Bank building next door, also designed by York and Sawyer and completed in 1902, so that they are sometimes taken to be a single building. The east facade of the building presents a multiple bay arrangement with two plain bays flanking a hexastyle portico of six Ionic columns and entablature, while the narrower and plainer south face has a single bay with two plain Doric pilasters flanking the entrance in a shallow recess. The parapet conceals three skylights. Although the exterior has two rows of windows, the interior is in fact a single floor, also decorated in the neoclassical style; it was remodeled in 1931-1932 but retained essentially the same form excepting the removal of a pair of balconies and new openings into the adjoining annex which was constructed at the same time to the north. A basement floor formerly contained vaults, but with the construction of the annex these were moved to the adjoining building. The building exterior is constructed of granite ashlars with deep horizontal joints at the corners creating a striped effect; the interior is largely faced in a variety of marbles. History The American Security Bank building appeared on the back of the $10 bill, just beyond and to the right of the Treasury Building. American Security Bank was founded in 1889 in Alexandria, Virginia, as a banking and trust concern, operating a branch in the District of Columbia at 1419 G Street, NW; the following year it reincorporated in the District and moved to 1405 G Street. Its president was Charles James Bell (Dublin, April 12, 1858 ‚Äì October 1, 1929), nephew of Alexander Graham Bell.Death List of a Day: David Charles Bell, The New York Times, October 29, 1902. It was the second trust company established in the District and the first to offer a woman's department. By 1903 business had grown to the extent that a new location was once again sought. The present location (a block from Lafayette Square and part of the Lafayette Square Historic District) was selected, and construction began in 1904. The design was praised in the banking press, and it was featured in The American Architect and Building News in 1905. The building now houses a branch of Bank of America as a result of the latter's merger with NationsBank, which purchased MNC Financial in 1993. MNC had purchased American Security Bank in 1987 but continued to operate it under the original name. Due to its location immediately north of the Treasury Building the building appeared on the back of the ten dollar bill for many years, a fact exploited in advertising with the slogan \\"right on the money.\\" See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington, D.C.

Dr Pulepule was also the Chief Apostle of the Samoan Assemblies of God in New Zealand for over 40 years and was elected as the World Chairman of the Samoan Assemblies of God International. Also the Tokelauan Assemblies of God and Tuvaluan Assemblies of God came under his leadership. The Right Reverend was the senior pastor for the Grey Lynn Samoan A/G congregation in Auckland. It was one of the fastest growing and largest Samoan congregation in the world. Dr Pulepule also planted over 100 churches throughout New Zealand, and was a leading key factor in the establishment of the Samoan Assemblies of God around the world where Samoan communities were present. In Australia he planted over 60 Samoan A/G Congregations. He was heavily involved in mission work, especially in Samoa and American Samoa where almost 200 congregations make up the District Council of the Assemblies of God in Samoa. His leadership reached mainland USA who currently has over 90 congregations mainly along the west coast states. Dr. Pulepule also administered the establishment of the Samoan Assemblies of God in Hawaii and Alaska where together over 50 congregations thrive. In the 1990s Pulepule assisted in the establishing of the Samoan Assemblies of God in England and Germany. The World Tongan Assemblies of God fellowship began when the Tongan leaders sought assistance from Dr. Pulepule who helped establish a worldwide movement. In 2005 the New Zealand Samoan movement he led went through a phase of division where 40 churches stayed under the Assemblies of God in New Zealand umbrella, and 45 churches left and became an autonomous fellowship under his direction. Since 2005 the church under his direction has grown from 45 to over 80 at this present time, and the church continues to grow and is still known to be the fastest growing Pentecostal movement in New Zealand. On 25 September 2011, Pulepule officially resigned from all his posts of chief apostle, general superintendent and world chairman in the Samoan Assemblies of God movement. In attendance were the former general superintendents of the Assemblies of God in New Zealand, Assemblies of God leaders around the world, the mayor of Auckland, the Auckland City Council and Members of Parliament as well as leaders of all the other Pentecostal denominations who all paid tribute to Pulepule and the First Lady. Since the beginning of the Samoan Assemblies of God in New Zealand, the church group have rejected many traditional Samoan cultural practices. Pulepule was known as one of the eldest serving pastors in the Southern Hemisphere. His wife, First Lady Sapapali'i Pulepule, died on 21 May 2013. Pulepule died two weeks later on 4 June 2013. Thousands attended both memorial services for two great pioneers in the Assemblies of God movement. The New Zealand Government also presented gifts, and the national flag of New Zealand was draped over their coffins.  Early life and history  Pulepule was born on October 13, 1923, in the village of Solosolo, Samoa (formerly Western Samoa) to Tupolesava Pulepule Matu'u II and Aimama Tuala Tagaloa of Saluafata who were members of the L.M.S. in Solosolo. He has 9 siblings and is the second eldest child. He became a teacher at Avele College, and later met his wife Sapapali'i, both were members of the CCCS (Congregational Christian Church of Samoa or L.M.S.). By then the Assemblies of God from American Samoa had already begun missions in the Samoan islands. In 1963, Pastors Makisua & Mauosamoa Fatialofa were holding revival meetings in Lotopa. It was at these meetings that Samani and Sapapalii were saved. The late pastor and evangelist Barry Smith, a school teacher at that time who worked with Samani at Samoa College, had brought them to the meetings, and it was from that day on, Pulepule and the First Lady devoted the rest of their life to the church and its purposes. (Pentecost to the uttermost: History of the Assemblies of God: Dr. Tavita Pagaialii, Pg.53) In 1965 they were both appointed to lead Faleasi'u Assembly of God (the first A/G church in Samoa), and within 1 year moved to New Zealand and began to witness the power of God that transformed their lives. In New Zealand, there were already a few Samoan Pentecostal churches at the time, the first one starting in Wellington by the late Pastor Fred Ama. Pulepule and his wife planted a church in the Grey Lynn area in Auckland, and the church grew rapidly, having to extend their church more than 5 times just to cater to the 500 plus strong congregation. In 1967, Grey Lynn Samoan A/G was the first ethnic church to align with the Assemblies of God in New Zealand. The 20 or so Samoan Pentecostal churches thought their church would become more effective if they all came together, and at that time these Pentecostal churches had united and officially became the Samoan Assemblies of God in New Zealand under the leadership of Pulepule, there he was elected as the Superintendent of the Samoan movement in New Zealand, and it soon became the fastest growing church in New Zealand. In 1992 the Samoan Assemblies of God Convention Centre officially opened. The center was named the \\"Samani Pulepule Convention/Community Centre\\" and it seats up to 4,000 people. In 1999 the Grey Lynn church relocated to Mt. Roskill where it purchased an old factory building for NZ$1.6 million, and renamed their church from Grey Lynn to Auckland Samoan Assembly of God, which has been the church of the General Superintendent for over 40 years. In September 2011, Pulepule resigned as the Superintendent for the Samoan Assemblies of God fellowship around the World.  Family and Heritage  During their time in ministry, Pulepule and the First Lady had 3 children, Onesemo, Sera and Talalelei. Onesemo moved to Australia and founded the Melbourne Samoan Assembly of God church, and in 2001 was elected as the General Superintendent of the Samoan Assemblies of God in Australia. All are Samoan-born. His brother Taulapapa Mama Pulepule is also currently Pastor for the Falefa Assembly of God in Samoa and has been for several years, His younger brother Ieti is also a Pastor for the Paraparaumu church. His other brother Tautiaga (who holds the Magele of Lufilufi & Lemusu of Solosolo titles) and sisters Masina, Tivalo & Lanuola. Other siblings who died at a young age were Niu, Levao, Momoemaluapia.  Homegoing Celebration  A three-day homegoing celebration was held from 13‚Äì15 June 2013. The first celebration service was a Pastors celebration service held at the church he founded, Grey Lynn Auckland Samoan Assembly of God, eulogies were made by local pastors, as well as the Executive Council of the Samoan Assemblies of God in New Zealand. The second celebration service was held at the Samani Pulepule Convention Centre, a complex which seats 4,000 people, eulogies were made by family members, and a special musical from the Auckland Samoan A/G church. In attendance were the Tongan Assemblies of God, a church that Pulepule had helped with becoming a worldwide fellowship, also in attendance were the former Assemblies of God Leaders from around the world, local members of Parliament, and leaders of other major denominations. The third service was the Assemblies of God National/International service. This was held at the Auckland Samoan Assemblies of God, and a special presentation from the New Zealand Government, the National and Labour Parties were made to Pulepule's family. Tagata Pasifika, a well-known television news broadcast had special coverage of the homegoing services. Pulepule was buried next to his wife, who had died two weeks earlier. Thousands of people from all over the world gathered to celebrate a life of devotion and faithfulness. Sunday services the following day were spread out across the Auckland metropolitan area to cater to the thousands of dignitaries and pastors from around the world. Over 4,000 people gathered every night of the three-day celebration.  Leadership  From between 1962 and 1963 Pulepule became the 3rd Pastor of Faleasi'u Assembly of God, he then moved to New Zealand in 1963 and founded the Grey Lynn Samoan A/G and in 1999 Pulepule founded the Auckland Samoan Assembly of God, a church that grew from 4 families to over 500 adherents in 10 years. Since 1967 he was elected as the General Superintendent at one of the Camp Meetings in Wellington, and recently resigned from this post in September 2011. He was also elected as Chairman of the Worldwide Fellowship following the death of Pastor Max Haleck, Jr. in 2006. From 2006 and 2011 Pulepule held the post of World Chairman, until he resigned in September 2011. Succeeding him on this role is his son, Onesemo Pulepule, who was called into office at the resignation of his father. * Cultural reformation In an interview with ABC Australia presenter Geraldine Coutts, New Zealand MP William Sio said that Dr. Pulepule had genuine concern for the people he led. In a question asked by Coutts mentioning the way the church went about things with traditional Samoan practices and the pioneering role he had had in the change, she asked about the practices in particular were rejected. Sio replied that in the case of weddings and funerals etc., it was the exchange of fine mats. And often money and food which puts a burden on the extended family. He found that even though the practice still exists, it has been somewhat modified without the extravagance they were accustomed to and making it more in line with what the communities could afford.ABC Radio Australia Samoan community mourn well-known church leader This played a key role in the church's rapid growth. People were drawn to his genuine concern for their wellbeing spiritually and physically. His message to the worldwide fellowship was received with a rousing support. Dr. Pulepule will be remembered because he was simply a servant. The Samoan congregations will never forget the time where the Te Puke Samoan A/G church were preparing to bless their new church when a few members of the church were in a fatal car accident, a father and two sons died leaving a widow and their youngest child. During the service where a love offering was collected for Dr. Pulepule, he stopped the service and collected a love offering for the widow and her child. These were one of many great things Pulepule had done, and one of the many reasons he was admired and known as the spiritual father of the movement.

Around 1323, Ramberto was approached by his cousin Uberto, Count of Giaggolo and invited into a conspiracy to overthrow their uncle Pandolfo I Malatesta, Lord of Rimini and head of the Malatesta family. But Uberto da Giaggolo was the son of the Giovanni 'Gianciotto', who had murdered Ramberto's father Paolo 'il Bello' in a bout of jealousy back in 1285. Pretending to play along, Ramberto arranged for a banquet in his home for the conspirators, and then fell upon and killed Uberto, a belated vengeance for his father's murder. At the death of Pandolfo I in 1326, the succession to the Malatesta dominions was partitioned between Ramberto's cousins, Malatesta II 'Guastafamiglia' getting Pesaro and Ferrantino 'di Malatestino' receiving Rimini, leaving Ramberto out in the cold. But Ramberto was not a man to be ignored. In July 1326, shortly after the succession, Ramberto arranged for another banquet at his home in Rimini, inviting his cousins and their families. Alas, Malatesta II himself was unable to attend, foiling Ramberto's plans for what was likely to be a family mass murder. Ramberto opted for the half-measure of releasing the members of Malatesta II's family, and imprisoning only Ferrantino's family, hoping Malatesta II could be persuaded to join him in the conspiracy. It is possible Malatesta II contemplated it. But Polentisana da Polenta, wife of Ferrantino's son Malatestino Novello, rallied the people of Rimini and appealed to her own Polentani family, in an effort to release her husband from Ramberto's clutches. Malatesta II entered Rimini with his army, and forced the captives' release. Ramberto escaped to his countryside castles. In 1327, Cardinal Pouget managed to reconcile Ramberto with the rest of the Malatesta. But the very next year, Ramberto and his brother the Archpriest Guido conspired with the exiled Parcitadi family, long-time enemies of the Malatesta, in an assault on Rimini. Once again it failed, and once again a reconciliation was negotiated. But Malatestino Novello (son of Ferrantino) had had enough of Ramberto's plots and intrigues. In January 1330, he lured Ramberto on a hunting trip to his castle in Poggiano. Soon upon arrival, Ramberto fell on his knees and begged Malatestino's forgiveness for his past treacheries. Malatestino's only reply was to pull out his dagger and plunge it into Ramberto's neck, killing him instantly. Sources * J.

It was named after General Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre. It forms part of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system fortifications in the fortified region of Belfort in northeastern France. It is located at the summit of Salbert hill to the northwest of Belfort. During the early years of the Cold War it briefly served as an air defense coordination center. Plan of the original S√©r√© de Rivi√®res fort S√©r√© de Rivi√®res fort Fort du Salbert is one of the second ring of forts around Belfort, built about 5000 to 6000 meters outside the first ring of the 1840s. All of the new generation of forts abandoned sheer walls and bastions in favor of low earth-covered mounds to better resist artillery. After it became apparent that masonry forts would not resist explosive shells, the fort was modernized beginning in 1885 with concrete over the caponiers and the creation of underground shelters for troops. From 1893 the fort was connected to other Belfort forts by the Chemins de fer du Territoire de Belfort strategic railroad. The fort was equipped with optical semaphores allowing communications with other forts. During the First World War a number of underground galleries were constructed to link the caponiers to the caserne. Fort du Salbert commands an area of ponds surrounding Malsaucy, and controls roads to Lure, Giromagny and the Paris rail line. Its initial construction cost was 2,120,332 francs d'or. Initial manning was 460 men, 24 non-commissioned officers, and 13 officers. A well and cistern provided water. Armament in 1882 was five 155mm long guns, eight 120mm long guns, and a variety of small mortars and small-caliber guns for close defense. A 1900 modernization was to add a Galopin armored twin 155mm gun turret and an armored observation post. The gun turret project was abandoned, along with a further addition of a machine gun turret and a 75mm gun turret. The main fort never received the extensive concrete cover that was applied to other S√©r√© de Rivi√®res forts. During the quarrying of the fort's stone the caves of Cravanche were discovered in 1876.https://web.archive.org/web/20071020135556/http://www.mairie- cravanche.fr/dossiers/dossiers.php?val2=55_31_les+grottes+cravanche+2 Currently, the fort has lost much of its original appearance (late nineteenth century) due to the creation in 1950 of the Ouvrage \\"G\\" de la D.A.T. that required modernization of the fort.

Welsh graduated from Hollywood High School, received a B.A. from Scripps College in Claremont, California. On June 8, 1951, she married Maximilian Welsh, a Los Angeles trial lawyer for the Santa Fe Railroad. He later became a California Superior Court Judge and was a founder of the San Diego Inn of Court. In 1956, the couple built a home in Del Mar, California that was designed by John Lloyd Wright, They had two children, Francesca Filanc and Wendy Woolf. Early career During the 1960s, Welsh began her career as an authority and television personality. She started writing travel and self-help articles, published under the names Patricia Fisher and Patricia Welsh, in the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers. In 1975, she began lecturing on gardening at the University of California, San Diego Extension. In 1979 she became the first Garden Editor of San Diego Home/Garden Magazine. In 1981 Welsh was hired as the host of an evening news segment called \\"Newscenter 39‚Äôs Resident Gardener\\" on KNSD in San Diego. This was the first regularly scheduled garden news segment aired on the evening news by a network station. During her time at KNSD, she planned, wrote, and performed over 500 practical gardening segments plus one grand promo weekly and two teases. The show lasted five years. During its time, Welsh's show helped raised public awareness of gardening in her area. Patricia won a San Diego Emmy Award for News Performer. She continued for several years in local and nationwide television as a freelance writer and performer. Later years In the late 1990s Welsh made two gardening videos for the Meredith Corporation, the publisher of Better Homes and Gardens magazine. \\"Foolproof Flowerbeds\\", written and performed by Welsh and filmed in Descanso Gardens, La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California, won the Garden Writers‚Äô of America Quill and Trowel Award for Best Video of 1990. The success of this video led to another called \\"Landscape Problems Solved\\". This was followed by infomercials, national TV programs, and eight shows on the Home/Garden network filmed in Nashville, Tennessee in 1996. In 1988 Welsh returned as a columnist to San Diego Home/Garden Magazine, In 1991, Chronicle Books published Pat Welsh‚Äôs Southern California Gardening: A Month-by-Month Gardening Guide, the first major gardening book \\"written exclusively for the unique climate and conditions of Southern California\\". This book stayed in print for twenty years, selling close to 100,00 copies. In January 2010, the new all-organic edition entitled Pat Welsh‚Äôs Southern California Organic Gardening, Month by Month was published by Chronicle Books. Gardening philosophy Welsh strongly believe that Californians should use gardening techniques suited to their climate rather than the climates of England and the Eastern United States. She urged gardeners to grow drought-resistant plants and use techniques and timing of garden tasks appropriate to a Mediterranean climate: plentiful sunshine, mild temperatures, and dry summers with most rainfall occurring in fall, winter, and spring. Welsh's approach combines the artistic elements of gardening, such as design and color, with practical skills for dealing with climate zones, soil types, plant materials, irrigation methods, and environmentally responsible methods of disease and pest control. An early emphasis on IPM (Integrated Pest Management) was later replaced by a firm conviction that chemical pesticides have no place in the home garden. Patrician now urges gardeners to use Organic horticulture methods with organic fertilizer in place of synthetic ones. Artistic ventures Welsh is also a sculptor and painter in watercolor and oils. Her professional art projects include the design and building of a 92-foot-long, multi-media mural completed in 2002 in collaboration with graphic artist Betsy Schulz and 80 volunteers. This mural is four feet tall and includes over thirty pieces of original terra cotta sculpture plus brick, Mexican river rock, and local memorabilia. It is located in Del Mar at the Public Library.Del Mar Library  Awards  * The San Diego Area Emmy Award for Performance, News * The San Diego Press Club Award * The National Quill and Trowel Award * The Lifetime Achievement Award from Quail Botanical Gardens, Cuyamaca College Horticulturist of the Year * San Diego Horticultural Society‚Äôs Horticulturist of the Year. * Honorary Master Gardener of San Diego  Publications  * Pat Welsh‚Äôs Southern California Gardening: A Month-by-Month Guide: Chronicle Books, 1991. * Pat Welsh‚Äôs Southern California Gardening: A Month-by-Month Guide, Completely Revised and Updated: * Chronicle Books, 2000. * All My Edens: A Gardener‚Äôs Memoir: Chronicle Books, 1996. * The American Horticultural Society Southwest Smart Garden Regional Guide: D.K.

Watling was a one-club man, whose only senior team was Bristol Rovers. Prior to joining The Pirates, he played for Plain House Youth Club, the Royal Navy, and St Andrew's Boys Club in Avonmouth, and he also had an unsuccessful trial at Plymouth Argyle at the end of the Second World War. He joined Bristol Rovers in October 1945, initially as an amateur, before signing his first professional contract in January 1947. After having made 323 League appearances and scoring 19 goals, Watling retired from playing in 1963 but remained with the club for a further two years as a coach and scout before finally leaving in 1965 after spending twenty years with them. Following his retirement from football, he worked as a storekeeper at Glenside Hospital in Bristol. He is also the cousin of boxer Terry Ratcliffe, who won the gold medal in the welterweight division at the 1950 British Empire Games. As of 2019, Watling was noted as being Bristol Rovers' oldest living player.Profile ‚Äì John 'Josser' Watling References * Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Bristol Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football defenders Category:English Football League players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players ","title":"Josser Watling"},{"id":"25883554","text":"Dar√≠o Delgado Mora (born December 14, 1985) is a Costa Rican footballer who currently plays for Guadalupe FC.Interview with nacion.com Career=Professional During the Clausura 2008 season he debuted in the Costa Rican First Division appearing in 11 games scoring 2 goals.

Using Universe Sandbox, users can see the effects of gravity on objects in the universe and run scale simulations of the Solar System, various galaxies or other simulations, while at the same time interacting and maintaining control over gravity, time, and other objects in the universe, such as moons, planets, asteroids, comets, and black holes. The original Universe Sandbox was only available for Windows-based PCs, but an updated version, Universe Sandbox ¬≤, was released for Windows, macOS, and Linux in 2017. Universe Sandbox was designed by Dan Dixon, who released the first version in May 2008. Dixon worked full-time on the project since 2010, founding the company Giant Army the following year. Since then, he has hired eight additional designers for the company. Simulations Both realistic and fictional simulations appear in Universe Sandbox, with each area of outer space being placed by default or according to the player's preference. Real simulations include the Solar System, which includes the eight planets, five minor planets, 160+ moons, and hundreds of asteroids; and predictions of future events such as the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxy collision which will occur in 3.8 to 4.5 billion years. During gameplay, the player may be introduced to the regions that include the 100 largest bodies in the Solar System, the nearest 1000 stars to the Sun or the nearest 70 galaxies to the Milky Way. A visual size comparison of the largest known stars and planets can be explored, and real time animations of events like the Apophis asteroid passing near Earth in the year 2029 can be watched. Comets can be observed colliding into planets, such as the Shoemaker Levy 9's collision with Jupiter. The trans-Neptunian object 2008 KV42 with a retrograde motion orbit can be seen in a simulation. Moons are able to be converged into planets, and may be able to affect the planet's atmosphere or minerals. Players are able to view the Rho Cancri (55 Cancri) star in the constellation of Cancer; they can see the five known planets in the system. The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft can be seen in its encounters with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Visual Lagrange points of the Earth and Moon can be seen, along with the galaxy and star system. The gamma-ray burst locations, found in distant galaxies, can be found. Supernovas are shown in real time. Reception Duncan Geere of PC Gamer UK gave it an 84/100 and spoke positively of the game, \\"Universe Sandbox isn't going to change your life. It isn't going to make you cry, and it won't sit in the top of your most-played list in Steam for weeks. But if you like the idea of an interactive orrery that you can rip apart and put back together in whatever way you like, and you're happy to feed it with a bit of imagination, it's hard to find a better way to spend ¬£6.\\" Jules of Wired said in their review, \\"I've seen some pretty wonderful interactive programs that allow you and your family to explore the vast regions of the universe, but nothing nearly as enthralling as Universe Sandbox. [...] Unlike most astronomy software that just shows you what the sky looks like or where the planets are, Universe Sandbox is a powerful gravity simulator.\\" Universe Sandbox ¬≤ The team began working on a complete rewrite of Universe Sandbox in 2014. Some of the new features include atmospheres being shown on planets, dynamic and procedurally generated textures on stars and gas giants, a more realistic and graphic collision system, 3D charts in chart mode, simulation of stellar evolution, procedural detail in rings/particles, visualization of black holes, simulation of fluid-like objects (such as gas clouds, nebulae and protoplanetary disks, and planetary collisions) and much more. The team demonstrated many of these features at the Unite 2012 conference. On November 15, 2018, the feature to share simulations through Steam Workshop was added. Such simulations like Planet X crashing into Earth, Venus and Mars as the planets were billions of years ago are possible.

In effect, the Kelvin‚ÄìVarley divider is an electromechanical precision digital-to-analog converter. The circuit is used for precision voltage measurements in calibration and metrology laboratories. It can achieve resolution, accuracy and linearity of 0.1 ppm (1 in 10 million). Circuit Kelvin‚ÄìVarley divider set for 0.2073. The conventional voltage divider (Kelvin divider) uses a tapped string of resistors connected in series. The fundamental disadvantage of this architecture is that resolution of 1 part in 1000 would require 1000 precision resistors. To overcome this limitation, the Kelvin‚ÄìVarley divider uses an iterated scheme whereby cascaded stages consisting of eleven precision resistors provide one decade of resolution per stage. Cascading three stages, for example, therefore permits any division ratio from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.001 to be selected. Each stage of a Kelvin‚ÄìVarley divider consists of a tapped string of equal value resistors. Let the value of each resistor in the i-th stage be Ri Œ©. For a decade stage, there will be eleven resistors. Two of those resistors will be bridged by the following stage, and the following stage is designed to have an input impedance of 2 Ri. That design choice makes the effective resistance of the bridged portion to be Ri. The resulting input impedance of the i-th stage will be 10 Ri. In the simple Kelvin-Varley decade design, the resistance of each stage decreases by a factor of 5: Ri+1 = Ri / 5\\\\. The first stage might use 10 kŒ© resistors, the second stage 2 kŒ©, the third stage 400 Œ©, the fourth stage 80 Œ©, and the fifth stage 16 Œ©. Application The full precision of the circuit can only be realized with no output current flowing, since the output's effective source resistance is variable. Kelvin‚ÄìVarley dividers are therefore usually applied in conjunction with a null detector to compare their output voltage against a known voltage standard, e.g. a Weston cell (which must also be used without drawing current from it). The final stage of a Kelvin‚ÄìVarley divider is just a Kelvin divider. For a decade divider, there will be ten equal value resistors. Let the value of each resistor be Rn Ohms. The input impedance of the entire string will be 10 Rn. Alternatively, the last stage can be a two resistor bridge tap. Trimming For high precision, it is only necessary to ensure the resistors in any one decade have equal resistances, with the first decade requiring the highest precision of matching. The resistors have to be selected for tight tolerances, and may need to have their resistance values individually trimmed to be equal. This selection or trimming only requires comparing the resistances of two resistors in each trimming step, which is easily accomplished by using a Wheatstone bridge circuit and a sensitive null detector ‚Äî a galvanometer in the 19th century, or an electronically amplified instrument today . The ratio of resistances from one decade to the next is, surprisingly, not critical ‚Äî by using Ri+1 resistances slightly higher than Ri / 5 and connecting a trimming resistor in parallel to the entire preceding decade in order to trim the effective resistance down to 2 √ó Ri+1. In the above example, the second stage might use 3 kŒ© resistors instead of 2 kŒ©; connecting a (trimmable) resistor of 60 kŒ© in parallel with the second stage brings the total input resistance of the second stage down to the 20 kŒ© required. Sources of additional error=Temperature coefficient Ideally, a resistor has a constant resistance. In practice, the resistance will vary with time and external conditions. Resistance will vary with temperature. Carbon film resistors have temperature coefficients of several 100 parts per million per degree C.DigiKey catalog has some carbon film resistors with 350 ppm/degC. Some wirewound resistors have coefficients of 10 ppm/¬∞C. Some off-the-shelf metal foil resistors can be as low as 0.2 ppm/¬∞C.DigiKey catalog lists 0.2 ppm/¬∞C as the lowest searchable TC. Self-heating The power dissipated in a resistor is converted to heat. That heat raises the temperature of the device. The heat is conducted or radiated away. A simple linear characterization looks at the average power dissipated in the device (unit watts) and the device's thermal resistance (¬∞C / Watt). A device that dissipates 0.5 W and has a thermal resistance of 12 K/W will have its temperature rise 6 ¬∞C above the ambient temperature. When Kelvin‚ÄìVarley dividers are used to test high voltages, self-heating can create a problem. The first divider stage is often made from 10 kŒ© resistors, so the divider input resistance is 100 kŒ©. Total power dissipation at 1000 V is therefore 10 W. Most of the divider resistors will dissipate 1 W, but the two resistors bridged by the second divider stage will only dissipate 0.25 W each. That means the bridged resistors will have a quarter of the self-heating and a quarter of the temperature rise. For the divider to maintain accuracy, the temperature rise from self-heating must be limited. Getting very low temperature coefficients keeps the effect of temperature variations small. Reducing the thermal resistance of the resistors keeps the temperature rise small. Commercial Kelvin‚ÄìVarley dividers use wire-wound resistors and immerse them in an oil bath (sometimes the first decade only). Thermal EMF The thermoelectric effect causes junctions of different metals to generate voltages if the junctions are at different temperatures (see also thermocouple). While these unwanted voltages are small, on the order of a few microvolts per ¬∞C, they can cause appreciable errors at the high accuracy of which the Kelvin-Varley circuit is capable. The errors can be minimized through proper design ‚Äî by keeping all junctions at the same temperature, and by employing only metal pairings with low thermoelectric coefficients (down to the external connectors and cables used; for example, a standard 4 mm plug/socket combination may have a coefficient of 1 ŒºV/¬∞C compared to only 0.07 ŒºV/¬∞C for a \\"low thermal EMF\\" grade plug/socket ).

The nephew of civil rights leader Harvey Milk, he is the co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation. He has engaged in domestic and international activism, including work with LGBT movements in Latin America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Stuart Milk has promoted his uncle's story and addressed LGBT rights in formal major addresses on multiple continents, including before the United Kingdom House of Lords in 2012, the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 2011, the Panamanian National Assembly in 2010, and Turkish Grand Assembly in 2009. Milk is frequently quoted in international news and seen on broadcast television discussing issues of LGBT inclusion and diversity. He is also a featured writer and columnist for The Huffington Post, focusing on global human rights. During the 2012 U.S. elections, Milk gave public endorsements as a surrogate for Barack Obama and backed LGBT supporter Bob Filner over openly gay conservative Carl DeMaio in the race for mayor of San Diego; Filner narrowly won the election, becoming the first Democrat to be elected mayor of San Diego in 30 years. Biography Milk has worked on public policy since the late 1980s in both the public and private sector, primarily on workforce issues pertaining to youth and disadvantaged populations in the U.S. and abroad. In addition to his human service work, he has been a speaker on LGBT rights at colleges, universities and public events including for Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, University of San Francisco, SUNY, Central European University, University of Oxford, University of San Diego, as speaker or grand marshal for numerous LGBT Pride parades including San Francisco and Orlando in 2008, Istanbul and Madrid in 2009, Boston and San Diego in 2010, Pittsburgh and Budapest in 2011, as well as Tijuana and Atlanta in 2012. He has provided addresses at political conventions, including both the California Democratic Convention and Florida statewide conventions in 2009 and 2010. In addition to his role as Milk family spokesperson, he worked to share his uncle's story at international, national and state levels. He has successfully advocated for recognition for his late uncle as an annual California state holiday, Harvey Milk Day, held since 2009 on the late Milk's birthday; the induction of his uncle into the California Hall of Fame; accepting the United States' highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, on behalf of his uncle from President Obama; co-founding the international Harvey Milk Foundation; and the development of several new LGBT centers named after Harvey in foreign nations. Milk was active in the 2012 U.S. presidential election as surrogate for incumbent Barack Obama, speaking to primarily LGBT audiences on behalf of the president at public campaign events, to the media and for the Obama For America organization. In October 2012, Stuart Milk, through his role as leader of the Harvey Milk Foundation, and Rosaria Iardino hosted a global summit on human rights inclusive of the LGBT community that brought NGO and governmental leaders from five continents to Milan, Italy. The summit was supported by the European Union, the Italian Senate, the City of Milan and Equality Italia. Early life and impact of his uncle As reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, the 1978 assassination of his uncle destroyed the \\"closet door\\" for Stuart Milk. At the 20-year memorial of Harvey Milk's death, Stuart stated that he decided to be vocally out right after his uncle's murder, as a living and active memorial. \\"Earlier that year, Uncle Harvey and I had a three-hour talk at a family gathering, he talked to me about being your authentic self. I was just a teenager, but it stayed with me,\\" Milk said. \\"When I think about Uncle Harvey, I think about, even as a small child, the kind of the richness and color of life that he brought to me. Harvey was the person who introduced me to Broadway, and Broadway musicals\\", Stuart said in 2009. Milk has been involved in public service since the late 1980s including directing employment assistance centers and youth enrichment programs. He told The New York Times that he sees his work in public service, \\"with youths, the elderly, dislocated workers and former prison inmates, as part of his family's legacy.\\" In 1999, Stuart Milk made available to the public several never before seen photos of his uncle's early campaign for elected office and as well as personal family pictures. In 1985, Milk gave his first large public address as an \\"out\\" LGBT activist alongside The Times of Harvey Milk producer Richard Schmiechen at Oberlin College in Ohio. At the time Milk was working as a campaign director for National Citizen Action, a progressive political advocacy organization and was based in western Pennsylvania. Current work and activism Milk producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks, Stuart, director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black In addition to being the President of the Harvey Milk Foundation's Board of Directors, Stuart also sits as a director on boards and advisory boards of numerous human rights, LGBT rights and youth advocacy organizations including the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER), Equality California, International Conference on Disadvantaged Youth, the Coalition for Workforce Solutions, and the International Committee for Minority Justice and Equality. Stuart Milk has travelled to foreign nations advocating for human rights inclusive of the LGBT community while working collaboratively with other diminished and marginalized populations. Stuart's speaking events have included LGBT public speeches in the Near East cities of Istanbul, Ankara, and Cairo to public events in Central and Eastern Europe, Central American and South American cities, as well activities in Asia and the Pacific Rim. In addition to twice giving the keynote addresses for International Congresses in the Netherlands, Milk has been a delegate on official sister city visitations or state visits to Sydney, Australia; Panama City, Panama; and Cape Town, South Africa. Milk was involved with getting legislation signed creating an annual California State Day of Recognition named after his late uncle in 2009. His involvement was cited as a reason he received Equality California's Champion Award that year. In 2010 he worked with then California First Lady Maria Shriver in designing the first public museum exhibit on Harvey Milk in Sacramento, and he accepted his uncle's medal and induction into the California Hall of Fame from the Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Harvey Milk Day (HMD) activities are now held around the world every May 22‚ÄîMilk's birthday‚Äîand are facilitated annually by the Harvey Milk Foundation.. The foundation encourages organizers of Harvey Milk Day events to promote the unity of all marginalized minorities. Stuart Milk participated in efforts to have a U.S. postage stamp named for Harvey Milk, the first for a self-identified LGBT person. The successful \\"Harvey Milk U.S. Postage Stamp Campaign\\" was also supported by LGBT organizations including the International Court System, Equality California, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Human Rights Campaign, Victory Fund, The Trevor Project, and GLAAD. The Harvey Milk stamp was released on May 22, 2014, on what would have been Milk's 84th birthday, with an official first-day-of-issue ceremony taking place at the White House. It featured a black-and-white photograph of a smiling Milk in front of his Castro Street Camera store, along with a rainbow stripe. Following a meeting with Milk during his 2011 \\"Human Rights Tour\\" for Equality Italia, Italy's Minister of Equal Opportunities, Mara Carafagna, publicly reversed her opposition to a proposed anti-homophobia law saying \\"I now see it is important for my government to protect against homophobia and create gay friendly workplaces\\". Milk helped develop a 2011 professional international conference for youth educators working along with the Center For Excellence in School Counseling at San Diego State University. Senior federal government officials, including the assistant secretary of the United States Department of Education, were brought together with San Diego Mayor Sanders, school superintendents, faculty, counselors, and parent/student advocates to define and examine best practices to support LGBT youth while in school. Milk is also involved with a Global LGBT Transitions and Interchange Congress being presented in early 2012 with the support of European Union officials and the European private sector. Portrayals Portrayals of Stuart Milk have included his characterization in the play, Dear Harvey, by Patricia Loughrey that was partly based on Loughrey's interviews and discussions with Stuart. The play has been performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., at New York City's Fringe Festival and at colleges and universities across the United States. Dear Harvey has been translated into Spanish for production in Mexico and Spain while Stuart Milk's character was performed by actor Chad Allen in the spring 2010 production in Sacramento. Honors and awards Milk has been the recipient of international and national awards for his global civil rights work, including Spain's Annual Muestra T (cultural authenticity) in 2008, Keshet/Jewish Mosiac's Hacham and Hachamat Lev Award in 2010, the Jos√© Sarria International Human Rights Award from the International Court in 2007, the Equality Champion of the Year Award from Equality California in 2009, and was the 2011 recipient of the Medal of Turin.

On November 4, 2014, Nass was elected to the Wisconsin 11th Senate District.'Steve Nass elected as 11th state Senate District Representatives,' GazetteXtra, andrea Anderson, November 4, 2014 Political positions He has become known for his public adversarial relationship with the University of Wisconsin System, a position that assumed greater significance in 2006 when Nass became chair of the Assembly's Colleges and Universities Committee, which oversees the entire UW System. He was characterized by Paul Soglin, the mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, as \\"the outlaw chairman of an Assembly committee that is designed to destroy the University of Wisconsin System.\\" Nass has worked to cut funds for specific University programs that he disagreed with philosophically, saying that they are \\"too far to the left.\\" Specific criticisms of the University are articulated in greatest detail by his spokesman and research assistant, Mike Mikalsen: according to one account, \\"Nass ... acknowledges that Mikalsen dominates the conversation about the UW, explaining that legislators often don't have time to delve too deeply into issues.\\" When Republicans regained control of the State Assembly in the midterm elections of 2010, Nass also regained his old position as chair of the Colleges and Universities Committee,http://www.arc- wisconsin.org/resources/assemblystandingcommitteechairsannounced.pdf triggering a new round of speculation about the implications for the future of Wisconsin higher education. Nass was also in the spotlight in May, 2010, when it was reported that he would introduce legislation banning pavement markers designed to minimize conflicts between bicyclists and motorists. According to Nass, \\"It's basically about liberal extremists in Madison who hate cars and think everyone should bike to work. ... It is basically making it difficult to use an automobile.\\" Nass's position drew a caustic response from then Madison mayor Dave Cieslewicz, who noted that Madison is 70 miles from the district that Nass represents. \\"Not having been able to solve a single significant state problem (which they actually got elected to do) in their combined 37 years in office these guys now want to micromanage the city of Madison. There's a way they can do that, of course.

At the heart of the L√©man Express system is the CEVA rail project linking Eaux Vives station with Cornavin station in Geneva. This new line, largely underground, was opened on 15 December 2019. The L√©man Express marked the start of direct services from Gen√®ve-Cornavin railway station to the French cities of Evian, Thonon, Annemasse and Annecy as well as the population of the Arve valley up to Saint- Gervais-les-Bains. Prior to the opening CEVA, local rail in Geneva consisted of two short services: the half-hourly Regio operating from Coppet to the main Gen√®ve-Cornavin railway station and (since 2002) on to Lancy-Pont-Rouge station (now sections of L1-L4), and the Rh√¥ne Express R√©gional (abbreviated to 'RER') line from La Plaine (in Dardagny) to Gen√®ve-Cornavin station (now L5 and L6). The RER line used tram-trains derived from those on Lausanne m√©tro's line M1, required as it was electrified using 1,500 Volts direct current, unlike the 15,000 Volts alternating current rest of the Swiss Federal Railway network. Local trains to Bellegarde-sur-Valserine (in France) joined the network on 3 December 2001. The line was subsequently upgraded to the standard 25 kV AC electrification (as used on much of the French railways) in conjunction with the development of the L√©man Express system. Upon the full launch of the network in December 2019, it was hoped ridership would be around 50,000 travelers per day by the end of the next year; at the beginning of March 2020 it had already reached 45,000 per day before the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and travel shutdowns reduced ridership. As of June 2020, ridership had recovered to around 50% of pre-pandemic ridership.  History  On 8 February 2008, the Swiss and French Railways brought into being a study and marketing company, Transferis, to look into rolling stock, service, and marketing improvements for the RER system. The studies were necessitated by the growing number of commuters living in France and working in Geneva, not only on the short, existing RER system but on the lines leaving the station at Eaux Vives on the south side of the lake. The new, enlarged, RER network was to cover the present Eaux Vives to Annemasse line with services at regular intervals beyond to serve Evian, St. Gervais and Annecy, the RER line from Cornavin to La Plaine with services extending beyond to serve Bellegarde, and the local CFF services operating from Lancy (Pont Rouge) to Coppet through Cornavin. At the time of study, services carried some 7,000 commuters a day; with the improved network this was expected to grow to over 35,000 and cut up to 50,000 car journeys between France and Switzerland. The largest civil engineering project within the scheme was the CEVA line from Cornavin to Annemasse, with a tunnel between La Praille and Eaux Vives. Between Eaux Vives and Annemasse the present line was closed for four years period whilst it was double-tracked and cut-and-covered. As part of the scheme and to avoid RER rolling stock needing three voltages, Cornavin ‚Äì La Plaine ‚Äì Bellegarde was re-electrified at 25 kV AC in summer 2014. This not only allows standard Swiss dual voltage (25 kV AC 50 Hz and 15 kV 16‚Öî Hz) EMUs to work on the line but also improves the performance of the TGV workings (Paris-Geneva TGVs no longer need to run under 1.5 kV DC). The French signalling and train control between Geneva and la Plaine was replaced with standard Swiss equipment, the points motors renewed and the line fully automated.  Prior services  Rh√¥ne Express Regional = The Geneva RER or Rh√¥ne Express Regional was a commuter railway service running between Geneva Cornavin Station, Switzerland using the dedicated Platform 5 and La Plaine (Swiss terminus) and Bellegarde-sur- Valserine in France. It forms part of the Lyon-Geneva Railway. It is probably not a coincidence that the initials correspond to the Paris suburban railway commuter network RER. The service was twice hourly in each direction weekdays, with additional hourly services to Bellegarde at peak hours. Fares within the Swiss sector are covered by the Tout Gen√®ve ('whole of Geneva') rate, zones 11-17. This line used to be electrified at 1500 V DC and signalled to SNCF standards from the border to both Geneva's central passenger station and La Praille goods depot. Prior to the introduction of the \\"RER\\" brand in 1995 the Geneva - La-Plaine service was operated by two notoriously unreliable BDe 4/4 II railcars.  Rolling stock  Stadler FLIRT RABe 524 EMU about to leave Satigny for Cornavin Initially, service was operated by five specially built two coach articulated railcars of class Bem550. These were built by Vevey Technologies (formerly Ateliers de Constructions M√©caniques de Vevey (ACMV)) with electrical equipment by Asea Brown Boveri in 1994. They ran under 1.5 kV DC wires, but were equipped with a diesel engine to enable them to reach the workshops. When the service frequency was expanded, some trains composed of RIO carriages hauled by BB25500 series locos. This rather antiquated rolling stock was replaced progressively by Stadler FLIRT RABe 524 EMUs. From December 2010, to June 2014, Geneva - la Plaine services were operated by three Stadler FLIRT RABe 524 EMUs, which were not certified to run beyond la Plaine, while Geneva-Bellegarde services were operated by the Bem550s. The RABe 524 were taken temporarily from the Ticino railway network as they can also run on 1.5 kV DC. These sets went back to Ticino when the Gen√®ve-La Plaine line was re-electrified with 25 kV AC as they cannot use that voltage, to be replaced by RABe 522 EMUs.

Career Edvard Welle-Strand was born in Vester√•len, Norway. Welle-Strand wrote newspaper articles from his district in 1900, sending them to the newspaper Nidaros in Trondhjem. In 1905, he was hired by Nidaros. He later studied journalism in Berlin. In 1909 he published his first book Fra havskj√¶r og fjellvidde, a collection of tales. He worked in Hvepsen, and from 1910 to 1936, he worked as a subeditor in the newspaper Bergens Aftenblad. From time to time, he had assignments as a foreign correspondent; covering Petrograd in 1917 and Finland in 1918. He also contributed to Mikal Sylten's anti-Semitic magazine Nationalt Tidsskrift and to Sylten's likewise tinted Christmas magazine Nordisk Jul. Welle-Strand, who was a staunch anti-Semite and believed in Jewish financial domination conspiracies, was one of the most prolific non-pseudonymous contributors apart from Sylten himself, and had his most active period in Nationalt Tidsskrift in 1921. He also continued to publish novels, especially during the 1910s and 1920s. From 1937 to 1940 he edited and published the magazines Vi Reiser and Fiskermagasinet, and from 1940 to 1941 Bergens Illustrerte. Also, his last known contribution to Nationalt Tidsskrift came in 1940, a short story. In 1940 Norway was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany, but the Nazi authorities arrested Welle-Strand on 14 January 1942 as a \\"hostage\\", and incarcerated him at Grini concentration camp from 16 January to 23 March. Edvard's son Erling Welle-Strand, whom he had together with Elsa Kielland Lindh√© (1888‚Äì1979), was a member of the Norwegian resistance movement; from 1944 in the Norwegian Independent Company 1. Edvard's granddaughter Ragni (b. 1946) was married to famous writer Edvard Hoem from 1982 to 1995. Another son Erik Welle-Strand was a resistance member too. Welle-Strand continued to publish books after the war, from the 1950s concentrating on non-fiction books about Knut Hamsun. His last recorded release came in 1964.

large cities in Japan, but with a high degree of private transport. The region is a hub of international ferry services and has a high degree of air connectivity and a considerable rail transport network, complemented with highways and surface streets. It includes public and private rail and highway networks; airports for international, domestic, and general aviation; buses; motorcycle delivery services, walking, bicycling, and commercial shipping. The foci of the public transport system are Hakata Station, Tenjin Station, and Kokura Station, in Fukuoka and Kitakyushu cities respectively. Between these two cities lies a more sparse weblike regional rail network. The transit network consists of 32 surface and subterranean railway lines (see section on rail transport) operated by several and private operators. Monorails, trams, fixed- guideway lines and buses support this primary rail network. Like other cities in Japan, walking and bicycling is common.  Rail transport = Overview  Nishitetsu 3000 series EMUs Ky≈´sh≈´ Shinkansen The passenger rail network in Fukuoka-Kitakyushu metropolitan area (see also Northern Kyushu) is dense around the cities of Fukuoka and Kitakyushu and Shimonoseki, declining in density between and around the two primary cities. Passenger railway usage and density is lower than that of Greater Tokyo or Greater Osaka, with the region having a little less than 6 million people. Similar to other areas of Japan, few free maps exist of the entire network; only stations of a particular company are shown, along with key transfer points. The Sany≈ç Shinkansen serves as the backbone of intercity rail transport connecting Hakata and Kokura Stations to Honshu. Ky≈´sh≈´ Shinkansen lines are completed on March 12, 2011 running to Kagoshima. There are 33 operating passenger rail lines and a tourist-oriented cable car line in the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu area .

Most local bus routes complement existing rail service to form an effective intermodal transit network.  Air transport = Primary  Airplanes parked at Fukuoka airport Bridge to Kitaky≈´sh≈´ Airport's artificial island. Fukuoka Airport is the busiest airport in the region, serving international and domestic flights. Kitakyushu Airport is an international airport built on an artificial island in the Inland Sea, and serves as a major cargo hub for Kityakyushu area factories as well as a relief airport for Fukuoka.  Secondary  Saga Airport also provide air services to the region. Just outside the region is Oita Airport and Kumamoto Airport. There are also a number of Japan Air Self-Defense Force airfields.  Maritime transport Major area seaports include: * Port of Hakata * Port of Shimonoseki * Port of Kokura * Port of Shin Moji  Passenger ferries  See List of ferry operators in Japan. =International= Because of its geographic proximity to Korea and China, the region is the major hub in Japan for international passenger ferries. Pukwan Ferry, Camelia Line, and high- speed ferry Beetle (JR Kyushu), Kobee operate out of both Hakata and Shimonseki, there are also ferry services to Shanghai and Dalian in China, Busan, Ulsan in Korea. =Regional Domestic= There are ferry services to Tsushima Island as well as major Japanese cities (such as Hiroshima, Osaka, Matsuyama, Tokushima, K≈çbe and Tokyo) from Fukuoka, Kitakyushu, and Shimonoseki ports. =Cross Strait/Local= Within the Kanmon-Kitaky≈´sh≈´ area, there are three commuter ferry lines: the Wakato Ferry, the Kanmon Straits Ferry, and the Kanmon Straits Liner. There are services to some small islands near Kitakyushu and Fukuoka from their respective cities as well.  Shipping  Shipping plays a major role moving freight in and out of the Fukuoka-Kitakyushu area. Finished automobiles for export are handled by ports in the region. With just-in-time requirements of automobile manufacturers and suppliers, Kitaky≈´sh≈´ Airport plays an important role as a hub for cargo and logistics. The region is home to three regasification LNG terminals. Other modes Greater Fukuoka is little different from the rest of Japan in the other modes of transport.

Flanders Expo is the biggest event hall in Flanders, and the second biggest in Belgium (Flanders Expo's indoor surface is 55,000 m¬≤). Mortier later became president of Febelux, the Federation of Exhibitions in Belgium and Luxemburg. Until 2002, many concerts took place in Flanders Expo. Hall 8's capacity is more than 13,000 people. Musicians who have performed at Flanders Expo include Tina Turner (12 times), Phil Collins, Bryan Adams, Prince, Elton John, Britney Spears, Paul McCartney, Joe Cocker, Whitney Houston, Barry White, U2, Nick Kamen, Eros Ramazzotti, Bon Jovi, Metallica and AC/DC. Flanders Expo is also the host of Europe's biggest indoor techno party (I love Techno) with more than 60,000 visitors in one day. Mortier was an active member of the board of the soccer team K.A.A. Gent from 1988 until his death in 2004. After the degradation in 1988, Mortier consulted the Prime Minister of Belgium, Wilfried Martens, in order to establish an organisation named Foot Invest, to get the team back on track. Marc Mortier gathered at that time more than 50 million Belgian francs (1.25 million euros) in sponsoring in a couple of months and introduced VDK Spaarbank as the main sponsor. Mortier also was a member of the Board of 'Voetbalmagazine' (the Belgian national soccer magazine), 'Flanders Sports Arena, 'King Baudouin Foundation', 'The International Year Exposition of Flanders', 'The Festival of Flanders', and the Rotary Club (who honoured him individually with a Paul Harris Fellow One Star).

Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 110. and Jestice, Phyllis G, Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. (2004) pp 723.  Meaning  Ramakrishna in samadhi at the house of Keshab Chandra Sen. He is seen supported by his nephew Hriday and surrounded by brahmo devotees. Bhava samadhi, sometimes translated as 'trance', has no direct counterpart in the English language, though \\"ecstasy\\" is the closest translation.Swami Sarananda, Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master (India, Madras, 1952) pp 403 & pp 520 The various translations that have been proposed all refer to an ecstatic state of consciousness, which is attained by channelling the emotions into one-pointed concentration. For example, in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, the author, M., later identified as Mahendranath Gupta, recounts observing Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's introverted mood in which he became \\"unconscious of the outer world.\\"M., The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, pp. 78. M. later \\"learnt that this mood is called bhava, ecstasy.\\"M., The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna- Vivekananda Center, 1942, pp. 78; see also Swami Bhaskarananda, Meditation, Mind and Patanjali's Yoga, pp. 157. \\"Bhava\\" denotes the mood of ecstasy and self-surrender which is induced by the maturing of devotion to one's 'Ishta deva' (object of devotion).Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 108. \\"Bhava\\" literally means feeling, emotion, mood, or devotional state of mind. This refers to the aspirant's emotional life, which in the practice of jnana or raja yoga is controlled in order to transcend the spheres of the mind and intellect. In bhakti yoga, however, bhava is neither controlled nor suppressed, but is transformed into devotion and channelled to the Lord.\\"Definition can be found at Tara Yoga Center . Swami Sivananda states it is an \\"internal feeling\\" that needs to be developed through proper practice just like any other faculty of the mind e.g. memory or will power.See Swami Sivananda here According to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa real bhava can only be said to occur when the relationship with the Divine is so established that it remains fixed in our consciousness at all times, \\"whether eating, drinking, sitting or sleeping.\\" Swami Saradananda, Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master (India, Madras, 1952) pp432 Only when the bhava has fully ripened does the sadhaka (spiritual seeker) experience \\"bhava samadhi.\\" Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 109. and Swami Devananda, Meditation and mantra, Motilal Banarsidass, 1978, pp258 Bhava samadhi occurs when the emotions are perfectly channelled into one-pointed concentration on the object of one's devotion.Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi, \\"The Path Supreme,\\" 2010 page 160 It has also been described as \\"Absorption in meditation due to emotional cause, e.g. kirtan [devotional music]\\"See here. and \\"sheer ecstasy, a condition caused when the heart is seized by the Divine embrace.\\"See here Devotional practices that can evoke bhava, such as \\"bhajans\\" and kirtan (spiritual music), are standard practices in the bhakti tradition, and in the missions of many Indian saints including Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Shivabalayogi Maharaj. Shri Shivabalayogi often used the words \\"bhava\\" and \\"bhava samadhi\\" interchangeably.Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi, p 203. He explained bhava as follows: > \\"Everyone is in some sort of bhava of the guru because of their attachment > to the guru. The mind's attachment and devotion is the true bhava.\\"Bruce > Young, Guru-Disciple, pp. 186. ‚ÄúBhava is the beginning for samadhi and > tapas. Higher souls induce it. Bhava helps in physical, mental, and > spiritual progress.\\"Thomas L. Palotas, Swamiji's Treasure, God Realization > and Experiences of Shivabalayogi pp. 324-5. The qualities required for a genuine bhava samadhi have been emphasized by Ramakrishna Paramahamsa when he said that a spiritual experience of a lower plane may be had by \\"the momentary exuberance of emotions\\" but the scriptures say bhava samadhi is impossible to retain unless worldly desires have been removed and proper qualities have been established like renunciation and detachment.Swami Saradananda, Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master (India, Madras, 1952) pp 520  Misuse and controversy  There have been many misuses and controversies associated with bhava samadhi. Firstly, bhava itself has been mistaken to be an advanced spiritual state, whereas the great exponent of bhava samadhi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, made it clear to his disciple, Swami Vivekananda, that bhava is a preliminary state of consciousness: > \\"Witnessing the religious ecstasy (bhava) of several devotees, Narendra > (Swami Vivekananda) one day said to the Master that he too wanted to > experience it. 'My child,' he was told, 'when a huge elephant enters a small > pond, a great commotion is set up, but when it plunges into the Ganga, the > river shows very little agitation. These devotees are like small ponds; a > little experience makes their feelings flow over the brim. But you are a > huge river.' \\"See online Vivekananda biography Several other times Ramakrishna Paramahamsa made the same point like when he told one of his close devotees Gopalchandra Ghosh (later known as Swami Advaitananda, his most senior monastic disciple) that it was not so important to experience such a temporary ecstasy (bhava) and that on the spiritual path \\"true faith and renunciation are far greater.\\"Swami Saradananda, Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master (India, Madras 1952) pp 403 That bhava is a preliminary experience has also been emphasized by Shivabalayogi Maharaj: > \\"During this all your bhava (the mind‚Äôs feelings) will get concentrated on > your favorite deity and thus your mind becomes more concentrated, more > single-pointed. Then meditation itself becomes much easier and consequently > one would take up meditation more willingly. \\"It's like giving chocolate to > a child to make it go to school. But one should not settle just for the > chocolate - one must go on to school. In the same way, one must > meditate.\\"Bruce Young, Guru-Disciple pp. 80. Secondly, people have falsely claimed to have spontaneously attained spiritual powers and experiences through bhava, whereas bhava samadhi is the culmination of a long period of devotional practice.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 109, and teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi . Bhava has even been used by people to falsely claim that they are \\"possessed by sacred deities\\" and to issue orders on behalf of these deities.Bruce Young, Guru-Disciple pp. 186. If the bhava is genuine, however, the person will become non-violent and introverted, and will not claim or give instructions through bhava.Teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi . Spiritual efforts should always enable the mind to recede and become quiet, going introverted toward the Self.Teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi . Swami Vivekananda warned sadhaks (spiritual aspirants) to beware of claims made of bhava experiences: > He pointed out that Ramakrishna had been through long years of strictest > self discipline and that his ecstasy was a fruit of that discipline, not a > superficial emotionalism. \\"When people try to practice religion,\\" said Naren > \\"eighty percent of them turn into cheats, and about fifteen percent go mad. > Its only the remaining five percent who get some direct knowledge of the > Truth and so become blessed. So Beware.\\"Isherwood, C., Ramakrishna and His > Disciples, 1980, pp. 290-291. Thirdly, genuine bhava samadhi, which is an internal state of consciousness, has been identified with outer movements of the body, such as dancing and singing. It has been claimed that \\"the very nature of bhava itself - sometimes having such vigorous outward expression in action and movement - had always meant that those who wished attention or status in a group would sometimes simply pretend to be in bhava to obtain some personal gain.\\"Bruce Young, Guru- Disciple pp. 186. However, it has been made clear by Ramakrishna that emotional displays do not constitute spiritual experience: > One evening Subodh (later to become Swami Subodhananda) observed the > devotees dancing and singing Kirtan in the Masters room at Dakshineshwar. > They were overwhelmed with devotion. Shri Ramakrishna himself joined them > and his ecstasy surcharged the whole place with heavenly bliss. Some were > crying, some laughing, some dancing. Others were transfixed like motionless > statues, and some began to roll on the floor. Subodh was very skeptical > about this kind of emotional display ... [He asked] \\"who had real ecstasy in > the kirtan today?\\" The Master thought for a while and then said, \\"Today Latu > (later to become Swami Adbhutananda) alone had the fullest measure of it; > some others had sprinklings.\\"Swami Chetananda, God Lived with Them , 1997, > pp. 536-537. The depth of bhava experience varies across different individuals and depends on the spiritual maturity of their minds.Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 108. Mature sadhaks usually do not display outward signs of bhava, which are indicative of the depth of their experiences.Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi \\"The Path Supreme\\" 2010 page 160, Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life & Spiritual Ministration, pp. 109-110. The problem of devotees attempting to make claims about their inner state of consciousness by imitating external indicators of genuine bhava samadhi was addressed by Swami Vivekananda in the Ramakrishna Mission: > It was discovered that several were actually trying to induce the outer > physical symptoms of Samadhi and also imitate the movements of one who is > dancing in ecstasy. Naren reasoned with these devotees and persuaded them to > stop starving themselves and eat wholesome food, and to try control their > emotions instead of cultivating hysteria. The result was an increase in > spirituality and a decrease in outer show.Isherwood, C., Ramakrishna and His > Disciples Vedanta Press, 1980, , pp. 290-291. The actions of people in bhava samadhi, like dancing in ecstasy, can appear very strange to some. In Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj's mission various levels of bhava occurred to hundreds of people. Bhava was controversial throughout Shivabalayogi's public programs, and his own statements on the phenomenon appear inconsistent. Although some were acting or misusing the experience, when people complained to Sri Shivabalayogi, he was intolerant of most criticism or interference. \\"It is not drama. It really happens.\\"Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi, p 203, & Swamiji's Treasure, God Realization & Experiences of Shivabalayogi, pp 326-7 & 348. To place bhava samadhi into the correct spiritual context Ramakrishna Paramahansa said, > \\"If the depth of spiritual experiences is to be measured, it must be done > from observing one's steadfastness, renunciation, strength of character, the > attenuation of desires for enjoyment etc. It is by this touchstone alone, > and no other means, that the amount of dross in ecstacy can be assessed.\\" > Swami Saradananda, Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master (India, Madras, 1952) > pp 405  Sources  * Swami Sivananda, www.sivanandaonline.org * Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi, The Path Supreme, 2010 * Swami Devananda, Meditation and Mantras, Motilal Banarsidass publishers,1978 * Jestice, Phyllis G, Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, 2004 * Swami Saradananda, Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master.

The short was released on January 31, 1953, and stars Sylvester the Cat. The title is a pun on Lincoln's House Divided Speech. Plot The episode starts where a drunken stork delivers a baby to the nearest available home. Sylvester's wife, wanting a baby, despite his objections (\\"And what thanks do I get? I wish I was dead! Boo hoo hoo! Every day it's the same thing - pitter-patter of little feet!\\"), graciously receives the package. Sylvester is nonetheless excited- until he learns the baby is a mouse, at which point he tries to eat it. His wife quickly stops him, and when she goes out (and is not seen again afterwards), he tries again, but stops after the mouse calls him \\"Daddy\\". Sylvester's attitude toward the mouse changes entirely from this point on and decides to take his son for a walk. Unfortunately, the neighborhood cats are not so enamored of the mouse, forcing Sylvester to run back into the house. Several cats try to steal the mouse, using tactics such as climbing through windows, posing as a vacuum cleaner salesman (\\"Good day, Sir, I represent the Little Giant Vacuum Cleaner Company, Walla Walla, Washington and if you watch closely, you'll notice the powerful action of this machine as it removes completely and forever all foreign particles from around the room. I realize that you may not be ready to purchase the Little Giant right now but if you ever do, just remember the Little Giant Vacuum Cleaner Company, Walla Walla, Washington.\\"), babysitter and Santa disguises, cutting holes in the floor and ramming the door down, only to be foiled by Sylvester, who for once is on the winning end of the same traps by which he usually ends up getting foiled. The stork, meanwhile, returns (still drunk) under orders to deliver the mouse to its real parents by fishing it out with a piece of cheese. Sylvester, believing it to be another cat, stops the mouse and is pulled up instead with the stork thinking he is the mouse (\\"Boy [hic!], did that mouse grow!\\"). A later scene reveals a married mice couple walking a disgruntled Sylvester (dressed as a baby) with the wife telling her husband, \\"Well, nothing like that ever happened on my side of the family.\\", before he looks at the audience in bewilderment as the cartoon irises out.

Views on Israeli-Palestinian peace process At an international workshop on global security held in Rome in 2010, Avi Primor said regarding the prospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians: ::\\"We do not implement a peace plan because the majority of Israelis believe that the one and only issue that truly interests them, which is the issue of security, has not been resolved in any of the peace propositions that have been published. When we negotiated with Egypt and with Jordan, we knew that those partners, if willing, were capable of guaranteeing us security. We do not think that our Palestinian partner, although he is willing, is capable of guaranteeing us security. We fear that if we leave the West Bank under the present conditions, even within the framework of a peace agreement, that the situation in the West Bank will develop as it did in the evacuated Gaza Strip. If we do not find a solution that convinces Israelis that leaving the West Bank will guarantee their security, then there will be no public opinion to support or put pressure on the Israeli government to accept a peace agreement. I think that the solution only can come from the international community.\\"Ambassador Avi Primor - Security as the Key to Peace in the Middle East, Opening Remarks Publications *\\"No Permanent Allies, No Permanent Enemies, Only Permanent Interests: Israeli-Iranian Relations\\", Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs VIII : 1 (2014) pp 33‚Äì38.

He also served as Recorder for Colchester, and as a magistrate and Deputy Lieutenant for Essex, as well as being a substantial local landowner and notable. Round was educated at Winchester then Felsted (1810‚Äì1814), and graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, with first class honours in classics in 1818 (BA) and 1821 (MA); he was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1822. Round was always regarded as \\"a very able and intelligent lawyer\\", though not an eloquent pleader. He served as Chairman of the Essex Quarter Sessions, a post which he held for twenty years, and as Recorder of Colchester for nearly thirty. Round was an active magistrate for Essex and a warm supporter of most of the religious societies connected with the Church of England. He was also a founding member of the Essex Archaeological Society. Politically, he was elected unopposed to become an MP for North Essex in 1837, a seat which he held until 1847, when he stood for the University of Oxford, but failed to win that, losing to William Ewart Gladstone. Round inherited from his father (also Charles) a great deal of land in Colchester, including Birch Hall, which he rebuilt 1843‚Äì8 as \\"a handsome mansion in the plain Ionic order\\". In the same way he took possession of Colchester Castle and the accompanying Castle Park, originally under the ownership of Charles Gray. Round resigned his position as Recorder of Colchester in 1863. In 1838 he married his wife Emma Sarah (1819‚Äì1892); together they \\"promoted religion and education in the parish [of Birch], were diligent in charitable works, and provided some housing for estate workers.\\" Having no children, he was succeeded as owner of Birch Hall by his nephew James Round.

The doctrine states that the government must disclose to a contractor otherwise unavailable information that is vital to contract performance. \\"The Helene Curtis doctrine of superior knowledge is now firmly embedded in the jurisprudence of government contracts.\\" In order to recover under the superior knowledge doctrine, a contractor must prove each of the following elements: # The contractor undertook to perform the contract without vital knowledge of a fact directly affecting performance, cost, or duration of the contract. # The government was aware that the contractor had no knowledge of the information, and that the contractor had no reason to attempt to obtain this information. # A contract specification that the government supplied to the contractor misled the contractor, or failed to put the contractor on notice to inquire more. # The government failed to provide the relevant information.Petrochem serv inc. v United States, 837 F.2d 1076, 1079 (Fed Cir. 1988) (citing American Shipbuilding Co.

Cl. 733 (1995). History The case most often cited as initiating the superior knowledge doctrine is Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. United States (160 Ct. Cl. 437, 312 F.2d 774 (1963)). Helene Curtis Industries received an army contract for large quantities of a disinfectant chlorine powder that had never been mass- produced. The powder was to be used by U.S. troops in Korea to disinfect mess gear and fresh fruits and vegetables. The Army prepared directions for production of the new disinfectant powder. Based on the specifications, the contractor concluded that only a simple mixing technique was needed and submitted its bid. The Army already knew that a costly grinding operation would be required to produce the disinfectant powder. The Army also knew the contractor planned to simply mix the ingredients together, without performing any grinding. After the contract was awarded, the disinfectant failed to meet the specified solubility test. The company then investigated and discovered the powder needed to be ground. The contractor sued for the costs of finding that it needed to grind the powder, because the Army should have shared this superior knowledge. Later cases Later cases have established that: # The government may have a greater obligation to provide information where the contractor is a small business enterprise since it is presumed that such contractors will have less knowledge.See e.g. Numax Electronics, ASBCA 29080, 90-1 BCA ¬∂ 22,280.

The government's duty to disclose is heightened if the contractor is a small business.Numax Electronics, ASBCA 29080, 90-1 BCA ¬∂ 22,280 # The superior knowledge doctrine was potentially applicable to even classified information regarding prior secret technology.

The first book in the 100 Cupboards Trilogy, it is followed by Dandelion Fire and The Chestnut King. Plot Henry York moves to Henry, Kansas to live with his Uncle Frank, Aunt Dotty, and cousins Penelope, Henrietta, and Anastasia after his parents are abducted while bike trekking in South America. On his first night there, Henry sneaks out of his attic bedroom to go to the bathroom. Instead, he discovers that the door is closed and the light is on. He waits and sees a short man emerge from the bathroom and enter Grandfather's bedroom, a room that has been locked since Grandfather died two years previously. Another night, the plaster from Henry's attic wall starts coming off, revealing two master lock dials to a hundred little locked cupboards. When they are home alone, Henry and Henrietta discover a key in one of the cupboards they have managed to open, which unlocks the door into Grandfather's bedroom. There they find a journal which has a map of the cupboards. One morning Henrietta mysteriously disappears, and Henry discovers a journal entry which tells him how the cupboards work. He crawls through a cupboard in Grandfather's room to find Henrietta. After several strange adventures he finds her in the ballroom of a palace in a ruined city, but they are unable to return until the master locks of the cupboards are set back to their location, and they hide in a dark cupboard. They witness a group of people with wolves called \\"Witch-Dogs\\" kill a party, but they escape. Meanwhile, Uncle Frank attempts to find the two of them while Aunt Dotty tells Penelope and Anastasia that Frank came through the cupboards long ago, and it was their great- grandfather who invented the cupboards and made them work. But Frank is too late when a Witch and her cat emerge from the Endor (8th cupboard) cupboard and stab Frank. The witch is Nimiane, and she has been strengthened by Henry's blood. Aunt Dotty, Penelope, and Anastasia run up to see what's going on, and Aunt Dotty falls into a similar state as Frank. Henry and Henrietta emerge from the cupboard and struggle with the witch, but it is Zeke, a boy who was just dropping by to see if Henry was ready to play baseball, who knocks her out with a swing of his baseball bat. The children push her through the cupboard into an unnamed place, and Dotty and Frank are rushed to the hospital where they are healed. Henrietta discovers a creature that looks like a small flying rhino in one of the cupboards. This creature, called a raggant, was the one banging against his cupboard, causing it to break through the plaster at the beginning of the book. Uncle Frank tells Henry that he came from one of the cupboards as a child, and the raggant has been sent by someone to find him. Meanwhile, Nimiane has recovered and is plotting in one of the places beyond the cupboards. The book ends when Henry receives another threatening letter from the post office box. Main characters *Henry York - The 12-year-old protagonist of the story, Henry lived with his adopted parents, Phil and Ursula, that were kidnapped a short while before the beginning of the book.

It is unusual for a Puya, as the leaves have no spines along the leaf margins. The flowers are blue with brown buds and the plants reach maturity at 4 to 5 years. Another feature that sets this species is that it grows in boggy areas at 3000 m that dry up seasonably. Cultivation Puya dasylirioides comes from 2300-3300 meter elevation, where the climate is cool all year. It has taken temperatures in the mid-80s (30 ¬∞C), but it's possible that it won't thrive in consistently warmer conditions, especially if nights are warm. It is said to have taken winter lows of 19 ¬∞F (-7 ¬∞C), and might even handle colder temperatures. It grows well in a deep pot in normal cactus soil that contains no lime. Water it deeply occasionally, and avoid letting the soil dry out completely. Some protection from strong afternoon sun might be needed in warmer climates. Over about 40% humidity is recommended.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on April 4, 1953, and features Tweety and Sylvester. Plot Granny is planning a day-long trip into town and leaves Hector in charge of looking after Tweety and keeping Sylvester away; mimicking gunfire, she threatens to shoot and kill him if Tweety is harmed. Later, Sylvester (disguised as a scarecrow on stilts) sneaks up on Tweety and grabs him out of his cage, but Hector quickly sniffs out the cat and chases him away; Sylvester's attempt to get Hector to shut up (his only line of dialogue in the entire cartoon) only make him angrier. Tweety, deciding he needs a little fresh air as long as he's outside his cage, decides to look around the barnyard. He greets a cow (\\"Hello, moo-moo cow!\\") and a pig (unwittingly insulting the pig by calling him a \\"dirty piggie\\") before immediately identifying Sylvester wearing a rubber goat's head mask (\\"Hello, puddy tat!\\") The chase this time leads to the fenced-in area of a chicken coop, where a large male rooster (an ill-tempered, perfectionist rooster and not Foghorn Leghorn, who is a strictly Robert McKimson character) serves as the cat's nemesis. After Tweety takes refuge amongst several chicks in a nest, Sylvester tries using a wind-up toy soldier to get the hens to stand up, allowing the cat to kidnap what the mother hen thinks is one of her young. The rooster intervenes and, after making Sylvester give the bird back, Tweety sarcastically says, \\"You tee, he's really a nice puddy tat,\\" before scoffing‚Äîsets up a screen and beats up the puddy tat. Later, Tweety feeds with the chicks, himself mimicking a chick, the bird advising a worm (\\"a piece of spaghetti with eyes\\") to hide or he'll be eaten. Sylvester disguises himself with a red glove as a hen and calls Tweety over. Before the cat can grab dinner, the rooster decides to \\"court\\" Sylvester. The courtship immediately ends, the rooster demanding that Sylvester lay eggs; when the rooster's suspicion is confirmed, he decides to \\"see\\" if the cat can \\"hatch\\" an egg by making him sit on a live grenade. Just then, Hector realizes Tweety is outside his cage and hears Granny's horse and buggy coming back home. After envisioning his execution (for failure to protect Tweety), Hector finds Sylvester and demands to know the bird's whereabouts. Short on time and Sylvester unable to answer, Hector hastily paints the cat yellow, places him in Tweety's cage and makes him sing. The ruse works, completely fooling Granny, and Hector's well-being is ensured. Tweety then comes into the yard, sees Sylvester in the cage acting like a bird. \\"Ho ho! If he's a birdie, den dat makes me a putty tat!\\" the bird scoffs before meowing, and scratching and hissing at Hector.

She finished fourth in the competition. Early life Jennifer Lyon was born in Nevada, but grew up in Washington and The Dalles, Oregon. She enjoyed hiking, playing soccer, and photography. At the age of 18, Jennifer learned Spanish when she participated in the foreign exchange program around 1990. After graduating from high school, Jennifer spent a year in Spain and two years in London working as a nanny. When Jennifer returned to the U.S., she attended Portland State University and spent a year there until she later attended Western Oregon State College before she was sent to Oregon State University. She later received a Bachelor of Science Degree in nutrition and food management. Survivor In 2004, Lyon was selected for Survivor: Palau, the tenth overall season of Survivor. The season aired in Spring 2005. The game started with all 20 players on the same beach. During the tribe division, she was chosen by Gregg Carey to be on the Koror tribe. She in turn picked Coby Archa to join the tribe. Koror ended up being the dominant tribe, winning every tribal immunity challenge. During this time she developed a showmance with Carey. She also developed a rivalry with Ulong member Stephenie LaGrossa, who was constantly beating her in challenges. Eventually, LaGrossa, the last remaining Ulong, was absorbed into Koror, but Lyon outlasted her when LaGrossa was voted out in seventh place. At the Final Four, when Lyon was expected to be voted out, she convinced Tom Westman to vote for Ian Rosenberger for thinking about betraying their alliance, while Rosenberger and Katie Gallagher, the only other players left, voted for Lyon. A re-vote was unsuccessful in breaking the tie, so Lyon was put in the first ever Final Four fire making tie-breaker challenge against Rosenberger. She lost the challenge, which put her on the jury. At the Final Tribal Council, she gave her vote to Westman to win the game. At the reunion show, it was revealed that her relationship with Carey only lasted on the island, although they remained friends afterwards. Death In 2005, while living in Encino, California, Lyon was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, and subsequently began blogging about her disease and treatment. Lyon got involved with the Me and My Two Friends Foundation, which focuses on the early detection and prevention of breast cancer through education and awareness. It was founded by Alisa Unger, who designed jewelry and planned to donate a portion of the proceeds to fund breast cancer education projects. In 2006, Lyon was the grand marshal for the 11th annual Walk for the Cause, a breast cancer fundraiser in Albany, New York. In December 2009, Lyon opened a Christmas tree lot with her boyfriend, Dion, mother and father, Larry and Jane Lyon, and her two nephews, Tyler Lyon and Mikel Lyon, and donated all the profits to the Susan Love Cancer Research Foundation. In January she moved to a spot on the Hood River in Oregon. On January 19, 2010, Lyon died from cancer, which had come back from remission and had metastasized to the bone. She became the first former Survivor contestant to pass away. The special Surviving Survivor, which aired Thursday, February 4, 2010, just over two weeks after her death, was dedicated to her memory. The reunion episode of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains showed a video montage of moments from Lyon's appearance on Survivor: Palau.

This species is native to Bolivia. Description Puya mirabilis grows as an evergreen, perennial herbaceous plant that reaches heights of 1 to 1.5 meters with its inflorescence. It lives terrestrially and is somewhat xerophytic. Many leaves stand together in a leaf rosette without a trunk being formed. After the seed and child development, the mother plant slowly dies. The tough, parallel- veined leaves are divided into leaf sheath and leaf blade. The white to brownish, relatively thick, durable leaf sheath is 3 to 4 centimeters wide and egg-shaped with a length and width of 3 to 4 centimeters with a finely toothed edge. The leaf sheaths are preserved for a long time and form a bulbous protective covering on the plant base. The simple, early balding leaf blade is 60 to 70 centimeters long and 1 to 1.5 centimeters wide at the base of the blade and is narrow-linear with a long, pointed upper end. The leaf margin is coarse, prickly serrated. The underside and the upper side of the leaf are only covered with gray when pressed on the lower half. For Puya species, an inflorescence is formed after relatively few years. The upright, strong inflorescence stem has a length of 90 centimeters and a round cross-section with a diameter of about 1 centimeter. The initially green, but early drying bracts on the inflorescence stem are similar to the foliage leaves and prickly on the edge, the lower ones being long and turned back and the upper ones being upright and short, but longer than the intervening axis sections. The upright, simple, so unbranched, loose, racemose inflorescence has a length of 30 to 50 centimeters and a diameter of 16 centimeters and some flowers. The early drying, almost upright to spreading bracts are triangular, broadly ovate-elliptical with a pointed upper end, long pointed with a prickly edge and with a length of 3 to 4 centimeters shorter than the sepals, but longer than the flower stalks. The 1.2 to 1.5 centimeter long peduncle is initially almost upright and curves downwards after pollination. The hermaphrodite flower is threefold with a double flower envelope. The three green, gray- scaled, relatively thick, leathery sepals are somewhat asymmetrical, about 5 to almost 6 centimeters long and about 1 centimeter wide and almost triangular with an indistinctly pointed upper end. The three greenish-yellow, bare petals are about 10 centimeters long and about 2 centimeters wide and twist in a spiral as they fade.

It is the 22nd annual installment in the bestselling Madden NFL video game franchise. It was released in 2010 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable, BlackBerry, and iOS platforms. The PS3 and Xbox 360 demos were released July 27, 2010. Features The 2010 installment of the Madden NFL series headlined new features such as a play-calling system titled \\"GameFlow\\", a new game mode titled \\"Online Team Play\\", and an assortment of other features. The game was advertised as being \\"Simpler, Quicker, and Deeper\\" than previous versions of the game. The superstar mode for the Wii version was removed from this Madden installment. \\"GameFlow\\" enables the player to create a situational game plan based on down and situation, and is advertised to speed up playing time as much as one half of the total game time from previous years of \\"Madden\\". Another addition is \\"Online Team Play\\", which supports 3 vs. 3 cooperative play. Players can also scout opponents in online head-to-head games to gain a competitive advantage. Other changes from previous installments include a new kick meter, new audible system, and an improved locomotion animation system. Lighting improvements, run blocking changes, new quarterback ratings, and a new Old Spice \\"Swagger\\" rating have also been added to the game. Gus Johnson does the play-by-play broadcast commentary, replacing Tom Hammond. One reviewer noted, Johnson's \\"penchant for the dramatic in real life keeps you on the edge of your seat as you turn the corner for a RB sprint or heave a desperation Hail Mary.\\" Cris Collinsworth returns as color commentator from previous editions. \\"Madden Ultimate Team\\": Madden Ultimate Team is a downloadable game mode released on January 7, 2011. In this mode, users are able to build a team by purchasing player packs. These packs are purchased with coins that are earned by winning a game, scoring a touchdown etc. They can also be purchased with real money through the user's PlayStation Network or Xbox Live accounts. As the user gains more coins, they are able to buy better packs of players, eventually building their \\"Ultimate Team\\". This mode has received some negative feedback with regards to 'Player Contracts' that are attached to each 'Player Card'. When purchased 'Player Cards' have a 10 match contract - this decreases by 1 every game (even if due to disconnection). When a 'Player Card' contract reaches zero you cannot use that player in your team until you replenish his contract. Replenishment of a contract on a 'Player Card' is done by a contract card that is purchased with coins. It is thus extremely difficult to keep a good team 'in contract' without spending real money. It is also possible to be in a position where you have a low amount of coins and not enough players to even play 'Madden Ultimate Team', unless you wish to spend real money for more coins. In order to buy contract cards to replenish your players contracts, or to buy new packs with - to try to fill the empty team positions that are stopping you from playing the mode. Cover For the first time in the series, the fans were given the opportunity to vote for who would appear on the cover of Madden NFL 11. The choices were Alex Smith, quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers; Drew Brees, quarterback of the New Orleans Saints; Jared Allen, defensive end of the Minnesota Vikings; and Reggie Wayne, wide receiver of the Indianapolis Colts. Drew Brees pulled in the most votes and became the cover athlete. Demo A demo of the game, featuring a game between the Indianapolis Colts and the New York Jets, was released on July 27, 2010. Marketing In August 2010, Time Warner announced that it would offer a copy of Madden NFL 11 and a Making of Madden NFL DVD free with a paid subscription to Sports Illustrated. A similar offer was made available in 2009 with the release of Madden NFL 10. Reception The game was met with positive reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 85.71% and 84 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 85.40% and 83 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version; 79% and 78 out of 100 for the iPhone version; 77 out of 100 for the iPad version; and 76.50% and 75 out of 100 for the Wii version. GamePro gave the Xbox 360 version a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five and said that \\"hardcore Madden players may not appreciate all the changes, but those of us who are more casual fans have a lot to like.\\" The same website, however, gave the iPhone version four stars out of five and said, \\"Everything from the 22 on- screen players to the stadium they're duking it out in looks great, and for the first time ever I felt like I wasn't playing a compromised or downgraded football experience despite the limitations of the iPhone platform.\\" The Escapist gave the Xbox 360 version all five stars and said, \\"I went into this game as a skeptic. Madden NFL 11 made me a believer.\\" The A.V. Club gave the same version a B+ and said that it \\"offers a refreshing change of pace, making it a fine point of entry for newcomers and allowing stat-obsessed veterans a chance to peel away some of the layers added over the last few years.\\" However, The Daily Telegraph gave the same version a score of eight out of ten and said, \\"What I've taken away from my time with NFL 11 is a new appreciation for the sport itself.

Edward, the eldest son, lived with servants and was taught by tutors and in public schools. His life in the west was one of which his father was a senior military officer, a decorated Civil War hero and he was \\"his father's son.\\" His life was privileged compared to others. As he grew up he watched both military officers and men show respect and courtesy to his parents. Later young Edward attended the public school in Omaha, Nebraska. He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1876, but withdrew after his second year. In 1879 he was appointed second lieutenant in the 22nd Infantry Regiment, U.S. Army. By June 1880 Ord's parents were in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. His father was the Commanding General of the Department of Texas. Ord's father retired from the Army on December 6, 1880 after serving 41 years. General Ord began a second career building the Mexican Southern Railroad from Texas to Mexico City. His family stayed in San Antonio. In 1880, young Edward was stationed at Fort McKavett, Menard, Texas. He married Mary Frances Norton (May 27, 1857 ‚Äì June 27, 1947) on November 10, 1879 in Bexar County. She was the daughter of Charles Gilman and Frances (Brown) Norton.

Military career 1=Indian Wars The 22nd Infantry Regiment coat of arms. Second Lieutenant Ord of the 22nd Infantry served in the Indian campaigns in Texas in 1880, and later commanded the Seminole Indian scouts in 1882 to about 1890. Since 1870, the U.S. Army invited Black Seminoles to return from Mexico to serve as army scouts for the United States. The Seminole Negro Indian Scouts (originally a black unit despite the name) played a lead role in the Texas Indian Wars of the 1870s. The scouts became famous for their tracking abilities and feats of endurance. Four men were awarded the Medal of Honor. They served as advance scouts for the commanding white officers and the all-black units known as the Buffalo Soldiers, with whom they were closely associated. After the close of the Texas Indian Wars, the scouts remained stationed at Fort Clark in Brackettville, Texas. First Lieutenant Ord participated in the feared revolt of the Ghost Dancers supposedly led by Sitting Bull in mid-December 1891 and took part in patrols in Montana trying to keep the peace through the end of 1892. This was during the time when Sitting Bull was killed by an Army officer. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Lieutenant Ord fought at Santiago in Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War with the 22nd Infantry Regiment from July 3 to July 17, 1898. There he was promoted to captain. After the war, Captain Ord remained in Cuba for nine months as interpreter on the staff of General Henry Lawton. There he suffered from a mild case of yellow fever. Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War In late 1900 or early 1901, Captain Ord was sent to the Philippines from Benicia Barracks when the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War broke out. He participated in battle at San Isidro then other battles during the Moro Rebellion on Mindanao and Jolo. Ord, like his father would continue to suffer from yellow fever and its second phase. Unlike his father, he would live but require a long sabbatical from military service. He was forced to retire on October 10, 1903 due to the physical disabilities of yellow fever contracted in Cuba.

In 1908, he was the military instructor at St. Matthew's school in San Mateo, California and later at the University of Alabama. During this time period he continued his correspondence with Mexican leader Geronimo Trevino (1836‚Äì1914), mostly about the health of Trevino's son Geronimo Trevino y Ord, but also discussing aspects of the Mexican Revolution until his friend's death in 1914.

Military career 2 In 1915, Ord was a military aide on the staff of the governor of Arizona. He was also a liaison with Army unit that included his former regiment. He saw service on the Mexican border due to the rise of tension along the border following the Battle of Agua Prieta. This was where Pancho Villa sustained his greatest defeat and his units were disorganized and wandered around northern Mexico foraging for supplies. Desperate for food and fresh horses, Pancho Villa camped his army of an estimated 500 horsemen outside of Columbus, New Mexico on the Mexican side of the border in March 1916. On March 9, 1916, he invaded the United States for supplies and arms which resulted in the Battle of Columbus. Ord had been given the rank of Major and served Arizona well in organizing and arming militia units. No major raids across the border took place in Arizona. As the result of his Arizona service, on June 3, 1916, Ord was advanced to the grade of major on the Army retired list. In early 1917, he returned to full active duty, serving at Big Bend, Texas; Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In December 1918, because of complications of his yellow fever sustained in Cuba, he retired from the Army due to ill health. Later life In 1920, Ord was residing in Oakland, Alameda County, California. Ord was listed as an expert linguist and possessed exceptional artistic ability, devoting much of his leisure time to producing landscape & seascape paintings.

It is notable in that it was the occasion on which a Victoria Cross was awarded, to seaman Joseph Trewavas. The action The Russians had built a large floating pontoon bridge across the Genitchi Strait, Sea of Azov, to connect the town of Genitchi to the Arabat Spit, and it served as the main supply route to reinforce their troops at Sevastopol. The destruction of the bridge would force the Russians to travel an extra to deliver supplies, and it therefore became a strategic objective for British forces. Two attacks to cut the floating bridge's hawsers had proved unsuccessful and alerted the Russian garrison. The British made a third attempt on 3 July 1855 using HMS Beagle's four-oared gig, commanded by Gunner John Hayles, and a small paddle-box steamer with one gun, under Midshipman Martin Tracy. The paddle-box steamer moored where the crew could see Russian soldiers marching about on shore and fired the first round in the breech, which drew the gun's securing bolts and made it useless. That left six men in a four-oared boat (including Joseph Trewavas), one rifle, ten rounds of ammunition, and a cutlass apiece to face two hundred enemy on shore behind heaps of coal. In Trewavas's own words: (Trewavas wondered why the Russians had not fired upon the British as they approached the pontoon bridge at Genitchi, but later a Russian officer explained that they had no idea the sailors planned to destroy the bridge, believing rather that they intended to destroy shipping, and therefore held fire with the intention of taking them prisoner.)

Established in 1900, the shipyard included, at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, a complete working steam-powered marine railway system, one of the few such in the nation. Description and history The Old Thames Shipyard is located on the Thames River waterfront in northern New London, just north of the United States Coast Guard Academy. It is accessed via Farnsworth Street, down a steep slope to the waterfront, and is set on basically level terrain between the river and a railroad right-of-way. The property (as of 1975) included a brick headhouse, from which three sets of rails descended into the river. Two steam engines powered heavy chain winches (with a capacity of 1000 and 4000 deadweight tons respectively) for hauling boats out of the water. It was built by Thomas Chappell, who operated a fleet of tugs and barges for hauling coal, to service his ships at the Thames Tow Boat Company. During World War I and World War II the yard was used for shipbuilding, producing military and commercial ships. John Wronowski took over the business (but not the property) from the Chappells in 1967. The shipyard property was taken by the United States Coast Guard in 1972, with plans to tear down the shipyard and expand its adjacent facilities. These plans were stalled by the National Register designation, and abandoned in 1976, amid disagreements with the city over the plans. Wronowski had fought the acquisition of the property, and was later given a waterfront area on Ferry Street in compensation, from which the Thames Shipyard operates. Wronowski, who had continued to lease this property from the Coast Guard, successfully acquired it in 1981. It now serves as the Thames Shipyard's North Yard, including its two main drydocks.

Having unsuccessfully contested the Bradford East Parliamentary seat at the 1900 General Election, he was elected an Alderman of Bradford in 1903 and its Mayor for 1904-5.Leeds Mercury, 13 April 1929. Local economic depression had resulted in increased demands on Bradford‚Äôs Cinderella Club, a charitable organisation with which Priestley had been associated since the 1890s and which provided free food, clothing and amusement for the city‚Äôs poor children. In the winter of 1903-4 the club served more than 110,000 free meals and, by the time of Priestley‚Äôs accession as mayor, its funds were approaching exhaustion.Bradford Daily Telegraph, 18 February and 22 October 1904. At a heated meeting chaired by Priestley in November 1904, it was agreed that Bradford Council would assume responsibility for funding the club‚Äôs provision of meals. The means by which this responsibility was to be discharged were ill-defined, but the commitment was the first of its kind by an English local authority. Alderman Fred Jowett argued that the cost should be a charge on the rates and in the first instance, to overcome legal difficulties, be paid from a salary to be voted to Priestley as mayor.Yorkshire Post, 30 November 1904; Bradford Daily Telegraph, 30 November 1904. Unhappy with this approach, Priestley launched an appeal for voluntary funding that raised more than ¬£3,000 in donations. Between November 1904 and October 1905, 350,000 free meals were served to Bradford children.Yorkshire Post, 26 July 1905; Leeds Mercury, 10 October 1905. During his mayoralty, Priestley laid the foundation stone of Bradford‚Äôs Town Hall extension, and his term of office was considered so successful that in November 1905 the Liberal and Conservative groups on the council united in asking him to serve for a further year.Bradford Daily Telegraph, 26 September 1905. He declined the invitation and two months later was returned as MP for Bradford East at the election which swept the Liberal Party to power. He held the seat until his defeat at the 1918 general election. Legislation introduced by the new government included the Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906, establishing the national system of free school meals. The Act was strongly influenced by the Bradford experienceK. Laybourn, \\"The Issue of School Feeding in Bradford 1904-1907\\" in Journal of Educational Administration and History, Vol. 14, 1982, Issue 2, pp. 30-38; National Archives resource relating to school dinners. and, when supporting it in Parliamentary debate, Fred Jowett (newly returned as Independent Labour MP for Bradford West) emphasised the need for secure funding of the meals system, dismissing the ¬£3,000 raised by Priestley‚Äôs appeal as \\"not voluntarily subscribed for its own sake\\" but payment by the well-to-do to fend off the \\"bogey\\" of municipal welfare.Hansard, Education (Provision of Meals) Bill, Commons Debate, 7 December 1906, Vol. 166, cc1397. Parliamentary career Priestley‚Äôs 1906 majority in his Bradford constituency was 1,108.Northern Daily Telegraph, 15 January 1906. He increased it to 2,695 in January 1910 and to 3,044 in December 1910 but, following the national split in the Liberal Party, he lost heavily to the Coalition candidate in the coupon election of 1918.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 14 January 1910; Brighouse News, 6 December 1910; Leeds Mercury, 30 December 1918. His contributions from the floor of the House of Commons were slight,Hansard 1803-2005 - People (P): Sir William Priestley, Contributions but he was active in lobbying ministers on trade issues and deserves credit for the Registration of Business Names Act 1916, which required registration of the ownership of each business operating under a name other than that of its proprietor(s). The measure was introduced by him as a private member‚Äôs bill in 1914, and he successfully persuaded the Board of Trade to allow it a sympathetic passage.Yorkshire Post, 22 May 1914; Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 2 February 1917. He was ready to speak forcefully on a topic when the occasion required. Thus, in 1917, after the War Office commandeered the nation‚Äôs entire wool supply, it was reported that ‚Äúin terse and telling phrases he arraigned the official ‚Äòamateurs‚Äô on the score of their ignorance and bungling‚Äù, and he was shortly afterwards co-opted to the Central Wool Advisory Committee.Yorkshire Post, 16 February 1917; Dundee Courier, 16 April 1917. He sat on the House of Commons Local Legislation CommitteeYorkshire Post, 11 May 1911. and in 1917 was appointed to the Balfour Committee on Commercial and Industrial Regulation, then considering adoption of the metric system.The Scotsman, 1 May 1917. He was outspoken in his opposition to women‚Äôs suffrage, and both he and his wife were members of the deputation, led by Lord Curzon on behalf of the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage, which sought assurances from Prime Minister Asquith that no women‚Äôs suffrage measure would be introduced except after a clear expression of support from the nation.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 11 November 1910; Leeds Mercury, 11 October 1911; Yorkshire Post, 15 December 1911. He was a member of the Executive of the National Liberal Federation, 1901-03, and of the committee of the Reform Club, was elected President of the national Museums Association in 1902, and was created a knight bachelor in the Birthday Honours of 1909.The Scotsman, 26 March 1932; Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 14 October 1910; Sheffield Daily Telegraph, 16 July 1902; Westminster Gazette, 25 June 1909. Wartime initiatives In 1914 Priestley led the delegation to obtain Field Marshal Kitchener‚Äôs authorisation for forming the Bradford Citizens‚Äô Army League that raised the ill-fated Bradford Pals‚Äô battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment. He gave ¬£1,000 to the League on formation and, pending issue of military uniforms, provided volunteers with handsome enamel badges to signify their enlistment.Ralph N. Hudson, The Bradford Pals, 4th Edn., 2013; David Raw, Bradford Pals, Pen & Sword Military, 2006, Chapter 3. He chaired the committee supporting the Bradford War Fund, paid a weekly allowance to the families of Priestleys‚Äô employees who enlisted and, for ten years following the war, continued the allowance to dependants of those of them killed on active service.Leeds Mercury, 26 March 1932. Commercial endeavour It was as a champion of free trade that Priestley stood for national political office, reflecting the dependency of both his constituency and his business on unhindered access to export markets. In trade he recognised the importance of responding promptly to changes in customer taste and of ensuring that advances in product and process compensated for what he saw as inevitable increases in British labour rates. The scale of economic demand in the 20th century presented, he said, challenges which individualism struggled to meet and which required effective combinations of resource and ideas and of capital and labour.‚ÄúPlan for Development of the British Textile Institute‚Äù, Commerce Reports, US Department of Commerce, Washington DC, No. 287 (7 December 1918), p. 914; Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 2 February 1917. His personal knowledge of textile manufacturing technique and markets was comprehensive: he was the inventor of several improvements in production processes, involved himself in all departments of his business, travelled extensively in pursuit of export opportunities and better supply arrangements (the firm‚Äôs wool was largely sourced from Australia)Batley News, 26 May 1888; Leeds Mercury, 28 May 1892; Bolton Evening News, 22 July 1898; Yorkshire Post, 20 May 1925. and was an accomplished promoter of Priestleys‚Äô products. He believed the long-term success of a business involved ‚Äúbuilding up a strong and wealthy community‚Äù, and was reported to have good rapport with and respect among his workforce.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 2 February 1917; Leeds Mercury, 18 November 1927. He was a key figure in the formation of the Textile Institute in 1910, contributed substantially to its Foundation Fund, succeeded Lord Rotherham as its President in 1913, and was made a Fellow of the Institute in 1927.Journal of the Textile Institute Proceedings, Vol. 23, 1932, Issue 4, p. P68; Manchester Courier, 15 September 1913; Leeds Mercury, 11 August 1927. He was senior Vice-President of the Bradford Chamber of Commerce and, in 1916, was elected an Honorary Secretary of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Great Britain.The Argus (Melbourne), 28 January 1925; Yorkshire Post, 22 February 1916. The Priestley Cup In 1904, the year following its formation, the Bradford Cricket League introduced a series of limited-overs matches in which member clubs competed annually for a silver trophy donated by Priestley, who was the League‚Äôs President.Bradford Daily Telegraph, 5 March and 20 August 1904. The competition, intended to raise income for local charities from gate-money, quickly became popular: 5,000 attended its final in 1904, 10,000 in 1913, and 13,300 in 1918 (when the Leeds Mercury described it as ‚Äúthe chief event of the wartime cricket season in Yorkshire‚Äù and suggested the competition had become ‚Äúperhaps the most popular in the country‚Äù).Bradford Daily Telegraph, 20 August 1904; Shipley Times and Express, 22 August 1913; Leeds Mercury, 17 August 1918. In 1913 the League introduced a parallel competition in which the clubs‚Äô second teams played for a silver shield, again donated by Priestley.Yorkshire Post, 31 January 1913. The expense of organising matches consumed an increasing proportion of gate-receipts, but by 1929 more than ¬£8,000 had been donated to charity.Shipley Times and Express, 1 November 1917; Leeds Mercury, 13 April 1929. The Priestley Cup and Priestley Shield continue to be played for, and competition matches have produced many memorable moments including notable performances by nationally famous players. Priestley also donated silver trophies for local association football, rugby and golf competitions and for award at athletics events, produce and livestock shows. All were known as Priestley Cups or Shields.Bradford Daily Telegraph, 20 April 1905; Yorkshire Post, 30 April 1906; Shipley Times and Express, 25 June 1909 and 8 December 1928; Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 18 July 1913; Bradford Observer, 25 August 1941. Other charitable interests He was a Trustee of Bradford Royal Infirmary (he gave ¬£5,000 to its building fund), of the Bradford Tradesmen‚Äôs Home (a complex of almshouses in Manningham), and of other local benevolent institutions.Yorkshire Post, 26 March 1932; Bradford Daily Telegraph, 10 November 1909. He subscribed the funds enabling the Cinderella Club to provide day-excursions for poor widows and entertainments for large numbers of disadvantaged children and, together with his wife, took a particular interest in the children‚Äôs holiday home established by the Club at Hest Bank, Morecambe, which he opened in 1905.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 2 March 1901; Bradford Daily Telegraph, 22 October 1904, 31 July 1905. He was President of the Club from 1918 until his death.Leeds Mercury, 18 April 1932. He was Patron of the Morecambe branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, Chairman of the Institution‚Äôs Bradford Branch and a national Vice-President of the Institution.Shipley Times and Express, 13 July 1929. In 1933, to commemorate what would have been their silver wedding anniversary, his widow had a lifeboat designed and built for the Morecambe and Heysham Fishermen‚Äôs Association; watched by a crowd of 20,000, she launched the vessel in the following year, naming it the Sir William Priestley.Lancashire Evening Post, 3 April 1934. Family, personal life and death In 1883 Priestley married Ruth Craven, fourth of the six daughters of Joseph Craven of Thornton, MP for Shipley.Bradford Daily Telegraph, 18 April 1883. Described as her husband‚Äôs ‚Äúalter ego‚Äù, she came ‚Äúfrom a thoroughbred race of hard-headed people‚Äù and was ‚Äúan ardent Liberal of great intelligence‚Äù.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 18 July 1903. Regularly sharing the political platform with her husband, Ruth Priestley was a confident public speaker and held office in several Bradford societies. The couple, who had two daughters, lived principally at Rosemount House, in Manningham, where during the war years Lady Priestley and a team of helpers ran a hospital supply depot that produced over 250,000 articles (dressing-gowns, pyjamas, surgical bandages, swabs and operation stockings) from fabric donated by Priestley.Shipley Times and Express, 22 August 1919. In 1905 Priestley bought the 1,900-acre Littledale Hall estate, in the Forest of Bowland, on 200 acres of which he ran an experimental farm.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 19 July 1912. He was described as a superior shot, a brilliant billiards player and a very moderate golfer, and was said, like Gladstone, to enjoy chopping down a tree.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 18 July 1903, 14 October 1910. He was a Council member and Vice- President of the Bronte Society - to which he lent his collection of Charlotte‚Äôs pencil drawings and watercolours, together with letters written by her and her father, all exhibited at the opening of the Society‚Äôs first museum at Haworth in 1895.Huddersfield Daily Examiner, 21 January 1896; Bradford Observer, 19 February 1901; Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 25 May 1895. William Scruton‚Äôs Thornton and the Brontes was dedicated to Priestley, who sent copies of the volume to every member of the Society as a Christmas gift in 1898.Yorkshire Evening Post, 24 December 1898. His library at Rosemount included several volumes inscribed by Patrick Bronte, as well as important first editions. He died at Rosemount on 25 March 1932. Following cremation his ashes were scattered on his Littledale estate.Leeds Mercury, 29 March 1932; Yorkshire Post, 30 March 1932. His coat of arms is displayed in the oriel window of the Banqueting Hall of Bradford City Hall.Bradford Weekly Telegraph, 14 October 1910.

It is a large three-story granite structure, whose main block is six bays wide, with a single-story porch extending across its width. A three-story granite wing extends the main block to the right at a recess. The interior follows a central hall plan, with a two-stage staircase in the central hall that has a fine mahogany banister and balustrade. The house was built in 1756 for Captain Nathaniel Shaw, probably with the labor of Acadians who had been brought to New London as refugees from the English Expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia. The house survived the destruction of New London in 1781 during the Battle of Groton Heights in the Revolutionary War. It suffered the loss of a wood-frame wing, which was afterwards rebuilt in stone. The single-story porch across the front was added in the mid-19th century. The house remained in the Shaw family until 1907, when it was acquired by the New London Historical Society.

It is located at Union Street and Broadway, prominently overlooking the city's central business district. Built in 1870-73, when Norwich was still a town, it has served as the seat of municipal government since then. Architecturally it is a prominent statewide example of civic Second Empire architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 (as Norwich Town Hall) for its architecture and history. Description and history Norwich City Hall is located in downtown Norwich, on a parcel bounded on the west by Union Street and on the east by Broadway. It overlooks Union Square, a major public space, and is flanked by other civic buildings, including two churches. Its history dates to 1865 (before the city and town of Norwich were consolidated), when the town of Norwich petitioned the state for permission to construct a single building to house town offices, city offices and Norwich's county court, the latter having been housed in a building recently destroyed by fire. The state authorized the work in 1869. The Norwich architecture firm Burdick & Arnold designed the building (built 1870-73), and the architects Cudworth & Woodworth built an addition (completed 1909),Class of 1884, Harvard College: Twentieth-Fifth Anniversary Report of the Secretary, Cambridge: University Press, June 1909. intended to provide more office space. The building continues to function in all of the roles for which it was originally designed, although the district court functions are now managed by the state. City Hall is an exemplar of the Second Empire style, with a three-story brick facade set on a cut-stone basement, and a full fourth floor tucked under the slate mansard roof. The exterior is richly decorated with Second Empire detail, including a cast-iron entry porch, stone window surrounds and bracketed eaves. The corner tower's mansard-roofed stage is topped by a clock, a belfry, and a conical cap. The interior is embellished with elaborate wood carving and finishes.

Solomon Andrew Layton (July 22, 1864 ‚Äì February 6, 1943) was an American architect who designed over 100 public buildings in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma area and was part of the Layton & Forsyth firm. Layton headed partnerships in Oklahoma from 1902 to 1943; his works included the Canadian County Jail in El Reno, Oklahoma State Capitol, sixteen Oklahoma courthouses, and several buildings on the University of Oklahoma campus. Layton had a considerable influence on Oklahoma City architecture, and he became known as the \\"dean of Oklahoma City architecture\\" Biography Layton was born on July 22, 1864, in Lucas County, Iowa, to Andrew and Jennette Miller Layton. Most of his family was employed in carpentry or building, giving Layton early experience in building. In 1885, Layton married Alice Wood; the couple later had two daughters. Layton began practicing architecture in Denver in 1887; in 1902, he moved to El Reno, Oklahoma and began to design buildings in El Reno - Oklahoma City area, the most notable being the Canadian County Courthouse, and the Canadian County Jail.\\"Canadian County Jail.\\" National Register of Historic Places Inventory- Nomination Form. November 14, 1985. Accessed January 18, 2017. He moved to Oklahoma City in 1907. By 1911, Layton had become a recognized architect in Oklahoma City, and he bid successfully to build the Oklahoma State Capitol. He originally intended the Capitol to have a dome, but due to budgetary constraints, his vision was not realized until a dome was added to the Capitol in 2002. After the Capitol, Layton began designing skyscrapers in downtown Oklahoma City such as the Baum Building, the Medical Arts Building, and the Skirvin Hotel. During this time, Layton also designed buildings at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City University. Layton died on February 6, 1943; he is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery. Architectural work Layton designed over one hundred public buildings in Oklahoma during his career. Twenty-two of his buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, an Oklahoma state record. He designed the neoclassical Oklahoma State Capitol in 1914 and created the original plans to add a dome to the building, a feature which was not installed until 2002. His works also include sixteen courthouses, including Oklahoma City's Oklahoma County Courthouse, and forty- six public schools, including the first five high schools in Oklahoma City. Layton's major projects include the campuses of the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City University. He designed some of the most prominent buildings on the University of Oklahoma campus, including the administration building, Bizzell Memorial Library, and Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. Several of Layton's skyscrapers still remain in Oklahoma City, including the Skirvin Hilton Hotel and the Medical Arts Building, now known as the 100 Park Avenue Building. Layton also designed the since-demolished Halliburton department store, the Patterson and Mercantile Buildings, and the Baum Building, a replica of the Doge's Palace in Venice.

Alteration and expansion  The 1970 National Register of Historic Places nomination states that the building had not been altered with \\"one possible exception of an elevator\\" which seemed to date from the nineteenth century but \\"does not appear in the plans.\\" However, the library added a 15,000 square foot extension in 1974. Further renovations increased the space for administrative offices and collections, concluding in March 2001. The Children's area and meeting rooms also underwent renovations in 2006.

The tavern was originally built in 1738 and owned by Captain Alden. By 1850, it had passed to Alden's descendant, Mr. Wattles. The Alden Tavern is well known for being the site of the horsewhipping of a captive General Richard Prescott, commander of the British troops of Rhode Island, by the tavern's owner Captain Alden when he dined at Alden's tavern. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 and listed under the \\"Event\\" and \\"Information Potential\\" criteria. It was listed as only having fieldstone foundations remaining. A parking lot was paved over the site in 2010, adding 26 paved spaces and 70 spaces in overflow parking on a grass field. It is now known as the Alden Tavern Parking Lot by the town of Lebanon.  Owners  In the American Revolutionary War the tavern was run by Captain Alden. Around 1850, it was owned by Mr. Wattles, a descendant of Captain Alden. The tavern's last owner or date of destruction is unknown, but it was part of the town green by the 1903 publication of Butterworth's book, Brother Jonathan.  Historical significance  The Alden Tavern is well known for being the site of the horsewhipping of a captive General Richard Prescott, commander of the British troops of Rhode Island, by the tavern's owner Captain Alden. Several days after Prescott's capture, he was escorted to General George Washington's headquarters, but on the trip came to dine at Alden's tavern. Several books detail different accounts and portrayals of the exchanges which led to Prescott's whipping, all involving the Prescott being served \\"the common dish of corn and beans\\" and throwing the food on the floor. Three of Benson Lossing's books recount this tale, in The Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution Volume 1 (1852), Our Countrymen (1855) and Lives of Celebrated Americans: Comprising Biographies of Three Hundred and Forty Eminent Persons (1869). It also appears in similar wording in The Boys of '76: A History of the Battles of the Revolution by Charles Coffin in 1876, with Prescott's line being: \\"Do you give me the pigs' feed\\". The story has persisted and a fictional account was referenced in 2010 in Martha Finley's Elsie Yachting with the Raymonds.  Fate  The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 13, 1998, and it was noted that fieldstone foundations remained. It was listed under the \\"Event\\" and \\"Information Potential\\" criteria with a period of significance between 1700-1874. The property is also listed as a contributing property for the Lebanon Green Historic District. The Alden Tavern site is now a parking lot on town-owned property adjacent to Lebanon's Community Center. Prior to the project, a phase 2 archaeological survey had to be completed, a notice for this survey was published in 2003. The town received a Small Town Economic Assistance Program grant for $250,000 to construct the parking lot. Coit Excavating won the contract with the lowest bid of $193,000 and began construction in April 2010 and was expected to be completed by May 31, 2010. The paved parking lot has 26 spots with 70 more for overflow in a grass field. On December 6, 2011, the Selectmen's Meeting the Board dissolved the committee because the project was successfully completed. It is now known as the Alden Tavern Parking Lot.

He was a cabinet minister, and on the Legislative Council. Paterson was born in Edinburgh in 1807. He lived in British Guiana for 14 years and by the early 1850s, he had returned to Edinburgh. He met George Ross, one of Dunedin's first settlers, who had come back to Edinburgh to have a ship built for him. Paterson emigrated to Dunedin on that ship, the Clutha, and reached Dunedin on 12 February 1854. He was a merchant in Dunedin and went into partnership with George Hepburn, and together they bought out the business of James Macandrew. Paterson was first elected onto the Otago Provincial Council for the Town of Dunedin electorate on 2 October 1861 and served for the remainder of the third council, and for all of the fourth council until 10 January 1867. For three separate periods between April 1862 and April 1865, he was a member of the executive council. When Edward McGlashan resigned from the City of Dunedin parliamentary electorate, he contested the resulting May , but was beaten by John Richardson. Richardson himself resigned not long after, and Paterson won the resulting by-election unopposed. He represented the City of Dunedin electorate until the following year (1863), when he in turn also resigned. When the Dunedin and Suburbs South electorate was formed in 1863, Paterson defeated Julius Vogel and represented the electorate until 1866. In 1865, he stood for Mayor of Dunedin, but was beaten by William Mason in this inaugural election. From 1866, he was a member for the City of Dunedin electorate alongside William Hunter Reynolds, until he again resigned in 1869. His popularity came to an end when he spoke in favour of the abolition of provincial governments. He did not stand for election again, and on 17 June 1869, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council by Edward Stafford. He remained a member until 19 August 1884, when he was too ill to remain on the council. In 1859, Paterson married the widow of Thomas Bain; they had no children. He was ill for five years before he died on 29 July 1886 at his home in Regent Road, Dunedin, and was survived by his wife.

The Rotte is the eponym of the city of Rotterdam: the city was founded in the 13th century when a dam was built along the river. Etymology The river was originally named Rotta, from rot, 'muddy' and a 'water', thus 'muddy water'. Geography It rises in Moerkapelle in the so- called Green Heart. It used to drain the Zuidplas lake until it was reclaimed in 1840. It flows past Bleiswijk and Bergschenhoek; and then the village of Hillegersberg, which was built on a sand dune and was one of the few places in the marsh land that could be permanently settled before the dikes were constructed. In the churchyard there are the ruins of a 13th century castle whose origins probably date back to the Roman Empire. Originally it flowed into the Nieuwe Maas in Rotterdam; however, the lower reach of the river was dammed off and the water now flows to the Nieuwe Maas via several man-made canals. The Rotte river no longer joins the Nieuwe Maas directly On the outskirts of Rotterdam, the Rotte merges with the Crooswijksesingel. Here, there is an old factory building of the Heineken brewery, which was brought here in the city due to the efforts of . Inner Rotte The Inner Rotte, that is, the part of the river in the Rotterdam city area, had to give way in 1869-1871 to the construction of the \\"Luchtspoor\\", an elevated section of the railway line. The river water was diverted via the Stokvisverlaat, the Delftse Vaart and Vlasmarktsluis to the . When the Luftwaffe bombed the city in 1940, this connection was also damaged. During the Second World War, city planner created a new connection to Leuvehaven. After the war, the Rotte was no longer used for freight transport. The construction of the East-West line of the Rotterdam Metro interrupted the direct connection between the Rotte and Nieuwe Maas. Since then, the river water flows through an underground channel to the Oostplein. In 1993 the elevated section of the railroad was demolished; trains now use the \\"Willemspoor\\" tunnel. Plans were made to dredge the old river bed and fill it with water. These plans were never implemented. The Inner Rotte is now a wide avenue, where events such as markets can be held. The former dam was situated where today the Inner Rotte crosses the Hoogstraat ('High Street').

Cos Cob Power Station The Spanish Revival style station building of 1907 was significant as part of the first mainline railroad electrification in the United States, using alternating current (AC) electrification. The New York City subway systems and a Hudson River railroad line used lower voltage direct current (DC) electrification, but for longer distances that would mean high transmission losses or frequent and closely spaced substations. A 1903 New York State law prohibited the use of steam locomotives in New York City. The New Haven line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad ran commuter trains into the city, and electrification all the way to New Haven would avoid massive congestion and delays to commuter trains if locomotives were changed at the New York City limits or at Stamford, CT. The \\"New Haven\\" chose AC electrification as proposed by Baldwin- Westinghouse, with locomotives which could operate on the third-rail DC system within city limits, and the AC system on the main line. The plant was built by Westinghouse in 1907 in Mission Style, and was located where the Mianus River empties into the Cos Cob Harbor of Long Island Sound. The plant used coal- fired steam turbines, and the three-phase alternators supplied single-phase power at 11 kV 25 Hz directly to the catenary. They also supplied power to the New York Central's Port Morris generating station to compensate the NYC for power consumed by New Haven trains on the NYC's third-rail supplied line to the Grand Central Terminal within the city limits. The station was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1982 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The power station was decommissioned in 1986-87. and The plant was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, but despite the listing and local and national debate, the plant was demolished in 2001. Part of the site is now a public park, and a plaque commemorating the plant is located at the nearby Cos Cob Railroad Station.

The mansion belonged to a U.S. Steel executive. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History In 1910, James A.

The Palace of the Marquis del Apartado is a historic residence located in Mexico City, just to the northeast of the city's Zocalo (main plaza) in the Historic center of Mexico City. It was built between 1795 and 1805 over one of the pyramids of the Aztec sacred precinct in Tenochtitlan. The residence was initially built for the main minter of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and the third floor was prepared to become the residence of Spanish king Ferdinand VII. However, the king never came to colonial Mexico. Today, the palace houses the main headquarters of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH). History During the Aztec Empire, the land on which this building is located was part of the teocalli, or sacred precinct of Tenochtitlan. The building sits on the remains of the pyramid dedicated to the goddess Cihuac√≥atl, the sister of Huitzilopochtli. The base of this pyramid was found in 1910, and a 1.5 ton sculpture of an eagle from this period was discovered in 1985. After the conquest, the site was part of land granted to the Acevedo family. This grant extended to what are now the streets of Rep. de Guatemala, Rep. de Argentina, Donceles and Rep. de Brasil. Over time, however, this grant was split up and parts sold to other owners. The site of the current palace was sold to Francisco de Fagoaga y Ar√≥squeta, who was in charge of minting and the collection of the king's share of precious metals mined in Mexico. Fagoaga commissioned architect Manuel Tols√°, who built a number of other structures in the city to design, to build this palace between 1795 and 1805. Tolsa designed the building similarly to the Palacio de Miner√≠a, which he designed, and included workshops for smelting metals and a chapel. In the first decade of the 19th century, the topmost floor was remodeled and prepared to become the residence of Fernando VII of Spain. However, the Spanish king never occupied the palace as he abdicated in 1808 and became the prisoner of Napoleon. After Mexican Independence in the early 19th century, the palace was owned by several wealthy families, who used it as an official residence. The lower part of the house was rented to businesses while the families lived on the upper two floors. Over time, the building has been remodeled several times. In 1901, the main courtyard and corridors were covered with an iron and glass translucent roof. From 1901 to 1908, it housed a major collection of works from the French Enlightenment as well as an extensive collection of fine arts. The latter eventually became part of the collection of the Academy of San Carlos. After the Mexican Revolution, it became government property, and it was remodeled to become the seat of the Secretaria de Justicia e Instrucci√≥n P√∫blica. In 1962, architect Jorge L. Medell√≠n and engineer Manuel M. Haro it was remodeled again, modernizing its electrical system and pipes. Since it became government property in the early 20th century, the building has housed a number of government agencies. Initially it was the home of the Secretaria de Justicia e Instituci√≥n P√∫blica. After that, it housed the Secretar√≠a de Fomento and Secretar√≠a de Comercio y Trabajo from 1917 to 1934, the Secretar√≠a de la Econom√≠a in 1947, the Secretar√≠a de Industria y Comercio from 1959 to 1961 and the Compa√±√≠a Nacional de Subsistencias Populares until the early 21st century. In 1989, cracks, fissures and other damage were detected from the building's tilt towards the nearby Metro Station. Initial efforts to correct the damage were undertaken in 1990-1994. Starting in 1995, a hydraulic system to inject and extract water into and from the subsoil was developed, buried forty meters under the building. Much of the building's sinking is due to dropping water tables underneath Mexico City because of the overpumping of groundwater for drinking. The hydraulic system is designed to artificially maintain water pressure under the building to keep it from sinking. Since 2005, it has been with the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, which uses it as its main headquarters and has restored much of its decorative work. Description The building covers an area of 3000 m¬≤, with 60 rooms such as halls, dining rooms, kitchens etc. It has two courtyards, with a fountain in the main one. The other courtyard functioned as a stable in the 19th century. This building is similar to Tolsa's Palacio de la Mineria in that both have two facades. The main facade is on Argentina and continues around the corner onto Donceles. The main facade is split into three sections. The middle section, where the main entrance is, stands out slightly from the other two. Except for this entrance, the ground floor is relatively free of decoration as it was of lesser importance than the two upper floors. The exception is the main entrance, which is decorated with a pediment placed over four Doric columns. The other floors are decorated with quarried stone pilasters and columns to frame the windows and balconies. Under the stairs that lead onto the main patio, pre-Hispanic ruins are visible. Archeological work has been done here since 1985, when restoration work uncovered a large Aztec-era stone sculpture of an eagle in the foundation of the building, where the remains of the pre-Hispanic temple are. The piece was excavated and preserved by archeologist Elsa Hern√°ndez Pons of INAH. It is considered unique as it is the only one that has been preserved in situ. The eagle is in a seated position and measures 1.39 meters long, 0.82 meters wide and 0.72 meters tall. It weighs approximately 1.5 tons. The eagle is sculpted in a realistic manner, with details such as feathers of different sizes in relief. It was painted in various colors such as ochre, orange and red. Elements of the sculpture, such as the right side of the face, are missing.

Piano, chamber music and songs As a professional pianist, Poulenc wrote many pieces for his own instrument. He was a prolific writer of works of chamber music, often with piano, and some works for two pianos. Poulenc composed many songs (m√©lodies), most of them accompanied by piano, but some also in versions with a small instrumental ensembles, for example his Rapsodie n√®gre for baritone, flute, clarinet, string quartet and piano. He composed easily for woodwind instruments, scoring for example a piano trio with oboe and bassoon instead of the traditional violin and cello. Poulenc was less familiar with string instruments. The cellist Pierre Fournier helped him to write the Cello Sonata, which he premiered with the composer as the pianist. Poulenc destroyed all sketches for string quartets and three for violin sonatas, while only the fourth one survived, but was received critically. Orchestra and stage Among his works with orchestra are three operas, two ballet, incidental music for plays, film music and concertos, some with unusual solo instruments such as harpsichord and organ. The harpsichordist Wanda Landowska inspired the composition of the Concert champ√™tre. Collaboration in the group Les Six Poulenc was a member of the group of composers Les Six, with Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and Germaine Tailleferre, and contributed to their collective productions, which included another ballet. Sacred music and choral music Poulenc turned to writing also religious music in the 1930s, composing a Mass in G major for a cappella choir. He composed the Stabat Mater in 1950 in memory of the painter Christian B√©rard in 1950. The late Gloria for soprano, choir and orchestra became one of his best-known works. He drew inspiration for his sacred compositions mostly from liturgical texts. Songs For his songs and song cycles, he often collaborated with contemporary poets, setting poems by writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Louis Aragon, Paul √âluard, Max Jacob, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, and Louise de Vilmorin, whom he mentioned in titles. He further set poems by Louis Aragon, Th√©odore de Banville, Maurice Car√™me, Colette, Robert Desnos, Maurice Fombeure, Marie Laurencin, Madeleine Ley, Fran√ßois de Malherbe, Ronsard, Jean Mor√©as, Jean Nohain and Paul Val√©ry, among others. In 1943, during the occupation of France, a cantata Figure humaine on poems by √âluard which celebrate Libert√©. List of works by FP number The Music of Francis Poulenc (1899‚Äì1963): A Catalogue, abbreviated FP, is a chronological catalogue of Francis Poulenc's works which was published by Carl B. Schmidt in 1995. Schmidt provides for each known composition, which includes unfinished, unpublished and lost works, a detailed history of composition and performance, and lists manuscripts and publications. In the table, the works are initially listed by the FP number. Other information given is the French title, a translation if commonly used, the key, the scoring if not clear from the title, the year(s) of composition, the genre, text information, notes and a free score when available, and the page number in the catalogue. Abbreviations used are \\"rev.\\" for \\"revised\\", \\"orch.\\" for \\"orchestration\\", arr. for \\"arrangement\\" and \\"sc.\\" for \\"score\\". In Genre, instrumental pieces are distinguished as orchestral and chamber music, particularly that for piano. The group of stage works contains operas, ballets and incidental music, while film scores are marked separately. Sacred and secular music for voice is divided in choral, for cantatas and motets, and vocal, holding songs and song cycles. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align: left\\" !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 10px;\\" class=sortableFP !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 10px;\\" class=sortableYear !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 270px;\\" class=sortableTitle !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 10px;\\" class=sortableGenre !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 150px;\\" class=sortableScoring !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 150px;\\" class=sortableText !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 20px;\\" class=sortableNotes -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 1 1914 Processional pour la cr√©mation d'un mandarin piano   destroyed or lost p. 11 -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 2 1916 Pr√©ludes piano   destroyed -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 3 1917, (rev. 1933) Rapsodie n√®gre vocal  Makoko Kangourou (Marcel Prouille and Charles Mouli√©) sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 4 1917 Scherzo for two pianos Z√®bre piano   destroyed or lost (fragment) -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 5 1918 Trois Pastorales piano    -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 6 1918 Po√®me s√©n√©galais vocal   destroyed or lost -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 7 1919 Sonata for two clarinets chamber   dedicated to √âdouard Souberbielle ¬∑ sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 7b 1925 Sonata piano   piano version of FP 7 -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 8 1918, (rev. 1939) Sonata for piano 4 hands piano   dedicated to Simone Tilliard ¬∑ sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 9 1918 Pr√©lude-Percussion genre percussion  destroyed or lost -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 10 1918 Le Jongleur piano   destroyed or lost -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 11 1918, (rev. 1932) Tor√©ador chanson hispano-italienne vocal  Jean Cocteau sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 12 1918 Violin Sonata chamber   destroyed or lost -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 13 1918 Sonata for piano trio chamber   destroyed or lost -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 14a 1918, (rev. 1939, 1962) Trois mouvements perp√©tuels piano   sc. ¬∑ p. 32 -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 14b 1925, (rev. 1939, 1962) Trois mouvements perp√©tuels chamber   arr. of FP 14a -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 15a 1919 Le Bestiaire (ou Cort√®ge d‚ÄôOrph√©e) vocal  Guillaume Apollinaire sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 15b 1922 Le Bestiaire (ou Cort√®ge d‚ÄôOrph√©e) vocal   arr. of FP 15a -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 16a 1919 Cocardes vocal  Cocteau dedicated to Auric ¬∑ sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 16b 1939 Cocardes vocal   arr. of FP 16a -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 17a 1919 Valse in C piano   part of L'Album des Six ¬∑ sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 17b 1932 Valse in C orchestral   orch. of FP 17a -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 18 1919 Quadrille for piano 4 hands piano   lost or destroyed -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 19 1920, (rev. 1926) Piano Suite piano   sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 20a 1920-1 Le Gendarme incompris stage (opera)  Cocteau and Raymond Radiguet lyric comedy in one act -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 20b 1921 Le Gendarme incompris (suite) chamber   sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 21 1920-1 5 Impromptus piano   sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 22 1921 Quatre po√®mes de Max Jacob vocal  Max Jacob dedicated to Darius Milhaud -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 23/1 1921 La baigneuse de Trouville (Carte Postale en couleurs) stage (ballet) orchestra  part of the collaborative Les mari√©s de la tour Eiffel, ballet by Cocteau -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 23/2 1921 Le discours du G√©n√©ra stage (ballet) orchestra  part of the collaborative Les mari√©s de la tour Eiffel, ballet by Cocteau -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 24 1921, (rev. 1952) Promenades piano   sc. -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 25 1921 Esquisse pour une fanfare orchestral   sc., overture for Act V of Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 26 1921 3 Etudes for pianola piano   lost or destroyed -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 27 1921 Premi√®re suite d'orchestre orchestral   lost or destroyed -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 28 1921 String Quartet no. 1 chamber   lost or destroyed -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 29 1921 Trio for piano, clarinet and cello chamber   lost or destroyed -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 30 1921 Military marches for piano and orchestra orchestral   lost or destroyed (fragments) -style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" 31 1922 Chanson √† boire choral men's choir anonymous texts of the 17th century, English by J.V.

Radio work=Romantica After starting out as a hospital radio presenter, Torrington joined Birmingham's BRMB in the 1980s to cover an overnight programme for Steve Dennis. He was with the station for several years during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and through most of his tenure there presented a late night programme of love songs called Romantica. The show had previously been hosted by Charley Neal, who went on to become a weather presenter at Central Television. Torrington presented the programme on Saturdays for a while after Neal, but moved to host the station's lunchtime show in 1989, as well as a Sunday morning programme. Romantica was presented by Nick Hennigan for a while, but the show was relaunched with Torrington in 1990 and aired on Sunday evenings. Romantica used an instrumental version of Luther Vandross's Any Love as its opening theme tune. Torrington continued his weekday presenting, moving to the Drivetime show, then in 1992 he started hosting a late night show from Mondays to Thursdays. This programme contained a love songs strand titled The Love Zone. Torrington left the station in 1993 after its acquisition by the Capital Radio Group when he and several other presenters were axed by incoming managing director Richard Park. He moved to Buzz FM, taking Romantica with him, and he was made the station's Programme Controller. He later launched Kix 96 in Coventry. Late Night Love The majority of Torrington's radio career has been within the commercial radio industry. Presenting on stations such as 96.4FM BRMB and more recently on Global Radio (formerly GCap Media's) The One Network where Torrington presented the nightly relationship show, Graham Torrington's Late Night Love for 12 years. The show regularly attracted more than 1 million listeners across the UK on 41 radio stations and earnt Torrington a Sony Radio Academy Award and the award for \\"Best Talk Show Host\\" at the New York Radio Festival Awards in 2008. Following Torrington's move to the BBC, fans of Late Night Love campaigned for him to return to late night radio, which prompted Torrington to start producing a weekly podcast version of the show. Late Night Love made a brief return to radio in 2012 when Torrington joined Smooth Radio to present the programme on Sunday evenings. The programme began in January 2012 and aired for three months. The show is now broadcast on Berkshire and North Hampshire‚Äôs Glow Radio BBC Radio  Torrington joined BBC Radio Bristol in 2008, and hosted the mid-morning talk-based radio programme on BBC Radio Bristol from 2009 to 2011.

The show was broadcast across seven BBC radio stations BBC Devon, BBC Cornwall, BBC Bristol, BBC Somerset, BBC Wiltshire, BBC Gloucestershire, BBC Jersey and BBC Guernsey between 10pm and 1am on Saturday and Sunday nights. Following his time with Smooth Radio in early 2012 Torrington joined Birmingham's BBC WM as a presenter, hosting a late night weekday programme of music and conversation from 16 April 2012. He also returned to BBC Devon to present Graham Torrington's Late Night Love Songs, a programme syndicated to stations across the West Country on Saturday and Sunday evenings.
