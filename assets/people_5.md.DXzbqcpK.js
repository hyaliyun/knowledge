The vessel was constructed in America in 1764, but was captured by the British in the American War of Independence, and operated as both a whaler and a general cargo ship until 1888, when she was broken up.  Description  Illustration of the Truelove from The Illustrated London News 1870 Truelove was a full rigged ship, with three masts and square rig. She was constructed with a \\"tumble home\\" design, with her hull sides (topsides) sloping inwards to the upper decks from the water line. Her topsides were constructed with planks overlapping in such a way as to allow water to drain freely from the upper decks. The ship's usual maximum speed was . While operating as a merchant ship, she was fitted with twelve guns for defence against French attack. The Truelove is commemorated with a sculpture in Hull by Stefan Gec.  Service history  Truelove was launched in Philadelphia in 1764. The vessel was captured by the British during the American War of Independence, when she operated as an American privateer, and was bought by a shipowner for use as a cargo ship in the wine trade to Oporto. After a refit in 1784, which involved strengthening the vessel's hull, she began work as a whaler in the Arctic, based at Hull, although she was occasionally used for other cargo. In 1849, the ship carried relief supplies in support of Franklin's lost expedition, during which time she was threatened with sinking several times due to pack ice, including one instance when she was trapped for six weeks in Melville Bay. Notable whaling captains of the Truelove included John Parker, William Barron, and William Wells (1854-1860 & 1866-67) The vessel retired from whaling in 1868, having completed 72 voyages. After this time, she was still capable of being used as a general cargo ship. She was eventually broken up, probably around 1888, after 124 years of near continuous service. Robert E.

In seminal papers that advanced strong methodological positions and set an agenda for subsequent research, Clower formalized and reformulated: * Keynesian theory as disequilibrium analysis in contrast to standard general equilibrium theory, thereby generalizing (or rejecting) Walras' law and standard price theory. To this end, he proposed the 'dual- decision hypothesis' in which realized transaction quantities affect adjustments in output at other than full-employment equilibrium but not at full-employment equilibrium. This, he argued, was implicit in Keynes's work to explain how full-employment equilibrium is only a special case. Such quantity constraints introduce nonlinearities that complicate dynamic stability of the economic system as to full-employment equilibrium and require a distinction between notional and effective demand.‚Ä¢ Robert W.

Built in 1875 and 1877, the two buildings are among the finest examples of the architecture of that period in the city, with one sporting one of the city's only surviving cast iron facades. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Imperial Granum- Joseph Parker Buildings are located one block east of the New Haven Green in downtown New Haven, on the east side of the corner of Elm and Orange Streets. Both buildings are four stories in height, and of masonry construction, with heavily bracketed projecting cornices at the roof line. The Parker Building, which stands at the corner, is built out of red brick. Its ground floor facade is a modern stylistic copy of the Imperial Granum Building, with paneled pilasters at the outer ends, and engaged round columns separating the window and door bays. It has one storefront, with three display windows and a double- door entrance. The main building entrance, which now serves both buildings is located to its right. The upper level windows are set in rectangular openings with peaked stone lintels. The Orange Street facade has similar upper-floor windows, with mostly blinded window bays and a secondary entrance on the ground floor. The Imperial Granum building is slightly narrower, sharing a full party wall with the Parker Building. It is three bays wide, with a single storefront on the ground floor. The upper level windows have more elaborate surrounds, with engaged columns between windows set in segmented-arch openings, pilasters at the ends, and shallow dentillated cornices between the floors. and The Parker Building was built in 1875, and the Imperial Granum in 1877. Both have been attributed to architects working in the office of Henry Austin: the Parker by David R. Brown, and the Imperial Granum by Rufus G. Russel. The latter is noted as having the city's only surviving ground-floor cast iron facade, a feature that was never popular in the city and existed only in small numbers. The Parker Building was built for a paper manufacturer, who used the upper floors as a warehouse. The Imperial Granum gets is name from a patent medicine marketed by its owner, Edward Heaton, and for many years sported an advertisement of that product on its exposed southeastern wall. The buildings came under one owner in 1945, and were joined in their upper floors by breaking through the party wall, and also building a shared, interior staircase. For many years, a hatshop named Del Monico's occupied the ground floor.

Built in 1924, it is the only known survivor in the state of the Little Theatre Movement of 1911-1933. and The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. After a major rehabilitation in the 2010s, the theater was reopened, and is now known as the ACES Little Theatre. Description and history The Lincoln Theatre is located on a densely built residential block on Lincoln Street, a short dead end off Trumbull Street, about three blocks north of the New Haven Green. It is a multipart construction, with a gable-roofed entry and auditorium at its north end, with rear sections devoted to the backstage and dressing room areas. A modern glass-and-stone addition extends to the left side of the original building. The theater was built in 1924, and was the only purpose built theater constructed in the state by one of a dozen or so Little Theatre Movement organizations in the state. It was in active use by that organization until 1935, mainly under the creative auspices of Jack Crawford, an English professor at Yale University. In 1935 it was taken over by the Federal Theater Project, a Works Progress Administration program supporting the creative arts, which ended in 1939. It was used for commercial theatrical productions until 1945, when it was converted into a film theater, showing foreign and art films. It closed in 1982. In 1986, the building was acquired by Area Cooperative Educational Services (ACES), a local educational organization. It was used mainly for its events (private and occasionally public) until 2012, when it underwent a major rehabilitation and upgrade, which preserved elements of its Art Deco interior.

It is one of East Harlem‚Äôs largest social service agencies and serves more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations, through programs including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers' market, community development, and neighborhood cultural events. History File:Staff of Union Settlement.jpgalt=Headworker Gaylord Starin White and the staff of Union Settlement in 1912.Headworker Gaylord Starin White (far left) and the staff of Union Settlement in 1912. Union Settlement was founded in 1895 by members of the Union Theological Seminary Alumni Club. After visiting Toynbee Hall in London, and inspired by the example of Hull House in Chicago, the alumni decided to create a settlement house in the area of Manhattan enclosed on the north and south by East 96th and 110th Streets and on the east and west by the East River and Central Park. Known as East Harlem, it was a neighborhood filled with new tenements but devoid of any civic services. The ethos of the settlement house movement called for its workers to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù in such neighborhoods in order to learn first-hand the problems of the residents. ‚ÄúIt seemed to us that, as early settlers, we had a chance to grow up with the community and affect its development,‚Äù wrote William Adams Brown, Theology Professor, Union Theological Society (1892‚Äì1930) and President, Union Settlement Association (1915‚Äì1919).A Teacher and His Times, William Adams Brown, Scribner, 1940. With millions of immigrants arriving in the Union States in the late 19th century as the two elevated subway lines were completed, East Harlem quickly equaled the Lower East Side as Manhattan‚Äôs predominantly immigrant community. Until the 1920s, it was New York‚Äôs true \\"Little Italy,\\" claiming the largest population of Italians outside of Italy.Thomas Kessner, The Golden Door: Italian and Jewish Immigrant Mobility in New York City, 1880-1915, Oxford University Press, 1977. The neighborhood had a progressive, reformist commitment: Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia lived in East Harlem, spoke often at Union Settlement, and personified the political activism of the area. Union Settlement‚Äôs work has helped tens of thousands of children, youth and adults, many of whom have gone on to become leaders in the community and beyond, including New York Secretary of State Lorraine Cortes- Vazquez and City Council Member Robert Jackson. Hollywood movie star Burt Lancaster played sports, acted in theater productions and learned circus arts at Union Settlement as a boy. He credited Union Settlement for \\"saving him from the streets,\\" and supported the organization all his life. In 1895 Union Settlement opened at 202 E. 96th Street, on the second floor of a tenement building. Union Theological Seminary student William E. McCord was appointed its first \\"headworker\\" (as its directors were known). It moved twice in 1895 (210 E. 104th Street and 237 E. 104th Street). In 1899, Morris K. Jesup purchased five houses (235-243 E. 104th Street) for the Settlement. In 1901, McCord resigned as headworker and Gaylord S. White replaced him, serving in that position for 22 years. In 1917, Union Settlement established three campgrounds in Palisades Interstate Park: Camp Nathan Hale for boys, Camp Gaylord White for girls and Camp Ellen Marvin for mothers and young children. The camps exposed tens of thousands of inner-city youngsters, from 1917 to the 1960s, to the natural world. In 1932, The New York Committee of the American Birth Control League opened a Birth Control Clinic at Union Settlement. The clinic is one of the first in the city and in East Harlem. In 1957, Union Settlement Federal Credit Union opened its doors for business. The credit union is a financial cooperative where members pool their assets and lend money to each other at low interest rates. In 1961, a $1 million Astor Foundation grant enabled Union Settlement and six other settlement houses to implement the Pre-Teen Delinquency Prevention Project. In 1965, Union Settlement became the site of one of the country's first Head Start Programs, the federally sponsored preschool initiative launched as one of the Great Society undertakings. In 1974, Settlement Health and Medical Services, part of a federal initiative, provided primary health care to East Harlem residents in a free-standing clinic. The program is separately incorporated in 1976. In 1992, Union Settlement was selected to serve as the lead agency of the East Harlem HIV Care Network, a coalition of over 100 social and health service agencies that address issues of AIDS. Network members serve people who are HIV positive or are living with HIV/AIDS, and their relatives and partners Programs * Early Childhood Services: six childcare/Head Start centers and Family Childcare Network, pediatric asthma initiative, serving one-sixth of all childcare services in East Harlem. * Youth Services: after-school and summer programs, computer classes, tutoring, sexual literacy, college readiness program, dance, theater, healthy living, counseling, workforce development (includes Rising Stars Program and Bridges) * Adult Education: Basic Education in Spanish and English, English for Speakers of Other Languages, Civics, GED preparation, citizenship and computer classes, Writing Through Reading Program, home health aide training program * Senior Services: five senior centers, Meals on Wheels, senior volunteer program, transportation program, senior fitness program * Mental Health: individual, group and family counseling and psychotherapy, crisis intervention, Children‚Äôs Blended Case Management, geriatric mental health services * AIDS/HIV Services: Manhattan HIV Care Network, HIV Counseling Program, training and workshops, community forums, Annual East Harlem AIDS Walk & Health Fair, participation in the National Latino AIDS Awareness Day Community events * Annual Day of the Dead Festival ‚Äì Each year, Union Settlement hosts a popular Dia de Los Muertos celebration featuring artists, and musicians.

General Andrei Vasilyevich Khrulyov () (, village of Bolshaya Alexandrovka, Saint Petersburg Governorate - June 9, 1962, Moscow) was a Soviet military commander. Early life Andrey Khrulyov was born in the village of Bolshaya Aleksandrovka, the son of Vasily Vasilyevich Khrulev, a blacksmith‚Äôs striker, and Maria Ivanovna, a peasant. He apprenticed to a goldsmith (1903‚Äì1912). At some point, he became a revolutionary, for which he was exiled to Estonia (1912‚Äì1914). Career Joining the Red Army in 1918 during the Russian Civil War, Khrulyov first served first in Petrograd, and during 1919‚Äì1921 as a political commissar in the 11th cavalry division of Budenny's First Cavalry Army. After the war, he remained in military service, and began developing a more sophisticated logistical system for the Red Army, which became the Rear of the Russian Armed Forces. Khrulev was Head of Main Intendant Directorate of the Red Army (1939-1941), deputy chief of People‚Äôs Commissar of Defence of the USSR and Head of Main Directorate of the Rear Services of the Red Army (from 1941). From 1942‚Äì1943 he served as People's Commissariat for Railways. A plaque in honor of General Andrey Khrulyov on Tverskaya Street in Moscow. At his death in 1962, a group of marshals pressed the Politburo to bury Khrulyov in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Normally, generals of his rank (Army General) were not entitled to this honor; Nikita Khrushchev was known to dislike Khrulyov and suggested burying him at the Novodevichy Cemetery. The military prevailed, and Khrulyov's ashes were buried on Red Square.

Built in 1883, it is a good example of Queen Anne architecture as applied to school buildings, and was the city's first teacher training school. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The building now houses a substance abuse clinic. Description and history The former Welch Training School building is located west of downtown New Haven, at the northwest corner of Congress and Vernon Streets in The Hill neighborhood. It is a 3-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick with stone trim, and covered by a slate mansard roof. Gabled dormers of varying styles and configurations adorn the roof faces, and a four-story gabled entry section projects at the center of the main facade. Windows are set in rectangular openings with sandstone sills and lintels, and sandstone stringcourses give horizontal emphasis to the design. and The school, completed in 1883, was designed by Leoni W. Robinson and is a good local example of Queen Anne architecture. It was named for Harmonus Welch, the city's first president of the board of education, and later also Mayor of New Haven. The school was designed to provide a space where new teachers could be trained, in order to address a shortage of qualified teachers in the city's school system. In its early programs, trainee teachers were paired with other teachers to learn teaching methods, before being sent for further hands-on training to other schools. The school's function for teacher training was ended in 1893, when the Skinner School opened as a proper normal school, and this one then became a regular elementary school. It was closed in the mid-1970s.

The diameter of these holes can be as small as 0.002‚Äù (~50 Œºm). If larger holes are required, the laser is moved around the circumference of the ‚Äúpopped‚Äù hole until the desired diameter is created; this technique is called ‚Äútrepanning‚Äù. Applications Laser drilling is one of the few techniques for producing high-aspect-ratio holes‚Äîholes with a depth- to-diameter ratio much greater than 10:1. Laser-drilled high-aspect-ratio holes are used in many applications, including the oil gallery of some engine blocks, aerospace turbine-engine cooling holes, laser fusion components, and printed circuit board micro-vias. Manufacturers of turbine engines for aircraft propulsion and for power generation have benefited from the productivity of lasers for drilling small (0.3‚Äì1 mm diameter typical) cylindrical holes at 15‚Äì90¬∞ to the surface in cast, sheet metal and machined components. Their ability to drill holes at shallow angles to the surface at rates of between 0.3 and 3 holes per second has enabled new designs incorporating film-cooling holes for improved fuel efficiency, reduced noise, and lower NOx and CO emissions. Incremental improvements in laser process and control technologies have led to substantial increases in the number of cooling holes used in turbine engines. Fundamental to these improvements and increased use of laser drilled holes is an understanding of the relationship between process parameters and hole quality and drilling speed. Theory Following is a summary of technical insights about the laser drilling process and the relationship between process parameters and hole quality and drilling speed. Physical phenomena Laser drilling of cylindrical holes generally occurs through melting and vaporization (also referred to as \\"ablation\\") of the workpiece material through absorption of energy from a focused laser beam. The energy required to remove material by melting is about 25% of that needed to vaporize the same volume, so a process that removes material by melting is often favored. Whether melting or vaporization is more dominant in a laser drilling process depends on many factors, with laser pulse duration and energy playing an important role. Generally speaking, ablation dominates when a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is used. On the other hand, melt expulsion, the means by which a hole is created through melting the material, dominates when a flashtube pumped Nd:YAG laser is used. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser normally has pulse duration in the order of nanoseconds, peak power on the order of ten to hundreds of MW/cm2, and a material removal rate of a few micrometers per pulse. A flash lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser normally has a pulse duration on the order of hundreds of microseconds to a millisecond, peak power in the order of sub MW/cm2, and material removal rate of ten to hundreds of micrometers per pulse. For machining processes by each laser, ablation and melt expulsion typically coexist. Melt expulsion arises as a result of the rapid build-up of gas pressure (recoil force) within a cavity created by evaporation. For melt expulsion to occur, a molten layer must form and the pressure gradients acting on the surface due to vaporization must be sufficiently large to overcome surface tension forces and expel the molten material from the hole. The \\"best of both worlds\\" is a single system capable of both \\"fine\\" and \\"coarse\\" melt expulsion. \\"Fine\\" melt expulsion produces features with excellent wall definition and small heat-affected zone while \\"coarse\\" melt expulsion, such as used in percussion drilling and trepanning, removes material quickly. The recoil force is a strong function of the peak temperature. The value of Tcr for which the recoil and surface tension forces are equal is the critical temperature for liquid expulsion. For instance, liquid expulsion from titanium can take place when the temperature at the center of the hole exceeds 3780 K. In early work (K√∂rner, et al., 1996), the proportion of material removed by melt expulsion was found to increase as intensity increased. More recent work (Voisey, et al., 2000) shows that the fraction of the material removed by melt expulsion, referred to as melt ejection fraction (MEF), drops when laser energy further increases. The initial increase in melt expulsion on raising the beam power has been tentatively attributed to an increase in the pressure and pressure gradient generated within the hole by vaporization. A better finish can be achieved if the melt is ejected in fine droplets. Generally speaking, droplet size decreases with increasing pulse intensity. This is due to the increased vaporization rate and thus a thinner molten layer. For the longer pulse duration, the greater total energy input helps form a thicker molten layer and results in the expulsion of correspondingly larger droplets. Previous models Chan and Mazumder (1987) developed a 1-D steady state model to incorporate liquid expulsion consideration but the 1-D assumption is not suited for high aspect ratio hole drilling and the drilling process is transient. Kar and Mazumder (1990) extended the model to 2-D, but melt expulsion was not explicitly considered. A more rigorous treatment of melt expulsion has been presented by Ganesh, et al. (1997), which is a 2-D transient generalized model to incorporate solid, fluid, temperature, and pressure during laser drilling, but it is computationally demanding. Yao, et al. (2001) developed a 2-D transient model, in which a Knudsen layer is considered at the melt-vapor front, and the model is suited for shorter pulse and high peak power laser ablation. =Laser energy absorption and melt-vapor front= At the melt-vapor front, the Stefan boundary condition is normally applied to describe the laser energy absorption (Kar and Mazumda, 1990; Yao, et al., 2001). :I_{abs} + k \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial z} + r \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial r} \\\\right) + \\\\rho_l u_i L_v - \\\\rho_v u_v (c_p T_i + E_v) = 0 (1) where I_{abs} = I(t)^{-\\\\beta z} is the absorbed laser intensity, Œ≤ is the laser absorption coefficient depending on laser wavelength and target material, and I(t) describes temporal input laser intensity including pulse width, repetition rate, and pulse temporal shape. k is the heat conductivity, T is the temperature, z and r are distances along axial and radial directions, p is density, v the velocity, Lv the latent heat of vaporization. The subscripts l, v and i denote liquid phase, vapor phase and vapor-liquid interface, respectively. If the laser intensity is high and pulse duration is short, the so-called Knudsen layer is assumed to exist at the melt-vapor front where the state variables undergo discontinuous changes across the layer. By considering the discontinuity across the Knudsen layer, Yao, et al. (2001) simulated the surface recess velocity Vv distribution, along the radial direction at different times, which indicates the material ablation rate is changing significantly across the Knudsen layer. =Melt expulsion= After obtaining the vapor pressure pv, the melt layer flow and melt expulsion can be modeled using hydrodynamic equations (Ganesh et al.,1997). Melt expulsion occurs when the vapor pressure is applied on the liquid free surface which in turn pushes the melt away in the radial direction. In order to achieve fine melt expulsion, the melt flow pattern needs to be predicted very precisely, especially the melt flow velocity at the hole's edge. Thus, a 2-D axisymmetric transient model is used and accordingly the momentum and continuity equations used. Ganesh's model for melt ejection is comprehensive and can be used for different stages of the hole drilling process. However, the calculation is very time consuming and Solana, et al. (2001), presented a simplified time dependent model that assumes that the melt expulsion velocity is only along the hole wall, and can give results with a minimum computational effort. The liquid will move upwards with velocity u as a consequence of the pressure gradient along the vertical walls, which is given in turn by the difference between the ablation pressure and the surface tension divided by the penetration depth x. Assuming that the drilling front is moving at a constant velocity, the following linear equation of liquid motion on the vertical wall is a good approximation to model the melt expulsion after the initial stage of drilling. :\\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(r,t)}{\\\\partial t} = P(t) + \\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u(r,t)}{\\\\partial r^2} (2) where p is the melt density, Œº is the viscosity of the liquid, P(t)=(ŒîP(t)/x(t)) is the pressure gradient along the liquid layer, ŒîP(t) is the difference between the vapor pressure Pv and the surface tension 2 \\\\sigma \\\\over \\\\bar{\\\\delta}. Pulse shape effect Roos (1980) showed that a 200 ¬µs train consisting of 0.5 ¬µs pulses produced superior results for drilling metals than a 200 ¬µs flat shaped pulse. Anisimov, et al. (1984) discovered that process efficiency improved by accelerating the melt during the pulse. Grad and Mozina (1998) further demonstrated the effect of pulse shapes. A 12 ns spike was added at the beginning, middle, and the end of a 5 ms pulse. When the 12 ns spike was added to the beginning of the long laser pulse, where no melt had been produced, no significant effect on removal was observed. On the other hand, when the spike was added at the middle and the end of the long pulse, the improvement of the drilling efficiency was 80 and 90%, respectively. The effect of inter-pulse shaping has also been investigated. Low and Li (2001) showed that a pulse train of linearly increasing magnitude had a significant effect on expulsion processes. Forsman, et al. (2007) demonstrated that a double pulse stream produced increased drilling and cutting rates with significantly cleaner holes. Conclusion Manufacturers are applying results of process modeling and experimental methods to better understand and control the laser drilling process. The result is higher quality and more productive processes that in turn lead to better end products such as more fuel efficient and cleaner aircraft and power generating turbine engines.

SARAL performs altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation. The payloads of SARAL are The ISRO built satellite with payloads modules (ALTIKA altimeter), DORIS, Laser Retro- reflector Array (LRA) and ARGOS-3 (Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite) data collection system provided by CNES was launched by Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket into the Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). ISRO is responsible for the platform, launch, and operations of the spacecraft. A CNES/ISRO MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) on the SARAL mission was signed on Feb. 23, 2007. SARAL was successfully launched on 25 February 2013, 12:31 UTC. Mission The SARAL mission is complementary to the Jason-2 mission of NASA/NOAA and CNES/EUMETSAT. It will fill the gap between Envisat and the Sentinel 3 mission of the European GMES program. The combination of two altimetry missions in orbit has a considerable impact on the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH), reducing the mean mapping error by a factor of 4. Payloads=Ka band Altimeter, ALTIKA ALTIKA, the altimeter and prime payload of the SARAL mission, will be the first spaceborne altimeter to operate at Ka band. It built by the French National Space Agency CNES. The payload is intended for oceanographic applications, operates at 35.75 GHz. ALTIKA is set to take over ocean-monitoring from Envisat. It is the first to operate at such a high frequency, making it more compact and delivering better performance than the previous generation. While existing satellite-borne altimeters determine sea level by bouncing a radar signal off the surface and measuring the return-trip time, ALTIKA operates at a high frequency in Ka band. The advantage of this is twofold. One, the Earth's atmosphere slows down the radar signal, so altimetry measurements are skewed and have to carry additional equipment to correct for this error. Since ALTIKA uses a different system, it does not have to carry an instrument to correct for atmospheric effects as current-generation altimeters do. ALTIKA gets around this problem by operating at a high frequency in Ka band. Another advantage of operating at higher frequencies is greater accuracy. ALTIKA will measure ocean surface topography with an accuracy of 8 mm, against 2.5 cm on average using current-generation altimeters, and with a spatial resolution of 2 km. The disadvantage, however, is that high-frequency waves are extremely sensitive to rain, even drizzle. 10% of the data is expected to be lost. (Although this could be exploited to perform crude measurements of precipitation). ARGOS Data Collection System It built by the French National Space Agency CNES. ARGOS contributes to the development and operational implementation of the global ARGOS Data Collection System. It will collect a variety of data from ocean buoys to transmit the same to the ARGOS ground segment for subsequent processing and distribution. Solid State C-band Transponder (SCBT) Is from ISRO and intended for ground RADAR calibration. It is a continuation of such support provided by C-Band Transponders flown in the earlier IRS-P3 and IRS-P5 missions.

Summary One of the U.S. Army soldiers have managed to shoot and kill one of the Viet Cong soldiers near the U.S. army base. In Stealth, the player takes control of a squad of six U.S. Army soldiers in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Gameplay is turn-based on a platoon's level, each squad member has the option to move, attack, wait, and in the case of the radio operator call in air or artillery support. The majority of the enemy Viet Cong troops hide in the jungles and appear on the computers turn to shoot at one of your characters if they are in range. Objectives that are given out in each level are to travel to a designated site and destroy a number of missiles guarded by a few visible and fortified Viet Cong soldiers. Viet Cong soldiers wear the same uniform in the game as they did in real life. Their outfit consists of a floppy jungle hat, rubber sandals, and green fatigues without insignia. This was to make them virtually blend in with the civilian population that happened to live in the villages (many of them were affected by the Vietnam War in a negative way). Each weapon has a different range (for its ammunition) and different a weight value (for the person who is carrying it). Soundtrack There are 14 tracks on the soundtrack for this video game. Many of them indicate an event happening in the game (heavy artillery, change of turns, aircraft) while others are the standard game over/beating the game kind of music.

She falls in love with Jacob in the end of the novel. * Eli Yoder An Amish man contracted to make repairs on Rusty's house. Plot summary The opening chapters of Driftless introduce the many characters whose lives are traced through overlapping narratives throughout the novel. Initially readers are told of: July Montgomery's decision to put settle in Words, Wisconsin; the close yet contentious relationship between the Brasso sisters, Grahm Shotwell's growing frustration and the complications in his marriage after Cora's discovery of fraud by her employer, the American Milk Cooperative; Gail Shotwell's unsettled professional and personal life; Jacob Helm's discovery of a cougar; Winifred Smith's tendency for confrontation; and the need for repairs to Rusty Smith's house. As the novel continues, these individual storylines converge with one another, often through the intervention of July. July gets Jacob to fix Gail's lawnmower, he encourages Rusty to hire Eli Yoder (despite Rusty's prejudice against the Amish) and he arranges for Gail's idol, Barbara Jean, to see her perform with her band. Meanwhile, Grahm and Cora file charges against the American Milk Cooperative and their lives are thrown into chaos, as Cora loses her job and Grahm's milk is apparently sabotaged. As fall turns to winter, Winnie experiences a religious epiphany, but when she tells Olivia about it, Olivia decides to look for her own divine sign at a casino and loses all of her and her sister's money. On the way out of the casino she is mugged, but Wade Armbuster intervenes and they establish an unlikely friendship. Rusty worries that Eli won't finish working on his house in time for a family reunion, but when the reunion goes off as planned Rusty finds himself emotionally estranged from his family and thinking of his brother, whom he has not seen for years. The Shotwell children almost freeze to death in a blizzard, causing Grahm to reevaluate his life. Characters lives change as they begin taking actions that they would have at the start of the book. Graham speaks up against the American Milk Cooperative at a shareholders‚Äô meeting. Olivia attends an illegal dogfight with Wade and ends up bringing one of the dogs home with her. Soon, she discovers that she is able to move her legs. Gail writes a song and works up the courage to share it with Barbara Jean, but she leaves when Barbara Jean's band begins adapting it to their style. Jacob begins to fall in love with Winnie. Rusty gets help from Jacob tracking down his brother, who is dead, but discovers that Winnie Smith is his niece. Rusty also discovers that the cougar and a cub are in his barn, but he is reluctant to shoot them and they leave on their own. July convinces Tim and Leona Pikes to represent the Shotwells against the American Milk Cooperative, and it appears that their case has a chance. As the book nears its conclusion, there are a series of revelations. Rusty informs to Winnie that he is her uncle. Olivia tells Violet that she can walk (Violet had already figured it out). Jacob and Winnie become involved. July is killed in a farming accident. The whole town turns out for his funeral, and July's ashes are mistakenly spread under a peony bush, leading Jacob and Winnie to disagree as to whether they should be left where they are or whether it is important for his remains to be where people think they are.

They were relatively large-bodied, feathered hypercarnivores (with diets consisting almost entirely of other terrestrial vertebrates) that flourished in the Cretaceous Period. Eudromaeosaur fossils are known almost exclusively from the northern hemisphere. They first appeared in the early Cretaceous Period (early Aptian stage, about 124 million years ago) and survived until the end of the Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, Ma). The earliest known definitive eudromaeosaur is the dromaeosaurine Utahraptor ostrommaysi, from the Cedar Mountain Formation, dated to 124 million years ago. However, the earlier (143-million-year-old) fossils such as those of Nuthetes destructor and several indeterminate teeth dating to the Kimmeridgian stage may represent eudromaeosaurs. Description While other dromaeosaurids filled a variety of specialized ecological niches, mainly those of small predators or larger fish-eating forms, eudromaeosaurs functioned as large- bodied predators of often medium to large-sized prey. Aside from their generally larger size, eudromaeosaurs are characterized by several features of the foot. First, there were differences in the positions of the grooves which anchored blood vessels and keratin sheathes of the toe claws. In primitive dromaeosaurids like Hesperonychus, these grooves ran parallel to each other on either side of the claw along its length. In eudromaeosaurs, the grooves were asymmetrical, with the inner one split into two distinct grooves and elevated toward the top of the claw, while the single outer groove remained positioned at the midline. The second distinguishing characteristic of eudromaeosaurs is an expanded and enlarged \\"heel\\" on the last bone in the second toe (phalange), which bore the enlarged, sickle-like toe claw. Finally, the first bone of the second toe also possessed an enlarged expansion at the joint, another adaptation relating to the unusually enlarged claw, and which helped the animal hold the claw high off the ground. Also unlike their more basal relatives, the sickle-claw of eudromaeosaurs was sharper and more blade-like. In unenlagiines and microraptorines, the claw is broader at its base. Classification Eudromaeosauria was first defined as a node-based clade by Nick Longrich and Philip J. Currie in 2009, as the most inclusive natural group containing Dromaeosaurus, Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, their most recent common ancestor and all of its other descendants. The various \\"subfamilies\\" have also been re-defined as clades, usually defined as all species closer to the groups namesake than to Dromaeosaurus or any namesakes of other sub-clades. The subgroups of Eudromaeosauria frequently shift in content based on new analysis, but typically consist of the following groups. For example, the subfamily Velociraptorinae has traditionally included Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, and while the discovery of Tsaagan lent support to this grouping, the inclusion of Saurornitholestes is still uncertain. The Dromaeosaurinae is usually found to consist of medium to giant-sized species, with generally box-shaped skulls (the other subfamilies generally have narrower snouts). A number of eudromaeosaurs have not been assigned to any particular subfamily, because they are too poorly preserved to be placed confidently in phylogenetic analysis (see section Phylogeny below). The following classification of the various genera of eudromaeosaurs follows the table provided in Holtz, 2010 unless otherwise noted.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2010) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. * Eudromaeosauria ** Subfamily Saurornitholestinae *** Atrociraptor *** Bambiraptor? *** Saurornitholestes ** Subfamily Dromaeosaurinae *** Achillobator? *** Dakotaraptor? *** Deinonychus? *** Dromaeosauroides? *** Dromaeosaurus *** Itemirus? *** Utahraptor? *** Yurgovuchia? *** Zapsalis? ** Subfamily Velociraptorinae *** Acheroraptor? *** Boreonykus?Bell, P.

The cladogram below follows a 2015 analysis by paleontologists Robert DePalma, David Burnham, Larry Martin, Peter Larson, and Robert Bakker, using updated data from the Theropod Working Group. This analysis concluded that several members of traditional eudromaeosaurian subgroups are actually outside of that group, and that traditional groupings like Velociraptorinae are paraphyletic.

Today the canyon bearing the name Doubtful Canyon, is mostly in Cochise County, Arizona, near the New Mexico border. It descends to the east into the Animas Valley past Steins Peak it is in Hidalgo County, New Mexico. Doubtful Canyon has a tributary, Little Doubtful Canyon that joins it just east of the Arizona New Mexico border. The western canyon is now called West Doubtful Canyon and it descends into the San Simon Valley, in Cochise County, Arizona. History The mountain water sources and the low north south divide that lay between the two Doubtful canyons made it a favored shortcut for early east west travelers to the Southern Emigrant Trail wagon road that ran farther south before turning west. Doubtful Canyon and West Doubtful Canyon formed the pass where the Butterfield Overland Mail passed through the Peloncillo Mountains. Later near Steins Peak, the Steins Peak Station of the Butterfield Overland Mail was located in Doubtful Canyon. Steins Peak Station was destroyed and its keepers killed by the Apache in 1861.On May 4, 1864, soldiers of California Column fought a band of Apache in the Skirmish in Doubtful Canyon, in the canyon near Steins Peak.

As a result, Poda sought and attained an appointment, and was sworn into the state Senate on January 14, 1971. However, citing the want to be closer to family more often, Poda decided not to run for a full term in the Senate, and was replaced by David Headley in 1973. In 1974, Poda ran for Summit County Auditor and won. However, in 1981, Poda was charged with receiving illegal campaign contributions. Following the incident Poda continued to serve as auditor, and eventually recovered politically from the damage.

It runs past Dock Square, Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, the Rose Kennedy Greenway, and North Square. It was first named in 1852, and consists of segments of streets formerly named Ann, Fish, Ship, Drawbridge, and Conduit Streets.Boston Street Laying-Out Dept. A record of the streets, alleys, places, etc. in the city of Boston. Boston: City Printing Dept., 1910. Ann Street in the 19th century Ann Street, also known as the \\"Black Sea\\", was an infamous neighborhood in the 19th century. The main street and its side alleys formed a red-light district where brothels, inns, \\"jilt shops\\", and tavernsBergen 23. could be segregated from the rest of the city.Duis 235. Over half of Boston's brothels were located there. The establishments in the area relied heavily on custom from sailors, who had come ashore at Dock Square nearby, and working men, who used the taverns as meeting places in the winter. The area was one of the few places in Boston where African Americans and whites intermingled.Hobson 45. Detail of 1814 map of Boston, showing Ann St. and vicinity North Street, looking up from North Square, ca.1894 Ann Street was the main thoroughfare through the neighborhood. It ran from Faneuil Market, spanned an old drawbridge, and led into the rest of the Boston's North End, terminating at the wharves. On 4 December 1834, Ann Street was widened to connect Merchant's Row and Blackstone Street. The area lay about ten minutes by foot from Boston's banking and commercial center.  Police raids  The Ann Street area was occasionally subject to police raids, generally superficial affairs that left the brothels alone. In 1851 Ann Street had reached the height of its notoriety. Police who patrolled the area (now known as the \\"Black Sea\\") estimated that it was home to 227 brothels, 26 gambling dens, and 1,500 establishments that sold liquor.Hobson 41. The Boston government responded by organizing a raid. The first, on 8 March 1851, nabbed 86 gamblers. A second on 14 March took many more. Officer Edward H. Savage described the final phase of this Great Descent: \\"On the eve of the 23rd of April, this year, we made the great Police descent in Ann Street, capturing some one hundred and sixty bipeds, who were punished for piping, fiddling, dancing, drinking, and attending crimes.\\"Savage 90-1. This raid involved some 50 officers (the whole day force's contingent) and 50 night officers. In all, 60 men, including 35 brothel keepers, and 95 women, mostly prostitutes, were arrested.  Name change: North Street  At the behest of residents eager to improve the area's image, Boston rechristened Ann Street \\"North Street\\" in 1852. The change made little difference. In 1866, some Protestant missionaries described the area as \\"squealing of fiddles\\" and the \\"disorderly shuffle of many feet\\", populated by criminals of every kind.Quoted in Hobson 45. In 1896, Benjamin Orange Flower described a similar scene in his book Civilization's Inferno. Over time, the area did improve, but this was more likely the result of economic and community changes.  Present day  Today's North Street is part of a rejuvenated North End and all of Boston's red-light district is limited to a few bookstores and two strip clubs on Kneeland Street, part of the now defunct \\"Combat Zone\\".

Built on the site of a Bronze Age stone circle of puddingstones, parts of the church building date to the 12th century. Remodelled in the 15th and 17th centuries, the church is architecturally a mixture of English Gothic styles. Weakened by additions to the church tower and undermined by burials in and around the church, by the 19th century the building was structurally unsound. The church was remodelled and strengthened in the 1860s by George Gilbert Scott and again in the 20th century by Robert Potter. Formerly part of the Diocese of Lincoln, it served what was historically the largest parish in Buckinghamshire, and the church traditionally had two vicars. Initially the advowson (the right to appoint the vicar) was held jointly by a pair of prominent local families, but in the wake of the 12th century civil wars of the reign of King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154), the advowsons were granted to the monks of Woburn Abbey and to the Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis in Leicester, each of whom appointed their own vicars to the parish. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries Woburn Abbey, together with its half of the advowson, was granted to the Earls of Bedford, while the half that had belonged to Leicester Abbey passed through a succession of private owners. In 1769 the Duke of Bedford acquired the Leicester half of the advowson and unified the parish, and from then on the parish was served by a single vicar. The town of Chesham grew rapidly in the 19th century. After the parish was transferred to the Diocese of Oxford, reforms introduced by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, led to the parish being partitioned, eventually becoming four independent parishes (Chesham, Latimer, Waterside and Ashley Green). In 1980 it was decided to reverse this decision, and over the 1980s and 1990s three of these parishes (Chesham, Waterside and Ashley Green) were reunited under St. Mary's Church. Historical background alt=a number of buildings, mainly red, in front of a church on a hill and a row of small trees Chesham is a Buckinghamshire town of around 20,000 people, located in the Chiltern Hills at the head of the River Chess, about north-west of London and south-east of Aylesbury. There is archaeological evidence of human habitation during the Mesolithic period circa 8000 BC, of Neolithic farming circa 2500 BC and of Bronze Age settlement circa 1800 BC, during which time a stone circle of puddingstones was built at Chesham. The Catuvellauni tribe occupied and settled the area in around 500 BC, and at nearby Latimer there are remains of a Roman villa and archaeological evidence of Roman vineyards. Following the departure of the Romans the area appears to have been depopulated until Anglo-Saxon colonisation in the 7th century AD. The first recorded mention of Chesham dates from 970 in the will of Lady √Ülfgifu (identified with the former consort of King Eadwig of England), bequeathing C√¶st√¶leshamme, \\"the water meadow at the pile of stones\\", to Abingdon Abbey. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists Cestreham as containing four mills and comprising three adjacent estates, the most important of which were held by Odo of Bayeux and Queen Edith, the widow of Edward the Confessor. alt=a narrow road flanked by small houses As with much of England, Chesham suffered serious religious unrest in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in 1532 Lollard radical Thomas Harding was burnt at the stake in the town for heresy. From the 17th century Chesham was a focus for dissenters. The first Baptist chapel in the town opened in 1701, Quakers have met in Chesham since the late 17th century, and John Wesley preached in Chesham in the 1760s. Chesham Old Town, to the south-east of the present-day town centre, is the oldest part of the town and was the centre of Chesham until the late 19th century; in 1851 the population stood at 2,496. In 1889 the Metropolitan Railway reached the area as the first phase of a planned extension from Rickmansworth to Berkhamsted, and Chesham railway station was opened to the north-east of the Old Town. Following the Metropolitan Railway's acquisition of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A&B;) in 1891, the extension to Berkhamsted was abandoned in favour of a connection between the Metropolitan Railway's station at Chalfont Road (now Chalfont & Latimer) to Aylesbury and over the A&B;'s route to Verney Junction, and Chesham station was left as the terminus of and sole station on a branch from the mainline, a status it retains today. alt=a number of buildings, mainly red, in front of a church on a hill and a row of big trees The new town of present-day Chesham grew between the railway station and the Old Town, leaving the architecture of the Old Town almost untouched. In June 2009 the Old Town and the present-day town centre were added to Historic England's Conservation Areas at Risk Register, although the local authority claimed that this was owing to a misunderstanding of its responses to English Heritage's questionnaire. Architecture The existence of the stone circle indicates that a pagan place of worship existed in the area since prehistory, and although no archaeological evidence exists of any pre-Conquest structure on the site of the present-day St. Mary's Church other than the stone circle itself, it is considered likely that a wooden church was built on the site by the Anglo- Saxons. The earliest evidence of there being a church in Chesham is in the registers of the Diocese of Lincoln, whose 1153 registers mention \\"the church in Chesham\\". In 1257 Hugh de Vere was granted the right to hold an annual three-day fair and a weekly market in Chesham by Henry III. The annual fair was to be held on \\"the eve, the day and the morrow of the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\", strongly suggesting that Chesham's church was already dedicated to Mary. alt=detail of a stone column resting on a large chunk of puddingstone The church is built on the Bronze Age puddingstone circle, which has been incorporated into the foundations of the church. Built of knapped flint with limestone dressings, it has a roughly cruciform shape. The present day church building comprises a chancel, a clerestoried nave, north and south aisles and transepts and a south porch with a tierceron vault. The church is topped by a square central crenellated steeple with an octagonal wooden spire covered with lead. Although the current stone church of St. Mary's contains a mixture of architectural styles, mainly Gothic and dating from later periods, a Romanesque window between the north transept and north aisle has been dated to the 12th century, indicating that the church was already a stone building by this time. The building as a whole is long from east to west and wide from north to south. The nave (excluding the aisles) is long and wide; English Gothic aisles and the arcades of the nave were added early in the 13th century. The arcades consist of five bays with octagonal piers and arches with half-pyramid shaped springers, a design described by Nikolaus Pevsner in 1960 as \\"baffling\\". In 1270 the eastern arch of the tower was widened, and in around 1320 the other arches of the tower were also widened. In about 1370 the chancel was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style, and a doorway added in the south aisle at around the same time. 15th- and 17th-century renovation alt=Very large arched window above a large wooden door In the 15th century the clerestory was added to the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered. While the stone tower was completed in the 15th century, the date of the spire is unknown and has been dated to periods ranging from the 16th to 18th centuries. The church is known to have possessed a ring of bells by the 16th century, as the 1552 inventory of church possessions carried out on the instructions of Edward VI lists \\"v bells in the stepill\\". A bell cast in around 1450 by John Sturdy is still used as a Sanctus bell and is regarded as having national historic significance. alt=Interior of a church with a high vaulted ceiling, gallery balconies along the sides, and a large coat of arms on the chancel arch In the chaotic climate of religious upheaval during and following the Reformation of the 16th century many of England's churches fell into disrepair, including St. Mary's; the great door of St. Mary's was damaged during the Civil War and bullet holes from the conflict remain visible today. In 1606 it was decided to renovate St. Mary's. Two of the bells were re-cast, the pews were replaced, and \\"a fair new gallery\\" was built along the south aisle. In the 18th century two further galleries were added to the church; a north gallery reserved for the exclusive use of \\"maids and maidservants\\", and a west gallery for the use of St. Mary's band of musicians and choristers, later used to house the church's organ. The wooden communion table was sold for 3s and a new table added at a cost of 10s 6d (about ¬£ as of ). 19th-century renovation Since the widening of the tower arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St. Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added to the weight of the tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17 cwt (860 kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and rubble and covered over with roughcast as an interim solution. alt=Stone church with a square tower topped by a slim spire By 1867, church authorities deemed the problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St. Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St. Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design. alt=stone church with a slim metal spire Scott removed the galleries, the high-sided 1606 pews, and the three-tiered pulpit. The tower was strengthened, the building's exterior facing of flint and limestone was restored, and the chancel, which had been remodelled in the late 17th century, was restored to its original shape and given a new east window in the Decorated Gothic style, containing Ward and Hughes glass depicting Faith, Hope and Charity, donated by the Duke of Bedford. New wooden pews were installed together with a Gothic style pulpit, and a font of Mansfield Woodhouse stone donated by the Lowndes family. The north transept, which had previously served as a vestry from which the Poor Law was administered, was used to house the church's William Hill & Son organ, which had been installed in 1852 in the now-removed western gallery; the south transept, which up to that date had been used as a mausoleum for the Cavendish family and was completely walled off from the rest of the church and accessible only via its own door from the churchyard, was opened up to the church. In 1890 Cambridge Chimes were added to the tower clock, in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. 20th- century renovation Scott's alterations proved successful in stabilising the tower and in serving the needs of the church, and the church remained little changed for the next 130 years; the most notable alterations during this period were the replacement of the glass in the chancel's two leper windows with stained glass images of Pre-Raphaelite knights by Edward Burne-Jones as a memorial to a young officer killed during the Boer War, and the painting of a mural over the chancel arch by John Ward depicting the events of Holy Week in modern dress and set in the Chilterns. In 1951 the church was Grade A listed. In 1980 the fourth bell of the ring of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the internal design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical for the needs of the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs. Ecclesiastical organisation alt=a church and a large house near the bank of a river In the 12th and early 13th centuries the advowson (the right to appoint the vicar) of the church was held jointly by two local landowning families, the de Bolbec (or de Bolebec) and Sifrewast families; as a very large parish (generally considered to have been the largest parish in Buckinghamshire) twin administrations suited the needs of the parish. Following the civil wars of the reign of King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154) England underwent a major upsurge in religious activity and saw a significant growth of monasteries. At some point prior to 1221 the de Bolbec family had included their half of the advowson in a grant to the Cistercians of Woburn Abbey, and the Sifrewasts had granted their half to the Augustinian Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis in Leicester. From then on, Woburn and Leicester were to share the patronage, each appointing their own vicars to the parish, known as Chesham Woburn and Chesham Leicester. alt=elderly man in a grey wig and red coat Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century the advowson of Chesham Woburn remained attached to Woburn Abbey and was transferred, along with the abbey building, to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford. The advowson of Chesham Leicester was sold, and from then on had a succession of owners, eventually coming into the ownership of prominent local landowners the Skottowe family, who purchased it from Sir Francis Whichcote, MP for Cambridgeshire. From 1601 onwards, other than a brief period between 1623‚Äì1660, the appointees of Chesham Woburn and Chesham Leicester were the same person, and thus the parish was served by a single vicar, although he continued to be appointed by the holders of each advowson separately. In 1769 John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, who had inherited Chesham Woburn, also acquired Chesham Leicester and from then on the parish was served by a single vicar assisted by multiple curates; in 1767 the two halves of the parish were formally unified by an Act of Parliament. In 1845 Chesham, along with the rest of Buckinghamshire, was transferred from the Diocese of Lincoln, of which for historical reasons it had been a part since the Norman Conquest despite its distance from Lincoln, to the Diocese of Oxford. It thus came under the control of Oxford's newly appointed dynamic young bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who in turn appointed Adolphus Aylward as vicar in 1847 to oversee the reform of the parish. A second church at Waterside was opened in 1867, and the huge parish of Chesham was partitioned between St. Mary's and the new Christ Church, Waterside. As Chesham and the surrounding towns grew following the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway the parish was divided further, leaving a total of four independent parishes: St. Mary's, Christ Church Waterside, St. John the Evangelist Ashley Green, and Latimer At the end of the 19th century the advowson of the much-reduced parish of St. Mary's was acquired by the recently created Peache Trust. In 1980 it was decided to reverse the partition of the parish. Over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s three of the four parishes were reunified into a single parish of Great Chesham, administered by a single Rector, also the Vicar of St. Mary's, and a team of clergy serving five of the other churches; the sixth, St. Michael's Whelpley Hill, was closed. Associated buildings and structures alt=Church on a hill with a large house on each side and a number of red buildings in front of it In 1712 Secretary to the Treasury William Lowndes rebuilt Chesham's manor house, The Bury, immediately to the south of the church. The building still stands today, and currently serves as an office building. Owing to its unusual advowson, Chesham historically had two vicarages. The Upper Parsonage, also known as Bury Hill House, was built in the 16th century and attached to Chesham Leicester, and was used as a residence by the Skottowe family following their acquisition of Chesham Leicester; it was a large mansion house immediately north of St. Mary's Church. In the early 19th century the house was bought and demolished by the Lowndes family. alt=Large red brick house The Lower Parsonage, attached to Chesham Woburn, stood immediately east of the church, between the church and the Old Town. It was demolished in around 1769 by John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, and replaced by a new vicarage for the vicar of the newly unified parish. This vicarage remains attached to the parish, and since the re-amalgamation of the Chesham parishes in the 1980s and 1990s is known as the Rectory. Organ In 1504 the will of Robert Wedon bequeathed funds for a chaplain, provided that he could \\"organise\\" and \\"sing well\\". No other reference to an organ at St. Mary's exists until the installation of the William Hill & Son organ in 1852 in the west gallery. In 1869 the organ was moved to the north transept during Scott's renovation of the church, and at this time its volume and power were increased. In Potter's 1999 remodelling of the church the pipes of the organ were moved to the new west gallery and electronically enhanced, and the console installed at the eastern end of the north aisle. Notable graves and memorials The south transept had historically served as the mausoleum for the Cavendish family, who resided at nearby Latimer. During Scott's renovations of the 1860s the transept was opened up to the church and remodelled, and only one Cavendish tomb survives today, that of John Cavendish, son of William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, who had died in 1617 aged 11. Sculpted by John Bolt the Elder of London, the tomb features ornately carved strapwork above a sarcophagus, flanked by black coupled columns supporting small obelisks, and topped by a double-curved roof. The south transept also holds the 1726 pyramid-shaped tomb of Lady Mary Whichcote, wife of Sir Francis Whichcote who at that time owned Chesham Leicester; Mary Whichcote's elaborate funeral bankrupted Sir Francis, leading to his sale of Chesham Leicester to the Skottowe family. alt=stone church with a slim metal spire Richard Bowle (c. 1549 ‚Äì 13 December 1626), who had recorded and audited the restoration project of 1606, is commemorated by a black marble monument on the north side of the chancel, noting his \\"faithful service of divers great lords\\", and that \\"part of\\" him \\"lyeth here\\". On the north wall of the sanctuary is a large memorial to Richard Woodcock, who had served as vicar of both Chesham Woburn and Chesham Leicester from 1607 to 1623. Topped by a large painted bust of Woodcock holding a book, a lengthy gilded inscription in Latin and English describes Woodcock as \\"H√¶reticorum Malleus\\" (\\"The hammer of heretics\\"). Woodcock had been a popular local figure, and at his death the parishioners had taken it in turns to carry the coffin to the church. Near the memorial to Woodcock is a memorial to Nicholas Skottowe erected in 1800. This takes the form of a stone sculpture of a mourning woman kneeling over a sarcophagus, and was described by Pevsner as \\"[an] interpretation of remarkable tenderness\\". During Scott's renovations of the 1860s, all burials within the church itself were removed. However, during the 1999 renovation, a vault was uncovered near the crossing. The vault was marked by a brass plaque inscribed \\"The Family Vault of Robert Ward\\", and was found to contain the coffins of Catherine Julia Ward, wife of novelist and Tory politician Robert Plumer Ward, and of their three-year-old son Charles Robert Ward. The vault has been resealed and remains in place. Adolphus Aylward, the vicar from 1847 to 1872 and overseer of the parish restructuring, is commemorated by a brass plaque on the south-west pillar of the tower, and by a Clayton and Bell window in the north-west chancel. Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with snowdrops at her mother's request, which still bloom each spring. Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls glass in the lancet window at the west end of the north aisle. alt=Stone Celtic cross in front of a church A memorial to Lollard martyr Thomas Harding stands in the churchyard near the south chancel, erected in 1907 by the Protestant Alliance. The base of the cross is inscribed:Harding was executed at nearby White Hill and is believed to have been held in St. Mary's parvise prior to his execution. Foxe's Book of Martyrs describes the execution thus: Near the memorial to Harding by the chancel door is a worn gravestone depicting a teacher and a group of children, believed to be the grave of Daniel King, teacher in Chesham's first Sunday School.

Season review Juventus just came up short in Serie A for the second year in a row. Unlike in 2000, it did not have matters in its own hands prior to the final game of the season, and even though Juventus fended off Atalanta 2‚Äì1 at home, Roma beat Parma 3‚Äì1, which meant the title landed with a Roman club for the second year running. The determining moment of the title race had been a showdown between Juventus and Roma at the Stadio delle Alpi with six games to go, and the Bianconeri closing down on the Romans who had suffered a recent dip in their form. In front of their crowd, Juventus began the brightest. Two goals in quick succession by Alessandro Del Piero and Zinedine Zidane gave them a lead they held on to until the 79th minute, when Edwin van der Sar took center stage. The Dutch goalkeeper fumbled a long-range effort from Roma's Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, enabling the latter to score a fortunate goal. In added time, Vincenzo Montella equalized for the Roman club, thus denying Juventus a vital victory. La Vecchia Signora did win all five of its remaining games after that, but in the meantime, Roma did enough to make sure they didn't lose the top spot of the table, thus winning their first scudetto since 1983. The success was celebrated wildly in the streets of the Italian capital, and the fact that Roma had beaten bitter rivals Juventus to the title made the supporters even happier. In the Champions League, Juventus was a major disappointment, getting knocked out in the first group stage of the tournament. It was the first time in the club's history that it had been knocked so early in the competition. This performance put Carlo Ancelotti's position at the helm under even more threat. Ancelotti had already been associated in the previous season with the club's worst run in any European competition since the 1987‚Äì88 season. As a man who had been associated with Juve's rivals Milan, Roma and Parma for most of his footballing career, he had never been a popular choice with the fans, with frequent doubts being raised about his lack of concern for the club's declining fortunes. In the summer of 2001, wholesale changes were made. Marcello Lippi returned to his old job prior to the 2001‚Äì02 season. It was also Zinedine Zidane's last season with Juventus as he was sold for a world record fee to Real Madrid, but the Italian club compensated his loss with four new players during the summer, with Gianluigi Buffon and Lilian Thuram coming from Parma, and Pavel Nedvƒõd and Marcelo Salas came from Lazio.

The Betar Naval Academy was a Jewish naval training school established in Civitavecchia, Italy in 1934 by the Revisionist Zionist movement under the direction of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, with the agreement of Benito Mussolini.Kaplan, 2005, p. 156. The titular head of the Academy was the Italian maritime scientist Nicola Fusco but Betar leader Jeremiah Halpern ran the School and was its driving force. The Academy trained cadets from all over Europe, Palestine and South Africa and produced some of the future commanders of the Israeli Navy. Although the Revisionists were keen to ensure that trainees avoided local Fascist politics the cadets did express public support for Benito Mussolini's regime, as Halpern later detailed in his book History of Hebrew Seamanship. Cadets marched alongside Italian soldiers in support of the Second Italo‚ÄìAbyssinian War and collected metal scraps for the Italian weapons industry. They \\"felt as if they were living the true Beitarist life in an atmosphere of heroism, militarism, and nationalistic pride.\\" The Academy closed in 1938.Dieckhoff, 2003, p. 243. The Revisionists and Italy Italy was a source of ideological, historical and cultural inspiration for the Zionist Revisionists of the 1920s and 1930s.Kaplan, 2005, p. 149. The country under Mussolini was seen as a historical reminder of the roots of the Jewish people and as a contemporary example of a once glorious culture reclaiming its role in the world through the affirmation of power and national pride. From the early 1930s onwards Jabotinsky believed that the United Kingdom could no longer be trusted to advance the Zionist cause and that Italy, as a growing power capable of challenging Britain for dominance in the region, was a natural ally.Kaplan, 2005, p. 150. Jabotinsky had been scheduled to meet Benito Mussolini as early as 1922, but for various reasons the meeting did not take place. However, in a letter to Mussolini, Jabotinsky attempted to win his support for the Zionist cause by arguing that for cultural reasons Italy's pro-Arab policy was misguided.Kaplan, 2005, p. 151. Jabotinsky predicted that Italy and the Arabs would inevitably come into conflict and that a Jewish state in the Middle East could act as a buffer between Europe, Asia and Africa.Kaplan, 2005, p. 151-152. In the second half of the 1920s Revisionism became a growing force among Italian Zionists and the first branch of the movement, the Raggruppamento d'Italia, was founded in 1925. In 1930 the first issues of Leone Carpi's L'Idea Sionistica advanced an anti-British stance and in 1932 the first Revisionist Zionist conference in Italy took place in Milan.Kaplan, 2005, p. 152. Mussolini and the Revisionists In 1933 the Italian foreign ministry (Mussolini was also foreign minister) began circulating internal policy documents arguing that a strong Jewish state would be in Italy's best interests.Kaplan, 2005, p. 154. Although Jabotinsky had still not been able to arrange a meeting with Mussolini it became clear that the Italian government did view the Revisionists as potential ideological partners. It was this change that facilitated the creation of the Betar Naval Academy in the Italian port city of Civitavecchia.Kaplan, 2005, p. 155. Nicola Fusco, the nominal head of the Academy, was administrative secretary of the local Fascist Party and the relationship between the cadets and the fascist establishment was close.Kaplan, 2005, p. 156-157. This was perhaps seen most clearly following the drowning of a cadet in 1935. On 28 May 1935 the Italian newspaper Popolo di Roma's report on the funeral ceremony illustrated the closeness of the relationship: an emotional commemoration took place on board the Italian ship the Domenico, which was flying its flag at half mast; all of the cadets were present, as were Halpern, Fusco, the mayor's representative, the port supervisor and all of the cadets from Lazio naval academy.Kaplan, 2005, p.156-157. The paper reported: \\"In the place where the accident occurred, the dead cadet's comrades prayed according to their own tradition, performed a military ceremony, and tossed a bouquet of flowers to the sea. All who were present then performed the Saluto Romano with their heads uncovered.\\"Kaplan, 2005, p. 157. In a clear expression of the solidarity between the Revisionist Academy and the Italian military the official publication of the Italian professional maritime schools, the Bollettino del Consorzio Scuole Professionali per la Maestranza Marittima, stated, \\"In agreement of all the relevant authorities it has been confirmed that the views and the political and social inclinations of the Revisionists are known and that they are absolutely in accordance with the fascist doctrine. Therefore, as our students they will bring the Italian and fascist culture to Palestine.\\" The Sarah I The Sarah I: a 190-foot four-masted schooner of 750 tons used as a training ship by the Betar Naval Academy. The generosity of a wealthy Belgian supporter [Mr Kirschner] allowed the Academy to procure a training ship, the Italian Quattro Venti, which was renamed the Sarah I, after the donor's wife. In January 1938 the Sarah I sailed around the Mediterranean. In Tunisia there were clashes between the cadets and local Arabs. In September 1937 the Sarah I visited Haifa, where the \\"first Jewish Training Ship in modern history\\" attracted a great deal of attention.

The novel takes its name from Star Island in Miami Beach, Florida, where part of the story takes place. Plot summary Ann DeLusia, the \\"stunt double\\" for habitually intoxicated and drug-addicted pop star \\"Cherry Pye\\", is mistakenly kidnapped by an obsessed paparazzo. Now, the star's entourage must find a way to rescue Ann, and do it without revealing her identity to the star herself, or the world at large. The novel also features the re-appearance of Hiaasen's recurring character, ex-Florida governor Clinton \\"Skink\\" Tyree. Detailed Plot Summary Paparazzo \\"Bang\\" Abbott is lying in wait outside a posh South Beach hotel, on a tip that pop star Cherry Pye has overdosed again. However, when the paramedics bring a woman down to the ambulance, he sees that she is a body double. Meanwhile, the real Cherry is being driven to the nearest hospital in a private limousine by her entourage. The body double is Ann DeLusia, an actress hired by Cherry's family to make brief public appearances when Cherry is too inebriated to do so. Cherry's mother/manager, Janet Bunterman, tells Ann to take a few days off, while Cherry is packed off, yet again, to drug rehab. Infuriated at having been fooled by a body double, Bang becomes even more obsessed with getting photos of Cherry under sordid circumstances. In Los Angeles, Cherry jumps over the wall of the rehab center and hitches a ride to the airport from a nearby motorist, who happens to be Bang staking out the clinic. Pleased by his transparent flattery, Cherry takes him along when she charters a private jet to Florida. Aboard the plane, Bang is astonished when she decides to have an onboard quickie with him. His astonishment turns to outrage when she drives away in a limousine and strands him at the airport, taking his camera bag and BlackBerry with her. Meanwhile, Ann spends her few days off touring the Florida Keys, but while driving through Key Largo, she swerves to avoid a man scooping a roadkill off the highway and drives off a bridge. When she wakes up, the man, \\"Skink\\" has rescued her. With apologies, Skink brings Ann along on a brief mission to kidnap and intimidate real estate developer Jackie Sebago. Afterwards, Skink has a friend give her a ride to the nearest hospital, and gives her the number for his seldom-used cell phone, to call in case she ever needs help. Over Janet's protests, Cherry's record promoter, Maury Lykes, assigns a man nicknamed \\"Chemo\\" to replace her recently fired bodyguard. As revenge for her theft of his cameras and smartphone, Bang kidnaps Cherry outside her hotel at gunpoint, only to realize that the woman he has snatched is Ann. He demands, in exchange for Ann's safe return, that Cherry be made available to him for a private photo shoot. Ann is furious to hear that the Buntermans have not even reported her missing. She hurriedly uses her cell phone to contact Skink. When the Buntermans refuse to agree to Bang's demand, he dresses Ann up in costume and shoots pictures of her with a discarded syringe, making it look as if \\"Cherry\\" is a drug addict. His threat to release the pictures is taken much more seriously than his threat against Ann's life. In fact, since Cherry's career is dangerously close to ending already, her father Ned suggests using the kidnapping as a publicity stunt to boost interest in her upcoming concert tour and comeback album. The photo shoot and hostage exchange takes place on Star Island, in the rented home of Cherry's actor boyfriend. Cherry is duped into thinking that she is posing for the cover of Vanity Fair, while Ann confronts her employers over their indifference to her safety. At that moment, Skink tracks her down, and Ann prefers to leave with him rather than the Buntermans. After the photo shoot, Chemo confiscates the digital memory cards from Bang's cameras. Maury had ordered him to kill Bang, but Bang convinces him that once Cherry is dead, they can make a fortune publishing them. Chemo decides to let Bang live and hangs onto the photos. Meanwhile, the Buntermans meet with Ann and Skink and offer her $50,000 in hush money. Ann declines, settling instead for plane fare back to California and the price of a Zegna suit she bought for Skink. She also informs them that she's quitting her role as Cherry's double, and warns them never to contact her again. Maury flirts with the idea of paying Chemo to kill her, but Chemo refuses and warns Maury not to send anyone else after her (after less than a week spent with Cherry and her parents, Chemo is now firmly on Ann's side). The Buntermans admit to Cherry that the photo shoot was a ruse, but she is pleased to hear that she will be the star of a media blitz surrounding her fake kidnapping. Cherry is upset to be told that, to sell the story, she will need to be secluded for a few days, ostensibly \\"recovering\\" from her ordeal. With Skink's assistance, Ann makes a conspicuous appearance at a nightclub using Cherry's name. A short time later, Cherry escapes from her parents' guard at the hotel and goes to the club with her boyfriend. There, Ann tells Cherry the truth about her role as Cherry's \\"stunt double\\". Cherry launches herself at Ann in an inebriated rage before Chemo carries her out. As he is doing so, Cherry vomits, inadvertently ruining the memory cards in his pocket containing the photos. Cherry's \\"meltdown\\" is captured by the paparazzi outside the club, instantly sabotaging her entourage's plan to sell the kidnapping story. Ann and Skink slip away in the chaos. Bang, however, does not get a photo of Cherry. Like the other paparazzi, he is lying in wait outside the club, but he is shot through the buttocks by a thug hired by one of his disgruntled tipsters. The tipster sent the information to Bang's BlackBerry while Cherry had possession of it, and Bang was unaware that the man was expecting his usual fee. In a touch of poetic justice, Bang finds himself on the receiving end of his profession's notorious indifference to pain and suffering: as he lies in agony on the sidewalk, none of his fellow \\"shooters\\" are inclined to give him aid, but just keep snapping pictures of him as he is lifted into an ambulance. Epilogue (Like many of Hiaasen's novels, the book ends with an epilogue summarizing the outcome of the various plot lines and the fate of the characters in bulletin form.) * Cherry's concert tour is canceled, and her comeback album is a flop, after her highly public \\"meltdown\\" and the embarrassing revelation about her need for a stunt double. Cherry's career continues, though on a much humbler level than before. She is last reported as the star of her own reality series on TLC Network chronicling her gradual return to sobriety. * Cherry's parents (whose relationship was sustained only by their shared interest in Cherry's career) separate after her music career collapses. Her publicists continue to be much in demand, while Maury is forced to flee the U.S. and is eventually murdered by the father of one of his underage \\"proteg√©es\\". * Chemo quits security work and returns to his former career as a mortgage loan broker. * Bang only partially recovers from his bullet-wounding. No longer able to chase celebrities, he operates a small portrait studio in Culver City, California. * Ann establishes herself as a serious actress in Hollywood through a series of critically successful films. Although her former role as Cherry's double becomes public knowledge, Ann steadfastly refuses to capitalize on her brief notoriety, including turning down several lucrative book deals, and becomes famous on her own terms. * Ann has never heard from Skink again, but hears from their mutual friend Jim Tile that the former governor of Florida is \\"in a good place\\". Characters=Main Characters *Ann DeLusia: A struggling actress normally based in Los Angeles, Ann was hired by Cherry Pye's family largely because of their physical resemblance. Cherry frequently needs someone to impersonate her in public to cover up her episodes of excess (though Cherry herself is completely unaware of this). Other than their looks, Ann is Cherry's polar opposite in every way: sober, intelligent, and dependable. *Claude \\"Bang\\" Abbott: Formerly a Pulitzer Prize-winning staff photographer for the St. Petersburg Times, Claude quit the paper under ignominious circumstances and now lives the frenzied, itinerant (but extremely lucrative) life of a paparazzo. Originally obsessed with snapping a photo of Cherry under sordid circumstances, he becomes obsessed in a different way when she seduces him in a drunken haze aboard a private jet. The star and her entourage *Cherry Pye: Born Cheryl Gail Bunterman, Cherry won early fame at age 14 with a one-line appearance in a Nickelodeon after-school TV special, which her aggressive parents and equally aggressive record promoter inflated into a career as a pop star (though her songs are entirely ghost-written and lip-synched, due to Cherry's nonexistent singing voice and general lack of musicality). Now aged 22, she is uncontrollably addicted to alcohol, drugs, and sexual promiscuity. *Janet Bunterman: Cheryl/Cherry's mother/manager. Janet is fanatically devoted to promoting her daughter's stardom, and insists on maintaining \\"positive energy\\" at all times - which manifests itself as an immovable state of denial about Cherry's many addictions (for instance, blaming her frequent drug overdoses on attacks of gastritis). *Ned Bunterman: Cheryl/Cherry's father/accountant. His devotion to his daughter's career (and the money it brings into the family coffers) is equal to his wife's, though he does not share her blindness to their daughter's fragile state. However, he is of minimal help since his wife usually takes the lead in dealing with their daughter. *Maury Lykes: Cherry's record promoter (he became interested in her after seeing her on Nickelodeon, which he regularly watches, being a closet pedophile). Unlike the Buntermans, he has no illusions about Cherry's lack of talent and self-destructive tendencies, but has a heavy stake in her upcoming comeback album and concert tour. *Lucy and Lila Lark: Cherry's publicists. Born fraternal twins, they were so alike in temperament and thought that they later achieved, through plastic surgery, a shared desire to become identical twins. They are renowned in the entertainment industry for their skill at spin doctoring and other forms of \\"damage control\\", which allows them to limit their clientele to only the most famous, or most recklessly self-destructive, celebrities. Recurring Characters *Blondell Wayne Tatum, a.k.a. Chemo: a disfigured bodyguard, first introduced in Hiaasen's novel, Skin Tight. *Clinton \\"Skink\\" Tyree: former governor of Florida, now wild bushman and environmental vigilante. *Jim Tile: A retired State Trooper from the Florida Highway Patrol, Skink's former bodyguard and best friend. Other Characters *Tanner Dane Keefe: a young actor of handsome looks and mediocre talent, riding the fame of being attached to Quentin Tarantino's latest upcoming slasher/parody film (in which he plays a necrophiliac surfer). He becomes Cherry's latest love interest, though it takes all of ten days before she starts to lose interest in him. *Jackie Sebago: a real-estate developer planning to build an upscale condominium complex in Key Largo, an enterprise which is already teetering on the brink of failure thanks to the United States housing bubble and his own fiscal irresponsibility, when Skink appears to violently dissuade him from continuing with it. *William Shea: one of Jackie's aggrieved investors, who demands the return of his money with increasing menace. *Detective Rob Reilly: detective with the Monroe County Sheriff's Office; he stumbles onto Skink's trail after his assault on Jackie Sebago, but ends up with little to no evidence of a crime. *D.T. Maltby: Clinton Tyree's former lieutenant governor, and one of his principal betrayers. Now a well- paid lobbyist living in Key Largo. *Ruben \\"Whaddup\\" Coyle: a mediocre point guard for the Miami Heat basketball team, whose career is on the skids due to recurring tendencies to lease luxury Jaguar convertibles and then wreck said vehicles under the influence of alcohol and drugs. *Freemont Spores: a retired newsprint mechanic who now operates a bank of contraband police scanners and feeds juicy tips to tabloid reporters, photographers, and the Miami underworld. *Teddy Loo: one of Abbott's competing \\"shooters\\" (paparazzi). Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science *Janet complains that Ann is \\"wasting away in Tequilaville\\", mangling the lyrics of Jimmy Buffett's song \\"Margaritaville.\\" *The novel drops the names of several real-life celebrities, either as quarry of Bang Abbott, or rivals of Cherry. Some memorable references include: **Abbott remembers the media \\"frenzy\\" that followed Michael Jackson's death, and his obsession with stalking Cherry is based not so much on her talent or even the stature of her fame, but rather his conviction that she is most likely to \\"beat the others to the grave\\", and that her death will generate another bonanza of publicity and demand for photos of her. ***Abbott feels \\"scarred\\" at not being able to be \\"on the scene\\" in Los Angeles at the time of Jackson's death, because he was in Nassau, on a false tip that Mitt Romney had checked into the Atlantis Paradise Island resort with a pair of prostitutes. **While criticizing the paparazzi in front of Abbott, Cherry makes an offhand reference to their role in the accidental death of Princess Diana. **One of Cherry's previous attempts to rejuvenate her failing career involved circulating a sex tape on the Internet, which Abbott bought and was disappointed to find was even duller than Paris Hilton's; **Cherry proposes that she adopt a baby as a publicity stunt; attempting to discourage the notion, Janet argues that celebrity adoptions have already been over-hyped, thanks to \\"Angelina and Madge\\" (likely a reference to Angelina Jolie and Madonna); **When asked to name the worst thing he's ever done in pursuit of a photo, Abbott recalls bribing a florist's delivery boy to snap shots of a comatose Farrah Fawcett on her deathbed; **Abbott recounts that the worst humiliation he ever suffered as a paparazzo was when Charlie Sheen threw him to the ground and urinated in his ear. **When duping Cherry into thinking she is posing for Vanity Fair, her entourage recalls the hysterical tantrum Cherry threw when Lindsay Lohan appeared on the cover of that magazine. *Behind her back, Cherry's entourage frequently compare her to British pop singer Amy Winehouse, for her reckless and recurring use of drugs and alcohol. Cherry's father points to Winehouse as an ominous illustration of what might happen to Cherry's career if she is not kept under control, noting that Winehouse (unlike Cherry) has genuine talent, but that has not stopped drug and alcohol abuse from wrecking her career. *Kurt, Chemo's one-day replacement as Cherry's bodyguard, refuses her demand that he shave his head, saying that none of his past female clients - including Lady Gaga, Anne Hathaway and Tara Reid - made him do so. He admits that Reid tried, as she had a \\"thing\\" for Ving Rhames. Kurt adds that he likes Rhames, but has no desire to emulate his hairstyle. Rhames played one of the main characters in the film adaptation of Hiaasen's novel Strip Tease.

The aquaculture operation is part of the private business Pesquer√≠as Isla Mayor, S.A. (PIMSA) at Isla Mayor, municipality of Puebla del Rio near Sevilla. PIMSA is part of Hisparroz, the leading Spanish company in rice seed production, is owned by the family Hernandez, whose industrial and commercial strategy is integrated within the group Ebro Foods. It is located on an island in the Guadalquivir river, 10 miles (16 km) inland from the Atlantic Ocean in Seville province of Spain. At 11,000 hectares it is the largest finca in the environs of Do√±ana National Park, and one of the biggest private properties in the province of Seville. It produces 1,200 tons of sea bass, bream, grey mullet, and shrimp each year. The fish food used in the farm's semi-extensive systems (fish in the extensive balsas are left to feed on naturally occurring organisms) contains no dioxins, antibiotics or GMOs. Given its 32 km2 area this gives a yearly yield of 37 tons per square kilometer. The fisheries have attracted more than 200 species of migratory bird, many of which are endangered. History Isla Mayor, as the nerve centre of the marshlands (Las Marismas) of the Bajo Guadalquivir, has seen a long process of transformation over time due to both the natural evolution caused by silting and the effects of human activity. The village and municipality were known as Villafranco del Guadalquivir, in honour of the caudillo General Franco, in 2000 the name was changed to Isla Mayor by popular vote. The first attempts to exploit the resources of the Isla Mayor date back to the 19th century, but it was not till the third decade of the twentieth century that farming really began in the area, thanks to a project carried between 1926 and 1928 by the British company Islas del Rio Guadalquivir Limited. During the Franco years the Veta la Palma Estate was owned by Argentinians who raised beef cattle. In 1982, the Empresa Agropecuaria del Guadalquivir, owner of the estate since 1966, was acquired by the Hisparroz, S.A. group, which transformed it into PIMSA. The Argentinians feared expropriation after Transition and sold up to the Hernandez family, the owners of the rice company Hisparroz and one of the wealthiest families in Spain.http://www.empresia.es/empresa/pesquerias-isla- mayor/http://sevilla.abc.es/economia/20150314/sevi-ebro-food- arroz-201503091157.htmlhttp://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2013/12/22/52b45576268e3e12268b456a.html Though it may have seemed a good idea to plant rice, agricultural activities were soon prohibited in much of the finca under Spain's new environmental legislation.http://www.foodswinesfromspain.com/spanishfoodwine/global/products- recipes/products/more-about-products/4446052.html Another plan was needed. After a brief introductory period, in 1990 PIMSA was authorised by General Directorate for Fisheries of the Andalusian Regional Government, following the Rector Plan for the Use and Management of the Do√±ana National Park (PRUG), to introduce fish farming to the area. Initially using 1,500 acres of the estate, the project was gradually extended to reach 8,000 acres. These are flooded with high quality waters which provide a habitat to the significant population of fish and crustaceans which reared on the farm. A further 8,000 acres are currently dedicated to the dry crops and 1,000 acres to the cultivation of rice. The remaining 12,000 acres are maintained to preserve the original biotope of the marshlands. Ecology Under the new environmental legislation this fish farm had to support a set of services for hydrology and ecology of the marshlands. The extensive and semi-extensive aquaculture has attracted a range of nesting and migratory species of birds. The total bird population of Veta la Palma can reach a figure of 600,000 covering some 250 different species, of which some 50 suffer some degree of threat in other areas. As such the artificial wetland habitat re-created on the estate plays an essential part in the conservation of birds by guaranteeing food both for species which complete their development cycle from birth on the island before migrating and those which, during the course of migration between Africa and Europe stay on the area temporarily to find food.

Background Ekaette was born in 1939 in Ikot Edor, Onna Local Government Area, Akwa Ibom State and died on the 25th of September 2019. He attended King's College, Lagos, graduating in 1960, then went to University College, Ibadan where he earned a B.Sc. in economics in 1964. He joined the Federal Civil Service on 28 July 1964.

On 24 December 2008 he was sworn in as Minister for Niger Delta Affairs. His appointment was criticized by the militant Joint Revolutionary Council, who said that he lacked the drive and leadership required, and questioned the sincerity and commitment of Yar'Adua in making this choice. Talking to oil company executives in February 2009, he said that the low level of development in the Niger Delta region and the crisis in the Niger Delta could have been avoided if the local people had received benefits from oil and gas development. He pointed out that in many cases workers had been brought in from other areas of the country, while locals suffered from pollution and lack of basic facilities. In March 2010 the Joint Revolutionary Council called for the removal of Ekaette for alleged duplication of development projects in the Niger Delta.

He is considered one of the founders of bioinorganic chemistry, studying the interactions of nonliving substances such as metals with biological systems. He is also considered a founder of metalloneurochemistry, the study of metal ions and their effects in the brain and nervous system. He has done pioneering work in understanding protein structure and synthesis, the enzymatic functions of methane monooxygenase (MMO), and the mechanisms of cisplatin anticancer drugs. His work has applications for the treatment of cancer, for bioremediation of the environment, and for the development of synthetic methanol-based fuels. Education Lippard was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1958. He earned his bachelor's degree from Haverford College in 1962. Originally interested in attending medical school, a talk on medicinal chemistry by visiting chemist Francis P.J. Dwyer inspired Lippard to focus on inorganic chemistry for his Ph.D. Lippard worked with F. Albert Cotton at MIT on Rhenium oxo complexes and clusters. He completed the thesis Chemistry of the bromorhenates, receiving his Ph.D. from MIT in 1965. Career Lippard joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1966 as an Assistant Professor. He was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 1969 and full Professor in 1972. In 1983, Lippard returned to MIT as a Professor of Chemistry. He has held the Arthur Amos Noyes Professorship of Chemistry at MIT since 1989. He and his wife Judy were housemasters at MIT's MacGregor House from 1991 to 1995. Lippard served as the head of the MIT chemistry department from 1995 to 2005. He is recognized for his scientific work and for his work with students, having mentored more than 100 PhDs. His students are active in a wide range of areas, in part because \\"He delivers a strong message that you need to go to the frontier of science and pick interesting problems.\\" Forty percent of his graduate students have been women, who he gives \\"high-risk, high-reward projects\\". Lippard has co-authored over 900 scholarly and professional articles, and co-authored the textbook Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry (1994) with Jeremy Berg. He edited the book series Progress in Inorganic Chemistry from Volume 11 to 40. He was an Associate Editor of the journal Inorganic Chemistry from 1983 to 1989, and an Associate Editor of the Journal of the American Chemical Society from 1989 to 2013, as well as serving on the editorial boards of numerous other journals. Research Lippard's research activities are at the interface of biology and inorganic chemistry. Lippard focuses on understanding the physical and structural properties of metal complexes, their synthesis and reactions, and the involvement of metal ions in biological systems. The formation and breaking of molecular bonds underlie many biochemical transformations. Purely inorganic substances such as iron are often required in essential organic reactions, e.g. oxygen binding in the hemoglobin family. Lippard attempts to better understand the role of metal complexes in the physiology and pathology of existing biological systems, and to identify possible applications of metal ions in medical treatment. He has made major contributions in a number of areas, including the development of platinum-based anticancer drugs such as the cisplatin family. Another area of interest is the structure and function of methane and enzymes that consume greenhouse gas hydrocarbons. In metalloneurochemistry, he studies the molecular activity of metal ions in the brain and develops optical and MRI sensors for binding, tracking, and measuring metal ions as they interact with neurotransmitters and other biological signaling agents. Cisplatin Cisplatin Cisplatin is one of the most frequently used chemotherapy medications for many forms of cancer. It was discovered in the 1960s by Barnett Rosenberg, but its mechanism of action was not understood. Early work in Lippard's lab on the interaction of metal complexes with nucleic acids led to the discovery of the first metallo- intercalators and eventually to the understanding of the mechanisms of cisplatin. Lippard and his students examined sequences of DNA and RNA and incorporated sulfur atoms into the sugar-phosphate backbone, where they selectively bound mercury or platinum complexes to specific positions. Karen Jennette's discovery that sterically encumbered platinum complexes were more successful in binding to sulfur atoms in tRNA than mercury salts led researchers to propose that the platinum complexes intercalated between the double-stranded RNA's base pairs. It was the first experimental demonstration to show a metal complex binding to DNA by intercalation: platinum terpyridine complexes inserted between the DNA base pairs and unwound the double helix. Using fiber X-ray diffraction, Peter Bond and others were able to display the intercalated platinum complex and to confirm predictions that the spacing of intercalators in DNA base pairs would follow the neighbor exclusion rule. This established the groundwork for subsequent work on intercalative binding. Jacqueline Barton and others have used electron micrography to show that the covalent binding of platinum complexes changes the supercoiling of the DNA, \\"bending and unwinding\\" the double helix. Further experiments have explored the mechanisms through which platinum drugs bind their biological targets and led to insights into their anticancer activity. Important results include the identification of an intrastrand d(pGpG) cross-link as the major adduct on platinated single-stranded DNA, identification of the major adduct on double- stranded DNA, the binding of high-mobility-group proteins to platinated DNA cross-links. Using X-ray crystallography and other techniques, Lippard and his coworkers have examined the mechanisms involved in binding cisplatin to DNA fragments, to better understand how cisplatin invades tumor cells and interferes with their activity. The interaction of Cisplatin and DNA results in the formation of DNA-DNA interstrand and intrastrand crosslinks which block DNA replication and transcription mechanisms. As well as the intrastrand cross links created by cisplatin, monofunctional metal complexes may suggest possible cancer treatments. A related line of research in Lippard's laboratory involves platinum blues. Jacqueline Barton was the first person to synthesize and structurally characterize a crystalline platinum blue, pyridone blue. Since then, extensive research has been done on the structure, properties, and reactions of such complexes. Methane monooxygenases Particulate methane monooxygenase Members of the Lippard laboratory studying macromolecular crystallography have explored the structure, mechanisms and activity of bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases. Methane monooxygenases are enzymes that occur in bacteria called methanotrophs. The primary function of this enzyme is the hydroxylation of methane to methanol as the first step in methane metabolism. Amy Rosenzweig determined the protein x-ray structure of the soluble form of methane monooxygenase (MMO) as Lippard's graduate student. Lippard has used X-ray diffraction and a variety of other methods to study such compounds, greatly expanding our understanding of their structure and function. MMO is vital to Earth's carbon cycle, and knowledge of its structure may help to develop clean technologies for methanol-based fuels. Methane monoxygenases may also be useful for bioremediation. Iron complexes Lippard and his students have also studied the synthesis of diiron complexes such as diiron hydroxylase to better understand the activities of metal atoms in biological molecules. They have developed model compounds for carboxylate- bridged diiron metalloenzymes which can be compared with corresponding biological forms. They have synthesized analogues of the diiron carboxylate cores of MMO and related carboxylate-bridged diiron proteins such as the dioxygen transporter hemerythrin. In 2010, Lippard received the Ronald Breslow Award for his work on nonheme iron proteins. Also exciting was the synthesis of a \\"molecular ferric wheel\\" by Kingsley Taft, the first wheel structure to be observed in self-assembled polymetallic chemistry. A nearly perfect circle containing ten ferric ions, the structure spontaneously assembled in methanolic solutions of diiron(III) oxo complexes, which were being studied to better understand polyiron oxo protein cores like those of hemerythrin. Although no particular use is known for the ferric wheel, it and subsequent ring-shaped homometallic molecular clusters are of interest as a subclass of molecular magnets. Another novel complex was a \\"ferric triple-decker\\", containing three parallel triangular iron units and a triple bridge of six citrate ligands. Metalloneurochemistry Lippard is considered a founder of metalloneurochemistry, the study of metal ions at the molecular level as they affect the brain and the nervous system. Working at the interface of inorganic chemistry and neuroscience, he has devised fluorescent imaging agents for studying mobile zinc and nitric oxide and their effects on neurotransmission and other forms of biological signaling. Companies In 2011 Lippard founded Blend Therapeutics with Omid Cameron Farokhzad and Robert Langer, in Watertown, Massachusetts. Blend focused on developing anti-cancer medicines for treatment of solid tumor cancers, with the goal of targeting cancerous tissue and leaving healthy cells alone. Its proprietary drug candidates included BTP-114, a cisplatin prodrug, and BTP-277, a targeting ligand designed to bond selectively to tumor cells. As of 2016, Blend split off into two separate companies: Tarveda and Placon, to follow these two approaches. Placon Therapeutics is developing platinum-based cancer therapies. These include BTP-114, the first clinical candidate to use an albumin- conjugating, platinum-prodrug platform, based on Lippard's work. BTP-114 has been cleared for Phase 1 cancer-treatment clinical trials by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Tarveda Therapeutics is developing BTP-277 (renamed PEN-221) and other Pentarins, a proprietary class of therapeutics which use peptide ligands to carry a target drug to tumor cells. Pentarins are nanoparticle drugs, similar to antibody-drug conjugates but smaller, that have been described as \\"mini-smart bombs\\". They are believed to be capable of penetrating dense tumor-based cancers. Honors and awards Lippard has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the National Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He is an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (2002), the Italian Chemical Society (1996), and the German National Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina) (2004), and is an external scientific member of the Max-Planck Institute (1996) in Germany. He has received honorary Doctorate of Science degrees from Haverford College, Texas A&M; University, and the University of South Carolina, and an honorary Doctorate degree from Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Lippard has received many awards throughout his career, most notably the 2004 National Medal of Science, the 2014 Priestley Medal of the American Chemical Society, its highest award, and the 2014 James R. Killian lectureship at MIT, given to one faculty member of the Institute per year. He is also the recipient of the Linus Pauling Medal, Theodore W. Richards Medal, and the William H. Nichols Medal. For his work in bioinorganic and biomimetic chemistry, Lippard received the Ronald Breslow Award and the Alfred Bader Award from the American Chemical Society (ACS). For research in inorganic and organometallic chemistry, as well as his role as an educator, he was honored with ACS awards for Inorganic Chemistry and for Distinguished Service in Inorganic Chemistry. In 2015, Lippard won the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Chemistry bestowed by The Franklin Institute. In 2016, he received the F. A. Cotton Medal for excellence in chemical research and the Welch Award in Chemistry from the Robert A. Welch Foundation. In 2017, he was chosen to receive the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal. Personal life Stephen Lippard married Judith Ann Drezner in 1964. They have two sons, Josh and Alex, a daughter-in-law Sandra, and twin granddaughters, Lucy and Annie. Judy Lippard died on September 9, 2013. Steve moved to Washington, DC, in 2017, where he remains active in science, writing, consulting, and grandfathering, while expanding his harpsichord playing and cooking skills.

She is a founding member of the music group Bananarama. The group have achieved 28 UK Top 50 and 11 US Top 100 singles, including a US number one with \\"Venus\\" (1986). Other hits include \\"Cruel Summer\\" (1983), \\"I Heard a Rumour\\" (1987) and \\"Love in the First Degree\\" (1987). Dallin and bandmate Keren Woodward are the only performers to appear on both the 1984 and 1989 Band Aid versions of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\". Bananarama have sold over 30 million records and entered the Guinness Book of World Records for achieving most UK chart entries by an all-female group, a record they still hold. Early life Dallin is of English, French and Irish ancestry. She studied journalism at the London College of Fashion (University of Arts) in 1980‚Äì81. She formed the group Bananarama with Keren Woodward, her childhood friend, and Siobhan Fahey, whom she met at college. In 1980, Dallin and Woodward met Paul Cook, ex-member of the Sex Pistols, in a club and they became fast friends. They sang backing vocals for his and Steve Jones' new band The Professionals, and had their first taste of the music business, recording demos in famous Denmark Street. When the house they were living in closed for renovation, Paul offered them a place to live in what used to be band impresario Malcolm McLaren's office above the Sex Pistols' old rehearsal room in Denmark Street. The two would come in from clubbing and plug the guitars in and have late-night jams. Dallin first appeared on stage with Woodward and friend Mel O'Brien at the Camden Palace (now Koko) with their friend Vaughn Toulouse's band, Department S. Dallin, Woodward and Fahey first appeared on stage (in what would become Bananarama) with the Monochrome Set (friends of Siobhan) at the Rainbow Theatre supporting Iggy Pop. The trio then started rehearsing with musician friends and recorded their first demo \\"Aie A Mwana\\", which they performed at various clubs around London, such as (Colonel Barefoot's Rock Garden, The Embassy and The Wag Club). They came to the attention of Demon Records, signed a one-off singles deal, and \\"Aie A Mwana\\" was released. It was played by legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who championed young bands. Terry Hall (ex-Specials) heard the track and bought it, then saw a photo of Bananarama in what was referred to as the 'style bible', a magazine called The Face. He had just formed a group called Fun Boy Three and contacted them to ask if they would sing on some tracks on their new album. The single release It Ain't What You Do (It's The Way That You Do It) became a top-five hit, propelling Bananarama into the limelight. Career Dallin, Fahey and Woodward formed Bananarama and released their first single, \\"Aie a Mwana\\", in 1981. The trio went on to have a string of top 10 hits in the UK, including \\"Shy Boy\\" (1982), \\"Robert De Niro's Waiting\\" (1984) and \\"Love in the First Degree\\" (1987). They also achieved international success, including in the United States, where they had top 10 hits with \\"Cruel Summer\\" (1984), \\"Venus\\" (number one in 1986) and \\"I Heard A Rumour\\" (1987). Fahey's replacement in 1988 was Jacquie O'Sullivan, with hits in this period including \\"I Want You Back\\" (1988). Dallin and Woodward were the only artists from the original 1984 Band Aid to also feature on the 1989 version. O'Sullivan left in 1991; Dallin and Woodward continued as a duo until 2017, when they reunited with Fahey. The original line-up of Bananarama received the Icon Award at the Glamour Awards in June 2017. Personal life Dallin was engaged to former Bananarama dancer Bassey Walker, with whom she had a daughter, Alice, in 1991, but they later separated.

The character first appears on-screen on 16 April 2010; she is introduced as a new love interest for Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment). Soon after her arrival she gets a job at the Underworld factory. Upon her debut, she was heralded as the soap's first disabled regular character in 50 years. Izzy was the first member of the Armstrong family to be introduced, her father Owen and sister Katy arrived within two months after her first appearance and is currently the only remaining member of the Armstrong family, following Owen and Katy's departures in early 2015. Storylines In April 2010, Izzy goes to The Rovers Return Inn for her date with Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment), having arranged to meet him, via an online dating site. Disaster strikes when she spots Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) - who she believes to be Kirk as Kirk used Jason's photo on his profile, much to Jason's surprise. As Izzy storms out, she bumps into Gary Windass (Mikey North) and they argue. Gary takes a shine to her feistiness and when he bumps into her again later in the day, there's a clear spark. On 7 May, Kirk arranges another date with Izzy and this time, it goes well, as the conversation flows easily. She meets Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) but snaps at David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) and Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) for spying on them and accuses Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) of talking down to her. Izzy then bosses Kirk into applying for a job as a machinist at Underworld, making Kirk begin to wonder what he's let himself in for. When Carla Connor (Alison King) turns Kirk down, Izzy demands an explanation; Carla refuses to change her mind but offers Izzy a job as she is impressed by her spirit. Izzy, however, is worried about telling Kirk; however, he reassures her that he never really wanted the job and is happy when Carla offers him a job driving a delivery van. In June 2010, Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) blows up Underworld, killing himself and Robbie Sloan (James Fleet), leaving her and her new colleagues jobless. The same day, her father Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) arrives at The Rovers while she is talking to Gary and she snaps at him for following her. Izzy and the other factory girls start work for Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) but Carla puts a stop to Nick's new business and reclaims her staff while Owen gets the contract to rebuild Underworld, annoying Izzy and Bill Webster (Peter Armitage). In August, Bill accidentally drops cement on her from some scaffolding, causing an argument when Owen tells Bill that he is too old to be a builder as he has just endangered Izzy. However, she steps in by telling Owen that the only one who treats her as disabled is him. Izzy is secretly delighted when she sees Gary again in September. They arrange to meet for a drink but he stands her up when Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) seduces him. Izzy is not pleased to see them together the next day, calling Gary names for sleeping around but when Izzy is insulted in The Rovers, Gary steps in. This leads to a fight outside the pub and Gary is questioned by the police. Izzy feels bad about this and urges Kirk, who saw the fight, not to tell the police anything so Gary will not be prosecuted. When Kirk, who secretly fancies Izzy, tells the police that he started the fight, Izzy softens towards Gary and tells him that she is glad that he is free. In November, Izzy is shocked to hear that Gary has been injured and one of his best friends, Luke \\"Quinny\\" Quinn (Steven Bell), has been killed. Gary comes home a few days later and Izzy becomes concerned about Gary's aggressive behaviour and withdrawn manner as it is clear he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In January 2011, she asks Owen to give Gary a job at the builder's yard and he agrees but sacks him after Gary attacks him and Jason when he is accidentally locked in the van. Owen tells Izzy he won't report him if she ends her relationship with him but Izzy defiantly refuses. In July 2011, Izzy is robbed by a gang of teenagers. After learning this, Gary becomes very overprotective and takes her wheelchair away so she can't leave. When Izzy's sister, Katy (Georgia May Foote) and her boyfriend Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) visit, Gary tells them that she is asleep but Katy refuses to take no for an answer and tells Owen that Gary is acting strangely so he kicks the front door down when Gary refuses to answer, to find Gary and Izzy in the corner, crying. Gary lets Izzy go and recognizing that he needs help, gets counselling for his Post-Traumatic Stress. Izzy, scared by Gary's mental state, asks him to move out so he returns to live with Anna and on Christmas Day 2011, Izzy and Gary reunite, much to the delight of Gary's sister, Faye, who has been attempting to reunite the two. In July 2012, Izzy tells Fiz that she is pregnant and Fiz persuades her to tell Gary. He is excited but she is worried about health problems for her and the baby until Dr. Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor) reassures her that the pregnancy should be relatively risk-free. She tells her family but Owen is sceptical and Izzy miscarries. Not wanting to risk miscarrying again as her health problems mean that she is more at risk, Izzy tells Katy that she isn't willing to try again, so she and Gary look into adopting. However, Gary's criminal history and mental health issues after Afghanistan mean he will not be allowed to adopt so when Izzy and Gary start talking about surrogates, Katy offers to help but Chesney, remembering how ill Katy was when she was pregnant with their son Joseph, is unhappy and asks Katy not to do it. Seeing Chesney's frustration and having doubts of her own, Izzy tells Katy that they won't be going ahead. However, in September, Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) tells Owen that she would be interested if the price was right as she and her boyfriend, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain), are in a lot of debt. Tommy, like Chesney, is not happy about the idea but Tina ignores him. Tommy insists that she tell Izzy and Gary that she has changed her mind or he'll leave her. Tina initially agrees but when Owen demands they repay the money that he has already paid them and leave his flat, Tina goes ahead with the implantation process. Much to Tommy's disappointment, Tina's pregnancy is confirmed two weeks later and it becomes public knowledge after she faints in the street. Norris overhears Gary say that Tina is pregnant and everyone assumes she and Tommy are the parents but Tommy, struggling to cope with the situation, reveals the truth in the Rovers. Disgusted with Tommy's behaviour, Tina ends their relationship. Izzy begins to feel left out when Gary and Tina go to antenatal classes together. When Tina finds out, she promises to involve her more. However, Gary becomes smitten with Tina and ends up making a pass at her, but Tina rejects him. Tina and Gary agree to keep it a secret but Izzy overhears them talking about it. As Izzy and Gary argue, Tina goes into premature labour and has the baby. Gary and Izzy name him \\"Jake\\", a name which Tina, who is becoming increasingly attached to the baby, is unimpressed with. As the baby's life hangs in the balance, Izzy refuses to allow Gary near him. When Tina realises how much they are arguing, she tells them neither of them can see the baby until they sort it out. Izzy and Gary agree to stop arguing but are devastated when Tina tells them that she's keeping the baby and renames him Joe, after her late father Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale). After visiting lawyers, they realise it will take years to win; Tina is legally Joe's mother as she gave birth to him. Izzy gives up, telling Tina she can keep him. However, seeing how much she loves Joe, Tina decides to give him back to Izzy and Gary, who change his name back to Jake. Shortly after, Izzy forgives Gary for making a pass at Tina and he moves back in with her. In 2015, Izzy and Katy's estranged mother, Linda Hancock (Jacqueline Leonard), arrives from Portugal after a lengthy absence, having abandoned Izzy when she was a child. Izzy is disgusted with her, but they soon make amends and Katy agrees to join Linda in Portugal to start a new life with Joseph. In 2016, Izzy starts using marijuana to relieve her chronic pain. She is arrested for buying cannabis and assaulting a Police Officer. She loses her temper in court. The court expresses sympathy for her, but is nonetheless she is sentenced to two months in prison. Character creation and casting Izzy grew up in a council house with her family. Her father Owen was faithful but her mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict who cheated on her husband. Izzy's mother left Owen for a man called Billy Jefferson. The character of Izzy was announced in early 2010 as a love interest for Kirk. It was announced that Izzy would be played by actress Cherylee Houston. Shortly afterwards the character's father was also confirmed to appear in Coronation Street in mid June 2010 along with her younger sister. Izzy is a wheelchair user. Commenting on her casting Cherylee Houston said \\"I‚Äôm really excited and well chuffed to be joining the show. I grew up with Coronation Street and I can‚Äôt wait to get start. I‚Äôm really looking forward to getting my teeth into the character.\\" Cherylee began filming in February 2010 and signed a contract for an initial seven episodes, which was soon extended for six months. Izzy is described as having a feisty and fiery personality. She is usually attracted to bad boys and has been known in the past to be a heartbreaker due to her troubled background and messy romantic history. During the character's first episode she clashes with regulars such as Jason Grimshaw, Anna Windass and Gary Windass, establishing the character's strong personality. A few weeks later she clashes with other strong characters such as Liz McDonald to whom Liz takes a disliking. Izzy's surname was initially intended to be Butterfield, although by the transmission of her first episode it had been changed to Armstrong. On her introduction to the programme, the character of Izzy was promoted as Coronation Street's first disabled regular, although Maud Grimes, who first appeared in 1993, also used a wheelchair. In one of Izzy's early scenes, viewers see Eddie Windass (Steve Huison) insult the feisty newcomer by telling Kirk: \\"You don't want to go out with a bird in a wheelchair.\\" Asked how disabled viewers will have felt about the remark, Houston replied: \\"They were probably going, 'Thank God that's showing reality\\". Shortly after her first scenes producers were pleased with her impact and decided to introduce a family for her. Houston said in July 2012 that she is starting to adopt Izzy's accent, adding that she is a bit more diplomatic than Izzy is and does not fly off the handle as fast. Houston continued: \\"She can be quite dogmatic when she gets something between her teeth - she's always ready to bark!\\" Reception Actress Cherylee Houston was Nominated for Best Newcomer at the Inside Soap Awards 2010 for her portrayal of Izzy Armstrong but lost out to Emmett J. Scanlan, who plays Brendan Brady in Hollyoaks.

The authors argue that their findings reveal an unacceptable level of disparities in grant rates, noting that the asylum adjudicators studied heard large numbers of cases from the same country in the same location over the same period of time. The study concludes with recommendations for reforming the immigration adjudication system.

During recent years, Sydney has experienced some freshwater shortages Australia is the driest habitable continent on Earth and its installed desalination capacity has been increasing. Until a few decades ago, Australia met its demands for water by drawing freshwater from dams and water catchments. As a result of the water supply crisis during the severe 1997‚Äì2009 drought, state governments began building desalination plants that purify seawater using reverse osmosis technology. Approximately one percent of the world's drinkable water originates from desalination plants. The first modern large-scale desalination plant was the Kwinana plant in Perth, completed in November 2006 and over 30 plants are currently operating across the country. Many plants are utilizing nearby wind or wave farms to use renewable energy and reduce operating costs, and solar powered desalination units are used for remote communities.  Background  Until a few decades ago, Australia met its demands for water by drawing freshwater from dams and water catchments. However, during 2000-2010 a significant lack of rainfall drained water reservoirs.El Saliby, I., Y. Okour, et al. (2009). \\"Desalination plants in Australia, review and facts.\\" Desalination 247(1-3): 1‚Äì14. The most affected cities were the capitals, where there is high uncertainty in water supply and demand. In 2007, Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales, experienced a dramatic drop of its main dam Warragamba, where water levels dropped to 33% of normal. Australia‚Äôs first desalination plant was constructed in 1903 to treat saline groundwater in the gold fields of Western Australia at Kalgoorlie.Heath, J. \\"The Water Supply in Hearth Australia.\\" July 2007 Web. 28 April 2010 Several desalination plants were built in Australia between 1960 and 1980, especially following the revolution in membrane technology that made reverse osmosis economically viable, but vapor-compression desalination and multi-stage flash distillation plants were also built. By 2002, however, only two reverse osmosis desalination plants were still operating, one on Kangaroo Island and the other on Rottnest Island. Seawater reverse osmosis is the only type of desalination technology currently used for large-scale desalination plants in Australia, the most important of these plants being located in Perth and Sydney.  Methods  Compared to existing sources, desalination is considered to be expensive, but research is underway to develop more effective desalination technology.Barron, O. \\"Desalination options and their possible implementation in Western Australia.\\" CSIRO. June 2006. Despite its drawbacks, it is considered a possible solution to the country's water shortages. Australia is the driest inhabitable continent on earth and its installed desalination capacity is around 1% of the total world‚Äôs desalination capacity. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has considered several desalination technologies processes in Australia: *Reverse osmosis *Electrodialysis *Multi-stage flash distillation *Multiple-effect distillation *Vapor-compression desalination *Solar humidification *Membrane Distillation ROSI A solar powered desalination unit designed for remote communities has been tested in the Northern Territory. The reverse osmosis solar installation (ROSI) uses membrane filtration to provide a reliable and clean drinking water stream from sources such as brackish groundwater. Solar energy overcomes the usually high-energy operating costs as well as greenhouse emissions of conventional reverse osmosis systems. A photovoltaic solar array tracks the Sun and powers the pumps needed to process the water, using the plentiful sunlight available in remote regions of Australia not served by the power grid.  Desalination plants  In Australia many desalination plants are utilizing wind farms to produce enough energy to operate nearby desalination plants. For example, the Kurnell Desalination Plant, with a capacity of producing 250 million liters (ML) of drinking water per day, supplies 15% of Sydney‚Äôs water needs via RO technology and is powered using \\"100 percent renewable energy\\" from the 140 MW Capital Wind Farm.Desalination. \\"Sydney Water.

The Garden Island plant, currently planned for commissioning in 2014, will be powered by wave energy, using Carnegie Wave Energy's CETO system. This system uses submerged buoys to pressurize water offshore, which is piped onshore to either drive turbines for electricity generation or as in this case, to directly desalinate seawater. The Garden Island project is a commercial scale demonstration project, which follows a pilot project off the coast of Fremantle, Western Australiahttp://www.carnegiewave.com/ Construction of Adelaide Desalination Plant The availability of renewable resources as well as their fluctuation in electricity production from region to region requires a customized design for each desalination facility. In order to maintain steady-state operations many facilities utilize renewable energy while connected to a smart grid, importing or exporting energy to the plant as required. The Perth Seawater Desalination Plant utilizes this strategy where 48 wind turbines produce 80MW on the Emu Downs Wind Farm to provide an overall 24MW to the desalination plant.Perth Seawater Desalination Plant, Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO), Kwinana, Australia\\".

He was one of the first academics to propose a historical approach to the study of religion. He was editor-in-chief of the journal Numen and president of the International Association for the History of Religions from 1950-1959. Biography Raffaele Pettazzoni was born 1883 in San Giovanni in Persiceto (Bologna, Italy), graduated in literature and specialized in the capital of Emilia in 1905 with a degree in archeology at the Italian School of Archaeology. In 1909 he was appointed Inspector to the Prehistoric and Ethnographic Museum in Rome. In 1923 he took the position of chair of the Royal University of Rome, and in 1924 presented his first university course in the history of religions. Pettazzoni introduced this discipline in the Italian academic world and went on to become one of the most important figures. Among his students in Rome there were also Angelo Brelich and Dario Sabbatucci, two other major historians of religions that have founded the so-called \\"Roman school (Scuola di Roma).\\" He was director of the History of Religions and Folklore of the Italian Encyclopedia from 1925 to 1937 and in 1933 he was named Academic of Italy, and in 1938 signed the Manifesto of Race. He was the first to apply the methods of comparative history to the study of religions. Following the end of World War II he was a member of the national Accademia dei Lincei, President of the International Association of History of Religions in 1950 and Editor of Numen. He retired from teaching at the end of the 1952-1953 academic year having reached retirement age. He died in 1959. Influence Pettazzoni was among the first to propose a historical approach to the study of religion and helped institutionalize \\"History of religions\\" as an autonomous historical discipline in Italy. He is the founder of the Italian school of History of Religions (1920s) and the journal Studies and materials of history of religions (1925). Comparison of different forms of religion are not limited to a single field, Pettazzoni writes in God's omniscience. His seven hundred page work was the culmination of a lifetime of research that challenges the theories of Wilhelm Schmidt. During his clerical studies he struggled against the Catholic Church's monopoly on religious studies in Italy and against such anti-clerical secularist academics as Benedetto Croce who held the study of religions to be an academically lazy and uninteresting discipline. Thought A significant part of Pettazzoni's work was devoted to refuting the theory of primordial monotheism (Urmonotheismus) developed by Schmidt and the study of the conceptions of the Supreme Being in primitive religions. He found evidence of monotheism in so-called primitive societies, and that all societies recognize the Supreme Being as a non-exclusive spiritual entity which is paramount by also opposed by other spiritual entities. He challenged Schmidt's concept of a Supreme Being as necessarily entailing monotheism. Rather, Pettazzoni writes that monotheism is a recent religious development over the course of a slow revolution in polytheism and perhaps henotheism. This debate is carried on by Old Testament prophets who wrangle with the Canaanite god and affirm the ethical monotheism of Israel and one exclusive transcendent deity coexisting with lesser ones. Schmidt confused science and theology, Pettazzoni writes in the booklet The supreme being in primitive religions, 1957. For Pettazzoni the idea of god in primitive religions is not an a priori concept independent of historical contexts; there is only the historical and arises from varying existential conditions within each type of society. It is only within that societal context that the idea of God can satisfy, the Supreme Being does not exist a priori. Therefore, one finds the Supreme Being defined variously as the one who sends the rain, the protector of the hunt, or even an associated with the earth in agrarian societies‚Äîunique historical contexts that give rise to their own particular conception of the Supreme Being. Pettazzoni argues that religion is a historical product conditioned by historical and social context with unique influence on other cultural realities within the same society. As a historical product, Pettazzoni noted that a plurality of stories is a plurality of religions: every nation has its own history and thus their religion and their answers to the great problems of humanity. What makes religion different from other social and cultural phenomena is its significance in the rites of passage: the religion, therefore, concerns the important moments of life of the individual. For Pettazzoni it is important in the study of religion to preserve a religion's specificity as a cultural product, and requires a particular method. Specifically, Pettazzoni adopted comparative history which shared much in common with the comparative method in classical anthropology favored by British scientists studying affinities and analogies between cultures.

Composition and lyrics  The song is notable for its hard rock sound and lyrics that use biblical images to explain the relationship between a father and son (symbolised as Adam and his son, Cain). Springsteen calls this song \\"emotionally autobiographical.\\" The bitter but loving relationship between the father and son is similar to Springsteen's with his own father. Springsteen once said: \\"Our actual relationship was probably more complicated than how I presented it. Those songs were ways that I spoke to my father at the time, because he didn't speak and we didn't talk very much.\\" Adam Raised A Cain by Bruce Springsteen Songfacts In the 2010 documentary The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, sound mixer Chuck Plotkin described Springsteen's instructions for how the jarring assault of this song should sound next to the more melodic tunes on Darkness. Springsteen told Plotkin to think of a movie showing two lovers having a picnic, when the scene suddenly cuts to a dead body. This song, the singer explained, is that body. Springsteen and the E Street Band released a longer version of the song on their 1986 live album Live/1975‚Äì85.  Use in the media  The song was used in the film Baby It's You, directed by John Sayles, who would also direct Springsteen's video clips for \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", \\"I'm on Fire\\" and \\"Glory Days\\". The song was used in Season 7 during the opening scene of episode 13 \\"Papa's Goods,\\" the series finale of Sons of Anarchy. The creator of Sons of Anarchy Kurt Sutter originally wanted to use the song as a cover in the final episode of Season 3, but there were issues with licensing from Sony and Springsteen did not like the idea of a cover of his song. An agreement was finally reached where the song would be played in its original version for the series finale.

The glebe, which lay south- west of the church, carried pasturage rights for a horse, two cows, and forty sheep. Dawyck church lands, under reservation of the glebe, were feued in 1580 by Robert Douglas, titled the 'perpetual vicar' of Stobo, with consent of the archbishop, dean and chapter of Glasgow, to John Tweedie, tutor of Drumelzier, and are described as the vicarage lands of Dayik, with the pasturage of 38 soums of sheep; reserving four acres of land and the manse to the reader of the church.

Early years Helstein was born in Duluth, Minnesota on December 11, 1908 to an orthodox Jewish family. When he was an infant, his father, a garment manufacturer, moved the household to Minneapolis. There, the Helstein family was part of the city's small but tight knit Jewish community, which came with its challenges. \\"As I was growing up, I had a strong feeling about this question of discrimation,\\" recounted Helstein. \\"Part of it may be because I was Jewish and when I was a kid, the kids would go along yelling 'sheeny' and I'd be excluded.\\" There, Mr. Helstein graduated from the University of Minnesota, receiving a degree in English literature. Helstein first aspired to a career in medicine, but dropped out of pre-med after he didn't see his name on a posted list of students who successfully passed a required examination.

He organized his first large music festival for alternative station KUKQ in Phoenix, Arizona in 1989, years before the launch of festivals like Lollapalooza and the KROQ Weenie Roasts. For this reason, he is often called the \\"father of all radio festivals.\\" History Jonathan L left his parents' Long Island home at age 14 and lived as a street urchin with a gang of juveniles. After quitting school and being convicted of assault charges, he spent three years incarcerated in various juvenile institutions. He was out and on parole shortly before his 18th birthday, and took a job as a parts man for Mack Trucks. He also began writing for an underground newspaper in Long Island called The Express. In 1973, Jonathan L left New York and headed for Berkeley, California. He fell ill when he and his wife stopped to visit friends in Tucson, Arizona, and they ended up staying there for the next thirteen years. He began self-publishing a monthly pop culture magazine called Newsreal. The publication was known for its eclectic mix of music artists, putting such stars as Joan Jett and B.B. King on the same cover. Begun in 1974, Newsreal‚Äôs circulation reached 20,000 before the publication folded in 1985. While on a summer hiatus in 1978 in New York City, Jonathan L was the editor for two issues of Drugs & Paraphernalia Digest, with the former publisher of High Times magazine. Career in Radio Jonathan L's radio career began in March, 1982 in Tucson, Arizona at 96 Rock KLPX with his creation, \\"Virgin Vinyl.\\" The show ran for more than four years on Sunday evenings for five hours from 7 p.m. to midnight. Among the many live guests were Henry Rollins as a co-host, Joey Ramone, The Circle Jerks, Huey Lewis, and the Meat Puppets. The music encompassed everything from Metallica to Leon Russell. In the summer of 1986, Jonathan moved up to Mesa, Arizona to start up alternative station KEYX 100.3 with his friend John \\"Johnny D\\" Dixon, referred to as \\"the key to your musical future.\\" The station ended in late 1987. Many felt it was far too ahead of its time. Jonathan was the assistant program director and music director, and held down the 7 p.m. to midnight shift Monday though Friday. In 1988, Jonathan L was hired by Phoenix rock station 98 KUPD, where he hosted \\"Virgin Vinyl\\" on Sunday nights until 1992. The show, which included everything from Suicidal Tendencies to a then-unheard band named Nirvana, was a huge hit in Phoenix, and garnered several \\"Best Radio Show\\" awards from the Phoenix New Times, which called Jonathan L \\"a thoroughly modern mouthpiece\\" who played \\"forward-looking wax attacks.\\" 3.Phoenix New Times, February 17‚Äì23, 1988 In 1986, they wrote of \\"Virgin Vinyl\\": \\"When this colorful Sunday night waxfest was imported from Tucson this year, it slapped the lethargic Phoenix radio market right in the face.\\"4.Phoenix New Times: Best of Phoenix, 1986 Simultaneously in 1989, Jonathan L founded and became program director for KUKQ AM, Phoenix's first all-alternative music station. He left KUKQ in 1992 to work for station KFMA in Wickenburg, Arizona. After a short stint there, he returned to KUKQ to retake over the helm as program director and again did his show \\"Virgin Vinyl\\" until he left in 1993 to join Phoenix station KDKB, where he did his award-winning \\"Virgin Vinyl\\" until 1995.3.Phoenix New Times, February 17‚Äì23, 1988 By the late ‚Äò90s, Jonathan L was considered a national go-to guy for alternative radio, and in a 1996 interview with New York Now, he rightly predicted \\"more British and rhythm- driven music shaking up the mid-90s cabal of American-born alterna-rock bands.\\" 7.New York Now, November 11, 1996, by Jim Farber He once again returned to KUKQ from mid-1994 to mid-19956.R & R, February 5, 1993 to run the station in its wildest punk rock form. Among his most popular programs was \\"The Monday Morning Music Meeting Live,\\" which gave listeners a chance to phone in and provide their own input on the music, which was added to the rotation that day.5.The Arizona Republic, August 29, 1994, by Julie Newberg In August 2005, Jonathan L returned once again to 98 KUPD, where he hosted and programmed \\"The Lopsided World of L\\" on Saturday mornings and Sunday nights in prime time live. Jonathan L remained there until his retirement from stateside radio in 2010. Album Network Years In the fall of 1995, Rosen left Phoenix (and radio) to accept an opportunity to become senior editor of the long time, now defunct, music industry trade publication the Album Network. He took control of \\"Virtually Alternative\\" magazine, one of many music format magazines the Album Network published. The monthly was not only informative, but tongue-in-cheek, which Jonathan felt was a must for radio programmers. At the same time, Rosen wrote a weekly column in Album Network, \\"Pleasantly Annoying\\", a phrase that he has become well known for in both publishing and radio. Radio wasn't gone totally during his tenure. Through the Album Network's radio syndication he was asked to host radio specials for The Cranberries, Social Distortion, Kula Shaker, and Oasis that were run by radio stations throughout the United States. The aggressive mouthpiece of alternative radio was asked to moderate panels at music industry conventions, as he had done before back in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2000, at a convention Album Network put on in New York city dubbed Y2K, Jonathan organized and hosted a panel of musicians to speak about everything from their careers to their personal lives in front of a packed house. The guest speakers were Ronnie Spector (The Ronettes), Glenn Danzig (Danzig), and Dee Snider (Twisted Sister). Jonathan was friends with Spector and Danzig, and thought they had more appeal and more to offer than many of the available alternative artists of that time period. Joey Ramone, also a friend, was the confirmed 4th panelist, but fell ill and couldn't make it. In 1999, Jonathan was given Vice President stripes as SFX (and later Clear Channel) bought the Album Network and all its properties. After more than six and a half years, Rosen left the Network Magazine Group in 2002 to launch his own independent record promotion company which he operated until 2005. In the summer of that year, Rosen decided to leave Los Angeles and go back to radio, this time to do \\"Lopsided World Of L\\" at KUPD-FM in Phoenix. Music Festivals In 1989, Jonathan L organized one of the first large-scale radio festivals in the United States, for KUKQ. The bill included the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Camper Van Beethoven. Subsequent KUKQ festivals (there were two each year) included artists like Social Distortion and The Meat Puppets (1990), Mojo Nixon and Dead Milkmen (1990), and Rollins Band and The Sugarcubes (1992). His festivals received national recognition in 1991, when MTV filmed its popular alternative music show 120 Minutes at that year's KUKQ Q-Fest, which included Front 242 and The Sisters of Mercy. Internet and Television In addition to his work on terrestrial radio, Jonathan L has also hosted several Internet radio shows, including a two-hour special for WOXY in Cincinnati in 2003, which included an on-air phone call from Jonathan L's close friend, music legend Ronnie Spector. In 2000, Jonathan L hosted and programmed the weekly Sunday afternoon show \\"Pleasantly Annoying\\" for Hollywood, California-based SpikeRadio.com. Jonathan L appeared on A Current Affair with Maury Povich in 1991, where he interviewed One Foot In The Grave, \\"the world‚Äôs oldest punk rock band,\\" a group from Sun City, Arizona with members all over the age of 60. In 2001, Jonathan L appeared on MTV2 in a 23-minute video feature about German rock group Rammstein. The Berlin Years In April 2010 Rosen moved to Berlin, Germany to be with the one true love he ever felt. He and Gaby at first were just pen pals meeting on Myspace in 2005. After a visit to Berlin in September 2009 to meet her in person he decided he knew what his future would be. At the age of 63 he moved permantantly to Berlin. In September 2010 the couple flew to Las Vegas and were married at the famous Little White Chapel. For the first few months he tried to secure opportunities for a live radio gig. He was unsuccessful mainly due to not being able to speak German. So he decided to try and master recording his Lopsided World Of L from their flat in Neuk√∂lln, the largest sector in the western part of Berlin. Back in 2007 when he was doing the show live on 98 KUPD FM in Phoenix the radio station starting streaming anywhere in the world. Jonathan had already made many friends and contacts from Europe and other countries and was promoting the show on Myspace. He used those contacts and new ones he made on Facebook in hope that if he was to use the internet, maybe that would give the show an edge and garner new listeners. From 2011 to 2014 he spent the better part of three years going to school three nights a week to learn the German language. Then the break came in October 2010 when Los Angeles station Indie1031 asked him on. That was followed in December 2010 by German internet station KING FM also wanted Lopsided World Of L which was followed by Phoenix, Arizona's KWSS FM 93.9 and others from Greece, Romania and Gothenburg, Sweden (the latter three are no longer on-air). The show lasted five years on KING FM until the station went dark Some of the stations have gone away due to crucial problems inherent due to a lack of advertising and for some personal reasons. Since then Mersey Radio Liverpool, England, andHow FM 107.5 New Zealand, KFMA Rock1021 FM Tucson, Arizona, and Radio Lantau Hong Kong joined in bringing the award- winning show to listeners all around the world on various continents. Although on a few FM stations, the show is the most known radio show on the internet for years. Took a few years to get to that status. As Mr. L says \\"I just continue to do what I do for all the musicians that are mostly unknown and what I get out of all the work is keeping active at my age for what I love and do the best\\". As the years go by he made many contacts directly with musicians and record promoters from so many Countries that the show is mostly music that American stations and ‚ÄôSpecialty Show‚Äôs‚Äô do not play. He feels that sets Lopsided World Of L apart from all the others. In describing the show he feels nowadays that is not an ‚ÄòAlternative‚Äô one but more of a progressive free form entity in all styles of music featuring new artists and many older ones that re-enter with new music.

They stretched from the Andes of southern Colombia southward down the Andes to northern Argentina and Chile. Archaeologists believe that Andean civilizations first developed on the narrow coastal plain of the Pacific Ocean. The Caral or Norte Chico civilization of Peru is the oldest known civilization in the Americas, dating back to 3200 BCE. Despite severe environmental challenges, the Andean civilizations domesticated a wide variety of crops, some of which became of worldwide importance. The Andean civilizations were also noteworthy for monumental architecture, textile weaving, and many unique characteristics of the societies they created. Less than a century prior to the arrival of the Spanish conquerors, the Incas, already established on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, united most of the Andean cultures into one single that encompassed all of what is usually called Andean civilization. The Timoto Cuica of Venezuela remained outside the Inca orbit. The Inca Empire was a patchwork of languages, cultures and peoples. Spanish rule ended or transformed many elements of the Andean civilizations, notably influencing religion and architecture. Uniqueness A quipu Andean civilization was one of five civilizations in the world deemed by scholars to be \\"pristine\\", that is indigenous and not derived from other civilizations.Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), Encyclopedia of the Incas, New York: Rowand & Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite 6 or 7 pristine civilizations. Due to its isolation from other civilizations, the indigenous people of the Andes had to come up with their own, often unique solutions to environmental and societal challenges. Andean civilization lacked several characteristics distinguishing it from the pristine civilizations in the Old World and from the Mesoamerican cultures. First, and perhaps most important, Andean civilizations did not have a written language. Instead, their societies used the quipu, a system of knotted and colored strings, to convey information. Few quipus survive and they have never been fully deciphered. Scholars differ on whether the knotted cords of the quipu were able only to record numerical data or could also be used for narrative communication, a true system of writing. The use of the quipu dates back at least to the Wari Empire (600‚Äì1000 CE) and possibly to the much earlier civilization of Norte Chico of the third millennium BCE. Andean civilizations also lacked wheeled vehicles and draft animals. People on land traveled only by foot and the transport of goods was only by humans or llama, pack animals which could carry loads of up to one-fourth of their weight, a maximum of . Llamas were not big or strong enough to be used for plowing or as riding animals for adults. Moreover, Andean civilizations faced severe environmental challenges. The earliest civilizations were on the hyper-arid desert coast of Peru. Agriculture was possible only with irrigation in valleys crossed by rivers coming from the high Andes, plus in a few fog oases called lomas. In the Andes, agriculture was limited by thin soils, cold climate, low or seasonal precipitation, and a scarcity of flat land. Freezing temperatures may occur in every month of the year at altitudes of more than , the homeland of many of the highland Andean civilizations.Guillet, David and others (1987), \\"Terracing and Irrigation in the Peruvian Highlands,\\" Current Anthropology, Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 409‚Äì410. Downloaded from JSTOR. Finally, the Andean civilizations lacked money. Copper axe-monies (also called \\"naipes\\")Smith, M.E.

These characteristics were especially notable during the Inca Empire but originated in much earlier times.Fagan, Brian M. (1996), The Oxford Guide to Archaeology, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 343 Agriculture andenes) were widely built and used for agriculture in the Andes. Agriculture in South America may have begun in coastal Ecuador with the domestication of squash about 8000 BCE by the Las Vegas culture.\\"Domestication History of the Squash Plant\\", https://www.thoughtco.com/domestication-history-of-the-squash-plant-172698, accessed 19 Jun 2018 Some scholars believe that the earliest civilizations on the Peruvian coast initially relied more upon maritime resources than agriculture during the formative period of their societies. However, as in all civilizations until the late 19th century, agriculture was the principal occupation of the great majority of the people. The greatest contribution of Andean civilization to the modern world has been the plants its people domesticated. Crops grown by the Andeans were often unique to the region. Maize, which found its way to the Andes from Mexico, was often the most important crop at lower and intermediate elevations. The Andeans cultivated an estimated 70 different plants, almost as many as were cultivated in all of Europe and Asia.Stevens, William K., \\"Rediscovering the Lost Crops of the Inca,\\" The New York Times, October 31, 1989 Many of these plants are no longer cultivated, or are minor crops, but important plants which were domesticated in or near the Andes include potatoes, quinoa, tomatoes, chile peppers, cotton, coca, tobacco, pineapples, peanuts, and several varieties of beans.Piperno, Dolores r. (2011), \\"The Origins of Plant Cultivation and Domestication in the New World Tropics: Patterns, Process, and new Developments,\\" Current Anthropology, Vol. 52, No. 54, pp. S457‚ÄìS459 Downloaded from JSTOR. Animals domesticated in the Andes were llamas and guinea pigs. The challenges of the environment required sophisticated agricultural technology. Unlike the Middle East, the Andes lacked easily domesticated and large-seeded plants such as wheat and barley and large and easily domesticated animals such as horses and cattle.Diamond, Jared (1999), Guns. Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies, New York: W.W. Norton & Co., pp. 83‚Äì113 Agriculture on the desert coast required the development of irrigation. In the mountains, the climate and steep terrain required a range of technological solutions such as terraces (and√©n), exploitation of microclimates, and selective breeding. Due to the climatic uncertainties, farmers traditionally farmed several crops at several elevations and exposures. At a macro level, societies and states did the same with the vertical archipelago, establishing colonies at different elevations and locations to increase the possibilities of agricultural success.  Archaeological cultures = Valdivia  Mortar, Jaguar Valdivia, South Coast (4000 BCE to 1500 BCE) The Valdivia Culture is one of the oldest settled cultures recorded in the Americas. It emerged from the earlier Las Vegas culture and thrived on the Santa Elena peninsula near the modern-day town of Valdivia, Ecuador between 3500 BCE and 1800 BCE.  Caral  The Caral pyramids in the arid Supe Valley, some 20 km from the Pacific coast The Norte Chico civilization, also called Caral,The name is disputed. English-language sources use Norte Chico (Spanish: \\"Little North\\") per Haas et al. (2004). Caral or Caral-Supe are more likely to be found in Spanish language sources per Shady. This article follows usage in recent English- language sources and employs Norte Chico, but the title is not definitive. Peruvian Norte Chico should not be confused with the Chilean region of the same name. was a complex pre-Columbian society that included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north- central coastal Peru. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the Cradles of civilization where civilization separately originated in the ancient world. It flourished between the 30th century BCE and the 18th century BCE. The alternative name, Caral-Supe, is derived from the Sacred City of Caral in the Supe Valley, a large and well-studied Norte Chico site. Complex society in Norte Chico arose a millennium after Sumer in Mesopotamia, was contemporaneous with the Egyptian pyramids, and predated the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia.  Chav√≠n  Formative Epoch 1200‚Äì300 BCE (Larco Museum Collection, Lima) The Chav√≠n culture is thought to have been primarily a religious movement. The culture apparently began in the Peruvian highlands and then spread outward throughout the country. The Chav√≠n culture has very distinctive art styles, particularly in effigy pots, a number of which were in feline shapes. Chavin de Huantar was an important ritual centre for Chavin Culture, dating to around 1,500 BCE.  Nazca  The Condor, Nazca Lines, created by the Nazca culture The Nazca culture (also Nasca) was the archaeological culture that flourished from 100 to 800 CE beside the dry southern coast of Peru in the river valleys of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage and the Ica Valley (Silverman and Proulx, 2002). Having been heavily influenced by the preceding Paracas culture, which was known for extremely complex textiles, the Nazca produced an array of beautiful crafts and technologies such as ceramics, textiles, and geoglyphs (most commonly known as the Nazca lines). They also built an impressive system of underground aqueducts, known as puquios, that still function today. The Nazca Province in the Ica Region was named for this people.  Moche  Condor from about 300 CE. The Moche civilization (alternately, the Mochica culture, Early Chimu, Pre-Chimu, Proto-Chimu, etc.) flourished in northern Peru from about 100 CE to 800 CE, during the Regional Development Epoch. While this issue is the subject of some debate, many scholars contend that the Moche were not politically organized as a monolithic empire or state. Rather, they were likely a group of autonomous polities that shared a common elite culture, as seen in the rich iconography and monumental architecture that survive today. They are particularly noted for their elaborately painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (huacas) and irrigation systems. Moche history may be broadly divided into three periods ‚Äì the emergence of the Moche culture in Early Moche (CE 100‚Äì300), its expansion and florescence during Middle Moche (CE 300‚Äì600), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in Late Moche (CE 500‚Äì750).Bawden, G. 2004. \\"The Art of Moche Politics\\", in Andean Archaeology. (ed. H. Silverman). Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.  Chachapoyas  Walls of Soloco fortress, Chachapoyas, Peru. The Chachapoyas, or the 'Cloud people', were an Andean civilization living in a cloud forests of the Amazonas region of present-day northern Peru. The Incas conquered the Chachapoyas shortly before the arrival of the Spanish in Peru. The first firm evidence of their existence dates back to around 700 CE, although it is possible that they built a settlement called Gran Paj√°ten where some ceramics have been dated to 200 BCE. The largest Chacapoyan site discovered so far is Kuelap. A number of mummified burial sites have also been discovered.  Wari  Pikillaqta administrative center, built by the Wari civilization in Cusco The Wari () were a Middle Horizon civilization that flourished in the south- central Andes and coastal area of Peru, from about CE 500 to 1000. (The Wari culture is not to be confused with the modern ethnic group and language known as Wari', with which it has no known link.) Wari, as the former capital city was called, is located north-east of the city of Ayacucho. This city was the center of a civilization that covered much of the highlands and coast of Peru. The best-preserved remnants, beside the Wari Ruins, are the recently discovered Northern Wari ruins near the city of Chiclayo, and Cerro Baul in Moquegua. Also well-known are the Wari ruins of Pikillaqta (\\"Flea Town\\"), a short distance south-east of Cuzco en route to Lake Titicaca.  Tiwanaku  The \\"Gate of the Sun\\" built by the Tiwanaku culture Tiwanaku (Spanish: Tiahuanaco and Tiahuanacu) is an important Pre-Columbian archaeological site in western Bolivia, South America. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important precursors to the Inca Empire, flourishing as the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south- eastern shore of Lake Titicaca in the La Paz Department, Ingavi Province, Tiwanaku Municipality, about west of La Paz. The site was first recorded in written history by Spanish conquistador and self-acclaimed \\"first chronicler of the Indies\\" Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n. Leon stumbled upon the remains of Tiwanaku in 1549 while searching for the Inca capital Qullasuyu. Some have hypothesized that Tiwanaku's modern name is related to the Aymara term taypiqala, meaning \\"stone in the center\\", alluding to the belief that it lay at the center of the world. However, the name by which Tiwanaku was known to its inhabitants may have been lost, as the people of Tiwanaku had no written language.  Historical cultures = Chim√∫  Chim√∫ vessel representing a fisherman on a caballitos de totora (1100‚Äì1400 CE) The Chim√∫ were the residents of Chimor, with its capital at the city of Chan Chan, a large adobe city in the Moche Valley of present-day Trujillo, Peru. The culture arose about 900 CE. The Inca ruler Topa Inca Yupanqui led a campaign which conquered the Chim√∫ around 1470 CE.Kubler, George. (1962). The Art and Architecture of Ancient America, Ringwoods: Penguin Books London Ltd., pp. 247‚Äì274 This was just fifty years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Consequently, Spanish chroniclers were able to record accounts of Chim√∫ culture from individuals who had lived before the Inca conquest. Similarly, archaeological evidence suggest Chimor grew out of the remnants of Moche culture; early Chim√∫ pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate.  Inca Empire  View of Machu Picchu built by the Incas The Inca Empire, or Incan EmpireAlso Inka Empire; see Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift for more information regarding this spelling difference (Quechua: Tawantinsuyu), was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America.Terence D'Altroy, The Incas, pp. 2‚Äì3. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in Cusco. The Inca civilization arose from the Peruvian highlands sometime in the early 13th century, and the last Inca stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572. From 1438 to 1533 CE, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, including Peru, southwest Ecuador, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, northern Chile, and a small part of southwest Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of the Old World.  Muisca  La balsa Muisca (The Muisca raft), a pre-Columbian gold sculpture representing the Muisca's offerings of gold in the Guatavita Lake The Muisca was the Chibcha-speaking people that formed the Muisca Confederation in the central highlands of present-day Colombia. They were encountered by the troops of Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, in name of the Spanish Empire at the time of the conquest in the spring of 1537. The Muisca comprised two confederations: Hunza (present-day Tunja) was located in the northern area, whose sovereign was the zaque; and Bacat√° the southern area, whose sovereign was the zipa. Both confederations were located in the highlands of modern-day Cundinamarca and Boyac√° (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) in the central area of Colombia's Eastern Ranges.  Timoto- Cuica  M√©rida, Venezuela Timoto‚ÄìCuica people was composed primarily of two tribes, the Timotes and the Cuicas, that inhabited in the Andean region of western Venezuela.Mahoney 89 They were closely related to the Muisca people of the Andes, who spoke a Chibcha language. The Timoto-Cuicas were not only composed of the Timoto and the Cuica tribes, but also the Mucuch√≠es, the Migures, the Tabares, and the Mucu√±uques. Timoto-Cuica society was complex with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. They also stored water in tanks. Their houses were made primarily of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful, for the most part, and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and ullucos.\\"Venezuela.\\" Friends of the Pre-Columbian Art Museum. (retrieved 9 July 2011) They left behind works of art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing.

This split resulted in the majority of the youth players breaking away from Evergreen to form Tramore Athletic. The club was founded following a meeting at the O'Connell's Corner House Pub in Turners Cross. Its founding members came from Turners Cross, Douglas and Blackrock and as a result it took its name from the Tramore River which passed through the three communities. The club started out as a schoolboy club and shortly after its formation, Tramore Athletic became founding members of the Cork Schoolboys League. They won their first ever trophy in 1954 after winning an under‚Äì14 league title. Tramore Athletic also joined the Cork Athletic Union League and in 1956‚Äì57 and 1957‚Äì58 won the leagues third level and second level division titles in successive seasons. 1957‚Äì58 also saw the club come to national prominence for the first time when they won the FAI Youth Cup after defeating Johnville 2‚Äì0 in the final at Turners Cross. Encouraged by this national success Tramore Athletic entered a team in the Munster Senior League for the first time in 1959. Over subsequent decades Tramore Athletic enjoyed success at both provincial and national levels, winning four Munster Senior League Senior Premier Division titles and contesting seven FAI Intermediate Cup finals. They have also won the FAI Youth Cup on two further occasions. Dave Barry and Kieran O'Regan both featured in the side which beat Home Farm in 1979‚Äì80.

Plot Mr. Hedges, the somewhat naive and idealistic teacher of the rebellious Class 5C of Fenn Street School lobbies to have his class allowed on the annual school camping trip despite much precedent to the contrary from the likes of head teacher Mr. Cromwell, the fastidious and officious school caretaker Mr. Potter, the snobby Miss Ewell and the world-beaten Mr. Price. Eventually with Mr. Hedges having won the hearts and minds of Mr. Cromwell and Miss Ewell with a speech about giving Class 5C a helping hand with the benefits of the trip to the countryside Class 5C eventually get to go on the trip - providing Mr. Hedges also comes along to supervise his unruly class. Once on the camping trip Mr. Hedges pursues Penny Wheeler, the local barmaid, and the class indulge in their usual activities where Dennis becomes at one with the clean air and natural surroundings of the countryside and he befriends a local gypsy boy named Nobbler and his family. A small feud with some stereotypical upper-class children from the posh Boulters School is resolved with a false rape allegation from Sharon. A case of some stolen money is resolved through Mr. Hedges trusting the class. At the final dance Mr. Hedges is ensnared in the romantic clutches of Miss Cutforth, contrary to his wishes. The opening credits to the film were filmed in Primrose Hill in North-west London, with the junction of Chalcot Road and Fitzroy Road featuring where the kids from Fenn Street School mess about with the school crossing patrol officer and run amok across a zebra crossing in front of traffic. In reality the roads in this area are quiet residential streets, with Chalcot Road being located on a dead end and where the zebra crossing and the traffic island were used as fake props just for this particular opening scene in the film. The film's closing theme was the song La La La Lu written by Mike Vickers and performed by Cilla Black. Black and her manager (her husband Bobby Willis) claimed they had been led to believe the song would open and close the film, but in fact, it is included in a very late scene in the movie where the students dance to the track and partially over the closing credits. The planned release of the single was thus abandoned by Black, switching the track to the 'B Side' of her single Something Tells Me (Something's Gonna Happen Tonight), which became her final top 10 single in the UKBlack, Cilla.

The name Rodgaubahn is derived from the medieval name of Rodgau, part of the former Maingau (Main district), which the line passes through for its whole length. History J√ºgesheim station on the Rodgau Railway in 1978 Heritage train on the S1 in November 2006 Since about 1870 there were serious proposals from local interest groups for the building of a railway to open up the Rodgau, but at first the government of the Grand Duchy of Hesse did not respond to them. An Eisenbahncomit√©e (railway committee) was formed after the first, unsuccessful initiative in 1877. But this took four years to get a response from Darmstadt, the capital of the Duchy, during which the committee carried out preparatory work for an Offenbach‚ÄìReinheim railway project at its own expense. It took until 1888 before the government gave final approval and after further discussions about the connection of the railway in Offenbach with the Prussian state railways in 1895, planning permission was granted. It was decided that the line would have its own station in Offenbach south of the Prussian state railways' station. The line was built by the Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways. On 30 September 1896, the new line (now line number 3661) was opened from Offenbach via Dieburg to Reinheim with a length of 42.2 kilometres. In the following years the Rodgau Railway was connected to two other railways: *On 1 December 1898, a branch line was opened from Offenbach-Bieber, the Offenbach-Bieber‚ÄìDietzenbach railway. *On 1 April 1905, a connection was opened in Ober-Roden to the new Dreieich Railway (Dreieichbahn) from Buchschlag. In 1923, the railway was built on an embankment in the city of Offenbach in order to remove level crossings with streets. This involved the rebuilding of the central station in Offenbach as a single station and the abandonment of the Rodgau Railway‚Äôs own station. Operational history Old station building at Weiskirchen Initially, four pairs of trains operated daily. After the connection of the Dreieich Railway, there were only two pairs of through trains between Offenbach and Dieburg. The first trains were steam hauled; after the Second World War trains were increasingly hauled by diesel locomotives. The importance of the connection lay in the growing commuter traffic from the district of Offenbach, especially for those working in the leather goods industry in Offenbach. On 28 May 1965, the line between Dieburg and Reinheim was closed for passengers, partly because of the operation of the parallel bus route. In 1967, this section of the line was dismantled, beginning with the section between Dieburg and Gro√ü-Zimmern. Freight trains ran to and from the Odenwald Railway (Odenwaldbahn) over the Darmstadt Ost‚ÄìGro√ü-Zimmern railway until it was closed in 1970. In 1989, the remaining section of the line to Reinheim was closed. Conversion to S-Bahn operations S1 at J√ºgesheim station in 2003 S1 near Rodgau-Rollwald Old trackbed in front of Dieburg The establishment of an S-Bahn operation on the track was considered in the late 1950s. It was not, however, until 23 March 2001 that the line to Dietzenbach began to be reconstructed as a double-track electrified line of the Frankfurt S-Bahn network. In the course of the development work, 13 stations were modernised and two rebuilt. 15 bridges were rebuilt and 18 level crossings were secured with new barrier systems. S-Bahn operations began on the Rodgau line at the beginning of the 2003/2004 timetable on 14 December 2003. The line is operated by DB Regio as part of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn network as line S 1 (Wiesbaden‚ÄìOber-Roden), the northern section of the line is also used by line S 2 (Niedernhausen‚ÄìDietzenbach). Proposed extensions of line S1 to Dieburg and S2 to Ober-Roden failed as they was found not to be economically justified. Therefore, the section from Ober-Roden to Dieburg has not been electrified. This section of the line is now operated as part of the Dreieich Railway from Buchschlag.

It was created and governed according to the \\"Plan for the Colonization of New Russia Gubernia\\" issued by the Russian Senate.New Russia Gubernia at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine It became the first region in Russia where Catherine the Great allowed foreign Jews to settle. Most of its territories belonged to the Zaporizhian Sich as well as the Poltava Regiment and Myrhorod Regiment of the Cossack Hetmanate. Its establishment was strategically successful and advantageous for Russia, and after the conclusion of the Russian war against Turkey in 1774 it gave a way for it to access the Black Sea and establish an area that became known as New Russia. It was created based on the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire against the Ottoman Empire and involved many military units from the region that were resettled in Ukraine. The military units included mounted cossacks (or hussars) and mounted pikers (or lancers). In 1796, the governorate was reestablished, but not with the centre in Kremenchug but in Ekaterinoslav, and in 1802 was split into three governorates: the Ekaterinoslav Governorate, the Taurida Governorate, the Nikolayev Governorate (known as the Kherson Governorate from 1803). History It was created on as a military district for the protection of the southern border of the empire and in preparation for the major military campaign of the Russo-Turkish War. The governorate united the territories of New Serbia, Slavo-Serbia, and the Slobidskyi regiment (today in Kirovohrad Oblast) which were the northern regions of Buhohard Palatinate (Zaporizhian Sich). The governorate, centered in the fortress of Saint Elizabeth, initially was divided into three territories (polki) assigned to each regiment in the area: Elizabeth City Pikers Regiment, Black Hussars Regiment, and Yellow Hussars Regiment. As of the governorate also included the so-called Ukrainian Line, a line of Russian built fortresses between Dnieper and Donets) that was administrated by the Dnieper and Donets Pikers regiments (based on the Habsburg's Pandurs, the cossacks of Poltava, the Myrhorod regiments), the Slavo-Serbia with Luhansk Pikers Regiment, and the Raiko Preradovic and Ivan Sevic Hussars regiments (soon the later two were united into the Bakhmut Hussars Regiment) as well as the Samara Hussar Regiment (originally the Moldavian Hussars Regiment based in Kiev). The first capital of the governorate was the city of Kremenchug (1765) with the fortress of Saint Elizabeth (today Kropyvnytskyi) serving that administrative function previously (1764)). Pikers unrest In 1769-70 during the 1768-74 Russian- Ottoman War there was an uprising among the Dnieper and Donets Pikers regiments.1769-70 Pikers Uprising. Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia. The unrest started on territory of today's Poltava Oblast and eventually spread across the lands of the Zaporizhian Host. It was mercilessly put down by Russian Imperial forces and its instigators were punished by knout or sent to katorga. The Donets Pikers Regiment eventually was forcefully sent to the war where it played a key role in forcing Syvash, taken of Perekop, Caffa (Feodosiya). Destruction of Zaporizhian Sich In June 1775 the Russian Imperial Army razed the capital of the Zaporizhian Sich, after which all its lands were annexed to the Novorossiysk Governorate. The following year the Bakhmut and Catherine provinces were transferred to the newly established Azov Governorate. Subdivisions The governorate was subdivided into 12 provinces (circuluses) and further into uyezdes (counties). The city of Ekaterinoslav (today - Novomoskovsk) was located in Azoff Governorate. The city of Ekaterinoslav (today - Dnipro) was located in Novorossiya Governorate.

In 1802, this province was divided into the Nikolayev Governorate (known as the Kherson Governorate from 1803), the Ekaterinoslav Governorate, and the Taurida Governorate. A Decree of 12 December 1796 set up a serf system on the territory of South Ukraine and Caucasus by attaching peasants to the land.

These elements consist of three basic types: # structural components such as frame members, bearings, axles, splines, fasteners, seals, and lubricants, # mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches, and # control components such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers.Robert L. Norton, Machine Design, (4th Edition), Prentice-Hall, 2010 While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users. Machine elements are basic mechanical parts and features used as the building blocks of most machines. Most are standardized to common sizes, but customs are also common for specialized applications. Machine elements may be features of a part (such as screw threads or integral plain bearings) or they may be discrete parts in and of themselves such as wheels, axles, pulleys, rolling-element bearings, or gears. All of the simple machines may be described as machine elements, and many machine elements incorporate concepts of one or more simple machines. For example, a leadscrew incorporates a screw thread, which is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. Many mechanical design, invention, and engineering tasks involve a knowledge of various machine elements and an intelligent and creative combining of these elements into a component or assembly that fills a need (serves an application).

It was designed in 1891 by the Czech architect Karel Pa≈ô√≠k, but criticisms by the minister, Baron Benjamin Kallay, caused him to stop working on the project. It was initially the largest and most representative building of the Austro-Hungarian period in Sarajevo and served as the city hall.Sarajevo Vijeƒánica The building was reopened on May 9, 2014.www.oslobodjenje.ba/ Opening of the national library. History Vedran Smailoviƒá playing the cello in the destroyed National Library, in 1992 The interior after restoration Alexander Wittek, who worked on the project in 1892 and 1893, fell ill and died in 1894 in Graz, and the work was completed by ƒÜiril Ivekoviƒá. The edifice was built in a stylistic blend of historical eclecticism, predominantly in the pseudo-Moorish expression, for which the stylistic sources were found in the Islamic art of Spain and North Africa. Building works began in 1892 and were completed in 1894, at a cost of 984,000 crowns, with 32,000 crowns provided for fixtures and fittings. It was formally opened 20 April 1896, and handed over to the City Authority, which occupied the property until 1949, when it was handed over to the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 25 August 1992, Serbian shelling during the Siege of Sarajevo caused the complete destruction of the library; among the losses were about 700 manuscripts and incunabula and a unique collection of Bosnian serial publications, some from the middle of the 19th century Bosnian cultural revival.For foreigners an event that defined the cultural objectives of the besiegers occurred during the night of August 25, 1992, the intentional shelling and utter destruction with incendiary shells of the irreplaceable Bosnia National and University Library, the central repository of Bosnian written culture, and a major cultural center of all the Balkans. Among the losses were about 700 manuscripts and incunabula and a unique collection of Bosnian serial publications, some from the middle of the 19th century Bosnian cultural revival. Libraries all over the world cooperated afterwards to restore some of the lost heritage, through donations and e-texts, rebuilding the Library in cyberspace. Before the attack, the library held 1.5 million volumes and over 155,000 rare books and manuscripts. Some citizens and librarians tried to save some books while they were under sniper fire, at least one person died. The majority of the books could not be saved from the flames. The structural repair of the building was planned to be carried out in four stages: 1996-1997 (financed by a donation from Republic of Austria), and 2000-2004 (financed by a donation from the European Commission), and the city of Barcelona among others. The third stage ended in September 2012, with an estimated cost of KM 4.6 million (about ‚Ç¨2.37 million) and will return the city hall to its former grace. The fourth stage began following the completion of the third stage and lasted about 20 months, finishing at the end of 2013 and cost of KM 14 million (about ‚Ç¨7.23 million) which are secured through the IPA. In this stage the whole interior was built and reconstructed (paintings, sculptures, books), meaning the building is brought back to function. Everything that was possible to restore has been done so, while those things that were not possible to save have been made anew through special molds. The whole reconstruction and restore process was predicted to cost about KM 25 million (about ‚Ç¨13 million). After it is repaired, the building, now a national monument, will be used for variety of events. Its space will be used for various protocol events for all levels of government, concerts and exhibitions.

He won an outright majority in a special election for the seat held on September 9, 2014. The slot became open when Robert L. Duncan, another Republican, resigned to become the new chancellor of the Texas Tech University System. From 2011 to 2014, Perry was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from District 83, a rural district south of Lubbock. A certified public accountant, Perry unseated incumbent Representative Delwin L. Jones, then the oldest member of the Texas House, in the runoff election held on April 13, 2010. He faced no Democratic opponents in the November 2 general election. Perry took his seat in the 150-member House in January 2011. Perry was named one of the \\"Worst Legislators\\" in Texas by Texas Monthly magazine in 2017. Perry responded by saying \\"that he is in touch with his district‚Äôs conservative values\\" and called Texas Monthly \\"a liberal Austin publication\\". Charles Perry is not related to former Governor Rick Perry. Early life, education and career Perry was born in Abilene in Taylor County, Texas. He graduated in 1980 from Sweetwater High School in Sweetwater in Nolan County. In 1984, he completed his Bachelor of Business Administration degree in accounting from Texas Tech University and has since worked in that field. Perry is affiliated with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Texas Society of Certified Public Accountants, the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts, and the National Association of Securities Dealers. 2010 political campaign Perry unseated Jones, 10,109 votes (57.8 percent) to 7,392 ballots (42.2 percent). Though Jones polled 291 more votes in the runoff than he had in the primary, Perry's total increased by 3,633 ballots over his initial showing on March 2, 2010. Perry carried the support of the Tea Party movement, also known as \\"Taxed Enough Already,\\" while Jones was supported by the president of the Lubbock Educators Association. Jones, who served in the legislature as a Democrat from 1964‚Äì1972 and as a Republican since 1988, led the primary, 7,103 ballots (37.7 percent) to Perry's 6,476 (34.4 percent). The third candidate, Zach Brady, with 5,240 votes (27.8 percent), had been expected to hold the key to victory in the Jones-Perry showdown. Brady, a Lubbock attorney, raised more than $250,000 and carried the backing of business interest groups, but he was eliminated from the race by his third- place showing. Brady's endorsement of Jones in the runoff did not help the incumbent, who also enjoyed the backing of his State Senator Robert L. Duncan of Lubbock. Neale Pearson, professor emeritus of political science at Texas Tech University, speculated that the nomination of Perry, the biggest legislative upset in the 2010 Texas primaries, was the result of \\"anti- government and perhaps anti-establishment tea party attitudes [which] affected voter turnout.\\" Pearson added that he doubted whether many of the Brady partisans supported either Jones or Perry in a meaningful way in the runoff contest. In addition to the Perry nomination, Lubbock area conservatives on April 13 nominated John Frullo as the GOP choice in neighboring District 84, where incumbent Carl Isett, also a Lubbock accountant, did not seek reelection. Frullo defeated Mark Griffin, a former Texas Tech regent who also carried Duncan's support. Scott Mann, Jones' campaign manager, said that Perry prevailed because of the anti-incumbent attitude: \\"We hit a movement where feelings are legitimate and whose goals are consistent with the rest of West Texas. [The Perry campaign] didn‚Äôt create those attitudes. Those attitudes were there, and they just capitalized on them. We also worked hard and had wonderful volunteers, maybe 75 to 100, but we just couldn‚Äôt overcome the anti- incumbent tide.\\" Perry and Frullo joined two other newly elected conservative state legislators from West Texas and the Panhandle, Jim Landtroop of Plainview and Four Price of Amarillo. 2012 election In the May 29 Republican primary Perry again defeated Delwin Jones, who at the age of eighty-eight sought to return to the Texas House. Perry received 13,093 votes (71.1 percent) to Jones' 5,323 (28.9 percent). In a 2012 radio broadcast at KFYO in Lubbock, Perry came into conflict with former Texas Tech University System Chancellor John T. Montford regarding the legalization of casino gambling in Texas. Montford said that Texans are already traveling to Louisiana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma to gamble, and the state could earmark those lost revenues for important public use. Perry said that lower-income residents who already benefit from massive amounts of entitlement spending are those most likely to squander their earnings on gambling. 2014 re- nomination Perry easily won re-nomination to a third term in the state House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 13,663 votes (73 percent) to his challenger Steve Massengale's 5,045 votes (27 percent). After the 2017 session of the Texas Legislature, Perry was named one of the ten worst members of the Texas Legislature. He was cited by Texas Monthly for voting the wishes of the Lt. Governor over the needs of his mostly rural voters. Perry responded by saying \\"that he is in touch with his district‚Äôs conservative values\\" and called Texas Monthly \\"a liberal Austin publication\\". However, Perry did not return to the House and was succeeded by his fellow Republican, Dustin Burrows. Perry instead won the special election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of State Senator Robert Duncan, the new chancellor of the Texas Tech University System. Among Perry's intraparty opponents was once again former Representative Delwin Jones, who became critically ill on August 31, just ten days before the election and finished with less than 2 percent of the vote, and the runner-up candidate, Jodey Arrington, a former staff member for U.S. President George W. Bush. In 2016, Arrington was elected to the United States House of Representatives for Texas' 19th congressional district to succeed the retiring Randy Neugebauer. Personal life Perry is a past president of the Lubbock Boys and Girls Club. He is a past member of the National Council on Family Violence and the National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline. He is a deacon at Southcrest Baptist Church in Lubbock. He and his wife, Jacklyn Elaine Perry, have a daughter, Jordan, and a son, Matthew. A former political operative and current entertainer at an Oklahoma-based gentlemen's club filed a protective order against Senator Perry on May 6, 2015. An Oklahoma judge subsequently ruled there is no basis for the protective order. In February 2016, the accuser was arrested in Oklahoma and booked into the Lubbock County Detention Center on a retaliation charge. The arrest warrant cites a Twitter account created by the accuser to attack the senator.

Osteochondroprogenitor cells are progenitor cells that arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the bone marrow. They have the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes depending on the signalling molecules they are exposed to, giving rise to either bone or cartilage respectively. Osteochondroprogenitor cells are important for bone formation and maintenance. Discovery Alexander Friedenstein and his colleagues first identified osteoprogenitor cells in multiple mammalian tissues, before any genetic or morphological criteria were put in place for bone marrow or connective tissues. Osteoprogenitor cells can be identified by their associations with existing bone or cartilage structures, or their placement in the embryo, as the sites for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis are now known. Cell signalling and differentiation Osteochondroprogenitor can be found between MSCs and the terminally differentiated osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Via different signalling molecules and combinations the osteochondroprogenitor will differentiate into either osteoblasts or chondrocytes. alt=A diagram showing mesenchymal stem cells and their differentiation pathways, via osteoprogenitor cell, to chondrocytic and osteoblastic cell lineages. The diagram is based on data from 10.5-day-old mice embryo. Below and above the cells are the factors required for differentiation into the two cell lineages. Differentiation into chondrocytes Chondrocytes are only present in cartilage where they will produce cartilaginous matrix to maintain the structure. Sox9, L-Sox5 and Sox6 are needed for the osteochondroprogenitor to undergo chondrocytic differentiation. The transcription factor Sox9 can be found in multiple sites in the body (pancreas, central nervous system, intestines) and it is also found in all chondrocyte progenitor cells, suggesting that they are important in chondrogenesis. Differentiation into osteoblasts Osteoblasts are cells that group together to form units, called osteons, to produce bone. Runx2 (which may also be known as Cbfa1), and Osx (a zinc finger containing transcription factor) are necessary for osteochondroprogenitor cells to differentiate into the osteoblast cell lineage. These factors also have a role in hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation. B-catenin Œ≤-catenin of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway plays a role in cell fate determination, as it is critical for osteoblastogenesis, and the differentiation of chondrocytes into osteoblasts. Knock out of the entire pathway results in early embryonic death, therefore most research of this nature utilised conditional knockouts of the pathway. TGF-Œ≤ During mandible development, most of it is formed through intramembranous ossification, where endochondral ossification will occur in the proximal region. TGF-Œ≤ is important for cell proliferation and differentiation during skeletogenesis. During this process, TGF-Œ≤ can stimulate differentiation into either chondrocytes or osteoblasts via FGF, Msx1, and Ctgf signalling pathways. General gene knock out of the TGF-Œ≤ resulted in death. Conditional inactivation of TGF-Œ≤r2 of osteochondroprogenitor cells in the cranial neural crest resulted in faster osteoprogenitor differentiation and disorganised chondrogenesis. TGF-Œ≤ determines and regulates cell lineages during endochondral ossification through Sox9 and Runx2 signalling pathways. TGF-Œ≤ will act as a stimulator of chondrogenesis, and an inhibitor of osteoblastic differentiation, by blocking the Runx2 factor through Smad3 activation. Sox9 stimulates differentiation into chondrocytes. Sox9 blocked osteochondroprogenitor cells were found to express osteoblast marker genes, reprogramming the cells into the osteoblastic lineage. Loss of TGF-Œ≤ signalling will lead to reduced Sox9 activity, but not prevent it completely, suggesting that there must be other factors and signalling pathways regulating Sox9 activity. Once Sox9 activity is lost, differentiation into the osteoblastic lineage dominates. Embryonic development It is thought that through a combination of biochemical and biophysical stimuli, the uncommitted stem cells of the embryo will undergo differentiation into certain cell lineages. However the exact mechanism and signalling pathways are still unclear. Studies have shown that embryonic stem cells are more mechanosensitive than their differentiated counterparts. During embryonic development mesenchymal cells will form cellular structures known as ‚Äòcondensations.‚Äô These cellular units will then develop into skeletal and other tissues, such as cartilage, tendon, ligament and muscle tissue. Osteoprogenitor cell condensations can aggregate, dissipate or condense depending on the signals present, however these still remain largely unknown. Depending on the different effects, the cellular condensations may differentiate into osteogenic or chondrocytic condensations. The positioning of the osteoprogenitor cell condensations determines the cell lineage before the signalling molecules can. This is due to their positions relative to any epithelial surfaces. Osteoblastic and chondrogenic condensations differ in their biophysical parameters within the embryo. Their distance in relation to the nearest epithelial surface will determine the cell lineage. For example osteoblastic condensations are closer to epithelial surfaces so they will be exposed to more biophysical and biochemical stimuli due to the proximity and increased cell-epithelial interactions. Consequence of defects in osteochondroprogenitor cells alt=A skull with cranial deformation, resulting in an extended skull Deletion of the Trsp gene in osteochondroprogenitor cells results in abnormal bone growth, delayed ossification, chondronecrosis and dwarfism. General Trsp gene deletion is lethal to the embryo. The results of this research was used as a model for Kashin-Beck disease. Kashin-Beck is a result of combinatorial environmentally induced by factors such as: toxic mould, contaminated grains by mycotoxins, and mostly by selenium deficiency, which is necessary for selenoprotein function. The disease has symptoms similar to those resulting from Trsp gene knockout. Loss of the regulator, Pten, of the Phophatidylinositol3‚Äô kinase pathway results in skeletal overgrowth and growth plate dysfunction, due to overproduction of the matrix and accelerated hypertrophic differentiation.

He died aged four. Life Prince Heinrich was born on 9 January 1900, in Kiel. His father was pleased by the birth of yet another son, especially such a handsome one, as the Prince had blonde hair. The newborn Prince immediately received the title Prince of Prussia with the style Royal Highness, and was baptised Heinrich Viktor Ludwig Friedrich in Kiel Castle on 15 March 1900. His older brothers were Prince Waldemar, a namesake of his uncle, and Prince Sigismund, a namesake of his other deceased uncle. Heinrich was named in honour of his father. The Prince was diagnosed with haemophilia as a young child, but, despite this, was a very cheerful and lively boy who liked to play a lot. As Henry grew older he became more aware of his condition. Death On 25 February, Princess Irene left Heinrich unsupervised for a few minutes while she went to fetch something. The playful Prince climbed a chair, and then he climbed onto the table. As he heard his mother approaching, he attempted to quickly come down but stumbled while attempting to climb down the chair and fell on the floor headfirst. He started to scream, which immediately attracted the Princess' attention. By the time she reached him, the child was almost unconscious. The doctor said the fall had not been that bad and the child would have survived had he not been a haemophiliac. However, suffering from this condition, it was certain the young Prince would die. He was suffering from a brain haemorrhage. He lingered for a couple of hours, but died the following day, on 26 February. He was four years old.

He was a member of the Committee of 51 which enforced the boycott of British goods up to the American Revolution. He was also a shareholder in the Tontine Coffee House, was one of the original 12 members of the New York Chamber of Commerce, and served as Vice Counsel to China.Morris, Ira. K.

Chapin,pg. 187 After Captain Tom retired from sailing, he set up a merchant shop on Hanover Street, while his son took over his fleet. He died in 1797 and is buried in the graveyard at Trinity Church Cemetery. Randall served as a privateer during the American Revolution.The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, July 1800-April 1802. Columbia University Press, 1977, page 389 In 1771 Randall, as a young man, joined the Marine Society of New York, a relief society for vessel operators, and their widow and orphans. His work with this charitable organization served to inspire him to dedicate his wealth to supporting needy sailors. Morris After his father's death, five years before Captain Robert himself died at the age of 51, Robert Randall used some of the money from his inheritance to purchase the former Elliot estate in the then- rural Greenwich Village for a sum of 5,000 pounds. The new Randall estate was 24 acres, and covered the area between today's Fourth and Fifth Streets and Waverly Place and Ninth Street.Chapin, Anna Alice. Greenwich Village. New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1917.  Philanthropy  As a sailor, himself, Captain Randall understood the difficulty of life as a sailor. Upon his death in 1801, Randall's will, drawn by Alexander Hamilton, directed an array of political, religious, and civic leaders in the city with the task of erecting an \\"Asylum or Marine Hospital, to be called the Sailors' Snug Harbor for the purpose of maintaining and supporting aged, decrepit, and worn-out sailors.\\" The endowment for the charity was to be formed from his estate in New York City. As the area was still mostly rural at the time of his death, Randall wanted Sailor's Snug Harbor to be built on his property, which included the north side of Washington Square Park and the south side of Eighth Street. The land was good farm land, and Randall believed that the residents would be able to grow grain and vegetables to be used to support the sailors living at Snug Harbor. However, there was a challenge to Randall's will by the children of his half-brother, which took many years in court to settle. By the time the conflict had been decided in favor of Sailor's Snug Harbor, the organization decided to subdivide up the land and lease it out. In 1831, Sailor's Snug Harbor used the money from the Greenwich Village leases to purchase a 160-acre complex on Staten Island for $16,000, to use as the home for the sailors.Barry City of New York, Department of Parks. \\"Snug Harbor Cultural Center\\" According to Randall's will, this ‚Äúsnug harbor‚Äù was to be a marine hospital for ‚Äúthe purpose of maintaining aged, decrepit, and worn-out sailors.‚Äù The lawyer responsible for drawing up the will was Alexander Hamilton. The charity set up by Randall and Hamilton was one of the first charitable institutions in the United States. The sole requirement for residency at Sailor's Snug Harbor was five years sailing under a United States Flagged Shipped (Military or civilian). There were no age, religion, race, or other factors taken into consideration. Once in residence, each former sailor was called ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù by the staff, regardless of their actual rank during their service. Though modified much since its inception, the Sailors of Snug Harbor foundation continues to function to this day.http://www.thesailorssnugharbor.org/Pages/default.aspx  Death and Burial  Randall died on June 5, 1801. He was initially buried in a plot in the cemetery at St. Mark's Church, but was subsequently moved into a vault as the extension of 8th Street per the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 would have run through his grave. Once Sailors' Snug Harbor was completed, his remains were transported to Staten Island and laid to rest on August 21st, 1834, under a monument bearing his name.Morris References Category:Sea captains Category:American founders Category:American humanitarians Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:People of New Jersey in the American Revolution Category:1750 births Category:1801 deaths Category:People of colonial New Jersey ","title":"Robert Richard Randall"},{"id":"26981772","text":"Walungu is a territory of South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo It was the site of a plane crash on May 25, 2005Congo Planet news article on plane crash when a chartered Maniema Union Antonov An-28 aircraft, owned by Victoria Air, crashed into a mountain near Walungu, about 30 minutes after takeoff.

A recurrent theme in these works is the struggle of individuals to come to terms with the nexus of history, politics, mythmaking, and media. For instance, the two \\"Roman Forum\\" projects took a close look at contemporary presidential politics through the eyes of 2000-year-old citizens of the Roman empire, while Demotic examined the many voices that vie to be heard within the American polity.Farley, Kathryn. \\"The DuSable Project: Hypertext Narrative Strategies in Live Performance.\\" Leonardo Electronic Almanac 13 (2005).

Experiments were made with human sunglasses and sports goggles before a pair was developed to fit the shape of a dog's head.

She contacted the Doggles Company and together they have sent over 120 pairs of Doggles out to Iraq for the military working dogs. Doggles were also featured in a CNN Saturday Morning News segment about equipment being sent out to military dogs on 30 July 2005. The British newspaper Metro reported in March 2007 the story of a dog suffering from a rare autoimmune disorder which means its eyes cannot produce tears. The owner, Diana Stephens, has the dog wear Doggles in order to prevent its eyes from drying out. Uses of Doggles for other eye conditions have also been reported. Veterinarian Pete Wedderburn reported in his Daily Telegraph blog in 2009 the case of a terrier that suffered from an ophthalmological condition in which tiny specks of debris were floating around inside its eyes. When exposed to bright sunshine, the dog would twist to its side while snarling and yelping; something that was originally thought to be the exacerbation of an existing arthritis condition. A pair of Doggles was ordered, and while the terrier did not initially like wearing them, they did solve the problem. Eventually the owner found that a baseball cap designed for dogs proved to be the solution as the terrier did not mind wearing it.

He teaches creative writing at Texas A&M; and operates small press Slough Press, publishing since 1973. His contribution to building the literature scene on the Third Coast in Austin, Texas, includes activities as both a writer and publisher. He published leading poets, fiction and non-fiction writers whose books received numerous awards and were later published by larger presses. His own titles, such as the poetry collection What do You Want, Blood? received the 1988 Austin Book Award and regional critical acclaim. He is one of the legendary figures of the Austin‚ÄìSan Antonio‚ÄìDallas triangle culture that nurtured the eccentric, free-spirited independence of Texan bohemia and cross-cultural innovative creativity, especially in the literary arts. Taylor's novel, Drifter's Story, and his poetry book, Ordinary Life, explore the lives of the working poor. He has taught in the NEA Poets-in-the-Schools Program and was CETA Poet-in-Residence for the City of Salt Lake. Along with Pat Littledog, Taylor co-operated Paperbacks Plus Books in Austin, Texas, from 1980 to 1988. The store became an important literary center for the Southwest sponsoring literary readings and plays as well as serving as a home for Slough Press. Business owners John and Marquetta Tilton of Dallas opened several store locations run by famous Texas poets and writers who had not yet achieved widespread notoriety: poet Dr. Ricardo Sanchez in San Antonio and Dr. Hedwig Gorski's infamous Voltaire's Basement bookstore in downtown Austin. All branches of Paperbacks Plus allowed serious poets to live with their families on the store premises while providing a small income managing or selling at the location. Each became a hub of literary and performance activities across generations and styles nurturing the offbeat talents and lifestyles Central Texas is known for. These activities, venues, and people set the stage during the late 1970s and 80s for Austin Poetry Slam scenes. Communalism Among the many themes Taylor uses expressing a hippie principle of communalism in both poetry and prose is the conflict between the ideal and the actual. His influences include Henry David Thoreau and hedonism. His search for spirituality includes reading Barth and Tillich and practicing chanting and meditation, plus explorations with a channeling group and a Wiccan group. Professor Taylor has been the Coordinator of Creative Writing in the English Department of Texas A&M; University at College Station and taught literature and creative writing there for 21 years.

Synopsis  An experimental submarine, the \\"Siren II\\", with an experienced NATO crew is sent to find out what happened to the missing \\"Siren I\\". The designer of the sub blames the Contek corporation's modifications. The Siren 2 is captained by experienced officer Captain Randolph Phillips (Emery) The Siren 2 traces the Siren I's black box to an underwater rift. They are surrounded by a toxic weed, although an on-board scientist says plant life at this depth is impossible. The Siren 2 escapes the weed by reversing the polarity of the hull, although some of the weed gets into the sub.

It covers an area of about 237 square kilometers and is located east and south of Al Qunfudhah in Makkah governorate. The population ranges from 20,000 to 21,000 Buhairis, divided into two primary communities: Alabadilah and Alwohoob. Two sheikhs are named for the tribe: Mwanis bin Saad (Al-abadilah) and Moussa Mubarak (Alwohoob).  Location  The borders of Bani Buhair are marked beyond Al-Ghabra, a small village inhabited by people from Bani Suhaim tribe. Primarily, Bani Buhair includes Furi Alabadilah on the Mount Inanin where small villages are also scattered such as Alsahnah and Alghamrah. The tribe embraces Alriyan (or Afas), Alwasha, and various parts of Bilharith region, i.e. Talaaa on the southern bank of Wadi Qanuna, a well-known wadi in Al Ordyaitain. The main residence of Bani Buhair is Alfaija where Suq Alrabu is located, a small market weekly visited by neighboring tribes on Wednesdays. Westwards, a handful of isolated villages are seen such as Hadrah, Hamdah, Siqarin, Musawi down to the outskirts of Mount Safa, a key feature on the western border of the tribe.  History  The history of Bani Buhair is a matter of discussion to date. Hamad Aljasir has not proposed a link for Bani Buhair within the tribal tree of Balqarn. On the basis of inaccurate historical account, however, Abdullah Alrizqi (2008) provides various hypotheses to account for the etymological origin of the word Buahir: (1) it has been suggested that Buhair is a person from the Yemeni tribe Tayy, who was well-renowned for hospitality and courage. (2) Buhair may be a treaty title signed between alliances in the region. (3) Bani Buhair (translated as the sons of a small sea) were initially immigrants from Bani Rizq down to wadi Qanuna. The ancestors perceived wadi qanuna wide enough as Buhair (lit. a small sea), and they named themselves after the wadi.  Culture  Culture of Bani Buhair does not hold worth-mentioning aspects. However, three cultural practices from religious and social perspectives are dominant in the tribe: circumcision, Zoroastrianism (religious practices) and night courtship (social practice). Bani Buhair people used to postpone the time of circumcision at a late age, mostly beyond the age of puberty. A young man strips himself of all his clothes and calls out the neighboring tribes for a show. As the tribes come together, the young man announces his willingness for circumcision and addresses a long sermon that highlights accounts of his ancestors‚Äô glory. He puts up a small stick in his hand while a slave performs the circumcision. The young man must maintain balance until the process is complete. Then his tribe comes near to lift him on shoulders in pride. It has been reported, however, that a couple of people passed out during the circumcision. Sky-related practices to mention a few are also observed in Bani Buhair culture. They are claimed to be remnants of Zoroastrianism. For example, when a person loses a tooth, they throw it to the sun in hope of a substitute. They say ‚ÄúO sun, please accept this tooth of a donkey and grant me a tooth of a deer.‚Äù Another practice is attested during the lunar eclipse; villagers fill barrels with water to reduce the so-called heat of the moon. During night, children are also discouraged from counting stars. They believe the counted stars leave acne on the private body parts. Dating 'night courtship' was a common act in the past. However, it has been islamically forbidden later on. In the past, a man was allowed to visit houses and ask fathers about the health of their daughters. Dating takes place in the house, and it is confined to marriage plans.

Altair SS Edisto was launched 10 May 1919, and commissioned as on 6 December 1921. She was converted to a destroyer tender at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and equipped with machine tools and shop equipment salvaged from dismantled war plants in the demobilization after World War I. She became the tender for destroyer squadron 12 in San Diego on 17 December 1922. San Diego remained her home port until the Battle Fleet moved to Pearl Harbor in 1940. She arrived in Bermuda on 11 November 1941 to support Neutrality Patrol destroyers, and was subsequently stationed in Trinidad and Guant√°namo Bay through World War II. She was scrapped in 1947.

After serving briefly in the Mediterranean, she was decommissioned at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 1924 to 1940, and never received the 5-inch gun carried by her sisters. She was recommissioned to prepare destroyers for transfer to the Royal Navy in Halifax Harbour for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. She was then stationed in Casco Bay tending Mid-Ocean Escort Force destroyers until sent to the Mediterranean in July 1944 to tend destroyers at Cagliari for Operation Dragoon. She was scrapped in 1950. Rigel SS Edgecombe was launched 23 November 1918, and commissioned as on 24 February 1922.

She was lightly damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor, and remained at Pearl Harbor until April 1942. She was stationed in Auckland until November, Espiritu Santo until January 1943, and Efate through April 1943. She was then stationed in New Guinea providing repair services to the VII Amphibious Force from 7 June 1943 to 10 January 1945; and spent the remainder of 1945 in the Philippines.

In the 1840s, it is thought to have been the newspaper with the largest circulation of any newspaper in any language in Missouri.Catholicism and American Freedom,, John McGreevy Norton and Co., New York 2003, p. 22-23. History=Early years The Anzeiger was founded by Heinrich Bimpage and B.T.O. Festen and its first issue appeared in June 1835. At first it was issued as a weekly. For years, the paper was the leading source of German-American thought throughout the Midwest. William Weber became editor early in 1836. He had been a German student. His republican sympathies and involvement in the Polish uprising of 1830 had made him an exile after imprisonment in Leipzig. His first employment in St. Louis had been as a librarian at the Mercantile Library. Henry Boernstein, one of several editors and proprietors, starting in 1850 Carl Daenzer, Editor of the Anzeiger des Westens.

Portraits n12053{\\"subject_uri\\":\\"http:\\\\/\\\\/collections.mohistory.org\\\\/resource\\\\/20881\\",\\"local_id\\":\\"37086\\"} Weber was a vigorous young writer, and soon drew about him the leading German minds of the city and vicinity: George Engelmann, Gustave Koerner, Fred. Muench and others of such stamp contributed to its columns. Opposition to slavery was an early theme. From 1842 to 1846 the paper was issued triweekly, and in the latter year as a daily. In 1844 Arthur Olshausen secured an interest, and three years later became sole proprietor. In 1850, Henry Boernstein succeeded Weber as editor, and very soon became proprietor and publisher. Boernstein was for years a conspicuous figure in St. Louis. In Austrian Poland he had studied medicine, served as a soldier, written editorials for newspapers, composed plays, and been a stage manager and actor. In Paris he hailed with delight the fall of Louis Philippe, but when Napoleon III came into power he fled the country, and was next heard from in Highland, Illinois. In 1851, Carl Daenzer was employed by Boernstein as editor. Daenzer had drifted into St. Louis as a general writer. He had been a member of the Frankfurt Parliament, and had made himself obnoxious to the German government with efforts to bring about German unity by force of arms. For his rebellious course, he was condemned to ten years' imprisonment with a heavy fine. He escaped to Switzerland, and thence to the United States. Native American Party Educated German-Americans rallied around the paper to fight the Native American Party (or \\"Know Nothing\\" party as they became known) which was becoming strong in St. Louis. The party was anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic and thought Protestant, native-born Americans should control the government. \\"Know Nothingism\\" found stimulus in the fact that, in three months of one year in the late 1840s, 529 steamboats had landed at the St. Louis levee, bringing 30,000 immigrants to settle west of the Mississippi. A Soulard neighborhood brick house When the Know Nothing sentiment culminated in violence, the Anzeiger was the first object of attack. At the city election of 1853, it was charged that the German-Americans had taken control of the First Ward polls at Soulard Market, and were preventing the Whigs from voting. At that time, the Germans were classed as Benton Democrats. The report was brought up town that Mitchell had been mobbed and that Mayor Kennett, candidate for re-election, had been hissed at. Bob O'Blennis, the gambler, and Ned Buntline, the story writer, assembled 5,000 men and marched down to Soulard Market. Pistol shots were fired. Stones were thrown. The crowd from up-town fired into the market house. A shot from Neumeyer's Tavern, on Seventh Street and Park Avenue, killed Joseph Stevens of the St. Louis Fire Company. The Americans charged the tavern, gutted it and burned it. They got two six-pounder cannons and located them on a Park Avenue corner to rake the streets to the south but did not fire. One party of 1500 people started for the office of the Anzeiger to clean it out, but met the militia and turned back. This trouble wore itself out in a day. It was the curtain raiser for the election tragedy of August 1854. Antagonism toward foreigners had become intense. Foreign-born American citizens offering to vote were challenged and called on to show their papers and then declared to be disqualified. Later years Boernstein was wont to squeeze the maximum of labor for the minimum of pay out of his employees at the Anzeiger. He not only undertook to rule the then rising abolitionist movement, but he had a number of other irons in the fire. He wrote a sensational novel first serialized in the gazette called The Mysteries of St. Louis that was strongly critical of Jesuits and Catholics (a large presence in St. Louis since French colonial days), and he undertook the management of a German-language theater. As a political boss, with his arrogance and dictatorial spirit, he quickly got into disrepute among his partisans. His influence waned and subscriptions began to fall off. Boernstein turned the entire conduct and responsibility of the Anzeiger over to Daenzer, whose name was put over the editorial columns, and who continued to edit the paper until 1857. Differences of various kinds arising between Boernstein and Daenzer, the latter withdrew, and, with the aid of friends, started the Westliche Post which was a vigorous competitor with the Anzeiger for several decades. Charles L. Bernays became editor of the Anzeiger after Daenzer's departure. Boernstein had been connected with Bernays in literary ways in Germany and France, and Bernays had preceded him to Highland, Illinois. Carl Daenzer, editor, and revitalizer of the Anzeiger When Daenzer returned to St. Louis in 1862 after having left for Europe in 1860, he found that the Anzeiger had gone out of business, likely due to Boernstein's having joined the army in the Civil War. He resuscitated the old concern under the name of the Neue Anzeiger des Westens, for the publication of which a company was incorporated, including William Palm, Charles Speck and others. After a time, the word \\"Neue\\" (new) was dropped. Although in the main supporting Democratic measures, the Anzeiger can hardly be said to have been an \\"organ\\" of that party, its chief quality being complete independence. During the agitation of the money question, it was always a strong advocate of the gold standard. After 1894, Daenzer had an able assistant in Carl Albrecht, a clear and forceful writer, particularly upon European and economic topics. On June 1, 1898, the Westliche Post and Anzeiger des Westens were consolidated, the local Tribune having previously been absorbed by the Anzeiger. Emil Preetorius of the Westliche Post and Daenzer both retired. Under the consolidation both papers, the Morning Westliche Post and the Evening Anzeiger, were issued by the German-American Press Association, the stockholders being Emil Preetorius, Carl Daenzer, Edwin C. Kehr, Charles Nagel and Paul F. Coste, John Schroers, business manager. The Sunday issue was called The Mississippi Blaetter or \\"Leaves\\". The Post remained Republican in politics, and the Anzeiger independent. Edward L. Preetorius was prominent in the management, and the editorial corps included Carl Albrecht.

The more cell types a cell can differentiate into, the greater its potency. Potency is also described as the gene activation potential within a cell, which like a continuum, begins with totipotency to designate a cell with the most differentiation potential, pluripotency, multipotency, oligopotency, and finally unipotency. Pluripotent, embryonic stem cells originate as inner mass cells within a blastocyst. These stem cells can become any tissue in the body, excluding a placenta. Only the morula's cells are totipotent, able to become all tissues and a placenta. Totipotency Totipotency (Lat. totipotentia, \\"ability for all [things]\\") is the ability of a single cell to divide and produce all of the differentiated cells in an organism. Spores and zygotes are examples of totipotent cells. In the spectrum of cell potency, totipotency represents the cell with the greatest differentiation potential, being able to differentiate into any embryonic cell, as well as extraembryonic cells. In contrast, pluripotent cells can only differentiate into embryonic cells. It is possible for a fully differentiated cell to return to a state of totipotency. This conversion to totipotency is complex, not fully understood and the subject of recent research. Research in 2011 has shown that cells may differentiate not into a fully totipotent cell, but instead into a \\"complex cellular variation\\" of totipotency. Stem cells resembling totipotent blastomeres from 2-cell stage embryos can arise spontaneously in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures and also can be induced to arise more frequently in vitro through down-regulation of the chromatin assembly activity of CAF-1. The human development model is one which can be used to describe how totipotent cells arise. Human development begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg and the resulting fertilized egg creates a single totipotent cell, a zygote. In the first hours after fertilization, this zygote divides into identical totipotent cells, which can later develop into any of the three germ layers of a human (endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm), or into cells of the placenta (cytotrophoblast or syncytiotrophoblast). After reaching a 16-cell stage, the totipotent cells of the morula differentiate into cells that will eventually become either the blastocyst's Inner cell mass or the outer trophoblasts. Approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these totipotent cells begin to specialize. The inner cell mass, the source of embryonic stem cells, becomes pluripotent. Research on Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that multiple mechanisms including RNA regulation may play a role in maintaining totipotency at different stages of development in some species. Work with zebrafish and mammals suggest a further interplay between miRNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in determining development differences. Primordial germ cells In mouse primordial germ cells, genome-wide reprogramming leading to totipotency involves erasure of epigenetic imprints. Reprogramming is facilitated by active DNA demethylation involving the DNA base excision repair enzymatic pathway. This pathway entails erasure of CpG methylation (5mC) in primordial germ cells via the initial conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a reaction driven by high levels of the ten-eleven dioxygenase enzymes TET-1 and TET-2. Pluripotency A: Human embryonic stem cells (cell colonies that are not yet differentiated). B: Nerve cells In cell biology, pluripotency (Lat. pluripotentia, \\"ability for many [things]\\") refers to a stem cell that has the potential to differentiate into any of the three germ layers: endoderm (interior stomach lining, gastrointestinal tract, the lungs), mesoderm (muscle, bone, blood, urogenital), or ectoderm (epidermal tissues and nervous system), but not into extra-embryonic tissues like the placenta. However, cell pluripotency is a continuum, ranging from the completely pluripotent cell that can form every cell of the embryo proper, e.g., embryonic stem cells and iPSCs (see below), to the incompletely or partially pluripotent cell that can form cells of all three germ layers but that may not exhibit all the characteristics of completely pluripotent cells. Induced pluripotency Induced pluripotent stem cells, commonly abbreviated as iPS cells or iPSCs, are a type of pluripotent stem cell artificially derived from a non-pluripotent cell, typically an adult somatic cell, by inducing a \\"forced\\" expression of certain genes and transcription factors. These transcription factors play a key role in determining the state of these cells and also highlights the fact that these somatic cells do preserve the same genetic information as early embryonic cells. The ability to induce cells into a pluripotent state was initially pioneered in 2006 using mouse fibroblasts and four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc; this technique, called reprogramming, earned Shinya Yamanaka and John Gurdon the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012.\\"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012\\". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2013. Web. 28 Nov 2013. This was then followed in 2007 by the successful induction of human iPSCs derived from human dermal fibroblasts using methods similar to those used for the induction of mouse cells. These induced cells exhibit similar traits to those of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but do not require the use of embryos. Some of the similarities between ESCs and iPSCs include pluripotency, morphology, self-renewal ability, a trait that implies that they can divide and replicate indefinitely, and gene expression. Epigenetic factors are also thought to be involved in the actual reprogramming of somatic cells in order to induce pluripotency. It has been theorized that certain epigenetic factors might actually work to clear the original somatic epigenetic marks in order to acquire the new epigenetic marks that are part of achieving a pluripotent state. Chromatin is also reorganized in iPSCs and becomes like that found in ESCs in that it is less condensed and therefore more accessible. Euchromatin modifications are also common which is also consistent with the state of euchromatin found in ESCs. Due to their great similarity to ESCs, iPSCs have been of great interest to the medical and research community. iPSCs could potentially have the same therapeutic implications and applications as ESCs but without the controversial use of embryos in the process, a topic of great bioethical debate. In fact, the induced pluripotency of somatic cells into undifferentiated iPS cells was originally hailed as the end of the controversial use of embryonic stem cells. However, iPSCs were found to be potentially tumorigenic, and, despite advances, were never approved for clinical stage research in the United States. Setbacks such as low replication rates and early senescence have also been encountered when making iPSCs, hindering their use as ESCs replacements. Additionally, it has been determined that the somatic expression of combined transcription factors can directly induce other defined somatic cell fates (transdifferentiation); researchers identified three neural-lineage-specific transcription factors that could directly convert mouse fibroblasts (skin cells) into fully functional neurons. This result challenges the terminal nature of cellular differentiation and the integrity of lineage commitment; and implies that with the proper tools, all cells are totipotent and may form all kinds of tissue. Some of the possible medical and therapeutic uses for iPSCs derived from patients include their use in cell and tissue transplants without the risk of rejection that is commonly encountered. iPSCs can potentially replace animal models unsuitable as well as in vitro models used for disease research. Naive human pluripotent stem cell colony here seen growing on feeder cells (mouse). Naive vs. primed pluripotency states Recent findings with respect to epiblasts before and after implantation have produced proposals for classifying pluripotency into two distinct phases: \\"naive\\" and \\"primed\\". The baseline stem cells commonly used in science that are referred as Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from a pre- implantation epiblast; such epiblast is able to generate the entire fetus, and one epiblast cell is able to contribute to all cell lineages if injected into another blastocyst. On the other hand, several marked differences can be observed between the pre- and post-implantation epiblasts, such as their difference in morphology, in which the epiblast after implantation changes its morphology into a cup-like shape called the \\"egg cylinder\\" as well as chromosomal alteration in which one of the X-chromosomes under random inactivation in the early stage of the egg cylinder, known as X-inactivation. During this development, the egg cylinder epiblast cells are systematically targeted by Fibroblast growth factors, Wnt signaling, and other inductive factors via the surrounding yolk sac and the trophoblast tissue, such that they become instructively specific according to the spatial organization. Another major difference that was observed, with respect to cell potency, is that post-implantation epiblast stem cells are unable to contribute to blastocyst chimeras, which distinguishes them from other known pluripotent stem cells. Cell lines derived from such post-implantation epiblasts are referred to as epiblast-derived stem cells which were first derived in laboratory in 2007; despite their nomenclature, that both ESCs and EpiSCs are derived from epiblasts, just at difference phases of development, and that pluripotency is still intact in the post-implantation epiblast, as demonstrated by the conserved expression of Nanog, Fut4, and Oct-4 in EpiSCs, until somitogenesis and can be reversed midway through induced expression of Oct-4. Multipotency Hematopoietic stem cells are an example of multipotency. When they differentiate into myeloid or lymphoid progenitor cells, they lose potency and become oligopotent cells with the ability to give rise to all cells of its lineage. Multipotency describes progenitor cells which have the gene activation potential to differentiate into discrete cell types. For example, a multipotent blood stem cell ‚Äîand this cell type can differentiate itself into several types of blood cell like lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, etc., but it is still ambiguous whether HSC possess the ability to differentiate into brain cells, bone cells or other non-blood cell types. New research related to multipotent cells suggests that multipotent cells may be capable of conversion into unrelated cell types. In another case, human umbilical cord blood stem cells were converted into human neurons. Research is also focusing on converting multipotent cells into pluripotent cells. Multipotent cells are found in many, but not all human cell types. Multipotent cells have been found in cord blood, adipose tissue, cardiac cells, bone marrow, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which are found in the third molar. MSCs may prove to be a valuable source for stem cells from molars at 8‚Äì10 years of age, before adult dental calcification. MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. Oligopotency In biology, oligopotency is the ability of progenitor cells to differentiate into a few cell types. It is a degree of potency. Examples of oligopotent stem cells are the lymphoid or myeloid stem cells. A lymphoid cell specifically, can give rise to various blood cells such as B and T cells, however, not to a different blood cell type like a red blood cell. Examples of progenitor cells are vascular stem cells that have the capacity to become both endothelial or smooth muscle cells. Unipotency In cell biology, a unipotent cell is the concept that one stem cell has the capacity to differentiate into only one cell type. It is currently unclear if true unipotent stem cells exist. Hepatoblasts, which differentiate into hepatocytes (which constitute most of the liver) or cholangiocytes (epithelial cells of the bile duct), are bipotent. A close synonym for unipotent cell is precursor cell.

Hecker states that he developed the concept of creating a grassroots call for reform prior to the April 15, 2009 Tax Day Tea Party rallies. To get his idea off the ground, he launched a website which encouraged people to offer possible planks for the contract. Hecker told The New York Times, \\"Hundreds of thousands of people voted for their favorite principles online to create the Contract as an open-sourced platform for the Tea Party movement. The agenda had the imprint of everyday citizens every step of the way (in the online voting process).\\" Hecker said the Republicans' 1994 Contract with America represented the nation's last intellectual economic conservative movement, but the new list, he said, was \\"created from the bottom up. It was not crafted in Washington with the help of pollsters.\\" From the original 1,000 ideas which were submitted, Hecker reduced it to about 50 based on popularity, then to 21 items with the help of former House Republican Leader Dick Armey, whose conservative group FreedomWorks has established close ties with many Tea Party activists around the country. After releasing the 21 ideas at CPAC on February 18, 2010, a final online vote was held to narrow the 21 ideas down to the final 10 to be included in the Contract from America. Over two months, 454,331 votes were cast. The resulting document, including the vote percentages for the statements, was posted online on April 12, 2010.

This group of formations is geographically divided into the Gunflint Range, the Mesabi and Vermilion ranges, and the Cuyuna Range. On the map, the Animikie Group is the dark gray northeast-trending belt which ranges from south-central Minnesota, U.S., up to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. The Gunflint Iron Range is the linear black formation labeled G, the Mesabi Iron Range is the jagged black linear formation labeled F, and Cuyuna Iron Range is the two black spots labeled E. The gabbro of the Duluth Complex, intruded during the formation of the Midcontinent Rift, separates the Mesabi and Gunflint iron ranges; it is shown by the speckled area wrapping around the western end of Lake Superior. Banded-iron formations are iron formations which formed about 2,000 million years ago and were first described in the Lake Superior region. Sediments associated with the last stage of the Great Lakes tectonic zone contain banded-iron formations. These sediments were deposited for two hundred million years and extend intermittently along roughly the same trend as the Great Lakes tectonic zone, from Minnesota into eastern Ontario, Canada, and through upper Wisconsin and Michigan. They are characterized by bands of iron compounds and chert. Enough oxygen had accumulated in seawater so that dissolved iron was oxidized; iron reacts with oxygen to form compounds that precipitate out - including hematite, limonite and siderite. These iron compounds precipitated from the seawater in varying proportions with chert, producing banded-iron formations. These iron formations are abundant in the Lake Superior region. The Sudbury Impact event occurred 1,850 million years ago; it is theorized that this caused the end of the banded-iron deposits. The results of the impact affected concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the sea; the accumulation of banded-iron formations suddenly ended . The Gunflint Range consists of a basal conglomerate, then the Gunflint Iron formation and the Gunflint Chert with the Rove Formation deposited on top. The Mesabi Range consists of the basal Pokegama Quartzite layer, then the Biwabik Iron Formation with the Virginia Formation deposited on top. The Vermilion Range consists of the basal Ely Greenstone, then the Soudan Iron formation with various granites on top. The Cuyuna Range consists of the basal North Range group, then the Trommald Formation with the Thomson Formation deposited on top. Age, location and size The Animikie Group sediments were deposited between 2,500 and 1,800 million years ago, in the Animikie Basin. Deposition of sediments began after the Algoman orogeny and continued through the Great Lakes tectonic zone rupture from 2,200 to 1,850 million years ago. The Animikie Group formations are in east-central and northeastern Minnesota, and the Thunder Bay District of Northern Ontario; they are geographically divided into the Gunflint Range, the Mesabi and Vermilion ranges, and the Cuyuna Range. The Animikie Basin was an extensional basin which developed over a basement consisting of the 2,750- to 2,600-million-year-old Superior province to the north and the 3,600-million-year-old Minnesota River Valley subprovince to the south. The extension was caused by the east-northeast-trending Great Lakes tectonic zone; it separates the Superior province from the Minnesota River Valley subprovince. The sediments were deformed, metamorphosed and intruded by the plutonic rocks of the 1860 ¬± 50-million-year-old Penokean orogeny. The rocks of the Animikie Basin form a sequence up to thick and show a complete transition from a stable shelf environment to deep-water conditions. Irregularities in the basement influenced the thickness of the sequence. The by basin is an elongated oval parallel to and straddling the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Development of Animikie Basin Twenty-seven hundred million years ago the Algoman orogeny formed mountains; these bare mountains eroded for several hundred million years to a broad level peneplain. A sea invaded central Minnesota and extended eastward through northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Sediments composed of quartz- rich sand were deposited along the shoreline of this sea; these were succeeded by thick iron-rich layers and eventually kilometers of mud and muddy sand. The deposition of sedimentary strata on top of the Archean basement formed the Animikie Group. The next tectonic event was the Great Lakes tectonic zone which began with compression caused by the collision of the Superior province and the Minnesota River Valley subprovince during the Algoman orogeny about 2,700 million years ago; it continued as a pulling apart (extensional) rift from 2,450 to 2,100 million years ago, followed by a second compression which deformed the rocks in the Lake Superior region during the Penokean orogeny which lasted from 1,900 to 1,850 million years ago. The first deposits occurred during the initial stages of extension of the Great Lakes tectonic zone in the continental crust. As the crust expanded it thinned, and magma was intruded through fissures in the thinned crust. Sedimentation stopped during this transitional period because the elevation was now above sea level. During later stages, the spreading center was adding oceanic crust - which is heavier than continental crust - so the area subsided, seas returned, and the second layer of sediments were deposited unconformably on the basin fill. During the Penokean orogeny the Minnesota River Valley subprovince overrode the Superior province. The third tectonic event was the Penokean orogeny which is dated 1,850 million years ago. The intense, northward-directed compression folded the shale and greywacke of the southernmost unit - the Thomson Formation - and metamorphosed the shale into slate. The Animikie strata on the Gunflint and Mesabi ranges were far enough away so they escaped this deformation and metamorphism; they contain some of the oldest unmetamorphosed sedimentary deposits in the world. Hotspot causing rifting of tectonic plates About a fourth tectonic event occurred in the Lake Superior region. A hotspot of magma from the earth's mantle beneath present-day Lake Superior rose, causing the crust to dome and break apart. This zone of crustal thinning and fracturing is the Midcontinent Rift System; it extends in a boomerang shape for over from northeastern Kansas northward through Iowa, under the Twin Cities of Minnesota, beneath Lake Superior, and then south through the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan and beneath the central Lower Peninsula of Michigan. As the crust was being stretched thin and more magma flowed out from below, the center of the rift was continuously subsiding. The vast quantities of rising magma created a vacuum under the crust, the weight of the solidified magma on the surface caused the crust to subside into that vacuum so the edges of the rift tilted toward the center. The rifting stopped after a few million years; one reason could be that the Grenville orogeny stopped the rift process when that collision occurred. Subsidence continued for several million years after the lava flows had ceased; immense volumes of sediments - sand, gravel and mud - were eroded off the barren landscape into the still-sinking basin along the rift axis. As much as of sedimentary rocks accumulated in the center before the sinking stopped and the region stabilized. A north-northeast trending branch of the Midcontinent Rift System separated the Animikie Basin into two distinct segments; the present-day Animikie Group and the Marquette Range Supergroup; the historical name for the Marquette Range Supergroup is the Animikie Series. Banded-iron formations Hematitic banded-iron formation specimen from Michigan's Upper Peninsula; Scale bar is 5.0 mm Oceanic sediments associated with the last stage of the Great Lakes tectonic zone contain the banded-iron formations. Banded-iron formations are iron formations which formed about 2,000 million years ago and were first described in the Lake Superior region. They are characterized by interlayers - bands - of iron minerals and chert (quartz). These sediments were laid down for two hundred million years and extend intermittently along roughly the same trend as the Great Lakes tectonic zone, from Minnesota into eastern Canada, and through upper Wisconsin and Michigan. Change in atmospheric oxygen levels Banded-iron sediments record the introduction of abundant free oxygen into earth's atmosphere. Microbial life played an important role in changing atmospheric conditions by releasing free oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis. Free oxygen was taken up by elements with strong affinities for it - hydrogen, carbon and iron. Evidence for the change in oxygen levels is that the sediments of the earlier Archean are dark brown and black caused by unoxidized carbon, iron sulfide, and other elements and compounds. As oxygen levels increased in the atmosphere and oceans, the sediments changed. In the late Archean, sediments went through a transitional stage with the banded-iron formations; after this transition they demonstrate an oxygen-rich environment - shown by iron oxide-stained siltstones or mudstones called red beds. Enough oxygen had accumulated in seawater so that dissolved iron - which had earlier eroded from the surrounding land - was oxidized. Oxygenated water has low levels of dissolved iron because iron reacts with oxygen to form compounds that precipitate out; the compounds include hematite (Fe2O3), limonite (Fe2O3¬∑2H2O) and siderite (FeCO3). These iron compounds precipitated from the sea water in varying proportions with chert, producing banded-iron formations. Banded-iron formations occur in several ranges around the margins of this basin, five of which contained sufficient concentrations of iron to be economically mined. These banded-iron formations have been one of the world's greatest sources of iron ore since mining began in the area during the late 19th century. Major iron formations in different parts of the basin represent either nearly contemporaneous shelf sedimentation on either side of the main basin, or deposits formed simultaneously in isolated sub-basins of the main basin. Effect of the Sudbury Impact on atmospheric oxygen levels A thick lateral layer between the metasedimentary Gunflint Iron Formation and overlying Rove Formation, and between the Biwabik Iron Formation and overlying Virginia Formation has evidence that the layer contains hypervelocity impact ejecta. Radiometric dating reveals that this layer was deposited between 1,878 and 1,836 million years ago. The Sudbury Impact event - which occurred to the east 1,850 ¬± 1 million years ago - is the likely ejecta source, making these the oldest ejecta linked to a specific impact. Additional evidence indicates a diameter meteorite collided with earth in the current-day vicinity of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The meteorite vaporized and created a wide crater. Earthquakes shattered the ground hundreds of kilometers away and within seconds ejecta (cloud of ash, rock fragments, gases and droplets of molten rock) began to spread around the globe. It is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake would have registered 10.2 on the Richter magnitude scale. To put the Sudbury meteorite impact in perspective, the Chicxulub impact on the Yucat√°n Peninsula occurred with the impact of a diameter comet. The kinetic energy from this impact probably generated earthquakes registering 13 on the Richter scale. The results of this impact caused the worldwide extinction of many species (including dinosaurs). The Sudbury Impact would have also had global ramifications; it is conjectured that this caused the end of the banded-iron deposits. The results of the impact fundamentally affected concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the sea; the accumulation of marine sediments (the banded-iron formations) were almost instantaneously shut down and banded-iron formation buildups suddenly ended about . In northeastern Minnesota these iron-banded formations lie immediately under the ejecta layer. One use of the impact layer is as a precise timeline that ties together well- known stratigraphic sequences of the various geographically separated iron ranges. The Sudbury Impact layer lies at a horizon that records a significant change in the character of sediments across the region. The layer marks the end of a major period of banded-iron formation deposition that was succeeded by deposition of fine clastic rocks - commonly black shales. End of deposition Sedimentation styles of the passive margin changed as deposition came to a close. The sedimentary environment recorded near the end changed from deep water shales derived from Archean rocks to coarser clastic rocks derived from a younger Proterozoic source. This change is interpreted to be from the Pembine-Wausau island arc as it closed in from the south just before its collision during the Penokean orogeny. Sediments shedding off the island arc settled on top of the previously deposited sequences. Formations within Animikie Group=Gunflint Range The Duluth Complex splits the Mesabi and Gunflint ranges. The Gunflint Range is a mountain range in northeastern Minnesota, U.S., and western Ontario, Canada. The Gunflint and Mesabi ranges form a belt extending from the upper Mississippi River to the extreme northeast part of Minnesota and into Canada to Thunder Bay. The two ranges are separated by the 1,099-million-year-old Duluth Complex which was formed during the Midcontinent Rift. The Gunflint Iron Formation is 1,878 ¬± 2 million years old. It lies on top of a basal conglomerate, unlike the Biwabik Iron Formation which was deposited on top of the Pokegama Quartzite in the Mesabi Range, and the Cuyuna Iron Formation which was deposited on top of the Mille Lacs and North ranges. It is long, less than wide, and thick. This iron formation lies in a northeasterly-trending belt; most of it lies in Ontario. Rove formation represented by prv The upper sedimentary layer is the 1,800- to 1,600-million- year-old Rove Formation. The seas and laid down the shales, slates and mudstones of the Rove Formation. Because the formation is on the northern part of the Animikie Basin these rocks escaped the crustal deformation from the Penokean orogeny that characterizes the equivalent strata of the Thomson Formation; this left the Rove Formation unmetamorphosed and lying flat. These are some of the oldest undeformed and unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks in North America. The dikes and sills within the Rove Formation were intruded during the Midcontinent Rift. Mesabi Range The Mesabi Range is over long and less than wide - its typical width is - and thick. Its natural ore is hematite- or geothite-rich leached iron formation; natural ores contain up to 50% iron and less than 10% silica. These thick sedimentary layers contain millions of tons of iron and minor ores which have been mined in the Great Lakes region since before the turn of the 20th century. Sedimentation ended when the Penokean orogeny began . The three different formations exposed along the Mesabi Iron Range were deposited along the leading edge of a foredeep basin - the Animikie Basin - which transgressed north over the Archean craton during the Penokean orogeny. Deposition of the basal Pokegama Quartzite, the medial Biwabik Iron Formation and the upper Virginia Formation's sediments represent near-shore, shelf and slope environments, respectively. These three layers were formed 2,500 to 1,600 million years ago. Pokegama Quartzite occupies the lowest level of the Mesabi Range sequence and is younger than 2,500 million years old. It contains shale, siltstone and sandstone, which were deposited in a flat environment of the sea that covered the Archean surface. It is thick, with an average of . The 1,900- to 1,850-million-year- old Biwabik Iron Formation is a narrow belt of iron-rich strata that extends east-northeast for ; its thickness varies from , its average may be . It has four primary subdivisions: the Lower Cherty (which was deposited upon the Pokegama Quartzite), the Lower Slatey, the Upper Cherty and the Upper Slaty (which the Virginia Formation rests upon). The two ore-producing layers are the Upper and Lower Cherty subdivisions; cherts make up the bulk of the formation. The east end of the Biwabik Iron Formation was metamorphosed by the heat of the Duluth Complex. The 1,850-million-year-old Virginia Formation is the sedimentary layer on top of the Biwabik Iron Range and forms the footwall of the 1,100-million-year-old Duluth Complex in the Ely - Hoyt Lakes region. The Virginia formation consists of black to dark gray argillite, which does not crop out in natural exposures. Vermilion Range Anticline The Vermilion Range is north of the Mesabi Iron Range; it is long and ranges from wide. Its basal unit is the Ely Greenstone layer. Ely Greenstone consists of igneous rocks which were metamorphosed by the gabbro of the Duluth Complex. The Ely Greenstone is a belt consisting chiefly of metamorphosed volcanic rocks which have been deformed so that original bedding stands nearly vertical. In the Soudan area the Ely Greenstone has been tightly folded and slightly overturned southward into the Tower-Soudan anticline, and bedding is inclined 70-80¬∞ to the north. The volcanic rocks of the Ely Greenstone are divided into a lower and upper sequence; the upper and lower volcanic sequences are separated by the Soudan Iron Formation - a thick unit that is transitional with the Ely Greenstone - which consists chiefly of banded iron- formation. The Soudan Iron Formation is in the western part of the Vermilion Range. It is in narrow belts, and consists of cherts, hematite, magnetite and small amounts of pyrite. The narrow belts trend east-northeast with the widest part to the southwest. These iron-bearing rocks are of sedimentary origin which overlie an igneous series. The iron formation is tightly folded with greenstone. and is overlain by granites in the Vermilion, Trout, Burntside, Basswood and Saganaga lake areas. Cuyuna Range Constituent parts of Cuyuna Iron Range Cross section of Cuyuna North Range The Cuyuna Iron Range is southwest of the Mesabi Range in east-central Minnesota; it is by of tightly folded iron formations. Its thickness ranges from . Two sequences - the Mille Lacs and North ranges - underlie the southern part of the Animike Group. The Mille Lacs Group is more than 2,197 ¬± 39 million years old. The North Range Group is the basal unit for the Cuyuna Range. It is divided into three structural units: South Range (The rocks of the South Range are assigned to the Mille Lacs group.), North Range and the Emily District each with its own characteristic stratigraphy and structure. The rocks of the South and North ranges are separated by a major north-verging thrust fault, and both are overlain unconformably by the Emily District. The rocks of the North Range - assigned to the North Range Group, - are divided into three formations, the Mahnomen, Trommald and Rabbit Lake. The North Range of the Cuyuna Range was regionally metamorphosed during the Penokean orogeny, which peaked between 1,870 and 1,850 million years ago. The iron ore of the Cuyuna is a Lake Superior-type iron-formation similar to other iron formations in the region. The Mahnomen Formation has a lower member, which lacks iron oxide components, and an upper member dominated by beds of iron oxide argillite and lean iron- formation interlayered with non-iron oxide argillite, siltstone and quartzose sandstone. The Trommald Formation - the principal iron formation of the North Range - is a chemically precipitated unit. This formation is thick and is composed of carbonate-silicate iron formations and associated manganese oxide deposits. The iron oxidised to form hematite and goethite. The uppermost Rabbit Lake Formation has a lower member of black mudstone inserted with beds of iron formation and units of volcanogenic origin; and an upper member of slate, carbonaceous mudstone, greywacke and thin units of iron-rich strata. Syncline and anticlines The top sedimentary layer is the Thomson Formation which was deposited 1,880 to 1,870 million years ago and deformed by the Penokean orogeny 1,850 million years ago. The formation contains folded and metamorphosed greywacke, siltstone, mudstone and slate which were originally deposited in the sea as horizontal beds of mud and sand; the Penokean orogeny subjected the rocks to intense compression from the south. This folded the layers into east-west trending anticlines and synclines, and compressed the muddy beds into slate, a metamorphic rock. The Thomson Formation has steeply dipping beds of greywacke, siltstone and slate. Several basaltic dikes, from the lava of the Midcontinent Rift period, cut across the Thomson Formation slate and greywackes. Most of these dikes trend in a northeasterly direction; they represent magma that rose in fissures in the crust. Summary of Huronian and Marquette Range supergroups The Huronian and Marquette Range supergroups are similar sedimentary groups to the Animikie Group; all three are in the Great Lakes region. Rifting of continental plates create sedimentary basins; the largest of these basins in the Great Lakes area are the Animikie Group in Minnesota, the Marquette Range Supergroup in northern Michigan and Wisconsin, and the Huronian Supergroup in eastern Ontario. Huronian Supergroup The Huronian Supergroup on the north shore of Lake Huron in Ontario overlies an Archean basement. On the map it is the formation north of both Lake Huron and the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone. Huronian sedimentary rocks form a east-west fold belt and reach a thickness of near Lake Huron. Deposition of sediments began 2,450 to 2,219 million years ago and continued until 1,850 to 1,800 million years ago when the rocks were deformed and metamorphosed during the Penokean orogeny. The supergroup's sedimentary layers are divided into lower and upper sequences. The lower sequence is subdivided into the Elliot Lake, Hough Lake and Quirke Lake groups; the upper sequence is the Cobalt Group. The lower sequences were deposited in a continental rift basin and the upper sequence was deposited in a stable passive margin. Marquette Range Supergroup The Marquette Range Supergroup also overlies an Archean basement. Originally termed the Animikie Series, it was proposed to be renamed in 1970 to avoid confusion with the Animikie Group in Ontario and Minnesota. On the map it is the dark grey area south of Lake Superior with four iron ranges shown. This supergroup consists of the Chocolay, Menominee, Baraga and Paint River groups, in descending order of age. The Chocolay Group - up to thick - is a shallow-marine layer which was deposited on the Archean basement; deposition in the Chocolay Group began 2,207 ¬± 5 million years ago and ended 2,115 ¬± 5 million years ago. The Menominee Group is a foredeep deposit whose layers were deposited in second-order basins created by oblique subduction of the continental margin, rather than in basins formed on a rifting margin. The upper Baraga Group represents deeper marine basins resulting from increased subsidence and continued collision. Deposition continued until when the Penokean orogeny began.

It is also the only secondary school on the city's west side. Classes began on the afternoon of Monday, August 30, 2010, and a grand opening followed on September 17 at a final, on-budget construction cost of $45.3 million. The school was built at a 20 hectare site as part of a $94.3 million Community School project which also included a Catholic Central High School West Campus, Crossings Branch Library, and the Crossings Leisure Complex. The first principal was Clark Bosch, formerly of Winston Churchill High School. A high number of the first staff and athletic directors were formerly of Lethbridge Collegiate Institute, The school features a 350-seat theatre, with similar amenities to the Genevieve E.

Notable cases=Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association Judge Staton presided over a challenge brought by several Orange County public school teachers to the California Teachers Union's exclusive bargaining system on constitutional grounds. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed her ruling in favor of the teachers union,https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1292811/teacher-friedrichs- plaintiffs-appeals-brief0814.pdf and this ruling was upheld by an evenly divided U.S. Supreme Court in a 4-4 per curiam decision in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Ass'n. Justice Scalia had been the expected 5th vote to overturn the controlling 1977 Abood decision, but his 2016 death shortly after the case was argued meant there was a deadlocked decision. Subsequently, Abood was overturned in Janus v. AFSCME in 2018, which effectively overturned Judge Staton's ruling in Friedrichs. Afghan Family Travel Ban Case In the wake of President Donald Trump's controversial Executive Order 13769 restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, certain individuals with valid U.S. visas continued to be detained at borders and airports despite a nationwide temporary restraining order having been issued by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Washington v. Trump. In a case that drew international attention, Judge Staton issued an emergency temporary restraining order on March 4, 2017, to prevent an Afghan family from being separated‚Äîand the wife and three small children sent to a detention facility in Texas‚Äîafter all five had arrived at Los Angeles International Airport with Special Immigrant Visas and were detained for almost two days without access to counsel. Judge Staton held a hearing on March 6, 2017, after which the Department of Homeland Security released the family for provisional resettlement in Washington state and ultimately granted them permanent residency status. Special immigrant visas were created for citizens from Iraq and Afghanistan whose lives were at risk because they had worked for the U.S. military or government, and the visa requires intense State Department vetting and interviews before being approved. At the hearing it was revealed that the visas had been issued because the father had worked for the U.S. military in Afghanistan for more than 10 years and had received death threats from the Taliban. Constitutionality of CFPB In a case involving a long-running investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) into the fraudulent consumer debt relief practices of Morgan Drexen and its proxy law firm, Judge Staton ruled that the CFPB was a constitutionally formed federal bureau. The defendant had argued that the CFPB violated constitutional separation of powers because it was headed by a single Director who exercises substantial executive power but can only be removed by the President for cause. Judge Staton cited the Supreme Court decision in Morrison v. Olson to hold that the for-cause removal restriction protecting the CFPB‚Äôs Director does not \\"impede the President‚Äôs ability to perform his constitutional duty\\" to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. Prior to the ruling, a three judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals had found the CFPB's structure unconstitutional in a ruling written by then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh, but an en banc decision by the DC Circuit reversed that decision and found the CFPB to be constitutional. Judge Staton's ruling was unanimously affirmed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The case, Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was argued before the U. S. Supreme Court on March 3, 2020. On June 29, 2020, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision ruled that the CFPB structure, with a sole director that could only be terminated for cause, was unconstitutional as it violated the separation of powers, vacating the lower court judgement and remanding the case for review. The Court found that the statute concerning the director of the CFPB was severable from the rest of the statute establishing the agency, and thus \\"The agency may therefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will.\\" Kids' Climate Change Case On January 17, 2020, on a 2-1 vote, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed an Oregon District Court ruling in Juliana, et al. v. United States of America, et al, a climate justice-based lawsuit filed in 2015 by 21 youth plaintiffs including Xiuhtezcatl Martinez against the United States and several of its executive branch positions and officers, formerly including President Barack Obama and currently, President Donald Trump. The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and future generations, sought relief under the U.S. Constitution for longstanding U.S. governmental policy contributing to global climate disruption and caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The majority agreed that the government had not rebutted the plaintiffs' science-based allegations of a looming climate catastrophe, but found a lack of standing on the part of the plaintiffs, with Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz holding that \\"it is beyond the power of an Article III court to order, design, supervise, or implement the plaintiffs' requested remedial plan. As the opinions of their experts make plain, any effective plan would necessarily require a host of complex policy decisions entrusted, for better or worse, to the wisdom and discretion of the executive and legislative branches.\\" In dissent, Judge Staton, sitting on the 9th Circuit panel by designation, characterized the majority as shirking its judicial responsibility to rectify a grave constitutional wrong in the manner the U.S. Supreme Court laudably did in its landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, stating, \\"My colleagues throw up their hands, concluding that this case presents nothing fit for the Judiciary.\\" She further argued, \\"No case can singlehandedly prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change predicted by the government and scientists. But a federal court need not manage all of the delicate foreign relations and regulatory minutiae implicated by climate change to offer real relief, and the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt climate change does not mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution.\\"U.S. court dismisses suit by youths over climate change, Register-Guard, Gillian Flaccus (AP), January 18, 2020. Retrieved January 19, 2020. In an analogy from her impassioned dissent that became widely cited in the news media, Judge Staton stated that \\"[i]n these proceedings, the government accepts as fact that the United States has reached a tipping point crying out for a concerted response -- yet presses ahead toward calamity. It is as if an asteroid were barreling toward Earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses. Seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the Nation.\\"Appeals court throws out lawsuit by children seeking to force action on climate crisis, CNN, Dan Berman, January 17, 2020.

Coronavirus Quarantine Case In a case that drew national media attention, Judge Staton issued a temporary restraining order at the request of the City of Costa Mesa on February 21, 2020, in response to a hasty plan by the State of California and the U.S. federal government to ship dozens of patients testing positive for coronavirus, then quarantined at Travis Air Force Base in Solano County, to a former assisted living center in Orange County, California. Judge Staton scheduled an expedited hearing for the following Monday, after which she continued the TRO in place pending a showing by the State of California as to its plan to house the patients in a densely populated part of the county. Prior to the hearing, the federal government had planned to ship the non-California resident former passengers of the cruise ship from Travis to a former army base in Anniston, Alabama, but Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama lobbied President Trump to include them in the group to be sent to Orange County, California, instead. At the hearing it became apparent that neither the State of California nor the Federal Government had developed a rationale for the plan, so the TRO was continued for another week to allow the authorities to do so. Prior to the next scheduled hearing, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, the state and federal governments withdrew their plan to house the Travis patients at the Fairview Developmental Center location. Personal life Judge Staton is married to Owen Prell, a lawyer and writer.

While Daredevil had been home to the work of comic-book artists such as Everett, Kirby, Wally Wood, John Romita Sr., Gene Colan, and Joe Quesada, among others, Frank Miller's influential tenure on the title in the early 1980s cemented the character as a popular and influential part of the Marvel Universe. Publication history=1960s Daredevil debuted in Marvel Comics' Daredevil #1 (cover date April 1964), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with character design input from Jack Kirby, who devised Daredevil's billy club. When Everett turned in his first-issue pencils extremely late, Marvel production manager Sol Brodsky and Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko inked a large variety of different backgrounds, a \\"lot of backgrounds and secondary figures on the fly and cobbled the cover and the splash page together from Kirby's original concept drawing\\". Wally Wood, known for his 1950s EC Comics stories, penciled and inked issues #5‚Äì10, introducing Daredevil's modern red costume in issue #7.DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 107 Issue #7, featuring Daredevil's battle against the Sub-Mariner, has become one of the most iconic and reprinted stories of the series. Issue #12 began a brief run by Jack Kirby (layouts) and John Romita Sr. The issue marked Romita's return to superhero penciling after a decade of working exclusively as a romance- comic artist for DC. Romita had felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker. He recalled in 1999, Romita later elaborated: When Romita left to take over The Amazing Spider-Man, Lee gave Daredevil to what would be the character's first signature artist, Gene Colan, who began with issue #20 (September 1966). Though #20 identifies Colan as a fill-in penciller, Romita's work load prevented him from returning to the title, and Colan ended up penciling all but three issues through #100 (June 1973), plus the 1967 annual, followed by ten issues sprinkled from 1974‚Äì1979. He would return again for an eight-issue run in 1997. Lee never gave Colan a full script for an issue of Daredevil; instead, he would tell him the plot, and Colan would tape record the conversation to refer to while drawing the issue, leaving Lee to add the script in afterwards.Field, p. 58 Though Colan is consistently credited as penciler only, Lee would typically give him the freedom to fill in details of the plot as he saw fit. Lee explained \\"If I would tell Gene who the villain was and what the problem was, how the problem should be resolved and where it would take place, Gene could fill in all the details. Which made it very interesting for me to write because when I got the artwork back and had to put in the copy, I was seeing things that I'd not expected.\\"Field, p. 61 The 31-issue Lee/Colan run on the series included Daredevil #47, in which Murdock defends a blind Vietnam veteran against a frameup; Lee has cited it as the story he is most proud of out of his entire career. With issue #51, Lee turned the writing chores over to Roy Thomas (who succeeded him on a number of Marvel's titles), but would remain on board as editor for another 40 issues. 1970s 18-year-old Gerry Conway took over as writer with issue #72, and turned the series in a pulp science fiction direction. He also moved Daredevil to San Francisco beginning with Daredevil #86, and simultaneously brought on the Black Widow as co-star.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: In May [1972], writer Gerry Conway transported Daredevil and his crime-fighting partner, the Black Widow, into a mansion in San Francisco. Conway explained, Concerning the Black Widow, he said, \\"I was a fan of Natasha [Romanoff, the Black Widow], and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry.\\" She served as Daredevil's co-star and love interest from #81‚Äì124 (November 1971‚ÄìAugust 1975), of which #93-108 were cover titled Daredevil and the Black Widow. The series had been suffering from slowly declining popularity, and in November 1971 Marvel announced that Daredevil and Iron Man would be combined into a single series, but the addition of the Black Widow revitalized interest in the comic. Due to the Comics Code Authority's restrictions on the depiction of cohabitation, the stories made explicit that though Daredevil and the Black Widow were living in the same apartment, they were sleeping on separate floors, and that Natasha's guardian Ivan Petrovich was always close at hand. Steve Gerber came on board with issue #97, initially scripting over Conway's plots, but Gene Colan's long stint as Daredevil's penciler had come to an end. Gerber recollected, \\"Gene and I did a few issues together, but Gene was basically trying to move on at that point. He'd just started the Dracula book, and he'd been doing Daredevil for God knows how many years. I think he wanted to do something else.\\"Field, p. 115 After six issues with fill-in pencilers, including several with Don Heck, Bob Brown took over as penciller. Tony Isabella succeeded Gerber as writer, but editor Len Wein disapproved of his take on the series and sent him off after only five issues, planning to write it himself. Instead, he ended up handing both writing and editing jobs to his friend Marv Wolfman with issue #124, which introduced inker Klaus Janson to the title. It also wrote the Black Widow out of the series and returned Daredevil to Hell's Kitchen; the post-Conway writers had all felt that Daredevil worked better as a solo hero, and had been working to gradually remove the Widow from the series. Wolfman's 20-issue run included the introduction of one of Daredevil's most popular villains, Bullseye.Sanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: In March [1976], writer Marv Wolfman and artist Bob Brown co-created one of the Man Without Fear's greatest nemeses, Bullseye. He was dissatisfied with his work and quit, later explaining, \\"I felt DD needed something more than I was giving him. I was never very happy with my DD‚ÄîI never found the thing that made him mine the way Frank Miller did a year or two later. So I was trying to find things to do that interested me and therefore, I hoped, the readers. Ultimately, I couldn't find anything that made DD unique to me and asked off the title.\\" His departure coincided with Brown's death from leukemia. With issue #144, Jim Shooter became the writer and was joined by a series of short- term pencilers, including Gil Kane, who had been penciling most of Daredevil's covers since #80 but had never before worked on the comic's interior. The series's once solid sales began dropping during this period, and was downgraded to bi-monthly status with issue #147. Shooter still had difficulty keeping up with the schedule, and the writing chores were shortly turned over to Roger McKenzie. McKenzie's work on Daredevil reflected his background in horror comics, and the stories and even the character himself took on a much darker tone. McKenzie created chain-smoking Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich, who deduces Daredevil's secret identity over the course of issues #153‚Äì163.Manning \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 102: \\"The Daily Bugle gained one of its finest writers when Ben Urich was introduced, thanks to writer Roger McKenzie and penciler Gene Colan.\\" Halfway through his run, McKenzie was joined by penciler Frank Miller, who had previously drawn Daredevil in The Spectacular Spider-Man #27 (February 1979), with issue #158 (May 1979).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 189: In this issue the great longtime Daredevil artist Gene Colan was succeeded by a new penciller who would become a star himself: Frank Miller. 1980s Frank Miller signing a copy issue 181 during an appearance at Midtown Comics. Sales had been declining since the end of the Wolfman/Brown run, and by the time Miller became Daredevil's penciler, the series was in danger of cancellation. Moreover, Miller disliked Roger McKenzie's scripts, and Jim Shooter (who had since become Marvel's editor-in-chief) had to talk him out of quitting. Seeking to appease Miller, and impressed by a short backup feature he had written, new editor Denny O'Neil fired McKenzie so that Miller could write the series. The last issue of McKenzie's run plugs a two-part story which was pulled from publication, as its mature content encountered resistance from the Comics Code Authority, though part one eventually saw print in Daredevil #183, by which time Code standards had relaxed. Miller continued the title in a similar vein to McKenzie. Resuming the drastic metamorphosis the previous writer had begun, Miller took the step of essentially ignoring all of Daredevil's continuity prior to his run on the series; on the occasions where older villains and supporting cast were used, their characterizations and history with Daredevil were reworked or overwritten. Spider-Man villain Kingpin was introduced as Daredevil's new nemesis, displacing most of his large rogues gallery. Daredevil himself was gradually developed into an antihero. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \\"Almost immediately, [Miller] began to attract attention with his terse tales of urban crime.\\" Miller's revamping of the title was controversial among fans, but it clicked with new readers, and sales began soaring, the comic returning to monthly status just three issues after Miller came on as writer. Miller introduced previously unseen characters who had played a major part in his youth, such as Elektra, an ex-girlfriend turned lethal ninja assassin.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 201: \\"Matt Murdock's college sweetheart first appeared in this issue [#168] by writer/artist Frank Miller.\\" Elektra was killed fighting Bullseye in issue #181 (April 1982), an issue which saw brisk sales.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 207: \\"Frank Miller did the unthinkable when he killed off the popular Elektra in Daredevil #181...[This issue] immediately sold out in comic book stores and sent fans and retailers to raid mass market newsstands for all the remaining copies.\\" With #185, inker Janson began doing the pencils over Miller's layouts, and after #191 Miller left the series entirely. O'Neil switched from editor to writer. O'Neil was not enthusiastic about the switch, later saying \\"I took the gig mostly because there didn't seem to be (m)any other viable candidates for it.\\" He continued McKenzie and Miller's noir take on the series, but backed away from the antihero depiction of the character. Janson left shortly after Miller, replaced initially by penciler William Johnson and inker Danny Bulanadi, who were both supplanted by David Mazzucchelli. Miller returned as the title's regular writer, co-writing #226 with O'Neil. Miller and Mazzucchelli crafted the acclaimed \\"Daredevil: Born Again\\" storyline in #227‚Äì233.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 226: \\"'Born Again' was a seven-issue story arc that appeared in Daredevil from issue #227 to #233 (February ‚Äì August 1986).\\" Miller intended to produce an additional two-part story with artist Walt Simonson but the story was never completed and remains unpublished. Three fill-in issues followed before Steve Englehart (under the pseudonym \\"John Harkness\\") took the post of writer, only to lose it after one issue due to a plot conflict with one of the fill-ins. Ann Nocenti was brought on as a fill-in writer but became the series's longest-running regular writer, with a four-and-a-quarter-year run from #238 to #291 (January 1987 ‚Äì April 1991). The shuffle of short-term artists continued for her first year, until John Romita Jr. joined as penciller from #250 to #282 (January 1988 ‚Äì July 1990) alongside inker Al Williamson, who stayed on through #300. The team returned Murdock to law by co-founding with Page a nonprofit drug and legal clinic, while Nocenti crafted stories confronting feminism, drug abuse, nuclear proliferation, and animal rights- inspired terrorism. 1990s New writer D. G. Chichester and penciler Lee Weeks continued from where Nocenti left off. The critically acclaimed \\"Last Rites\\" arc from #297‚Äì300 saw Daredevil regaining his attorney's license and finally bringing the Kingpin to justice.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 258: \\"Culminating in the anniversary 300th issue, Daredevil would finally gain the upper hand against longtime foe Wilson Fisk (the Kingpin) in this moody tale by writer D. G. Chichester and penciller Lee Weeks.\\" The creative team of Chichester and penciler Scott McDaniel changed the status quo with their \\"Fall From Grace\\" storyline in issues #319‚Äì325 (August 1993 ‚Äì February 1994).Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 263 Elektra, who was resurrected in #190 but had not been seen since, finally returned. Under writers Karl Kesel and later Joe Kelly, the title gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Gene Colan returned to the series during this time, but though initially enthusiastic about drawing Daredevil again, he quit after seven issues, complaining that Kesel and Kelly's scripts were too \\"retro\\".Field, p. 149 In 1998, Daredevils numbering was rebooted, with the title \\"canceled\\" with issue #380 and revived a month later as part of the Marvel Knights imprint. Joe Quesada drew the new series, written by filmmaker Kevin Smith.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 290: \\"It was a dream come true for many comic fans. Kevin Smith, the writer/director of such cult films as Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy...had been hired by Marvel to write Daredevil, a character whose title many thought could use a major facelift.\\" Its first story arc, \\"Guardian Devil\\", depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the Messiah or the Anti-Christ. Smith was succeeded by writer-artist David Mack, who contributed the seven-issue \\"Parts of a Hole\\" (vol. 2, #9‚Äì15). 2000s David Mack brought independent-comics colleague Brian Michael Bendis to Marvel to co-write the following arc, \\"Wake Up\\" in vol. 2, #16‚Äì19 (May 2001 ‚Äì August 2001).Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 305: \\"Writer Brian Michael Bendis began his impressive run on the Daredevil title with a small character-driven four-part story, teaming with his old friend David Mack.\\" Following Mack and Bendis were Back to the Future screenwriter Bob Gale and artists Phil Winslade and David Ross for the story \\"Playing to the Camera\\". Mack continued to contribute covers, while Brian Michael Bendis wrote further stories such as Daredevil: Ninja. Issue #26 (December 2001) brought back Brian Michael Bendis, working this time with artist Alex Maleev. IGN called Bendis's four-year-run \\"one of the greatest creative tenures in Marvel history\\" and commented that it rivaled Frank Miller's work. Writer Ed Brubaker and artist Michael Lark became the new creative team with Daredevil vol. 2, #82 (February 2006),Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 331: \\"Writer Ed Brubaker and artist Michael Lark had quite a challenge ahead of them when they took over the reins of Daredevil from the popular team of writer Brian Michael Bendis nand artist Alex Maleev.\\" no longer under the Marvel Knights imprint.

In July 2011, Daredevil relaunched with vol. 3, #1 (September 2011), with writer Mark Waid and penciler Paolo Rivera. Waid said he was interested in \\"tweaking the adventure-to-depression ratio a bit and letting Matt win again\\". Daredevil vol. 3 ended at issue #36 in February 2014. Daredevil volume 4 launched under Waid and Chris Samnee with a new issue #1 (March 2014) as part of the All-New Marvel NOW! storyline. Daredevil volume 4 officially ended with issue #18 in September 2015. A new volume began as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, written by Charles Soule with art by Ron Garney with the first two issues released in December 2015.

It was released in May 2010. The novel is available free on the author's website as a Creative Commons download, and is also published in traditional paper form by Tor Books. The book is centered on massively multiplayer online role-playing games. Even though the novel is targeted toward young adults, it takes on significant concepts such as macroeconomics and labor rights. It covers the new and fast evolving concept of virtual economy. It also deals with MMORPG specific topics like gold farming and power-leveling. Cory Doctorow's interview with New Scientist  Plot = Part 1: The gamers and their games, the workers at their work  In the near future, virtual economies play a key role in geopolitics. These economies share a common virtual world known as ‚Äúgame-space‚Äù, essentially a more evolved form of the Internet with no borders or separate countries. However, in game- space, income inequality is staggeringly high and exacerbated by the exploitative practices of robber baron-type figures, including Boss Wing and Mr Banerjee. Matthew Fong lives in Shenzhen, China. He uses his talents at gold-farming to find the optimal way to earn virtual gold in a dungeon in minimal time. Together with a couple of friends and roommates, they leave their greedy employer Boss Wing, a virtual economy kingpin who steals their profits. Matthew finds a place in the fictional MMORPG Svartalfaheim Warriors where it is possible to earn much more gold in a short time, and exploits this to make a month's living in a single night, before the administrators of the game discover and block him. However, Boss Wing sends his goons to raid Matthew's home and beat him up to lure him back; they agree that Matthew can work on his own but has to surrender 60% of his income to Boss Wing, who handles turning game-gold into real money for him in turn. Leonard Goldberg is a wealthy American boy in Los Angeles. His father built up a big shipping company, but Leonard is mostly interested in playing games with his guildies in China. He teaches himself Mandarin and takes on the pseudonym \\"Wei-Dong\\" (meaning \\"strength of the East\\"). His team mentors other Angelenos in leveling up their avatars for money in another game, Savage Wonderland. After one customer makes a series of missteps, they nearly fail but Wei-Dong is able to save them with luck. His stern, disapproving father discovers him playing at night due to time differences and decides to send his son off to a boarding school, Martindale Academy, for better discipline. On the way there, they get into a car accident and amidst the confusion, Wei-Dong manages to run away to Santee Alley, where he rents a cheap room and starts to live on his own, making money as Mechanical Turk, a player who slips into NPCs when other players trigger something not implemented in the game's AI. While he barely earns enough to make a living, Wei-Dong enjoys his newfound freedom playing for Coca-Cola Games, a huge subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company that runs some of the biggest virtual worlds. Mala moves with her mother and little brother from a small village in India to Mumbai, where her mother hopes to earn a better living. She ends up in a plastic recycling factory in Dharavi. With her friend Yasmin Gardez, Mala plays a game called Zombie Mecha in Mrs Dibyendu's internet cafe for fun after school, but her mastery of tactics and leadership skills quickly attract a huge following. Soon, she is approached by Mr Banerjee, who recruits her to attack his business rivals in the game, allowing her family to leave the factory and make a better living. One day, her army gets defeated by a mysterious army; their charismatic leader identifies herself to Mala as \\"Big Sister Nor\\". Nor tells her that they are trying to recruit and organize game-workers all over the world into the IWWWW (Industrial Workers of the World Wide Web, a pun on IWW). The members of the IWWWW similarly call themselves \\"Webblies\\", a pun on Wobblies and the web. While companies may move their production from one country to another whenever powerful unions arise, because no borders or separate countries exist in game- space, there will always be a chance to reach the replacement workers and have them join the union, too. Mala dismisses the idea at first, however, and begins to believe the Webblies are sabotaging her career.  Part 2: Hard work at play  Connor Prikkel, a PhD student in economics at Stanford University, develops a mathematical model for predicting values of virtual goods in games based on how much fun the game is. With this discovery (which he calls \\"Prikkel equations\\"), he quits his studies and begins speculating on in-game items. Eventually, he makes big wins, and his equations and understanding of the game economies earn him the leader's post in Coca-Cola Games‚Äô Command Central. Boss Wing locks in his employees at his main office after one of the boys discovers a new way to earn gold quickly. Angered at this lock-in, the boys in Shenzhen go on a wildcat strike, breaking out of the internet cafes, cutting their network connections and protesting in the street out front. Big Sister Nor supports them together with her two co-organizers, The Mighty Krang and Justbob. They talk to the media and spread the word about the strike to all the other Webblies. In addition, the Webblies extend the strike to the online worlds of Mushroom Kingdom, where they use their game characters to fend off Boss Wing‚Äôs replacement players attempting to earn gold in-game. Boss Wing retaliates with corrupt virtual detectives known as Pinkerton players, and the Webblies and Pinkerton players fight a huge virtual battle. Conner and his colleagues look on in interest (and even bet on the battle outcome), until they eventually block all the involved player accounts. During the fight, a group of hired bullies attack Nor‚Äôs hide-out and inflict serious injuries. Shenzhen police raid the strikers and arrest Matthew. He is sent to a labour camp for three months, while one of his co-workers, Lu, manages to escape. He briefly talks to Wei-Dong, one of his guildies in gamespace, and learns that videos of the strike and subsequent police raid are going viral in game-space and in Los Angeles. At Shenzhen railway station, Lu is recognized as one of the strikers by Jiandi, a girl who broadcasts a dissident Internet radio show centered around advice on labor organizing, with a huge following of millions of Chinese factory girls. Massive revenues from her show‚Äôs advertisements for other illegal movements, including Falun Gong, allow her to stay ahead of the police and escape arrest. She takes Lu into her custody, interviews him on her show, and they initiate a romantic relationship and travel the country together. While Mala harbors antipathy toward the Webblies, Yasmin joins them and gets expelled from Mala's army. Yasmin is recruited by Ashok Balgangadhar Tilak, an economist in Mumbai working on behalf of the Webblies. They go together to Andheri, where Ashok has scheduled a meeting with Indian union leaders. He hopes to win their support for the Webblies, and Yasmin tells them about their work as gold-farmers and gamers. However, the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù of union leaders do not take them seriously and decline to provide money or other support. When they arrive back in Dharavi, Mala and her army are already waiting to attack them. Mala attempts to use a petrol bomb, but Yasmin manages to bring her down and wound her, bringing the old friends together again. Yasmin convinces Mala and her army to declare their support for the Webblies, but they secretly continue to work as double- agents for Mr Banerjee. Upon Wei-Dong‚Äôs eighteenth birthday, he resumes contact with his mother. She tells him that his father is dying in the hospital. Wei-Dong decides to come home and visit him, only to arrive too late. From then on, he moves back in with his mother, and becomes part-owner of their shipping company.  Part 3: Ponzi  Wei-Dong comes into contact with the Webblies, and, partly out of his desire for adventure, helps them. Abusing his position as part-owner of his family's shipping company, he modifies a shipping container into a makeshift flat and smuggles himself into China, along with boxes of prepaid cards for games valid on servers in the United States, so the Webblies can then distribute and use the codes for their online activities. After three months in the labour camp, Matthew is released. He rejoins Lu and Jiandi in Shenzhen, along with Wei-Dong, who has successfully distributed his smuggled prepaid cards. Jiandi agrees to house more and more Webblies in her spare flats, motivating her to continue with her broadcasts. This attracts police suspicion, however, and one night, they raid her residence. Jiandi and Lu flee via a secret exit, while all the Webblies are arrested at the front door. Wei-Dong follows Jiandi and Lu, but while Jiandi and Wei-Dong escape the police, Lu is shot. The rest of the boys are also shot after being arrested. As their \\"chief economist\\", Ashok (working at the backroom of Mrs Dibyendu's cafe) devises a plan to destabilize the in-game economies. There are multiple references to Ponzi schemes in the plot, but it is not entirely clear how the plan works. One day, Ashok, Mala and her army find the cafe locked and Mrs Dibyendu gone. They are ambushed by a gang hired by Mr Banerjee; but Mala and her group drive them off. When Mr Banerjee returns with more thugs, Ashok and Mala finally persuades the union leaders to side with them, allowing them to defend themselves and keep the cafe to continue their work. Eventually, Ashok and the Webblies are able to set up a virtual doomsday device of bad financial assets based on game values. With that power in their hands, the Webblies blackmail Connor and his colleagues by demanding Coca-Cola Games give their workers more freedom to farm gold and sell it to players, in exchange for sparing the game economies. With their extensive inside knowledge, Connor and his employees reluctantly accept the Webblies‚Äô proposal and work together with Ashok on re-stabilizing the game economy. Mala gets kidnapped by Banerjee, who refuses to set her free even after Yasmin pays him ransom. Ashok and Connor tamper with his in-game assets, getting Banerjee to finally release Mala. Police in Hong Kong raid Big Sister Nor‚Äôs house, only to find that she had already moved to an apartment above a massage parlor to continue her work. One night afterwards, arsonists attack the massage parlor. The Mighty Krang and Justbob escape, but Big Sister Nor dies in the fire. Krang and Justbob hear this and tell the other Webblies about the fire, revealing that Nor's last words were \\"You all lead yourselves‚Äù, giving them new hope as their unionization efforts spread to more countries. Wei-Dong, Jiandi, and their teams decide to flee China aboard another of Wei-Dong‚Äôs ships. They meet with Ashok, Yasmin, and Mala in Mumbai and see each other face to face for the first time. Connor surprises them by revealing his defection, having used his security department to hack their accounts and find their location. The book ends with the protagonists resolving to figure out what to do next. Reception Reception of the novel has been mixed; some reviews praised its righteous message, but others said that this didacticism may detract from the novel for those who are not interested. One review from Kirkus praised the novel's coverage of social issues: \\"His story spans the globe and exposes levels of exploitation running from Ponzi schemes to sweatshop thuggery.\\" However, the same publication also criticized the novel's moralizing, explaining that \\"it is shot through with economics lectures; regularly, the focus shifts from the large cast of characters to a gentle exposition on union history or social contracts or some other complex economic idea. Fans, future bankers and future gametechs will be in heaven; those without interest will skim or give up by the halfway mark.\\" See also * Digital sweatshop References External links  *Official Book Page on Cory Doctorow's website *Online Version of the book *Manifesto for a virtual revolution: 2010 interview with Tom Chatfield, discussing For the Win and cyber-activism Category:2010 Canadian novels Category:Novels by Cory Doctorow Category:Crowdsourcing Category:Books about labour Category:Anarchist fiction Category:Creative Commons-licensed novels Category:Tor Books books ","title":"For the Win"},{"id":"26982855","text":"Carel Goseling Carolus Maria Joannes Franciscus (Carel) Goseling (10 June 1891, Amsterdam - 14 April 1941, Buchenwald) was a Dutch lawyer and politician for the Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP).

He was a two-time national scoring champion, two- time Consensus NCAA Division I All-America Second Team selection, two-time South Carolina Player of the Year and two-time Southern Conference Player of the Year. Floyd was just the second player to repeat as NCAA scoring champion. The first was Frank Selvy who also played for Furman with Floyd for one season (1953‚Äì54) and won consecutive scoring titles in 1953 and 1954. College career Darrell Floyd began his college career in 1952‚Äì53 at Wingate (N.C.) Junior College, where in his only season there he was named a Junior College All-American. From there he transferred to Furman University where he played for three years. As a junior in 1954‚Äì55, Floyd led the nation in scoring while averaging 35.9 points per game. On January 2, 1955 he scored 67 points in a win over Morehead State, which stands as the ninth-highest single-game scoring total in NCAA history. Also in his junior season he scored 56 points against Clemson, which is still the highest opponent total against the Tigers. Floyd was named to the Consensus All-America Second Team in 1955. In 1955‚Äì56, Floyd repeated as the national scoring leader by averaging 33.8 points. By the time his Furman career had ended he owned a 32.1 points per game scoring average, which is the eighth-highest in NCAA history and ahead of other college greats like Elgin Baylor and Larry Bird. In 71 career games, the 6'1\\" (1.85 m) guard scored 2,281 points and topped 40 points in a game on 15 occasions. When Floyd played college basketball the game's rules were different from the present. The three-point shot had yet to be created and implemented, a common foul only allowed for one point on free throws, and the \\"one-and-one\\" rule meant that the free throw shooter did not get the ball back if he made his first attempt. Given that Floyd was a small guard, one may reasonably infer that the majority of his shots were from at least a mid-range distance. Additionally, as a 78.3% free throw shooter, his scoring averages would have been higher if players had been rewarded with bonus free throw opportunities as they are under the game's current rules. Post-college After graduating in 1956 with a bachelor's degree in health and physical education, Floyd spent two years serving in the United States Army. Although he had been drafted by the St. Louis Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the league was in its fledgling state and could not offer more money than his job selling heavy machinery was paying. When the Hawks and Floyd could not agree on a contract price, the Hawks traded his rights to the Cincinnati Royals, but nothing ever came of it. Floyd holds the rare distinction of being a two-time NCAA scoring champion who never played a single game of professional basketball anywhere. In his later life, Floyd became an entrepreneur, businessman and basketball coach for a girls' church league team. He married Kay Harling, and they had three daughters‚ÄîDiane, Nancy and Libby.

Boston & Maine Corp., 503 U.S. 407 (1992), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (better known as Amtrak), could condemn railroad property from Boston and Maine Railroad and convey it to another railroad in order to continue passenger rail service over that route. History The Montrealer was originally a service of the Boston and Maine Railroad which used B&M;'s Connecticut River Line south of Vernon, Vermont to reach New York City. The NYC-Montr√©al portion of this route was continued under Amtrak. The Montrealer was suspended from early April 1987 to mid-July 1989 because of deteriorating track conditions on the Boston and Maine Railroad, which had been taken over by Guilford Transportation. During the suspension, Amtrak offered \\"Ambus\\" service (operated by Vermont Transit). To restore passenger rail service, Amtrak seized the section of the line between Windsor and Brattleboro by eminent domain. The track was rebuilt using federal funds and sold to the Central Vermont Railway. The train was reinstated in July 1989, continuing until 1995 on a modified route which used the Central Vermont Railway (now the New England Central Railroad) from East Northfield to New London, Connecticut.

It was first published in the July 28, 1928 issue of The Saturday Evening Post, and was reprinted in Fitzgerald's 1935 collection, Taps at Reveille. Plot The story centers around a boy and his discouragement while attending a preparatory school. The boy, Basil Duke Lee, is characterized as naive and dreamy. He is thus treated as an outcast among his peers as well as by the school's administrators. Lee's naivete is contrasted with the experienced perspective of an upperclassman, Lewis Crum. Crum resents Lee's carefree nature and his lack of commitment to tradition. The two boys develop a competitive relationship, and it becomes clear that Lee is internally adjusted to the environment while outwardly aloof and unhappy. Unlike Lee, however, Crum comes from wealth, which gives him a palpable advantage at the school. Lee is castigated by the school's headmaster over his low grades. As the story progresses, it becomes evident that Lee's family is not wealthy; he is one of the \\"poorest boys in a rich school.\\" This causes him obvious shame, and the story's focus shifts to his hopes for an off‚Äìcampus excursion to New York City. Instead he ventures out to a suburb and interacts with a boy who seems to have some type of emotional disability. Escaping the stifling atmosphere of the school, Lee finally goes to New York City, and has lunch at the Manhattan Hotel; while there he reads a letter from his mother. The theme of homesickness is evident throughout the work. The letter informs Lee that he will be going abroad and will thus not be attending the school anymore. Initially, he is elated by the news. The last section of the story takes place within the theater as Lee's thoughts turn to his future. He feels that, like actors following the course of a play, he has a destiny. Although he seeks to escape the turgid atmosphere of the preparatory school, he also believes that he must actualize his fate including college. After the play, the school official who accompanies him becomes intoxicated and falls asleep. When returning to the school, Lee is called a nickname but he is not ashamed, nor mortified by the prospect of being an outcast any longer. He realizes that he is accepted, to the point where it will serve his needs, and falls asleep satisfied. History The story was written when Fitzgerald was arguably at the height of his creative powers. It is part of The Basil and Josephine Stories, and was composed during the period when he also was writing his novel Tender is the Night. Some of Basil Duke Lee's details resemble Fitzgerald's own including growing up in the Midwest. The story, like many which Fitzgerald wrote at the time, was well received by readers. Collections \\"The Freshest Boy\\" was reprinted in Fitzgerald's 1935 collection Taps at Reveille. It was also collected in The Basil and Josephine Stories, as well as Malcolm Cowley's The Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald and in Matthew J. Bruccoli's The Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Reception In The New York Times review of Taps at Reveille, critic Edith Walton wrote, \\"Poignant as well as amusing [is] the longer sequence of stories which deals with a pre-war boy in his middle teens. Though his method is different from Booth Tarkington's, Mr. Fitzgerald approaches at times the same startling veracity. Basil Duke Lee is a bright, sensitive, likeable boy, constantly betrayed by a fatal tendency to brag and boss. He knows his failing, especially after the minor hell of his first year at boarding school, but again and again he is impelled to ruin an initial good impression. Two of the Basil stories‚Äî'He Thinks He's Wonderful', and 'The Perfect Life'‚Äîare small masterpieces of humor and perception, and Mr. Fitzgerald is always miraculously adept at describing adolescent love affairs and adolescent swagger.\\"Edith Walton, \\"Scott Fitzgerald's Tales,\\" The New York Times, March 31, 1935 References * The stories of F.

History  First established in 1738 as a stand for peddlers, Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba was opened in 1830 in the town center at Via Port'Alba 18. The restaurant replaced street vendors who would make pizza in wood-fired ovens and bring it onto the street, keeping it warm in small tin stoves they balanced on their head. It soon became a prominent meeting place for men in the street. Most patrons were artists, students, or others with very little money, so the pizzas made were generally simple, with toppings such as oil and garlic. A payment system, called pizza a otto, was developed that allowed customers to pay up to eight days after their meal. A resulting local joke was that a meal from Port'Alba might be someone's last free meal, if they died before they paid. Additionally, patrons created poetry to honor the pizzas. Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba is still in business today, located between a number of bookstores. It is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria.  Food  Since its creation in 1830, the eatery's ovens have been lined with lava rocks from nearby Mount Vesuvius. At the time of its creation, one popular pizza was the Mastunicola, topped with lard, sheep milk cheese, and basil. Basil and oregano were the most common herbs, while other toppings included seafood, buffalo mozzarella, cured meats, and cecinielli, small white fish still in development.

The book, dedicated to Hughes' first wife Sylvia Plath, is a collection of 40 poems. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Plath considered her husband's poetry \\".. the most rich and powerful since that of Yeats and Dylan Thomas\\". She had typed out almost all his poems and submitted them, in this collection, to a competition for a first book of poems being run by the Poetry Centre of the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association of New York. In February 1957 the judges, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Marianne Moore, awarded the first prize (publication by Harper and Row) to Hughes. Marianne Moore wrote: \\"Hughes's talent is unmistakable, the work has focus, is aglow with feeling, with conscience; sensibility is awake, embodied in appropriate diction.\\" Hughes rejected the Latinate and courtly iamb in favour of bludgeoning trochees and spondees.

Read codes are still in use in Scotland and in England are permitted for use in NHS secondary care settings, such as dentistry and mental health care until 31 March 2020. Read codes support detailed clinical encoding of multiple patient phenomena including: occupation; social circumstances; ethnicity and religion; clinical signs, symptoms and observations; laboratory tests and results; diagnoses; diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures performed; and a variety of administrative items (e.g. whether a screening recall has been sent and by what communication modality, or whether an item of service fee has been claimed). It therefore includes but goes significantly beyond the expressivity of a diagnosis coding system. History Since its origins in the 1980s, the system has evolved through three major technical design changes and significantly expanded its content. Read version 1 (4-byte Read) The first version was developed in the early 1980s by Dr James Read, a Loughborough general medical practitioner. The scheme was structured similarly to ICD-9: * each code was composed of four consecutive characters: first character 0-9, A-Z (excepting I and O), remaining three characters 0-9, A-Z/a-z (excepting i,I,o and O) plus up to three trailing period '.' characters * the relative position of one code to another was represented through the code itself: [J...] is the common ancestor of all other codes with 'J' as the first character, and [J1..] in turn the common ancestor of all codes beginning 'J1'. Because of its four character code structure, Read Codes version 1 was more commonly known as 4-Byte Read. The first release was in April 1986; the final official release of 4-Byte Read occurred in April 2009. Read version 2 (5-byte Read) 4-Byte Read could only encode a monoaxial hierarchy with a maximum of 4 hierarchical levels. The operational NHS requirement to provide a direct crossmap to both ICD-9-CM and OPCS-4 implied an additional hierarchical level was required. Accordingly, a new scheme was devised with exactly the same technical properties as 4-Byte Read except that the code structure was extended to 5-Bytes. This became known as Read2, or 5-Byte Read. The first release of 5-Byte Read occurred sometime prior to January 1991. The October 2010 release contained 82,967 discrete 5-byte codes (although the actual number of discrete clinical concepts that may be represented is estimated to be slightly lower - 82,593 - because of duplicate entries). A later extension of Read version 2 product family was the co- publication of a drug and appliance dictionary. This follows the same technical structure (5-character alphanumeric codes with first character lower case alpha organised in a monohierarchy). Released every four weeks, the October 2010 release contained 52,316 codes. A popular misconception is that all 4-Byte codes are also present in 5-Byte, where they will also carry the same meaning. Whilst in the majority of cases any 4-Byte code of the general form 'wxyz' will be equivalent to a 5-Byte code of the form 'wxyz.', there are notable exceptions. The 4-Byte code [E333 Fear of flying], for example, corresponds to 5-Byte [E202A Fear of flying]; no [E333.] code exists in 5-Byte Read at all. NHS mandation In 1988 a joint conference of the Royal College of General Practitioners and the British Medical Association recommended standardisation of the system in general practice Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems and the National Health Service mandated this in April 1999. The intellectual property of the codes themselves was purchased outright by the UK government, and they have therefore been published under Crown Copyright ever since. Read version 3 (Clinical Terms Version 3 or 'CTV3') A third and more radically progressive version was devised through the 1990s in an attempt to address some of the more serious technical limitations of the earlier designs, including: * Although codes remain 5-bytes in length, the hierarchical relationship between codes is no longer represented through the codes themselves but rather through a separate table listing all binary parent-child relations; this allows for a polyhierarchy of indefinite depth. * Codes exist independently from the terms associated with them; terms now have their own 5-Byte code identifier, usually beginning with the letter 'Y' * Both concept codes and term codes have a release status, thus allowing authoring errors to be corrected: concepts and terms may be moved to different places in the polyhierarchy between releases, or retired from the scheme (and hierarchy) altogether. * A large scale professional consultation exercise, the 'Clinical Terms Project', was conducted to identify clinically valuable concepts that were not codable within version 2. This led to a significant expansion in the content of CTV3, including improved support for the various 'professions allied to medicine', such as speech therapy, physiotherapy and community nursing. * CTV3 concepts can be qualified or 'post-coordinated' by the addition of further codes, to form compound expressions with more detailed semantics than may be expressed by any single code alone. For example, a procedure code can be associated via a laterality attribute code with a laterality value (left/right/bilateral). * Many concepts were provided with partially modelled definitions. Thus, many surgical procedures have a 'site' relationship linking to the code for the anatomical target(s) of the procedure: e.g. 70266Repair of acoustic nerve:X9019Site=7N031Vestibulocochlear nerve or 73143Myringostapediopexy: X9019Site=Xa18WTympanic membrane structure, X9019Site=Xa8RIStapes structure The first release of Clinical Terms Version 3 occurred in the late 1990s. The October 2010 release contained 298,102 discrete concept codes of which 55,829 were marked as inactive, and 58,130 were pharmaceutical products or devices. Production and license In the 1990s the Read codes were released on a quarterly basis for clinical terms, and monthly for drugs and appliances. Laterly, they were maintained by the UK Terminology Centre, a division within NHS Data Standards and Products (in turn a division of NHS Connecting for Health) and both versions were released biannually, in October and April, under the Open Government Licence. License application, and distribution, are now electronic only via the UKTC Terminology Reference data Update Distribution service. Read and SNOMED SNOMED CT was created in 2001 out of a technical, editorial and content merger of CTV3 and SNOMED RT, an American system. A significant part of the International Core content of SNOMED CT derives directly from CTV3; most of this content is identifiable as those SNOMED ConceptIDs where the CTV3ID column in the sct_concept table cites a code NOT beginning with the characters 'XU'. Although CTV3 continues to be released biannually by the NHS independently of SNOMED CT, maintenance of both occurs in parallel; most concepts required to be added to CTV3 are as a matter of course simultaneously dual-authored into both CTV3 and the UK extension of SNOMED CT. The NHS in England has committed to a strategic move to SNOMED CT, and systems using SNOMED are now being deployed within the NHS primary and secondary care estates. At the end of 2010, however, READ versions 2 and 3 remained the core clinical terminology used in UK primary care, with roughly 90% of the primary care estate still using version 2. Deprecation and withdrawal In preparation for the whole English health system moving to SNOMED CT by April 2020, primary care systems were to have adopted the new nomenclature by April 2018. Secondary care, including Mental Health and Dentistry, was mandated to move to SNOMED by April 2020. The former Information Standards Board for Health and Social Care (ISB) set December 2010 as the deprecation date for Read version 2, but did not set a date for its withdrawal at the time. In August 2014 the ISB's successor, the Standardisation Committee for Care Information (SCCI), formalised the withdrawal time frame of Read version 2: A final updated release for Read version 2 is to be made available on 1 April 2016, and will be withdrawn completely on 1 April 2020. The deprecation and withdrawal time frame for Read version 3 was also agreed by the SCCI in August 2014. The deprecation date was set at 1 September 2014, with a final updated release for 1 April 2018, and complete withdrawal on 1 April 2020. The Read Codes Drug and Appliance Dictionary (DAAD) was published for the final time on 1 April 2016, with data since being pulled from public circulation. The intent of NHS Digital is to migrate users to the Drugs and Medicines Dictionary (dm+d), which itself is based upon SNOMED CT.

G√¢teau Basque with cream is more typical in the Southern Basque region of Spain. Description Typically G√¢teau Basque is constructed from layers of a wheat flour based cake (a butter-sugar pastry dough, in this case p√¢te sabl√©e, not bris√©e) with a filling of either black cherry jam or almond or vanilla pastry cream. It has been argued that only black xapata cherries native to the Basque Country should be used. The type of dough used may vary a little. If butter is warmed before mixing with flour the dough will be called p√¢te sucr√©e. If it is cold the mixing process will require more work and the dough is called p√¢te sabl√©e (it is crumblier). The resulting textures are a little different but mostly for the initiated taster. The flour used is a soft wheat flour with little mineral content (that is, a refined flour, common pastry/cake flour) The proportion of sugar used also varies. But the principle of this cake is having a soft shortbread-type dough 3 to 6 mm thick filled with an almond pastry cream, also called frangipane, and with a shiny egg-coating. It is traditional to mark a Basque cross on the top if the cake is filled with black cherry jam, or to use a crosshatch pattern on top if filled with pastry cream. History The origins of G√¢teau Basque are tied strongly with the town of Cambo-les-Bains, Labourd. It may have originally been made with bread and called bistochak in the 18th century. The fishermen took it out to sea. The first known commercialisation of the cake was by Marianne Hirigoyen in Cambo in the first half of the 19th century. Later editions were flavoured with rum, brought back to France by Basques from the West Indies. The G√¢teau Basque Festival (F√™te du G√¢teau Basque) is organized each year in Cambo-les-Bains. Eguzkia (\\"sun\\" in Basque), an association to promote quality Basque cake, was founded in France in 1994. There is a museum dedicated to the cake, Le mus√©e du G√¢teau Basque, in Sare, Labourd.

Pluripotent is also described as something that has no fixed developmental potential, as in being able to differentiate into different cell types in the case of pluripotent stem cells. One type of pluripotent cell, called a hematopoietic stem cell, can differentiate into a large variety of cells with different functions. This stem cell can produce red blood cells, platelets, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Each of these cells have a different function, but they all work together as part of the immune system. Monocytes can differentiate into either dendritic cells or macrophages. Macrophages are covered with chemical receptors and phagocytose foreign particles, but are specific about what immune responses to be involved in. Dendritic cells phagocytose invaders; then they present the antigen on their surface to stimulate the acquired immune system (lymphocytes) as backup. Another example are lymphocytes called na√Øve T-helper cells. These cells can differentiate into many subtypes once activated by antigen presenting cells (APCs) like dendrites. They divide into memory cells, TH1, TH17, and TH2 cells, to name a few. Memory cells are made solely for the purpose of having a template to use in the case of reinfection so the body has a jump start instead of starting over as if never infected. TH17 cells do a variety of tasks including recruiting neutrophils, creating defensins, and mediating inflammation in the intestinal epithelium and skin. TH2 cells produce cytokines that will trigger certain B cells. B cells can differentiate into memory cells or plasma cells. The B plasma cells produce the antibodies that are used to tag invading cells so they can be attacked, among other functions. TH1 cells are created to make cytokines, like interferon gamma, that activate macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Interferon gamma represents an example of pluripotency in itself. Many cytokines are pluripotent, in that each of these compounds can activate specific behavior in some cell types and inhibit other behavior in other cell types. Once activated by T lymphocytes or Natural Killer cells, interferon gamma upregulates expression of macrophages and both types of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens. In B lymphocytes (B cells), interferon gamma stimulates antibody class switching. All of these cells have different, specialized functions, but they all came from one pluripotent cell.

Three weeks later, on 23 July, after a three-hour chase, King George and Seagull captured the French privateer Captain Thurot near Christiansand. Captaine Thurot was a small French privateer cutter armed with two brass 6-pounders and four swivels, and had a crew of 22. She had already captured the ship Tom, of Liverpool, from Riga, with timber, and the brig Bachelor, of Saltcoats in Scotland. Nautilus shared with Seagull by a private agreement. On 9 October King George sailed from Yarmouth for the Texel and on 11 October participated in the Battle of Camperdown. On 12 February 1798 prize money resulting from the sale of Dutch ships captured on 11 October 1797 was due for payment. In 1847 the surviving members of the crews of all the British vessels at the battle qualified for the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Camperdown\\". Second hired armed cutter King George The second King George may well have been the same vessel. She was of 133 tons (bm), and mounted twelve 12-pounder carronades. She served from 22 November 1799 until 23 October 1801.Winfield (2008), p.390. On 16 February 1800 King George recaptured the brig Perth. On 28 January 1801, while under the command of Lieutenant William Isaac Pearce, she captured the French privateer Flibustier in the Downs station. Flibustier was two days out of Dunkirk, had made no captures, and carried a crew of 16, armed with muskets and pistols. Prize money resulting from the capture of Flibustier was due to be paid on 18 April 1803. Earlier that month, King George had detained the Vrow Jesina, Diericke, master, which had been sailing from Hambro to Liverpool. Vrow Jesina was lost off Dover, but part of her cargo was saved.Lloyd's List 27 January 1801 - accessed 13 November 2013. In late 1801 King George, under the command of a Mr. Yawkins, served under Nelson at his failed attack on Boulogne.Yawkins had served with Nelson, who knew him personally, at Cadiz in 1797 On 25 August Nelson came aboard King George to conduct a reconnaissance of the French fleet. In October Nelson gave Lieutenant William Fitzwilliam Owen of the fire ship command over the King George as well, with secret instructions to launch a burning Nancy at the French fleet. The fire attack did not occur and Nancy was sold in December. Third hired armed cutter King George The third King George was a smaller vessel than her predecessor(s). She was a former packet boat of 58 tons (bm), and carried six 4-pounder guns. She served from 30 May 1803 to 15 December 1804, and again from 17 September 1807 until 18 May 1814.Winfield (2008), p.391. First contract In 1803 she was under the command of a Lieutenant Brown. On 25 May King George was part of a squadron of six vessels that captured the Matilda. In July and August 1804 King George participated in the squadron under Captain Robert Dudley Oliver in at the bombardment of French vessels at Le Havre. The bomb vessels' shells and carcasses set the town on fire on 23 July. On 1 August, the vessels kept a continuous fire for three hours. Still, it is not clear that the bombardment did much damage to the French flotilla. On 31 July the squadron did capture the French vessel Papillon. King George also shared in the capture, on 15 September, of the Flora de Lisboa, off Havre. Second contract On 17 August 1807 King George was among the vessels sharing in the capture of the Hans and Jacob. Then four days later King George was among the vessels that captured the Twee Gebroders. In her second contract, King George, under the command of Master's Mate Thomas Mercer, participated in the Battle of the Basque Roads. William Congreve, who had arrived with a transport, fitted King George, and the other hired armed cutter, Nimrod, with rockets. On 11 April the three vessels took up a position near the Boyart (see Fort Boyard) Shoal while fireships made a night attack on the French ships. The next day all three, together with a number of other vessels, opened fire upon Oc√©an, R√©gulus, and the frigate Indienne, as those ships lay aground. The first two eventually escaped, and the last was one of four eventually destroyed, though by her own crew some days later to avoid capture.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.103-122. In 1847 the surviving members of the crews of all the British vessels at the battle qualified for the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Basque Roads 1809\\". Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford sent King George back to England with dispatches. On 24 November 1809 King George captured a Danish galiot whose name later was established as the Texel. Then on 14 January 1810 she recaptured the Drie Gebroeders, J.F. Learman, Master. On 10 March 1811, while under command of Thomas Mercer, Master, she was in company with when they captured the French privateer cutter Velocifere. Velocifere was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 57 men. On 10 March 1812 King George and Mr. Thomas Mercer were in company with , and when they captured the American brig John. Then on 27 June King George captured the Jonge Antonio. On 17 September 1812, King George captured the merchant vessel Friede, and was present when Desiree captured the merchant vessel Dasikbaarheit. On 19 September was in company with Desiree and King George when they captured the Friede. Two days later Hearty and King George captured the Frau Maria. On 12 May 1813 King George captured off Lowestoff the small French privateer Elise (or Eliza). The Eliza had a crew of 15 men, armed with small arms. She had been out three days without capturing anything, and came into Yarmouth the next day.Lloyd's List 14 May 1813 - accessed 13 November 2013. On 18 October 1813, King George captured the Director and the Elizabeth. Then on 15 December King George captured the Alexandria. Fourth hired armed cutter King George The fourth King George may have been the same vessel as one or the other, or both, of the first two. She was of 129 tons burthen and carried twelve 12-pounder carronades. She served from 22 August 1803 until 25 September 1804 when she grounded and her crew set her on fire to prevent her capture. In 1804 King George had officially been renamed Georgiana (though the continuing reference to her under her old name suggests that this had not taken universally), and was under the command of Lieutenant Joshua Kneeshaw.Winfield (2008), p. 392.The United service magazine, Volume 1855, Issue 3, p.377. Earlier, on 25 May 1804 she was in company with a number of British vessels at the capture of the Matilda. Then on 31 July King George was in company with a much larger flotilla at the capture of the Postilion. On 7 August the flotilla, including King George, entered the mouth of the Seine to bombard a French flotilla of gun-brigs and luggers.Naval chronicle, (1804) Volume 12, p.251. On 15 September, a number of ships and vessels, including King George, participated in the capture by of the Flora de Lisboa, taken off Le Havre. On 25 September Georgiana had harried a sloop in a small convoy that had left Le Havre and was making for Honfleur, forcing the sloop to run aground, just before she herself ran aground on the western end of the Ratier bank. When efforts to lighten her failed to free her, and several French gunboats and luggers approached, her crew set her on fire.Hepper (1994), p.106. The crew escaped in boats, pursued by French boats firing on them until the gun-brig drove the French off.Naval chronicle, (1804) Volume 12, p.312. Georgiana blew up around 6pm. The court martial on 17 November praised Kneeshaw and his crew for their conduct and acquitted them of the loss. Kneeshaw was a veteran officer who had lost an arm in service; he received a pension of ¬£200 per annum.Grocott (1997), pp.178-9. Hired armed cutter King George the Second On 6 October 1803, the hired armed cutter King George the Second was under the command of Lieutenant Francis Gybbon when she recaptured British Tar. Lloyd's List initially reported that had recaptured British Tar. The newspaper also reported that British Tar had been sailing from the Baltic to Leith when a privateer had taken her in the North Sea. British Tar arrived in \\"the river\\" after her recapture.Lloyd's List 18 October 1803 - accessed 13 November 2013. Other vessels named King George in government service On 27 April 1804 the French privateer Hirondelle, of fourteen 12-pounders and 80 crew, captured the Government of Malta brig or cutter King George off Cape Passero. captured Hirondelle and recaptured two brigs that she had taken, Mentor, of London, and Catherine, of Liverpool. They had been sailing with valuable cargoes from Messina to Malta to join a convoy. Bitterns launch rowed 15 leagues to try to recapture King George but were too late. On 28 September 1804 the Navy armed 16 hoys at Margate for the defence of the coast. One of these bore the name King George. The Navy manned each vessel with a commander from the Navy and nine men from the Sea Fencibles.Naval chronicle, (1804) Volume 12, p.329, See also *Hired armed cutter George * HMS King George V Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References * * * * Category:Hired armed vessels of the Royal Navy ","title":"Hired armed cutter King George"},{"id":"26983215","text":"Martin After Dark (later retitled Martin Nievera After Dark) is a Philippine television musical talk show broadcast by GMA Network. Hosted by Martin Nievera, it premiered on July 30, 1988. The show concluded on November 28, 1998. History The show served as Nievera's comeback on GMA Network in 1988 after he and wife Pops Fernandez briefly left the network in 1987 to host \\"Twogether\\" on ABS-CBN. The show ushered an era on Philippine television where the Saturday late night timeslot is allotted for various guest celebrities and politicians to share their secrets on national television coupled with music and laughter. Martin was accompanied by \\"Lunch Date\\" co-host Jon Santos whose various stand-up impersonations before each commercial gap served as comic relief. In 1992, the show exchanged time slots and broadcast days with the then-Sunday musical variety show \\"RSVP\\" which was hosted by Dawn Zulueta and Ariel Ureta. The GMA management's decision to exchange time slots reportedly did not sit well with Martin, but continued hosting the show. In April 1993, \\"Martin After Dark\\" was pre-empted in two successive weeks by two television events aired by GMA: The Binibining Pilipinas pageant and the Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP) Awards night. The pre-emption of \\"MAD\\" for 2 weeks in favor of the 2 special events served as the last straw for the show's producer (Backstage Productions) and Martin, who eventually severed his ties with GMA Network and did not show up anymore when taping for the show resumed. The network aired reruns of \\"MAD\\" for a month while negotiations were underway to save the situation with the producers. The show was eventually cancelled by GMA Network after negotiations bogged down. It was also reported that Martin Nievera and his producer have already decided to move to ABS-CBN while the show was pre-empted. Due to legal conflicts the transfer was delayed until October 1993. Upon the show's move to ABS-CBN, it was renamed as Martin Nievera After Dark.

Jean N. Roberts grew up in Cincinnati and originally attended Ohio State University. After two years at Ohio State, Roberts enlisted in the Army in 1944 and served in the Women's Army Corps during World War II. Following the war, Roberts returned to Ohio State before graduating with a degree in journalism from Montana State University in 1948. While working for one of her father's three newspapers, Roberts met Fred M. Packard, an employee of the National Parks Association, and the two married in June 1951, moving to Fairfax. In 1971, Packard sought the nomination to run as the Democratic candidate for the Annanandale District seat on Board of Supervisors, but lost the September primary to Audrey Moore. Following the unexpected resignation of chairman William Hoofnagle in September 1972, Packard emerged from a crowded field of six candidates to become the chair in a special election held in November 1972. During her term, efforts were started to downzone the Occoquan Watershed in an attempt to minimize pollution of the main source for the county's drinking water, an effort that emerged successful in 1981 after many legal challenges. Packard was defeated for reelection in 1975 by Republican Jack Herrity, who then took office in January 1976. In 1988, Packard was appointed to the board of the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority, and would go on to serve for 24 years. In addition to her role on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, Packard was also on the National Board for the Sierra Club, and had been a leader on the League of Women Voters. Prior to serving as Board Chairman, she served as President of the Fairfax County Federation of Citizen Associations in 1967 and was honored with a Citation of Merit in 1984 and as Citizen of the Year in 1985 by the Federation. Packard was also a founding board member for the Northern Virginia Conservation Trust. Packard died at her Fairfax home on October 21, 2014. She was 91 years old.

She is best known for her work in the development of Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy method, and the discoveries of novel cellular structures using STORM. She received a 2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for developing super-resolution imaging techniques that get past the diffraction limits of traditional light microscopes, allowing scientists to visualize small structures within living cells. She was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019 and was awarded a Vilcek Foundation Prize in Biomedical Science in 2020. Early life and education Zhuang's father Zhuang Lixian () and mother Zhu Renzhi () are both professors at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Zhuang graduated from the USTC with a B.S. in Physics in 1991. She obtained her Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 and conducted her thesis research under the supervision of Dr. Yuen- Ron Shen. In 1997-2001, she was a Chodorow Postdoctoral Fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Steven Chu at Stanford University. She started her faculty position in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and the Department of Physics at Harvard University in 2001 and was promoted to full professor in 2006. She was named a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator in 2005. Research Zhuang's laboratory invented Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), a single-molecule-based super-resolution fluorescence microscopy method. The Zhuang laboratory demonstrated three-dimensional super- resolution imaging with STORM. The Zhuang laboratory also discovered several photoswitchable dye molecules that enabled STORM imaging and demonstrated live-cell STORM imaging. Using STORM, Zhuang and colleagues have studied a variety of biological systems, ranging from single-cell organisms to complex brain tissues. These studies led to the discovery of novel cellular structures, such as the periodic membrane skeletons in the axons of neurons and provided insights into many other cellular structures. The Zhuang laboratory invented a single-cell transcriptome imaging method, MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization), which allows numerous RNA species to be imaged and quantified in single cells in their native context. Zhuang and colleagues used single-molecule FRET to study biomolecules and molecular complexes and developed single-virus tracking methods to study virus-cell interactions.

Each of the six regional channels primarily focus on local news, weather and sports coverage in their given areas (most are located in upstate New York), in addition to national and international news stories. With the exception of NY1, none of the six channels are available on other pay television providers in their respective markets, including Verizon FiOS, AT&T; U-verse, DirecTV or Dish Network. Background Time Warner Cable (at the time, a subsidiary of media conglomerate Time Warner) launched its first regional cable news channel on September 8, 1992, with the rollout of the New York City-based NY1. The provider later acquired GRC9News in Rochester, New York in 1995 (the result of Time Warner Cable assuming franchise rights in the area), and launched two more channels in Florida in 1997, Bay News 9 in Tampa and Central Florida News 13 in Orlando (which were both spun off to Bright House Networks in 2001). These were followed by the launches of News 8 Austin in 1999, News 24 Houston in 2002 and News 9 San Antonio in 2003 (the latter two channels would shut down in 2004), Capital News 9 in 2002, News 10 Now in 2003 and News 14 Carolina in 2006. Logo as Your News Now used from 2009 to 2013. In August 2009, TWC launched YNN Buffalo on its Buffalo, New York area systems; the \\"YNN\\" brand (which stood for \\"Your News Now\\") was later adopted that August on its Rochester news channel (then known as \\"R News\\"). On February 12, 2010, Time Warner Cable announced plans to have the remainder of its New York-based news channels ‚Äì with the exception of NY1 ‚Äì adopt the \\"YNN\\" brand that March. In March 2010, Time Warner Cable announced plans to expand the brand to News 8 Austin and News 14 Carolina.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/business/media/03cable.html?_r=1 News 8 gradually made the transition first, beginning with the adoption of the \\"YNN Austin\\" brand on its Facebook and Twitter accounts. The branding change was implemented on that channel on January 10, 2011;http://www.news8austin.com/content/275590/news-8-austin-becomes-ynn however, News 14 would ultimately retain its name for another two years. On March 14, 2013, Time Warner Cable announced plans to rebrand NY1, News 14 Carolina and the Your News Now networks under the uniform brand TWC News by the end of the year, along with the adoption of new on-air logos and a standardized graphics and music package for each of the channels. The reasoning for the name change was due to the perception by the company that Time Warner Cable subscribers did not know that the provider owns its regional news channels and are largely exclusive to its systems (NY1 is an exception, as it is also carried by the other major cable provider in the New York City market, Cablevision).Time Warner Cable makes move to rename NY1 so viewers know it's an exclusive news channel, New York Daily News, March 14, 2013. thumb On November 20, after objections from Time Warner Cable subscribers over the planned rebranding, the provider announced that it would append the \\"Time Warner Cable News\\" brand to the beginning of the NY1 name, while \\"NY1\\" would continue to be used on-air as a primary brand.TWC Settles On New Name for NY1 Outlets, Multichannel News, November 20, 2013. The revised branding as well as the new graphics and music package went into effect on all of TWC's regional news channels on December 16, 2013 (NY1 utilized a modified version of the logo used by the channel since 2001, amended alongside the \\"Time Warner Cable News\\" logo). With the acquisition of TWC by Charter Communications in 2016, the \\"Time Warner Cable News\\" branding was dropped from all networks in favor of \\"Spectrum News,\\" after Charter's primary consumer brand, on September 20, 2016 (except for NY1, which also incorporates the \\"Spectrum News\\" brand into its name though still continuing to use the NY1 brand on air). Similarly, TWC's various regional sports networks have been rebranded under the umbrella of \\"Spectrum Sports\\". On July 27, 2018, the New York State Public Service Commission announced that Charter must cease operations in New York by September 25, citing numerous violations of the agreed terms under which the Charter/Time Warner Cable merger was approved. However, the company continues to operate in the state as of December 2018 as the result of a settlement with the commission that month. Programming video journalist's news car for Spectrum News 1 Wisconsin. The reporter was in Sheboygan reporting a human interest piece on the Above & Beyond Children's Museum. Each of the Spectrum News channels utilize a half-hour news \\"wheel\\" format and carry newscasts at least 20 hours a day. Weather reports are broadcast every 10 minutes at all times ending in \\"1\\" (for example, 7:01 a.m. or 5:31 p.m.); a brief minute-long roundup of the hour's major headlines (titled either \\"Top Stories\\" or \\"Spectrum News Minute\\") airs at the top and bottom of each hour. Each channel also carries live traffic reports based out of their local newsrooms and each maintains its own local assignment desk, on-air staff (anchors, reporters/videojournalists/meteorologists and sports staff), producers and news management. Spectrum News operates on a model of not carrying news about violent crimes, common auto accidents and fires (known in the industry as 'if it bleeds, it leads' journalism), unless a story involving one is so large and affecting, that coverage is effectively required to remain competitive. In Los Angeles specifically, it has stated that it will not carry coverage of live freeway car chases, a common feature of the broadcast news operations in Los Angeles. Spectrum News channels will also go off the wheel occasionally for live continuous breaking news coverage, such as press conferences for news and sports events, along with live segments or continuous coverage past scheduled live hours for severe weather coverage; some channels also host political debates for local and state candidates. National news events such as the State of the Union, presidential news conferences, and other events considered to be of significant interest are also covered live, depending on the local Spectrum News division's editorial judgement. Franchise news segments are also syndicated to all of the Spectrum News channels (these include Cooking at Home, a daily cooking segment hosted by Dan Eaton; The Getaway Guy, a travel segment hosted by Mike O'Brian, who also provides traffic reports for Spectrum News' channels in Upstate New York; From the Floor, a weekday financial news segment from the New York Stock Exchange; and Tech Talk, a technology news segment hosted by Adam Balkin). In addition to sharing weather (and in some cases, sports) content, Spectrum News' four regional news channels in upstate New York ‚Äì Spectrum News Buffalo, Spectrum News Rochester, Spectrum News Central New York and Spectrum News Capital Region ‚Äì share content with New York City sister channel NY1, which operates separately from the other Spectrum News channels in the state. The four channels also simulcast the political program Capital Tonight, which is hosted by former New York Daily News blogger Liz Benjamin and is produced out of Spectrum News Capital Region's studios in Albany, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The network also maintains a bureau in Washington, D.C. for national political news. Charter also operated Spectrum Sports channels in the same markets as well as many others. In fall 2017, markets that had both Spectrum News and Spectrum Sports stations were consolidated, with Spectrum News stations taking on sports programming and the Spectrum Sports outlets being eliminated. Channels=Spectrum News Austin Spectrum News Austin serves portions of central and south-central Texas. Headquartered in the state capital of Austin, it was launched on September 13, 1999 as News 8 Austin. On January 10, 2011, the channel was renamed as YNN Austin, becoming the last of Time Warner Cable's news channels to adopt the \\"YNN\\" brand. The channel adopted its name, Time Warner Cable News Austin, on December 16, 2013. It then changed its name to Spectrum News Austin on September 20, 2016. Spectrum News Buffalo Spectrum News Buffalo serves the Buffalo region of upstate New York. The channel launched at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 25, 2009 as YNN Buffalo, becoming the first news channel owned by TWC to use the now-former \\"YNN\\" (\\"Your News Now\\") brand. The channel is available in almost all of western New York except for portions of Cattaraugus County that are served by Atlantic Broadband. The channel adopted the name Time Warner Cable News Buffalo, on December 16, 2013. It then changed its name to Spectrum News Buffalo on September 20, 2016. Spectrum News Capital Region/Hudson Valley Spectrum News Capital Region primarily serves the Capital District region of upstate New York, and maintains a subfeed for the Hudson Valley region. The channel launched on October 11, 2002 as Capital News 9 (launching nearly a year behind schedule due to various infrastructure and staffing delays). In August 2006, Capital News 9 expanded its reach to systems within eastern New York that Time Warner Cable had recently acquired from Adelphia Communications. In March 2010, as part of a rebranding of Time Warner Cable's regional news channels statewide, Capital News 9 adopted the \\"YNN\\" brand, rebranding as YNN Capital Region. The channel adopted its current name, Time Warner Cable News Capital Region, on December 16, 2013; its subfeed, YNN Hudson Valley, accordingly rebranded as Time Warner Cable News Hudson Valley on that date. It then changed its name to Spectrum News Capital region/Hudson Valley on September 20, 2016. Spectrum News Central New York/Southern Tier/North Country Spectrum News Central New York serves the central portions of upstate New York. Headquartered in Syracuse, it also operates subfeeds for the Southern Tier and the North Country regions of the state, encompassing the western and northern Adirondacks. The channel launched in November 2003 as News 10 Now. In February 2007, the channel launched a separate feed focused on Binghamton, Elmira, Corning and surrounding areas. Due to the presence of ABC affiliate WSYR-TV, which broadcasts on VHF channel 9, it is the only one of Spectrum's news channels in upstate New York that is not carried on channel 9 in its primary markets; it is instead carried on either channel 10 or channel 14. In March 2010, as part of a rebranding of Time Warner Cable's regional news channels statewide, News 10 Now adopted the \\"YNN\\" brand, rebranding as YNN Central New York. The channel adopted its current name, Time Warner Cable News Central New York, on December 16, 2013; its subfeed, YNN Southern Tier and YNN North Country, were accordingly and respectively rebranded as Time Warner Cable News Southern Tier and Time Warner Cable News North Country on that date. It then changed its name to Spectrum News Central New York/Southern Tier/North Country on September 20, 2016. Spectrum News 1 Dallas-Fort Worth Spectrum News 1 was launched in Dallas-Fort Worth in October 2020, serving the provider's systems in Dallas and Fort Worth, as well as Wichita Falls. It also serves Southern and Western regions in Texas, adding to Spectrum's existing coverage of Austin and San Antonio. The official launch date for the DFW bureau was October 16, with a team of more than a dozen anchors and meteorologists including Brett Shipp, veteran reporter previously at WFAA, and Charles Divins, former morning anchor at WDSU-TV in New Orleans. Spectrum News 1 North Carolina Spectrum News 1 North Carolina serves the entire state of North Carolina, with individual feeds for four regions within the state (the Research Triangle, the Piedmont Triad, Charlotte and Wilmington) that are carried on Spectrum's systems in the respective markets. The channel originally launched as News 14 Carolina on March 22, 2002 in Raleigh; this was followed two months later on June 14 by the launch of its Charlotte feed, and later by sub-feeds for the Piedmont Triad on September 25, 2006 and Wilmington on August 18, 2008. The channel adopted the name Time Warner Cable News North Carolina on December 16, 2013, and changed its name to Spectrum News North Carolina on September 20, 2016. Spectrum News Rochester Spectrum News Rochester serves Rochester, New York and surrounding areas. The channel launched on April 22, 1987 as \\"WGRC\\" (for the city's cable provider at the time, _G_ reater _R_ ochester _C_ ablevision); as such, it is the oldest channel among the Time Warner Cable News networks and the only one that was not launched by the provider. In 1992, Greater Rochester Cablevision moved \\"WGRC\\" to channel 9 and rebranded it as GRC9News. In April 1995, after Time Warner Cable acquired the cable television franchise rights for the area, the channel was renamed R News and was converted into a 24-hour news channel. In 2005, some of R News' operations were merged with two of its sister news networks in other parts of New York, Syracuse-based News 10 Now and Albany-based Capital News 9. On August 4, 2009, the channel rebranded as YNN Rochester, becoming the second TWC-owned news channel (after Buffalo-based sister channel YNN Buffalo) to adopt the \\"YNN\\" brand. The channel adopted its newest former name, Time Warner Cable News Rochester, on December 16, 2013. It then changed its name to Spectrum News Rochester on September 20, 2016. Spectrum News 1 (Kentucky/Southwestern Ohio/Southern Indiana) Spectrum News 1 serves Louisville, Lexington, Paducah, Owensboro/Evansville, Indiana, and all other Kentucky communities in which Spectrum provides cable television service, including the Northern Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati, Ohio market. Louisville, Lexington, Northern Kentucky and several other Kentucky cable markets were once served by legacy Insight Communications systems until the company was acquired by Time Warner Cable in 2012, and are now a part of Spectrum and Charter Communications. Spectrum News 1 is the only Spectrum News network not founded under Time Warner Cable or Charter ownership. The network dated back to the late 2000s as cn2 (standing for \\"Community Network\\", and its main standard definition cable channel 2 slot) under Insight Communications ownership, and aired limited news updates, along with rolling weather updates. The network's service has slowly expanded over time under Time Warner and Charter ownership, now featuring political programs covering the Commonwealth, sports coverage, along with continuous weather coverage. The cn2 name was retained until Spectrum took control of Time Warner Cable. On October 29, 2018, the network was re-launched under the current name, replacing looped weather forecasts with rolling news and weather coverage from studios based in Louisville. The relaunch also saw the channel move universally to channel 1, displacing Spectrum's video on demand service to a channel 999 shortcut. Spectrum News 1 (Ohio) On November 7, 2018, Spectrum News 1 Ohio was launched as a 24-hour, statewide news channel. It serves Ohio's 3 largest cities, Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, as well as the majority of the state with three regional feeds of news and localized weather forecasts. Positioning itself as \\"Always Ohio. Always Refreshing. Always On.\\", Spectrum News 1 focuses less on sensationalism and crime stories and more on in-depth journalism, community stories, and local weather coverage. Taking over the affiliation with the Ohio High School Athletic Association from Spectrum's now-defunct sports channel, Spectrum Sports, Charter's Spectrum News 1 is the home of the Ohio High School Football and Basketball championships, other live high school games, select Dayton Flyers basketball games, and Ohio State athletics coverage. The channel is only available to Spectrum subscribers on channel 1. Spectrum News 1 (Southern California) On November 16, 2018, Spectrum News 1 Southern California was launched as a 24-hour, all-local news channel to serve most of Southern California. The channel is only available to Charter Spectrum subscribers. It offers the morning news show The Beat on 1 as well as local newscasts throughout the day. Spectrum News 1 (Wisconsin) Spectrum News 1 serves Milwaukee, Madison, and Green Bay and the Fox Cities with three separate feeds; one for Milwaukee, one for Green Bay, and the Madison feed serving the rest of Spectrum's service area in the western, central and northern part of the state, originating from studios in downtown Milwaukee within Spectrum's regional headquarters, along with bureaus throughout the state. The network launched on November 28, 2018, effectively serving as the de facto replacement for Spectrum Sports (a network never added to Charter's legacy systems in the state after the Time Warner Cable purchase), which had wound down its sports rights due to many of its partners taking their rights in-house or to new digital-only partners. Some of the latter network's staff remains with Spectrum News 1, along with an existing content agreement with the Green Bay Packers. The network is carried on channel 1 universally throughout the state on Spectrum; as above with Kentucky, it displaced Spectrum's on demand service to the channel 999 shortcut. For viewers without automatic HD tuning, the channel is carried in high definition on channel 1001 on legacy Time Warner systems, and channel 700 on legacy Charter systems. Spectrum News Massachusetts In December 2019, Spectrum News 1 was launched in Massachusetts, serving the provider's systems in Central and Western Massachusetts, as well as southwestern New Hampshire. It serves areas including Worcester and Pittsfield. It de facto serves as an expansion of the news department for Charter's former regional network, Charter TV3, which Spectrum effectively replaced. Related channels=NY1 NY1 (also known as Spectrum News NY1 and spoken as \\"New York One\\") serves the New York City metropolitan area, and is the only channel that restricts the \\"Spectrum News\\" name to a sub-brand. Although it shares content with the other Spectrum News channels, it maintains different programming than Charter's other New York- based news channels; it is the only such channel that does not carry Capital Tonight, but does produce its own specialty programs such as Inside City Hall (which is renamed Road to City Hall during New York City mayoral elections). The channel launched on September 8, 1992. Unlike the other Spectrum News channels, NY1 is carried on providers other than Charter (including Altice USA's New York City area systems and the Orlando and Tampa, Florida systems that were operated by Bright House Networks (which was managed by Time Warner Cable)) prior to their acquisition by Charter. It also operates NY1 Noticias for Spanish-speaking Hispanic American viewers along with NY1 Rail and Road for traffic and mass transit conditions around New York City. It is also carried some in Spectrum markets outside of the New York Tri-State region as a higher-tier digital offering, with local advertising bedded over with public service announcements. Spectrum Bay News 9 Bay News 9 (also officially known as Spectrum Bay News 9 as of September 24, 2017) is a cable news television network located in St. Petersburg, Florida and began operating on September 24, 1997. It currently serves the Tampa Bay area including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Manatee, Polk, Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus counties.

According to Bernard Figler, Freiman was the most influential Canadian Jew of his generation.Figler, p. 205. His wife was noted Zionist Lillian Freiman. Early life Aharon Yaakov Freiman was born on June 6, 1880, the fourth child and first son of Lithuanian Jewish parents, Hersh and Hanna Freiman.Figler, p. 197. In 1893 the Freimans left Virbalis, Lithuania for Canada and settled in Hamilton, Ontario.Figler, p. 197.Bilsky, p. 26. Modifying their names to fit Canadian norms, Hersh became Harris Freiman while Aharon Yaacov became Archibald Jacob Freiman, popularly known as \\"Archie.\\"Bilsky, p. 26. Archie Freiman performed well in elementary and high school and was admitted to the Hamilton Business College.Bilsky, p. 26. Harris Freiman had wanted his son to become a doctor, but Archie convinced him that a business career was a legitimate Canadian route to achievement and success.Bilsky, p. 27. Business 221‚Äì223 Rideau Street, former location of The Canada House Furnishing Company. The entrance to the Freiman Mall arcade at 73 Rideau Street, located adjacent to the former location of H. Freiman & Son. The Freiman Mall is an indoor arcade that links Rideau Street to the Byward Market and replaced the former outdoor Mosgrove Street In 1899, at the age of 19, Archie Freiman became the junior business partner of Moses Cramer. Together they opened the Canada House Furnishing Company on 223 Rideau Street in Ottawa.Bilsky, p. 27. The store sold carpets and oil cloths, among other household furnishings.Figler, p. 199. In 1900 the store was expanded to two more addresses, 221 and 222 Rideau Street. In 1902 the business was moved to 73 Rideau Street.Bilsky, p. 27. Archie Freiman's business methods were speculative and included signing for a year's worth of advertisement space with the Ottawa Citizen, a local newspaper, much to his partner's chagrin. When Archie suggested that a credit department be opened and installment sales offered, Cramer balked and dissolved their partnership. Harris Freiman, Archie's father, stepped in as senior new partner and the Canada House Furnishing Company was renamed H. Freiman & Son.Bilsky, p. 27. Having become more confident in his business acumen and backed by his new partner, Archie signed a year-long advertising contract worth fifty-dollars.Figler, p. 198. In 1908, H. Freiman & Son was enlarged to the addresses of 67 to 73 Rideau Street. In 1917 83 Rideau Street was also acquired. In that same year Archie bought his father's share in the business, and having become sole owner decided to turn the business into a department store. After adding separate departments for men and women in 1918, the store was renamed The Archibald J. Freiman Department Store, and the overall company A.J. Freiman Limited in 1923.Figler, p. 199. Charity and Philanthropy Business success was never Freiman's ultimate goal in life.Figler, p. 199. Rather, taking the Talmudic precept to 'separate not thyself from the community' he had learned in Hebrew School to heart, Freiman spent a considerable amount of time, energy and money on charitable and philanthropic causes. The first cause to which Freiman contributed was the building of the Adath Jeshurun Synagogue on King Edward Avenue in downtown Ottawa around the turn of the 20th century.Bilsky, p. 27. In 1903 he was elected President of the Congregation, maintaining the office for the following twenty-six years.Bilsky, p. 28. He was similarly President of the Ottawa Jewish Community. Helping the sick, Freiman supported the Ottawa Protestant Hospital, the Protestant Home for the Aged, and the Perley Home for Incurables.Figler, p. 200. He aided the poor through his support of the Salvation Army, the Jean D'Arc Institute, various Jewish charities and the Ottawa Council of Social Agendas.Figler, p. 200. Freiman contributed to Canadian economic life as part of the Ottawa Civic Foundation, the Board of Trade, the Retail Merchants Association of Canada and the Central Canada Exhibition.Figler, p. 200. Doing his part as a member of the British Empire, Freiman organized the 1927 celebration of Canada's Diamond Jubilee of Confederation. In war, he also lent his support: during the First World War Freiman offered his services to the government and became part of the Victory Loan Committee and was a vice-president of the Associated War Relief Societies of Canada.Figler, p. 201. In the Second World War he was part of the National War Finance Committee.Figler, p. 201. Freiman also worked to help fellow Jews in Europe who had been affected by the world wars, directing the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee which logistically provided for displaced Jews during and after the First World War. During the Second World War he chaired the United Jewish Refugee Committee of Ottawa and ran yearly fund- raising campaigns.Figler, p. 201. Zionism=Beginning Archie Freiman had a long and distinguished leadership role in Canadian Zionism, beginning when he was twenty-one years old.Azrieli, p. 52. In December 1901, Freiman attended the Second Convention of the Federation of Zionist Societies, in Montreal, as an official delegate representing the Kingston Jewish Community.Figler, p. 202. There he was elected member of the Zionist National Council. In 1906, Freiman succeeded Samuel Bilsky as President of the Herzl Club and attended the Fifth Convention of the Federation of Zionist Societies, held in Toronto. By the end of 1906 he was chairman of the Ottawa Zionist Society.Figler, p. 203. Freiman attended the Tenth Zionist Convention in Montreal in 1909 and moved a resolution favouring the purchase of land in Palestine, having been appointed to study the proposal beforehand with others. In 1912, Freiman was chairman of the Twelfth Zionist Convention, held in Ottawa, and was there elected a vice-president of the Federation of Zionist Societies.Figler, p. 204. First World War As the damage wrought upon European Jews became known, the idea of creating a Canadian Jewish Alliance became popular. In September 1915 Freiman moved a resolution \\"that the Federation of Zionist Societies shall call a conference of Canadian Jewry to decide what stand to take with regard to the proposed Jewish Congress to be held in the United States and that every Canadian Jewish organization be invited to the Conference.\\"Figler, p. 205. The resolution passed, and the conference, the first great gathering of Canadian Jewry, was held on November 14, 1915, with Freiman as a vice-chairman.Figler, p. 205. During the conference Freiman and Louis Fitch moved a resolution, unanimously approved, that called for Jewish rights to be upheld in Palestine and Jews allowed to develop the land \\"without hindrance.\\"Figler, p. 205. Inter-War Years At the Sixteenth Zionist Convention in early January 1919, Clarence De Sola, then president of the Federation of Zionist Societies of Canada, retired.Azrieli, p. 51. A provisional committee was formed to elect his successor, chaired by Freiman. In December 1919 Freiman was elected Dominion Executive President of the Million Dollar Relief Campaign, an organization which helped Jews in Eastern Europe.Figler, p. 208.Azrieli, p. 52. In his very first year as President Freiman tripled the organization's fund-raising, reaching $214 000.Figler, p. 208. On April 20, 1920, word reached Canada that Britain had received the Mandate for Palestine with the \\"express obligation of carrying out the Balfour Declaration.\\"Figler, p. 208. Freiman said: > No longer are we a race without a country; no longer can we be regarded as > wanderers on the face of the Earth. We are now a nation with a national > home; that goal towards which our hearts have always yearned has been > reached, and we Jews of this generation ought to count ourselves doubly > blessed that we have lived to see this great day. World Jewry of to-day can > be truly likened to a much-buffeted and battered ship that has weathered the > storm of ages, of suffering and anxious hope, and now sails into the calm, > placid waters of the home port.Figler, p. 208. In May 1920 Freiman and five others were appointed by the Zionist Council to attend the Zionist Conference in London. In October he was part of a group of Canadian Jews who sent a cable to British Prime Minister Lloyd George, calling for Palestine's northern boundaries to be fixed and the Balfour Declaration made part of the Mandate for Palestine.Figler, p. 310. At the Seventeenth Zionist Convention the provisional committee formed at the previous convention came to its conclusion and Freiman was chosen as the organization's new President.Figler, p. 210. Freiman's first great challenge as President was in responding to the White Paper, a British government declaration that reduced the proposed size of the Jewish state by two-thirds through the removal of Transjordan. Freiman chose to continue to be optimistic, focusing on the positive of any return to Palestine over the negative of the restrictive White Paper.Figler, p. 217. In his 1922 New Year's message, Freiman said: > Today we have that very opportunity our fathers and forefathers prayed for, > for nigh 2,000 years. Whereas they lived with the hope of return to our > Homeland as a mirage, an ideal, we live with the return as a fact to be > accomplished ‚Äì if we only will it. Consider then what a magnificent > privilege is ours today. O, how I wish that every Jew and Jewess would think > in this way!Figler, p. 217. Freiman continued in his optimism at the Nineteenth Zionist Convention in January 1924, and targeted Israel Zangwill for his pessimism. Freiman also made clear that there were not enough donations, and outlined a plan of spending that would focus on land buying in Palestine. The donations were to always be a difficulty. The fund-raising Keren Hayesod Campaign, which Freiman founded in September 1924,Azrieli, p. 246. estimated in 1920 that twenty-five million pounds sterling could be raised by 1925, a goal that was not even half reached by 1945.Figler, p. 218.Figler, p. 225. Freiman had to deal with Canadian Jews, well established in Canada, who were uninterested in emigrating to Palestine and swung from extreme optimism and pessimism with respect to the future of Zionism.Figler, p. 225-226. It was this fund-raising role that Canadian Jews had also been called upon to provide as their contribution to world Zionism, and it was to Freiman to organize it.Tulchinsky, p.332. Freiman's spirits were raised when in 1927 he first visited Palestine, at the age of 47.Figler, p. 227. Discussing his experience at the Keren Hayesod campaigned dinner in March 1927, he said that: > Nowhere in the world have I seen that spirit, the pride of being a Jew, as > in Palestine.Figler, p. 228. Preceding the Twenty-First Zionist Convention in Winnipeg Freiman's optimism and Presidency was put to its sternest test. In Ottawa was Mendel Ussishkin, President of the Jewish National Fund in Jerusalem.Figler, p. 228. He offered a challenging proposition to Freiman, the redemption of Emek Hepher, Biblically known as the Plain of Sharon.Figler, p. 228. It would cost $1,000,000 to buy at $100,000 a year, with an immediate payment of $300,000.Figler, p. 229. Canadian Jews, however, had only contributed $25,000 a year towards the Jewish National Fund in the previous years.Azrieli, p. 60. Freiman contemplated the challenge for two weeks while Ussishkin was a guest at his house in Ottawa.Figler, p. 229. H.M. Caiserman was a guest for a week at the Freiman house and recounted later that: > In the summer of 1927, I spent a week in the summer home of the Freimans. > Immortal Ussishkin was there too, with the proposal for Canadian Jewry to > purchase Emek Hepher. Freiman doubted whether Canadian Jewry were prepared > for such a great undertaking.Figler, p. 229. Freiman considered resigning instead of bringing the proposal to the Convention.Figler, p. 230. After further thought he brought the discussion to the Zionist Council, where it was successfully passed. At the Twenty-First Zionist Convention, taking place the following week, the proposal was brought forward after a speech by Ussishkin, who elaborated on the Jewish history of the region to be purchased.Figler, p. 231. The proposal was unanimously passed. In the excitement that immediately followed conventioneers called out their donations to the cause: A. A. Levin alone promised $25,000.Figler, p. 232. As Ussishkin spread word to the Fifteenth Zionist Congress in Basle, Switzerland, congratulatory messages were sent by such figures as Nahum Sokolow, Leo Motzkin, the Congress Presidium and Dr. Chaim Weizmann. The Jewish National Fund inscribed the name of the Canadian Zionist Organization into its fourth Jubilee volume of the Golden Book.Figler, p. 233. In 1932 the bank loan that was required to finance the original $300,000 payment had been paid back.Figler, p. 254. Freiman's next challenge arrived in 1930 when a British Royal Commission of Inquiry formed to investigate violent Arab riots in Palestine concluded that Jewish immigration and development was the cause.Figler, p. 238. A White Paper was thereafter published which limited Jewish immigration. Freiman responded with optimism and suggested that better efforts be made to share Jewish perspectives with the British, as he was convinced they had an \\"inherent sense of justice and fair play\\" and lack of information was the cause of their conclusions.Figler, p. 239. Freiman said: > It is true that our task is similar to that of our ancestors in the days of > Pharaoh, when told to make bricks without straw being given to them, for we > are told to build a National Home without immigration or the right to > acquire land. But even such seemingly insurmountable difficulties we will > overcome. The Jewish will has never faltered and so with our perseverance > and the help of God we will yet attain our goal.Figler, p. 254. Nazism and the Second World War Freiman also supported Zionism through his own personal battles with anti-Semitism. In the 1930s, Canadian Nazi and anti-Semitic groups began to increase their preaching of discrimination and boycott of Jewish businesses.Figler, p. 261-262. Jewish leaders were unable to curtail their efforts, and when in Montreal a Jewish merchant sued an anti- Semitic publication for \\"personal hurt and pecuniary loss through the libel of Jews as a people\\" the judge ruled that so long as a Jew was not singled out by name then no law was broken.Figler, p. 262. It was in this climate that in 1935 Freiman was the target of an anti-Semitic publication, written by Jean Tissot, a detective of the Ottawa Police Department. Freiman sued Tissot for libel and won.Figler, p. 263. In September 1938, responding to the treatment of Jews in Germany, Freiman wrote that: > In this battle between the forces for good and evil, we who have in the past > provided the world with a rallying cry must do so again. We were nurtured on > the prophetic teachings of social justice, and we gave these to mankind for > its own salvation. The issue to-day is clearcut; either the discordant > cacophony of the devil's music or the clear God-like voice of freedom must > prevail.Figler, p. 271. In April 1939, Freiman explained his response to Nazi treatment of Jews, with the statement that \\"The only solution to Jewish suffering is Zionism. Zionism is our Messiah.\\"Figler, p. 272-273. In September 1939 word reached Ottawa that Germany had invaded Poland. Freiman, upon hearing the news, had a heart attack. After recovering he gave his thoughts, condemning the Nazis as barbaric and oppressive, destroyers of civilization, and pledging his support and that of Canadian Jews to the democracies.Figler, p. 272-273 A few years later, in 1941, Freiman shared an optimistic view on the implications of the war for Judaism, stating that as the Balfour Declaration was a result of the First World War so the new war would \\"reinstate us in our human value and rehabilitate us as individuals and as a people.\\"Figler, p. 279. By 1943 Canada and the world had learned of the Nazi extermination of the Jews in Europe, and Britain had responded by allowing 30,000 Jewish immigrants into Palestine. Freiman, through the United Palestine Appeal, began fund-raising to finance the emigration, calling on Canadian Jews to \\"do our part\\" in aiding European Jews.Figler, p. 284. By September 1943 Freiman had become certain in the eventual victory of the Allied Powers.Figler, p. 287. In his New Year's message he focused on the eventual rebuilding of Judaism, calling for more than \\"mere existence.\\" He explained that Jews could only improve by living \\"on their own soil, in their own land, the land of their Fathers ‚Äì in Eretz Israel.\\"Figler, p. 288. Freiman's final speech on Zionism was read aloud at the Twenty-Seventh Zionist Convention in Montreal, on January 30, 1944, he being too sick to attend. His statement ended with a call for Jewish redemption: > It is only consonant with the war aims of the United Nations that our > suffering and sacrifices in these last years should be recognized by the > equalization of our status with that of every other people, by being granted > the opportunity to rebuild Palestine as a Jewish Commonwealth within the > framework of the British Commonwealth of Nations, thus assuring to us the > opportunity of living our lives as normal people. The peace shall be won > only to the extent that we, the weakest of the people, shall be meted > justice.Figler, p. 289. Death On Sunday, June 4, 1944, Freiman and the greater Ottawa Jewish community attended Adath Jeshurun Synagogue for the unveiling of a tablet dedicated the memory of Rabbi J Mirsky.Figler, p. 290. Freiman gave a speech before unveiling the tablet, beginning with an explanation that his doctor had advised him against attending.Figler, p. 291. After his dedication finished he unveiled the tablet, stepped down from the pulpit, and turned to look at the stained glass window that had been dedicated to his wife. As he returned to the congregation and chanted the memorial prayer to the dead, El Mole Rachamin, Freiman slumped over.Figler, p. 291. Two doctors present immediately came to his aid, and the congregation was ordered outside by the Cantor to give space. The doctors were unable to help Freiman, and at just before five-o'clock his death was announced to the waiting congregation. He was sixty-three years old. Funeral Freiman's funeral was held two days later, on June 6. It was attended by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had been a personal friend,Abella, p. 207. Ottawa mayor Stanley Lewis, representatives of the War Information Bureau, the Judiciary, Young Judea, the Canadian Jewish Congress, Histadrut, the Zionist Organization of America, the Red Cross, War veterans and an honor guard consisting of forty members of the Air Force.Figler, p. 292. Rabbi Fasman gave the eulogy: > The greatness of Archibald Jacob Freiman was not lodged in an ivory tower, > was not embodied in a character that shunned realities and toyed with ideas > far from the affairs of men. People loved him because they sensed that all > his power as a personality was derived from a wholesome grasp upon their > everyday problems. Business man that he was, he dealt with situations as > they were, not as somebody might dream they ought to be ... In no country in > the world has Zionism attained so dignified a stature as that height to > which Archibald Jacob Freiman carried it in Canada ... Either a man lives > forever or not at all. Archibald Jacob Freiman lived the only way to live ‚Äì > forever!Figler, p. 292-301. ReferencesBibliography * * * * *  External links  * A.J.

It was formed in February 1943 at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, as part of No. 9 Operational Group. The wing initially comprised three attack squadrons flying CAC Wirraways, Douglas Bostons, and Bristol Beaufighters, with which it took part in the New Guinea campaign until mid-year. It was then reorganised with three fighter squadrons operating P-40 Kittyhawks and Supermarine Spitfires; in this form it saw action in the New Britain and Admiralty Islands campaigns through 1943‚Äì44. The wing was disbanded at Los Negros in August 1944, and by the beginning of 1945 its squadrons had been absorbed into other RAAF wings under No. 10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force). History=New Guinea campaign alt=Three twin-engined military aircraft flying low over a valley Formed in February 1943, No. 73 Wing consisted of No. 4 Squadron (flying CAC Wirraways), No. 22 Squadron (Douglas Bostons) and No. 30 Squadron (Bristol Beaufighters). Based at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, the wing was under the control of No. 9 Operational Group, the RAAF's \\"premier fighting unit\\" in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), whose purpose was to act as a mobile strike force in support of advancing Allied troops.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.23‚Äì24Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.122‚Äì123 In March 1943, No. 73 Wing's units participated in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, \\"the decisive aerial engagement\\" in the SWPA according to General Douglas MacArthur, that resulted in twelve ships from a Japanese convoy being sunk. During this engagement, some of No. 22 Squadron's Bostons struck Lae airfield to prevent Japanese fighters taking off to intercept Allied bombers, while others took part in the actual assault on the convoy; No. 30 Squadron's Beaufighters launched \\"withering\\" low-level cannon and machine-gun attacks on the Japanese ships to suppress anti-aircraft fire prior to bombing runs by USAAF B-25 Mitchells. Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton, one of the Boston pilots who attacked Lae, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for pressing home bombing missions against Salamaua later that month, in spite of severe damage to his aircraft.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.160‚Äì165Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp.690‚Äì692Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, pp.125‚Äì127 alt=Two single- engined military aircraft parked on field in front of palm trees Having earlier been led by Wing Commander Blake Pelly, by June 1943 No. 73 Wing was under the command of Group Captain Ian McLachlan. That month, McLachlan established his headquarters at Goodenough Island, where the wing was reorganised as a fighter formation consisting of No. 76 Squadron (flying P-40 Kittyhawks), No. 77 Squadron (Kittyhawks) and No. 79 Squadron (Supermarine Spitfires). As well as providing local air defence, defending the naval forces assigned to Operation Chronicle, and fighter escort for Australian bombers, the Kittyhawks were themselves armed with incendiary and general-purpose bombs so that they could engage in ground-attack missions, a practice that had already been employed by Commonwealth forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre.Group Captain Blake Raymond Pelly at Australian War Memorial.

Although sometimes referred to as the \\"Edinburgh Advertiser\\" this was not its name and the terminology is only used to distinguish it from other newspapers of similar name. At the time of its inception, it was the only newspaper published on these days of the week in Edinburgh. It ran from 3 January 1764 until 29 March 1859 when it merged with the Edinburgh Evening Courant. Through the years, its offices were located at Castlehill; No. 91 Rose Street; No. 13 South Hanover Street; 210 High Street; 15 India Street; and 7 Heriot Row. Publishers Its first publishers were Alexander Donaldson and John Reid. Reid's name appeared on the masthead briefly, only through 21 August 1764, at which time, only Donaldson's continued.Couper, P. 106 Donaldson, a bookseller as well as printer and publisher, is most notable for the 1774 Donaldson v Beckett court case relating to shared perpetual copyrights. In 1774, the newspaper passed from Donaldson to his son, James Donaldson. In 1820, James sold the paper to Claud Muirhead of Heriot Row and Gogar Park, Midlothian. Of the large fortune made by the Donaldsons, James bequeathed it for the endowment of Donaldson's Hospital. Operations Claud's father, James Muirhead, printer, Burgess and Guild Brother, served as the newspaper's printer, principal manager and superintendent. Rev. Andrew Crichton, a Scottish biographer and historian, served as editor until 1851 when he was replaced by Robert W. Paterson. For a short period, editorial control was held by Robert Chambers. At one point in time, Christopher North (the pseudonym of the Scottish writer John Wilson), was said to be associated with the Edinburgh Advertiser. James Macaulay was a foreman. Journeymen printers included John Bryce, James Lamb, Robert Lamb, and George Robertson. Two of the pressmen were James Thomson and Joseph Thompson. The paper was run frugally. Its initial cost was 2¬Ωd, and it was increased to 7d by 1820.Couper, p. 106, 111 It covered news, religion, trade, manufacturing, agriculture, politics, and entertainment of Great Britain and the Colonial United States; it also published essays.Couper, p. 107 Its motto, Quidquid agunt homines, uotum, timor, ira, uoluptas, gaudia, discursus, nostri farrago libelli, (translation: \\"whatever men do ‚Äì prayer, fear, rage, pleasure, joy, running about ‚Äì is the grist of my little book\\") is a satire by the Roman poet Juvenal. History The newspaper was the first to publish some historically important pieces. The first publication of Epitaph: On Robert Fergusson appeared in the 7‚Äì11 August 1789 issue. One literary note was the first publication of Robert Burns' On the Commemoration of Rodney's Victory which appeared in the 16‚Äì19 April 1793 issue. After Burns' death, several of his epigrams were published in the 8 August 1800 issue.

He has been the bishop of the El Paso since July 9, 2013. He was Auxiliary Bishop of Dallas from 2010 to 2013. Early life and education Mark Seitz was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 10, 1954, the eldest of ten siblings. In 1972, he entered Holy Trinity Seminary at the University of Dallas in Texas. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy in 1976 and a Master of Divinity degree in 1980. Ordination and ministry Seitz was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Thomas A. Tschoepe on May 17, 1980. He served as a parochial vicar at Good Shepherd Church in Garland from 1980 to 1985. He earned a M.A. in Theology from the University of Dallas in 1982 and an M.A. in Liturgical Studies from Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, in 1985. He also took summer courses at the University of Notre Dame and Duquesne University. Seitz served as an adjunct professor at the University of Dallas from 1985 to 1994, teaching liturgy and sacramental theology. He also served as associate spiritual director (1986-1987), director of liturgy (1986-1993), and vice-rector (1987-1993) at Holy Trinity Seminary. From 1993 to 2003, he was pastor of St. Joseph Church in Waxahachie. He was an instructor at Christ the Servant Institute in Dallas in the fall of 2001 and interned at the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the fall of 2002. In 2003, he became pastor of St. Rita's Church in Dallas. He was named a Prelate of Honor by Pope John Paul II in December 2004. In 2009, he donated one of his kidneys to an ailing parishioner. In 2010, he became pastor of All Saints Church in Dallas. Seitz was a member of the Presbyteral Council of the Diocese of Dallas (1988‚Äì1993, 1999‚Äì2006, 2007‚Äì2010), spiritual director of Dallas/Fort Worth Courage (1998‚Äì2010), a member of the Diocesan Honduras Solidarity Team (2002‚Äì2010), a member of the College of Consultors of the diocese (2007‚Äì2010), spiritual director of the White Rose Women's Center (2009‚Äì2010), and a member of the Board of Directors of the BirthChoice Catholic Crisis Pregnancy Center (2009-2010). Auxiliary Bishop of Dallas On March 11, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Seitz auxiliary bishop of Dallas with the titular see of Cozyla. He said: \\"I have learned through the years that following Christ is an adventure filled with totally unexpected dips and turns. When you give your life to His service you better learn to enjoy the ride.\\" Along with J. Douglas Deshotel, he was be one of the first auxiliary bishops of the Dallas since the Diocese of Fort Worth was split from it in 1969. He received his episcopal consecration on the April 27, 2010 from Bishop Kevin Farrell, with Charles V. Grahmann and Michael Duca serving as co-consecrators. Bishop of El Paso On May 6, 2013, Pope Francis appointed Seitz the Bishop of El Paso, Texas. He was installed there on July 9, 2013. Bishop Seitz is an advocate for the humane treatment of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers arriving at the border. On June 27, 2019, he performed a public action in which he and members of the Hope Border Institute escorted seven Central American asylum seekers to the Santa Fe international bridge in Ciudad Ju√°rez in order to assist them in claiming asylum. On July 18, 2017, he issued a pastoral letter on immigration in which he said that \\"elected leaders have not yet mustered the moral courage to enact permanent, comprehensive immigration reform\\" and praised the efforts of the \\"heroic individuals, families, pastors, religious, parishes and institutions that spend themselves in service to migrants and refugees\\" and campaign \\"against the militarization of our border\\". He expressed concern for immigrant families who fear separation and for law enforcement officers who \\"put their lives on the line to stem the flow of weapons and drugs\\" but are \\"troubled in conscience by divisive political rhetoric and new edicts coming from Washington, D.C.\\" He condemned profit-based immigrant detention centers, the hostility shown to asylum seekers, and \\"the disparagement of our Muslim brothers and sisters\\". In the aftermath of the El Paso Walmart shooting on August 3, 2019, Bishop Seitz wrote a pastoral letter on racism and white supremacy in which he wrote that, \\"If we are honest, racism is really about advancing, shoring up, and failing to oppose a system of white privilege and advantage based on skin color. When this system begins to shape our public choices, structure our common life together and becomes a tool of class, this is rightly called institutionalized racism. Action to build this system of hate and inaction to oppose its dismantling are what we rightly call white supremacy. This is the evil one and the ‚Äòfather of lies‚Äô (John 8:44) incarnate in our everyday choices and lifestyles, and our laws and institutions.\\" The pastoral letter invokes the history of racism in the United States, especially the history of colonialism and racial terror at the US-Mexico border. It calls on Catholics to fight against racism and acknowledges support from the Catholic Church in the United States for an assault weapons ban. In February 2020, Bishop Seitz, along with bishops from Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, met with Pope Francis in Rome. Pope Francis gave Bishop Seitz 50 rosaries that he personally blessed for survivors of the El Paso Walmart shooting.

Description (Original description) The shell has a small, blunt nucleus of one or two whorls. The sculpture is chiefly spiral, feeble, except for one or two spiral carinae, sometimes with a few small riblets or beads on the principal carina. The periostracum is conspicuous, smooth or vermiculate. The siphonal canal is wide and very short. The outer lip is sharp, simple, arcuat. The columella is solid, with one strong, nearly horizontal plait continuous upon the whole axis. This axis is impervious, the operculum absent. Type Borsonia dalli There is never more than one plait in Borsonella ; in Cordieria Rouault, 1848, as restricted by Cossmann, there are never less than two. In Rouaultia the anal sulcus is narrow, sharp, and situated at the shoulder in the peripheral carina. Both Cordieria and typical Borsonia have a long and slender canal and the general aspect of Gemmula Weinkauff, 1875, while Borsonella resembles an Antiplanes Dall, 1902 with a strong plait on the proximal part of the columella.

Description (Original description) The shell is small, stout and biconic. The protoconch is small-tipped, consisting of about 3 very rapidly enlarging whorls. The body whorl is sculptured with crowded, protractive, curved, axial riblets. The aperture is long and narrow. The base of the shell is barely emarginate. The anterior canal is not differentiated. The outer lip is not varicose, except at intervals corresponding to axial ribs. The anal notch is shallow. Specimens with a perfectly formed outer lip show a low denticle below the notch well within the aperture. The parietal callus is moderately thickened adjoining notch. The sculpture consists of axial ribs, barely overridden by fine spiral threads, and of microscopic frosted spirals. Brachycythara is a genus of small, biconic turrids having a very rapidly enlarging axially sculptured protoconch, non- varicose outer lip, and no anterior canal.W. P. Woodring. 1928.

Description This genus was introduced by Paul Bartsch in 1941 to accommodate species with a distinct anal sinus and a protoconch sculptured with numerous fine threads, that were otherwise similar to the species in the genera Oenopota Moerch, 1852 and Propebela Iredale, 1918. The shell has an ovoid shape and is short and stubby. The whorls of the teleoconch are strongly tabulatedly shouldered and lack a keel at the angulation of the shoulder. The axial ribs show up strongly between the shoulder and the periphery, but disappear at the base of the shell. The spiral sculpture consists of incised lines on the spire and threads on the columella. The aperture is pear-shaped, decidedly channeled anteriorly and shows a feeble sinus at the shoulder.P.

The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Jaspidiconus Petuch, 2003 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turbinate in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral with 1.5 whorls. The anal notch is deep, and the anterior notch is absent. The early whorls are not nodulose but may be ornamented by an undulating carina. Later whorls may be ornamented with nodules. Cords are absent on the whorls. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior sections of the radular tooth is shorter than the posterior section, and the blade is short. A posterior fold is present, and the posterior blade is absent. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. A shaft fold is present and is blunt at its anterior end. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the West Atlantic region. ::Feeding habits :::These species are vermivorous, meaning that they prey on polychaete worms.

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Jaspidiconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308.Petuch E.J. & Sargent D.M. (2011) New species of Conidae and Conilithidae (Gastropoda) from the tropical Americas and Philippines. With notes on some poorly-known Floridian species. Visaya 3(3): 37-58. [August 2011] Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

The genus has been used for a long time as a wastebasket taxon. There have been many described species, many of which have become synonyms. Among the remaining accepted names a good number are still in doubt and are little known. They are only tentatively placed within the genus Mangelia. This genus was named Mangelia by Leach and accepted by Risso in 1826. Later, some authors, such as Lov√©n in 1846, spelled it inadvertently as Mangilia, to honor the Italian malacologist Mangili Guiseppe (1767-1829). This had led to some confusion.Vaught, K.C., 1989. In Abbott, R.T. & Boss, K.J. (eds) A Classification of the Living Mollusca. American Malacologists Inc., Melbourne, Florida. 195 pp Description The shell has a fusiform shape. It is mostly longitudinally ribbed The spire is elongated, turriculated, acuminated. The lip is very finely rugosely denticulated. The lip is thickened and slightly sinuated at the upper part. The siphonal canal is short, more or less truncated. The columella is smooth. The sinus is near the suture.

They are generally strongly spirally sculptured. The flattened shells are crossed by longitudinal plicae and revolving lirae. The aperture is long and narrowly oval. The anal sinus is in most cases obsolete. The outer lip is acute, smooth within, occasionally scarcely sinuated posteriorly. The columella is straight, bearing a number of short plicae or teeth upon it in the middle and slightly transversely lirate.G.W.

The protoconch is smooth at the apex, succeeded by a whorl with three spiral cords and rather distantly spaced axial ribs. The longitudinal ribs become stronger on succeeding whorls but evanesce at the base of the shell. The spiral sculpture weakens on succeeding whorls and finally becomes mere threads. The pear-shaped aperture is deeply channeled anteriorly. It shows in the outer lip near the summit a feeble posterior sinus.Bartsch, P. \\"The nomenclatorial status of certain northern turritid mollusks.\\" Proceedings of the biological Society of Washington 54 (1941): 1-14. Later, in 1980, it has been stated by Bouchet & War√®n that there is a high variation within the arctic forms of this genus, such as the outer lip showing all transitions from sinuated to nonsinuated Bouchet, Philippe, and Anders War√©n. \\"Revision of the northeast Atlantic bathyal and abyssal Turridae (Mollusca, Gastropoda).\\" Journal of Molluscan Studies 46.Supplement_8 (1980): 1-119.

The New York Times, August 26, 1916. Petr√°ss debuted in as a lead singer in November 1911 in Le√°nyv√°s√°r along with S√°ri Fed√°k. The show produced at the Kir√°ly Sz√≠nh√°z (King Theater), Budapest became an international hit as was instantly picked up by Carltheater in Vienna and by the English impresario George Edwardes. In 1912, Edwardes \\"imported\\" her and most of the original Budapest cast to London.Traubner, Richard (2003). Operetta: a theatrical history. Routledge. . p. 252. Petr√°ss quickly mastered singing in English and performed at the Daly's Theatre in Edwardes's English language version of Franz Leh√°r's Gipsy Love (1912) at Daly's Theatre, which ran 299 performances.Traubner, pp. 238‚Äì239, She then performed at Daly's in The Marriage Market (1913) and in a revival of A Waltz Dream (1913), all with Gertie Millar and Robert Michaelis. Petr√°ss was an expert horse rider, and rode a donkey called Jenny in the opening scenes of The Marriage Market. In February 1916, the American media spread a rumour that Petr√°ss had been executed in Budapest as a spy. Allegedly, after the outbreak of World War I she returned from England to Hungary to spy against the Central Powers for the British. The exact origin of the rumour is unknown; later it was confirmed that she indeed returned from England to Vienna and starred there in The Beautiful Unknown by Oscar Straus.\\"My Lady's Glove\\" Comes from Vienna. The New York Times, June 19, 1917. William Boosey wrote that the London show of The Gipsy Princess with Petr√°ss failed owing to cast selection, despite a \\"phenomenal run everywhere\\".Boosey, William (1931). Fifty Years of Music. 2008 reprint: Read Books, pg. 166; . In late 1916, she settled in New York City and starred at the New Amsterdam Theatre.

Symptoms typically include difficulty thinking, poor coordination, decreased level of consciousness, and a decreased effort to breathe (respiratory depression). Complications of overdose can include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. If death occurs this is typically due to a lack of breathing. Barbiturate overdose may occur by accident or purposefully in an attempt to cause death. The toxic effects are additive to those of alcohol and benzodiazepines. The lethal dose varies with a person's tolerance and how the drug is taken. The effects of barbiturates occur via the GABA neurotransmitter. Exposure may be verified by testing the urine or blood. Treatment involves supporting a person's breathing and blood pressure. While there is no antidote, activated charcoal may be useful. Multiple doses of charcoal may be required. Hemodialysis may occasionally be considered. Urine alkalinisation has not been found to be useful. While once a common cause of overdose, barbiturates are now a rare cause. Mechanism Barbiturates increase the time that the chloride pore of the GABAA receptor is opened, thereby increasing the efficacy of GABA. In contrast, benzodiazepines increase the frequency with which the chloride pore is opened, thereby increasing GABA's potency. Treatment Treatment involves supporting a person's breathing and blood pressure. While there is no antidote, activated charcoal may be useful. Multiple doses of charcoal may be required. Hemodialysis may occasionally be considered. Urine alkalinisation has not been found to be useful. If a person is drowsy but awake and can swallow and breathe without difficulty, the treatment can be as simple as monitoring the person closely. If the person is not breathing, it may involve mechanical ventilation until the drug has worn off. Psychiatric consult is generally recommended. Notable cases People who are known to have committed suicide by barbiturate overdose include, Gillian Bennett,Charles Boyer, Ruan Lingyu, Dalida, Jeannine \\"The Singing Nun\\" Deckers, Felix Hausdorff, Abbie Hoffman, Phyllis Hyman, C. P. Ramanujam, George Sanders, Jean Seberg, Lupe V√©lez and the members of Heaven's Gate cult. Others who have died as a result of barbiturate overdose include Pier Angeli, Brian Epstein, Judy Garland, Jimi Hendrix, Marilyn Monroe, Inger Stevens, Dinah Washington, Ellen Wilkinson, and Alan Wilson; in some cases these have been speculated to be suicides as well. Those who died of a combination of barbiturates and other drugs include Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Dorothy Kilgallen, Malcolm Lowry, Edie Sedgwick and Kenneth Williams. Dorothy Dandridge died of either an overdose or an unrelated embolism. Ingeborg Bachmann may have died of the consequences of barbiturate withdrawal (she was hospitalized with burns, the doctors treating her not being aware of her barbiturate addiction).  Differential Diagnosis  The differential diagnosis should include intoxication by other substances with sedative effects, such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine), alcohols (ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol), opioids, carbon monoxide, sleep aids, and gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB ‚Äì a known date rape drug). Natural disease that can result in disorientation may be in the differential, including hypoglycemia and myxedema coma. In the right setting, hypothermia should be ruled out.

This in turn may lead to a need for increasing doses of the drug to get the original desired pharmacological or therapeutic effect. Barbiturate use can lead to both addiction and physical dependence, and as such they have a high potential for abuse, however, it does not affect all users. Management of barbiturate dependence involves considering the affected person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of barbiturates. Psychological addiction to barbiturates can develop quickly. The patients will then have a strong desire to take any barbiturate-like drug. The chronic abuse of barbiturates leads to moderate degradation of the personality with narrowing of interests, passivity and loss of volition. The somatic signs include hypomimia, problems articulating, weakening of reflexes and ataxia.J√ºri Saarma \\"Kliiniline ps√ºhhiaatria\\". Tallinn, 1980. P. 139. The GABAA receptor, one of barbiturates' main sites of action, is thought to play a pivotal role in the development of tolerance to and dependence on barbiturates, as well as the euphoric \\"high\\" that results from their abuse. The mechanism by which barbiturate tolerance develops is believed to be different from that of ethanol or benzodiazepines, even though these drugs have been shown to exhibit cross-tolerance with each other and poly drug administration of barbiturates and alcohol used to be common. The management of a physical dependence on barbiturates is stabilisation on the long-acting barbiturate phenobarbital followed by a gradual titration down of dose. The abusers tend to prefer rapid acting barbiturates (amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital) rather than long- acting barbiturates (barbital, phenobarbital).Medical Toxicology of Drug Abuse: Synthesized Chemicals and Psychoactive Plants By Donald G. Barceloux. P. 469 The slowly eliminated phenobarbital lessens the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and reduces the chances of serious barbiturate withdrawal effects such as seizures. A cold turkey withdrawal can in some cases lead to death. Antipsychotics are not recommended for barbiturate withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required. The withdrawal symptoms after ending barbiturate consumption are quite severe and last from 4 to 7 days.

Started in mid-2002, Empower Up took old electronics in for donation, and recycled/distributed them. History Empower Up's history can be traced back to a collection event started by the City of Vancouver and Clark County in June 2001. The success of this collection prompted the city to start another collection in January 2002, to collect only reusable computers and monitors for the community. Due to the success of the second event, comments by sponsors, and the general public showed an interest in these collections. In mid-2002, after both an event for re-usage and recycling of computers, departments of the City of Vancouver created the program Computer REuse and Marketing, or CREAM. This new organization would have a permanent location, permanent collection sites, and mobile collection units to travel around the area. CREAM would also make sure of the proper disposal of materials in electronics not suitable for redistribution. By 2008, CREAM had distributed 250 refurbish computers to needy families (with the help of Salvation Army Family Services), and recycled 3.5 million pounds of electronic waste. Near the beginning of 2009, due to new laws in Washington, it was recommended that the organization become an independent non-profit organization. With the help of Habitat for Humanity, and Clark County ReStore, the state created a 3-year plan to make CREAM an independent nonprofit. In February 2009, they established their first permanent building in Vancouver. In April 2010, CREAM's name was changed to Empower Up, with the motto \\"Technology Reuse In Action\\", and changed to their current logo. In October 2013 Empower Up moved to 3206 N E 52nd Street Vancouver Washington 98663 on St Johns Road. They expanded the Reuse store and added an eBay store. On 27 August 2016 Empower Up was shut down permanently, citing \\"economic pressure\\". Media Empower Up has recently received attention from many local and state news sources.

It involves measuring the change in electrical resistance of a sample when exposed to certain microwave frequencies. It can be used to identify very small numbers (down to a few hundred atoms) of impurities in semiconductors. Outline of technique frameright A band structure (energy level) outline of the EDMR mechanism. A donor impurity (P) sits just below the conduction band (C). An acceptor (R) sits between the donor and the valence band and provides a recombination pathway for the donor electron (small blue circle) to recombine with a hole in the valence band (V). A photon (Œ≥) of a specific frequency can flip spins against the magnetic field (B). To perform a pulsed EDMR experiment, the system is first initialised by placing it in a magnetic field. This orients the spins of the electrons occupying the donor and acceptor in the direction of the magnetic field. To study the donor, we apply a microwave pulse (\\"Œ≥\\" in the diagram) at a resonant frequency of the donor. This flips the spin of the electron on the donor. The donor electron can then decay to the acceptor energy state (it was forbidden from doing that before it was flipped due to the Pauli exclusion principle) and from there to the valence band, where it recombines with a hole. With more recombination, there will be fewer conduction electrons in the conduction band and a corresponding increase in the resistance, which can be directly measured. Above-bandgap light is used throughout the experiment to ensure that there are many electrons in the conduction band. By scanning the frequency of the microwave pulse, we can find which frequencies are resonant, and with knowledge of the strength of the magnetic field, we can identify the donor's energy levels from the resonant frequency and knowledge of the Zeeman effect. The donor's energy levels act as a 'fingerprint' by which we can identify the donor and its local electronic environment. By changing the frequency slightly, we can study the acceptor instead. Recent developments EDMR has been demonstrated on a single electron from a quantum dot. Measurements of less than 100 donors and theoretical analyses of such a measurement have been published, relying on the Pb interface defect to act as the acceptor.

The inaugural awards took place at a ceremony in London on 23 April 2010. The awards, in the shape of a gold statue of Boudica, were presented in a number of categories including art, design, entertainment, fashion and science. All proceeds of the awards are to be donated to various charities. History With the UK in a recession in the late 2000s, and with a steadily declining manufacturing industry and little natural resources, the creative sector was believed to be the basis for future growth, and was as of 2010 was estimated to already contribute ¬£110billion to the economy per annum, contribute two million jobs, and number over businesses classed as creative. The BIAs were initiated by David Yarnton, the UK managing director for Nintendo. He was of the opinion that \\"The UK is the creative capital of the World\\" and it was \\"about time that the UK creative sector was recognised for its achievements\\". He was of the belief that, although a world leader in the creative industries, Britain had a tendency to understate its achievements, and thus sought to correct that. The BIAs were therefore created to recognise those who have already contributed to Great Britain's \\"economic, social and artistic development through creative endeavor\\", and highlight the opportunities Britain offered in the creative industries. On the eve of the 2010 United Kingdom general election campaign, on 16 March 2010 the BIAs attracted the support of the Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Conservative Party leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat Party leader Nick Clegg. The inaugural BIAs were to be presented in a daytime ceremony at The Brewery near Barbican Centre in London on 23 April 2010 (St George's Day). The nominees in each category were announced on 14 April 2010. Attendees of the ceremony, hosted by Richard Madeley, included nominees David Arnold, Michael Eavis and Gareth Pugh, as well as Phillip Schofield, Ant and Dec, Helen Skelton and Andy Akinwolere. The Award The BIA is given \\"In recognition of an individual, company or groups contribution to the Creative Economy of Great Britain and the Inspiration that they give to others\\". Individual awards are to be presented in categories for the Film; Television; Music; Fashion; Arts; Design; Innovation, Enterprise and Industry; Science and Technology; and Interactive Entertainment industry sectors, as well as a Special Recognition award. The BIAs use the symbol of Boudica as their logo and award. Described by the BIA organisers as a \\"forward looking woman who inspired others around her\\", Boudica was a queen of the ancient tribe of the Iceni of present-day Norfolk, who in AD 60 or 61 led them and neighbouring tribes in a revolt against the authority of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, the Roman Governor of Britain, before ultimately being defeated. The award itself is a gold statue of the stylised version of Boudica depicted in the BIA logo. The logo shows this stylistic representation of Boudica moving forward using four shades of colour, symbolising England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \\"moving forward together as one.\\" Judges The BIA committee headed by Yarnton is made up of: Chairman: David Yarnton ‚Äì Russ Lindsay ‚Äì Wendy Malem ‚Äì Tom George ‚Äì Nicola Mendelsohn ‚Äì Philip Snape ‚Äì Allan McLaughlin ‚Äì Adam Clyne ‚Äì Chris Maples ‚Äì Caroline Taylor ‚Äì Elisabeth Murdoch ‚Äì Richard Desmond ‚Äì Sir George Martin ‚Äì Colonel Ben Farrell MBE ‚Äì Lord Michael Grade ‚Äì Lucian Grange CBE ‚Äì Cilla Snowball CBE ‚Äì Ian Livingstone OBE ‚Äì Sir Terence Conran ‚Äì Baroness Susan Greenfield Beneficiaries The proceeds of the BIAs were to be donated to charity through the Dallaglio Foundation and GamesAid. Through the Dallaglio Foundation, a charitable foundation set up by the ex-England rugby player Lawrence Dallaglio, the major beneficiary of the BIAs proceeds would be Cancer Research UK, with money also going to Help for Heroes (for the UK Armed Forces), the Rugby Players' Association Benevolent Fund, Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research and DebRA (for Epidermolysis bullosa), while GamesAid, a UK charity, is a distributor of charitable funds from the video games industry to children's charities predominantly operating in the UK.

It was built to house some of the remains of Saint George who was known as the \\"Slayer of Dragons\\". Architecture The church of Saint Gevork stands within a rectangular walled monastery. It has a single cylindrical drum notable for the horizontal alternating striped pattern that surrounds it, and a conical umbrella type dome above. The striped pattern repeats some within the interior portion of the dome. The front fa√ßade is made up of a triple-arched walkway with an arch on either side adjacent that leads underneath a belfry. The belfry consists of sixteen equally spaced columns with an equal amount of smaller arches that support the weight of the cupola above. A main portal leads into the church decorated by an intricately carved arched lintel and door frame. Another smaller doorway is located on the fa√ßade to the right of the front of the church. It is almost as intricately carved as the main entry door. Many portions of the stonework on the church of Saint Gevork use two colors of stone; a darker grey tuff and an apricot colored tuff. In particular the doorways, the drum, the peaks of the fa√ßades, and the capitals of the rectangular columns of the triple-archway in front are accentuated by the alternating stone colors. In the interior of the church there are numerous religious frescoes around the apse and on the left wall leading to the tomb of S. George of whom the church is named after. They were most likely painted in the 17th century by Naghash Hovnatan whose other works include decoration of the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and other churches near Yerevan and Agulis. A single marble tomb sits in a room adjacent to the apse with semi-circular stone of green marble on top worn down from the many people who have touched it. It is said to come from Jerusalem. A chapel built in the 6th century had at one point served to house the remains of S. George, but was later replaced by the church of Saint Gevork.

Sebastiani was born in Weimar. He became Kantor at K√∂nigsberg cathedral in 1661, and court Kapellmeister from 1663 to 1679. He died in K√∂nigsberg. His works include sacred and occasional pieces and songs; the most famous is his St Matthew Passion (before 1663, performed again 1672). He is the first composer who introduce chorale into oratorio passion. Within the St Matthew Passion, Sebastiani includes eight different chorale melodies and introduces thirteen chorale verses.Duff, Robert Paul David, The Baroque Oratorio Passion: A Conductor‚Äôs Guide to Compositional Techniques and Their Foundations, 2000 This work is a development from the style of Heinrich Sch√ºtz which includes recitatives and arias but avoids a dramatic operatic idiom, and marks an intermediate position between Sch√ºtz and Bach such as those of Johann Theile and Johann Valentin Meder.Stanley Anthony Malinowski, The Baroque oratorio passion: an edition of the St. Matthew passion of Johann Valentin Meder 1978 p146 Two violins accompany Christ, who is a bass; three viols accompany Evangelist, who is a tenor, Judas, who is an alto, and the other characters. In 1672 Sebastiani got married and from that point until the end of his life he was concerned primarily with the publication of his works. In 1672, he published a collection entitled Erster Theil Der Parna√ü-Blumen, Oder Geist- und Weltliche Lieder.Duff, Robert Paul David, The Baroque Oratorio Passion: A Conductor‚Äôs Guide to Compositional Techniques and Their Foundations, 2000 Recordings * Matth√§us-Passion 1672.

The novel is prefaced with a quote from the poet and playwright E. E.

Dade Hamilton is 16 years old and trying to enjoy the summer after his high school graduation. He has a part-time job at Food World, a local supermarket. Dade has come out gay to himself, but not anyone else. His father, Ned, sells luxury automobiles and his mother, Peggy, is an art teacher at a local Roman Catholic parochial school. They live in Cedarville, a fictional city in Iowa. For several years, Peggy has struggled with depression, and is taking a large number of antidepressants. She is increasingly alienated from her upper middle class lifestyle and family. Ned, too, is alienated from his family, and has begun taking poetry classes at a local community college. Dade is a loner whose only friend is Pablo Soto, a Mexican American who is Cedarville high school's star quarterback for the football team. Since they were 16 years old, Pablo and Dade have been having sex. But Pablo considers himself heterosexual, and has a girlfriend, Judy Lockhart. Pablo and Dade are friends, but Pablo doesn't spend much time with Dade and appears to only see him as a provider of passive anal sex. The novel opens in the last days of high school, with Dade telling Pablo that he loves him. Pablo slaps him hard across the face until Dade retracts the statement. Dade is increasingly harassed at high school by jocks and by Judy Lockhart, all of whom think he's gay. A short time later, Ned tells Dade that he is having an affair with a woman he met at his poetry class. As the school year ends, Dade attends a party hosted by the pretty Jessica Montana and her awkward, less-pretty twin sister Francesca (whom everyone belittles by calling \\"Fessica\\"). Fessica attempts to seduce Dade, and Dade leaves the party. Outside, Dade meets Alex Kincaid, a 20-year-old marijuana drug dealer. It is love at first sight for Dade. Dade discovers Alex's name and where he works. He meets Alex, and under the pretense of securing some marijuana, the two teens take a trip into the countryside that evening to obtain drugs from a man named Dingo. Dade meets Dingo, an older man who grows marijuana, and members of Dingo's rock band (all of whom appear to be slackers and drug users). Dade finally feels like he is accepted by a group of 'cool' people. A few days later, Dade meets Lucy at a neighbor's barbecue party. Lucy is a 17-year-old lesbian from California. She came out to her parents, who were upset with their daughter's sexual orientation. So they sent her to Cedarville to live for the summer. Where Dade is introverted, socially awkward, and closeted, Lucy is socially outgoing, confident, and cool. They become close friends as June turns into July. Pablo seeks out Dade for more sex, but Dade turns him down. Dade expresses that he wants a real relationship with Pablo, something Pablo is unwilling to give. In late July, Lucy and Dade use fake I.D.s to get into Cherry's, a gay bar. Dade sees Pablo there, but Pablo and Dade argue briefly and Dade leaves. After several weeks, Dade finally hears from Alex, who invites him to a party at Dingo's. They attend, and both Alex and Dade shave their heads on a whim. Later that night, Alex nonchalantly reveals he is gay; he is unconditionally accepted by Dingo and his friends. Alex and Dade kiss and Alex takes Dade home. A few nights later, Alex takes Dade to his grandfather's grave where he learns more of Dade's history. This gives them a deeper connection, and they have sex under the night sky. Alex and Dade continue to bond after that evening, while Pablo continues to harass Dade‚Äîseeking both sex and companionship, and verbally gay bashing him when he does not answer his text messages or cell phone calls. After a night of binge drinking by the family swimming pool, Dade has a dream (or possibly a hallucination) where he sees Jenny Moore, a nine-year-old girl whose disappearance has dominated the local television and radio news for weeks. Dade tells Lucy, who says she believes that Dade really saw Jenny despite the fact that he was drunk, and they try to unravel the meaning of Dade's dream. Dade also tells his parents he is gay. His father is uncertain what this means, but his mother accepts it. Alex takes Dade, Lucy, and Alex's African American co-worker Jay to a large party hosted by Bert McGraw, a homophobe who is a friend of Pablo's. The presence of Alex, Lucy, and Jay cause Dade to be somewhat accepted by the other cool teens and jocks. Dade meets Pablo and they argue, which leads Pablo to become jealous of Alex. Dade's parents reveal that they will be taking a three-week trip to Europe to try to repair their marriage. Pablo becomes increasingly desperate to be with Dade, even exposing his genitals to him at work. When Dade rejects him, Pablo spits on him. Dade introduces Alex to his parents at an awkward barbecue before they leave for Europe. While his parents are gone, Alex stays with Dade. Alex, Jay, Lucy, and Dade spend much of their time drinking alcohol to excess, and Dade worries that Alex's late-night lifestyle is not very similar to his own. Alex convinces Dade to have a large party at the house. Dade becomes very drunk. He wakes at 5 A.M. to learns from the television news that Jenny Moore has been found. He sleeps again, and wakes to find Pablo in his room. Pablo breaks down and cries, but refuses to talk about his feelings with Dade. A terrible accident brings the novel to a sudden close and forces Dade to end his wonderful summer. A subplot in the novel involves the disappearance of nine- year-old Jenny Moore. The girl's disappearance creates tension for Peggy, Dade, Alex, and others. At times, the characters' concern for Jenny allows them to voice their own inner feelings to themselves and to others. The novel depicts homosexual encounters (one review called these descriptions PG-13), marijuana smoking, underage consumption of alcohol, and hangovers.Welch, Rollie. \\"Nick Burd's 'The Vast Fields of Ordinary' Is A Stand-Out Young Adult Novel This Year.\\" The Plain Dealer. December 3, 2009. Most of the teenagers in the novel smoke cigarettes constantly. Critical reception The novel was widely reviewed, and received many positive comments. The New York Times found the novel \\"fascinating and dreamy...filled with characters who are extraordinary to a degree that the reader wants to know more, even about the most minor ones.\\"Vizzini, Ned. \\"Inside the Outsiders.\\" The New York Times. July 10, 2009. The review praised Burd's use of language and metaphor, and called the work \\"the best kind of first novel‚Äîit's packed with insights that might have been carried around for years, just waiting to come out.\\" Michael Cart, reviewer at Booklist, was highly laudatory: \\"...Burd is a terrific writer with a special gift for creating teenage characters who are vital, plausible, and always engaging (even when they're being mean and menacing). His take on the complications in Dade's life is sophisticated and thoughtful, especially on the ambiguities of that 'relationship' with Pablo, while his limning of the growing friendship with Alex is deeply satisfying, never striking a discordant emotional note.\\"Cart, Michael. \\"The Vast Fields of Ordinary. (Review).\\" Booklist. May 15, 2009. A review in The Plain Dealer found that Burd \\"writes incisively about the anxiety of severing relationships and fleeing a dead-end town, a reality playing out daily across the Midwest.\\" The School Library Journal listed The Vast Fields of Ordinary as one of 11 novels for LGBTQ teens published in 2009 that had strong characters and candid writing, and concluded that it \\"beg[s] to be invited into a surprising variety of classroom discussions...\\"Burner, Joyce Adams. \\"Out and About: Gay Teens Live, Love, and Learn in Young Adult Fiction.\\" School Library Journal. August 4, 2009. Some reviews of the book were critical however. Booklist, while generally praising the novel, also criticized the work for being a \\"traditional coming-out-while-coming-of-age story,\\" and found the missing-girl subplot unsatisfying. Both Booklist and The Plain Dealer felt the novel's conclusion was perfunctory.

Economic and Organizational Aspects Ha-Yom was characterized by a modern, Europeanized form of journalism, previously unknown in the Hebrew-language press. It was the first Hebrew-language newspaper to rely on telegraphic news agency material for its coverage.

Katzenelson. The launching and initial success of Ha-Yom provoked the existing Hebrew- language publications Ha-Meliz and Ha-Tsefirah to convert themselves into daily newspapers. Competition with Aleksander Zederbaum's Ha-Meliz became fierce. Prior to the founding of Ha-Yom, Ha-Meliz had monopolized the Jewish press in the Russia.Orbach, Alexander. New Voices of Russian Jewry: A Study of the Russian-Jewish Press of Odessa in the Era of the Great Reforms. Studies in Judaism in Modern Times, V. 4.

The subscription costs (3,000 rubles per year) became a heavy economic burden for both publications. At an early stage Ha-Yom became the newspaper of choice of many followers of the Lovers of Zion movement. However, Ha-Meliz was able to convince a large portion of them to shift their subscriptions back to Ha-Meliz, thus significantly undercutting the popularity of Ha-Yom. In 1887 the literary Ben-Ami (\\"Son of my people\\") was introduced as a monthly supplement to Ha-Yom. Four issues of Ben-Ami were published.Beƒ≠zer, M., and Martin Gilbert.

In this approach, each macromolecule is described as a chain of N segments, each of length l. If we assume that the initial configuration of a chain can be described by a random walk, then the initial chain length is : r_0 = l\\\\sqrt{N} If we assume that one end of the chain is at the origin, then the probability that a block of size dx_1 dx_2 dx_3 around the origin will contain the other end of the chain, (x_1,x_2,x_3), assuming a Gaussian probability density function, is : p(x_1,x_2,x_3) = \\\\cfrac{b^3}{\\\\pi^{3/2}}~\\\\exp[-b^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2)] ~;~~ b := \\\\sqrt{\\\\cfrac{3}{2Nl^2}} The configurational entropy of a single chain from Boltzmann statistical mechanics is : s = c -k_B b^2 r^2 where c is a constant. The total entropy in a network of n chains is therefore : \\\\Delta S = -\\\\tfrac{1}{2} n k_B (\\\\lambda_1^2 + \\\\lambda_2^2 + \\\\lambda_3^2 - 3) = -\\\\tfrac{1}{2} n k_B (I_1-3) where an affine deformation has been assumed. Therefore the strain energy of the deformed network is : W = -\\\\theta \\\\, dS = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} n k_B \\\\theta (I_1-3) where \\\\theta is the temperature.

Antiroll tanks are tanks within the vessel fitted with baffles intended to slow the rate of water transfer from the port side of the tank to the starboard side. The tank is designed such that a larger amount of water is trapped on the higher side of the vessel. This is intended to have an effect completely opposite to that of the free surface effect. They can be broadly classified into active and passive antiroll tanks. Passive antiroll tanks=Free surface tanks A single partially filled tank that extends across the full breadth of the vessel. Its shape, size and internal baffles allow the liquid inside to slosh from side to side in response to the roll motion of the ship. The phasing of the roll moments acting on the ship and the resultant liquid motion will be such that it reduces the roll motion. This type of tank was first investigated by William Froude, but did not receive much attention until the 1950s when it was revived and used in many naval vessels. They have the added advantage that it is possible to vary tank natural frequency by changes in water level and thus accommodate changes in ships metacentric height. Free surface tanks are commonly referred to as \\"flume\\" tanks. U-tube tanks The use of these tanks was pioneered by Frahm in Germany at the start of the 20th century and they are often referred to as Frahm tanks. These partially filled tanks consist of two wing tanks connected at the bottom by a substantial crossover duct. The air columns above the liquid in the two tanks are also connected by a duct. As in the free surface tanks, as the ship begins to roll the fluid flows from wing tank to wing tank causing a time varying roll moment to the ship and with careful design this roll moment is of correct phasing to reduce the roll motion of the ship. They do not restrict fore and aft passage as space above and below the water-crossover duct is available for other purposes. External stabilizer tanks This was another concept introduced by Frahm and used in several ships in the early 1900s. In this concept the two wing tanks are connected only by an air duct at the top. Water flows in and out of each tank via an opening in the hull to the sea. This eliminates the need for a crossover duct as in the other designs, but has its own set of disadvantages. This design promoted corrosion of the tanks due to the explicit interaction with sea water. The holes on the hull cause resistance to forward motion. The force required to accelerate sea water outside the ship (which is initially at rest) to the speed of the ship as it enters the ship is a substantial drag component (momentum drag) as its magnitude increases with the square of ship speed. More recently, a variation of these tanks has been used in oil drilling rig applications where forward motion is of little relevance. Controlled passive antiroll tanks=Active u-tube tanks This is similar to a U-tube tank but the water crossover duct is much larger and the air crossover contains a servo-controlled valve system. Since this valve controls the flow of air very little power is required. When the valve is closed, passage of air from one tank to the other is prevented and the resulting compression of air in the tank prevents flow of water also. When the valve opens, free movement of water and air is possible.Bell and Walker (1966) Fig.102 Active antiroll tanks The border between controlled- passive and active stabilisation is not that distinct. Active stabilisation generally implies that the system requires the use of machinery of significant power and the system must be much more effective in reducing roll in order to justify this high cost. Active tank stabilizer This concept utilises an axial flow pump to force the water from one side of the ship to other rather than allowing it to slosh as in passive systems. Webster (1967) studied the design of such a tank in detail. The main disadvantage to this is that when the pump is operated there is a time lag for a sizeable amount of fluid to arrive at a tank, thus limiting instant roll stabilization. Hence, compared to fin stabiliser systems, this is highly inefficient.Minorsky (Chadwick and Klotter, 1954) Active tank stabilizer with energy recovery Instead of consuming energy to control the flow inside the tank, this concept utilises a water turbine to produce electricity using the water that sloshes into the tank as in passive systems. The main advantages to this are operating cost reduction by replacing part of fuel consumption and control of water flow without any mechanical mobile device.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YKErLEc7i4  See also  * Slosh dynamics References *Principles of Naval Architecture Vol.III, SNAME, 1989, Pg: 127 External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20100917163912/http://allatsea.net/article/February_2007/Anti- Roll_Tanks_-_A_Simple_Way_to_Stabilize *http://www.hoppe-marine.com/ *http://www.geps-techno.com/ Category:Watercraft components Category:Control devices ","title":"Antiroll tanks"},{"id":"26984181","text":"KFXU (90.5 FM, \\"Keeping Him Close By 90.5\\") is a radio station broadcasting a Gospel Music music format.

No bishop in Orthodoxy is considered infallible, even the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople who is considered to be 'First-among-equals'. None has any authority over or apart from his priests, deacons, and people or the other bishops. A bishop holds the responsibility of maintaining the unity of the Church throughout the world by ensuring the truth and unity of the faith and practice of their diocese. The bishop represents his particular diocese to the other churches or dioceses, and represents the Universal Church to his own particular priests, deacons, and people. According to Church Law, bishops of an area must meet in councils. When doing so, the metropolitan or patriarch presides administratively. Male monks only In the Orthodox Church, from about the sixth century, it has been the rule that bishops are single men or widowers. Bishops are also usually in at least the first degree of monastic orders. Holy orders It is the belief of Orthodoxy that Christ is the only priest, pastor, and teacher of the Christian Church. He alone forgives sins and offers communion with God, his Father. Christ alone guides and rules his people. Christ remains with his Church as its living and unique Head. Christ remains present and active in the Church through his Holy Spirit. Through the sacrament of holy orders bishops bring order to the Church. Bishops guarantee the continuity and unity of the Church from age to age and from place to place, that is, from the time of Christ and the Apostles until the establishment of God's Kingdom in eternity. Bishops receive the gift of the Holy Spirit to manifest Christ in the Holy Spirit to men and women everywhere. Bishops are neither vicars, substitutes, nor representatives of Christ. It is Christ, through his chosen ministers, who acts as teacher, good shepherd, forgiver, and healer. It is Christ remitting sins, and curing the physical, mental, and spiritual ills of humanity. This is a mystery of the Church and although firmly believed, there is reluctance to try to explain it in Orthodoxy. Ruling bishop A ruling bishop or diocesan bishop is responsible for and the head of all the parishes located in his particular geographical territory, called a diocese or archdiocese. All authority of the lower orders of clergy is derived from the bishop. No divine services may be celebrated in any Orthodox building without the authorization of the appropriate bishop. Saint Ignatius the God-bearer of Antioch went so far as to state that \\"he who acts without the bishop's knowledge is in the devil's service.\\" A ruling bishop may have the title of Bishop, Archbishop, Metropolitan, Metropolitan Archbishop, or Patriarch. Rankings of bishops Sacramentally, all bishops are equal, but there are honorific titles and distinctions of administrative rank. Patriarchs The title patriarch is reserved for the primate (the leading bishop) of some of the autocephalous Orthodox churches. The leading bishops of the other autocephalous churches are called metropolitans or archbishops, although they have the same administrative role as a patriarch. The title patriarch was first applied to the original three major sees of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, and shortly after extended to include Constantinople and Jerusalem (forming the Pentarchy). After the Great Schism, the Church of Rome has not held this position in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Much later the term was granted to the heads of other most significant churches. Significance for some churches now may be more historical than actual. Archbishops and metropolitans The title of archbishop or metropolitan may be granted to a senior bishop, usually one who is in charge of a large ecclesiastical jurisdiction. He may, or may not, have provincial oversight of suffragan bishops and may possibly have auxiliary bishops assisting him. In the Slavic and Antiochian traditions, a metropolitan outranks an archbishop, whereas the reverse is the situation in the Greek tradition. The Antiochian tradition also uses the style 'metropolitan archbishop' to differentiate from metropolitan bishops in the Greek tradition. The change in the Greek tradition came about in later Greek history, because the diocesan bishops of ancient sees (which include most Greek bishops) came to be styled metropolitans, short for \\"metropolitan bishops\\". The Slavic and Antiochian churches continue to follow the older tradition, where an archbishop is a senior bishop in charge of a major see, and a metropolitan is a bishop in charge of a province which may include a number of minor and/or major sees. In the Greek tradition, all diocesan bishops of autocephalous churches such as the Church of Greece (the Bishop of Patras being Metropolitan) are now metropolitans, and an archbishop holds his title as an indication of greater importance for whatever reason. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America is the notable exception as all diocesan bishops carry the title of metropolitan. In other churches under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate such as the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia the ruling bishop is the archbishop while the other bishops are auxiliary bishops with titles of the ancient sees. Non-ruling bishops A bishop who does not rule his own diocese is either a Patriarchal Vicar or an Auxiliary Bishop. Patriarchal vicars In the Church of Antioch, a bishop who is in charge of a newly created diocese on behalf of, and under the supervision of, the Patriarch of Antioch is called a Patriarchal Vicar. The diocese is usually kept under the direct control of the patriarch until it becomes self-supporting. Patriarchal Vicars are not members of the Holy Synod, and do not answer to the Holy Synod. When a diocese becomes self- supporting, it is usually granted a ruling bishop who becomes a member of the Holy Synod. The equivalent title in some Orthodox jurisdictions is Exarch, and in the Catholic Church it is \\"Vicar Apostolic\\". Auxiliary bishops Most Orthodox Churches allow themselves the capacity to appoint auxiliary bishops to assist ruling bishops within their own dioceses or archdioceses. Auxiliary bishops do not govern in their own right but act only as directed by their diocesan bishop. Titular bishops Bishops who are assigned a title of ancient dioceses that no longer function are called titular bishops. The Diocese of Sourozh, the diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in Great Britain and Ireland, is an example. However, generally, titular bishops are auxiliary bishops. Special forms The Patriarch of the Church of Constantinople holds the title of \\"Ecumenical Patriarch\\". The Patriarchs of the Church of Alexandria and the Church of Rome have the title \\"Pope\\", meaning \\"father\\" (although the second of these is no longer in communion with the Orthodox Church). The Patriarch of the Church of Georgia has the title \\"Catholicos\\". Patriarchs are addressed as \\"Your Holiness\\", with the exception of the Ecumenical Patriarch, who is addressed \\"Your All- Holiness\\". Archbishops are addressed \\"Your Beatitude\\". Metropolitan bishops are addressed \\"Your Eminence\\" or \\"Your Reverence\\", with the exception of the Metropolitan Bishop of Thessaloniki, addressed \\"Your Holiness\\". In the Greek tradition, all bishops may be addressed directly as \\"D√©spota\\" (despot, \\"Sire\\"), an unofficial but highly reverential form of address. Hierarchical vestments The bishop wears a monastic garment called a mantiya when he arrives for a divine service. Unlike the typical monastic mantiya, which is black, that of the bishop is some other colour, purple for bishops and Greek metropolitans, blue for archbishops and non-Greek metropolitans, and green for a patriarch. Upon it are sewn the Tables of the Law, square patches at the neck and feet, characterizing the Old and New Covenants. In addition, strips of cloth, called fountains, are sewn horizontally around the mantiya, representing the streams of teachings which flow from the bishop's mouth. In the Slavonic tradition, a ruling bishop is usually liturgically vested by others while he stands in the centre of his church. In the Greek tradition, bishops are often vested at the altar. In the Antiochian tradition, the bishop usually vests in the sanctuary. Liturgically, except for the phelonion and the nabedrennik, a bishop wears the same vestments as a priest. The phelonion was at first part of the bishop's vestments but was replaced by a garment, similar to the deacon's sticharion, called a sakkos (also saccos), a representing humility. As Christ's robe was without seam, the bishop, as an icon of Christ, wears the saccos either sewn or buttoned at the sides. Over the saccos, the bishop wears a wide shoulder covering called the omophorion. It hangs down in front and back, and symbolizes the wandering sheep which Christ took upon his shoulders as the Good Shepherd. In ancient times, it was made of sheepskin. At other times at services, the bishop may wear a shorter omophorion that has both ends hanging down the front called the small omophorion The bishop wears a richly embroidered crown, called a mitre which symbolises the authority conferred upon a minister of the Church. Sometimes together with his pectoral cross, the bishop also wears a small, circular icon of the Saviour or the Mother of God, called the panagia (All-Holy, after the Mother of Christ), or engolpion, over his heart. This is to remind the bishop that he must carry Christ and his Holy Mother in his heart, and thus his heart must be pure. An episcopal staff called a crosier is carried by the bishop, as a shepherd's crook, to be reminiscent that he is a shepherd of Christ's flock. It has a cross at the top, just above a double crook. This double crook is sometimes in the shape of serpent's heads, symbolizing the serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness. (Now Christ lifted up on the Cross.) Liturgical items At services in the Slavic traditions, the bishop stands on a small round or oval rug, called orlets, upon which is represented an eagle hovering over a city. This symbolizes his rule over a city and the eagle reminds the bishop that by his teaching and life he must rise above his flock and be an example of one hopeful to the things of Heaven. In the Greek traditions, the bishop sits or stands at the bishop's throne on the south side of the church, on the solea. The back of the throne has an icon depicting Christ the King, and the bishop will always venerate this icon before occupying the throne. At times during the services, the bishop blesses the faithful, and any attending clerics, with two candlesticks, one with two candles called dikiri (symbolising the two natures of Christ) and the other with three candles called trikiri (symbolising the three persons of the Holy Trinity).

The 'Fairchild Emerald' mango is a named mango cultivar that originated in southwest Florida.  History  Little is known about the history of the variety, other than that it originated in the Panama Canal Zone during the early 1900s. The fruit was named after the family of David Fairchild, who had taken a liking to the variety. It was first brought to the United States through Hawaii in 1926, then introduced to Florida in 1936 by David Fairchild. While it grew in popularity in Hawaii, specimens in Florida collections were lost over time and it was not re-introduced to the state until 1992 by Carl Campbell, who brought Fairchild to the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, Florida from Honduras.f The characteristics of the Fairchild mango suggest it is of Indo-Chinese origin, however the fruit contains a monoembryonic seed, which is unusual for mangoes from that line. This suggests that the Fairchild is possibly some sort of hybrid of Indo- Chinese and Indian cultivars.  Description  Fairchild is grown on a limited commercial basis in Hawaii and Panama, and has seen some commercial plantings in Florida as well. While the fruit lacks the color desired of some major commercial mango cultivars such as Tommy Atkins, it possesses qualities that give it potential for wider commercial adaptation. These include flavor, excellent production, and very good disease resistance.

It covered the local bicycle scene and grew quickly as Vol. 1 No. 6 took on a 5 ¬Ω x8 ¬Ω offset printing format in December, 1961. The name was changed to American Cycling Newsletter with Vol. 3 No. 1 in March, 1964 issue. The name was changed again with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1965 to American Cycling. The size was changed to a larger format with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1966 to 8 ¬Ω x 11. Peter Hoffman sold the magazine to Leete publications in August 1968 but stayed on as an editor until late 1969. The last American Cycling titled magazine was the Nov. 1968 issue, Vol. 7 No. 8. The name was changed to Bicycling! with the Dec 1968 Issue Vol 7 No 9. For three months following the name change, \\"American Cycling\\" was included on the cover in small print under the Bicycling! masthead. NCCA Newsletter and American Cycling were published 10 times a year, March though December; however, in 1968 -the first year under Leete- there were only 9 issues. Leete skipped the October issue and called it November both to make it more current, and because they were behind in production as they worked on the design change to Bicycling!. After 1968 the magazine went to publishing 12 issues a year. In April 1973 the magazine was acquired by Capital Management Publications. In early December 1977, a team was sent from Rodale to California to meet with the owner and iron out a deal.Our Roots Grow Deep: The Story of Rodale, Daniel Gross, 2008 Rodale acquired Bicycling! and published their first issue in February, 1978. In 1980, Rodale purchased a smaller magazine, Bike World, and merged it into Bicycling!. In 1982 Rodale bought American Cyclist and incorporated it into Bicycling. Pricing of the magazine changed over the years as follows July 62 to December 64, 25 cents, March 65 to June 67, 35 cents, July 67 to July 68, 45 cents, In August 1968 with the Leete purchase the price went up to 50 cents, and the covers were changed to full color, the previous covers had been in red and black. Hearst announced its acquisition of Rodale in 2017. Hearst moved Bicycling to Easton, Pennsylvania in 2018.

The Foundation was established in 2003 by Republican politician Roy Moore, who was ousted as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama in 2003 for refusing to comply with a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the grounds of the Alabama Judicial Building. In 2013, Moore was again elected to the Alabama Supreme Court, but was suspended from the Court in 2016, and resigned in 2017, after ordering Alabama probate judges to ignore federal court decisions on same-sex marriage.John Kruzel, Did Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore take $1 million from a charity he ran?, PolitiFact (September 5, 2017).  History and finances  The Foundation for Moral Law was established in 2003 by Republican politician Roy Moore. Pastor Phillip Ellen became the first president of the Foundation for Moral Law in December 2002. Randy Stafford acted as vice president at that time, and Mel C. Glenn Sr. was executive director. In November 2003, the board chose Rich Hobson as president of the Foundation for Moral Law, and Ellen became its vice president. Moore served as the president of the Foundation for Moral Law, and Hobson served as executive director. In 2013, Moore's wife, Kayla Moore, became president of the Foundation for Moral Law. In 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined that the Foundation for Moral Law is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. Also in 2005, fhe Foundation accepted a $1,000 contribution from a neo-Nazi organization founded by Willis Carto, a prominent Holocaust denier. The donation attracted attention during Moore's 2017 campaign for a Senate seat. Moore said that he did not draw a \\"regular salary\\" from the organization. In October 2017, however, The Washington Post reported that Moore had arranged an annual salary of $180,000 for himself from the foundation. From 2007 to 2012, he collected more than $1 million, an amount that far surpasses what the organization declared in its public tax filings. Furthermore, The Washington Post reported that Moore arranged the salary and that, in 2012 when the charity could not pay his full salary, Moore received a note promising that he would get the salary in back pay or a stake in the assets of the foundation. The foundation also paid for Moore's health- care benefits, travel expenses, and bodyguard, and the foundation's website has regularly promoted Moore's speaking arrangements and book. Furthermore, the foundation employed Moore's wife and at least two of Moore's children. The Washington Post also reported that there was considerable overlap between the charity and Moore's political activities, with previous top officials of the charity leading Moore's 2017 Senate campaign and with the charity using the same fundraising firm as Moore's campaigns. The IRS warned the foundation about discrepancies in its tax filings in 2013, saying that the issues \\"could jeopardize your exempt status\\". A number of charity and tax law experts have said that the foundation's activities \\"raised questions about compliance with IRS rules, including prohibitions on the use of a charity for the private benefit or enrichment of an individual\\". Additional reporting by The Washington Post that October found that the $498,000 that Moore was guaranteed in back pay was not declared to the IRS; tax experts say that it should have been and that Moore would have had to pay more than $100,000 in federal tax. As of August 2017, the Foundation for Moral Law had not filed a Form 990 for 2015 or 2016, as required by law.Christopher Harress, Missing: 2015-2016 tax returns for Roy Moore's Foundation for Moral Law , AL.com (August 4, 2017). Positions and activities The Foundation for Moral Law advocates Moore's Christian right and socially conservative views through the filing of amicus briefs in courts. The group is anti-abortion, opposed to same-sex marriage, and supportive of public prayer. In 2010, the Foundation for Moral Law allowed its offices to be used to host a \\"Alabama Secession Day Commemoration\\" event, celebrating Alabama's secession from the Union in 1861. The event featured a speaker from the League of the South, a group that supports secession of the South from United States and is classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group.Secession Day event set for Roy Moore's foundation , Associated Press (February 19, 2010). In 2017, the Foundation for Moral Law publicly opposed the U.S. Air Force's nomination of then-Colonel Kristin Goodwin as commandant of cadets of the U.S. Air Force Academy because Goodwin is a married lesbian; in a letter, the Foundation's president, Kayla Moore, accused the United States Department of Defense of having a \\"disregard for the fundamental moral order established by God.\\"Greg Garrison, Roy Moore's wife issues statement opposing lesbian Air Force Academy commandant , AL.com (April 3, 2017).

It is located on the eastern side of Broad Street between Wall Street and Exchange Place with entrances at 51 Exchange Place and 37 Wall Street. In 1931, it made the list of the 20 largest office buildings in the world.  History =Construction: 1928 The building was built in the neoclassical style for the Equitable Trust Company and was therefore called the Equitable Trust Building. Replacing the Mills Building and another building on the site, it was completed in 1928. The Equitable Trust Co. was one of the units of the Chase National Bank organizations, one of the largest and most powerful banking institutions in the world at the time. The law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell was located in the predecessor building from around 1889 and moved out when it was demolished, but returned to the address into the newly completed building and stayed there until 1959. The architects were Trowbridge & Livingston, who also drew plans for the Bankers Trust Co., the New York Stock Exchange extension, Bank of America, and the Equitable Trust Building's adjacent J. P. Morgan & Company Building at 23 Wall Street in 1915. The builder was the Thompson‚ÄìStarrett Co., the agent Douglas Cruikshank. First remodeling The structure was later bought and remodeled as the headquarters of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, a forerunner of J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. In 1957 the building was linked to neighboring 23 Wall Street. 2003 remodeling by Philippe Starck 15 Broad Street along with 23 Wall Street were bought by A. I. & Boymelgreen of Brooklyn in 2003 for $100 million, after plans to have the building ripped down to make way for a new stock exchange building were dropped. The building became a luxury condominium development called Downtown, designed by French product designer Philippe Starck along with project architect Ismael Leyva and developer A.I. & Boymelgreen, making it one of a growing number of residential buildings in the Financial District. Remodeling was largely completed at the end of May 2007. According to Real Estate Weekly, by November 2006, 98% of the apartments had been sold. Prices for the 326 units ranged from about $335,000 for a studio to $4.6 million for a two-bedroom apartment with a terrace. The building is fitted with many amenities such as a gym, swimming pool, dance and yoga studio, squash court, bowling alley, business centre, movie theater, lounge and an in-house dry cleaning service amongst other things. The original 1,900-piece Louis Quinze chandelier that used to hang in the main hall of J. P. Morgan's 23 Wall Street was given by Morgan to be displayed in the lobby of 15 Broad Street. According to the architect Phlippe Starck, many pieces had come from Austria-Hungary before World War I and have been identified by him as Swarovski crystal. Starck made the roof of 23 Wall into a garden with children's pool and dining area, accessible to the residents of the development.  Layout  The layout of the building is L-shaped, wrapped around 23 Wall Street. The building is 540 feet high and has 43 floors. The assumed value in 1931 was $17,250,000. The facade is made out of grey brick stone, while the limestone base echoes the facade of neighbouring 23 Wall Street. The rent area was ; the interior was originally luxuriously fitted out.

The mill has been restored so that it can turn by wind. It is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 18208. History De Groene Molen was built c1800. It drained the Bleeker polder. In 1937, a Lister diesel engine was installed. On 18 December 1956, the mill was bought by the Gemeente Haskerland. In 1992, the mill was restored by millwright Westra of Franeker. A new buck and sails were fitted. On 18 January 2007, the mill was severely damaged in a storm, with parts of the roof of the buck being blown off. The mill was dismantled on 12 December 2008 and restored by millwrights Boubedrijf Hiemstra BV, Tzummarum. On 13 May 2009, the renewed roundhouse, buck and sails were re-erected on the base. Description De Groene Molen is what the Dutch describe as an Spinnenkop met Stelling. It is a hollow post mill with a roundhouse on a single storey base. The stage is at first floor level above ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The buck and roof are covered in horizontal boards. The sails are common sails. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a wooden windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 39 cogs. This drives the wallower (19 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the crown wheel (see photo of engine below). Since the last restoration the Archimedes' screw can be driven by either the Lister engine or by wind power. The crown wheel at the bottom of the upright shaft drives a layshaft which is connected by belt to a second layshaft. The driving gear on the end of this layshaft has 16 teeth; it drives a gear with 64 teeth on the axle of the Archimedes' screw, which is inclined at 19¬∞. A second belt is used to drive this layshaft by the Lister engine. Public access De Groene Molen is open by appointment.

Maoist activities Right from its inception in 2000. Jharkhand was a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a ‚Äúguerrilla zone‚Äù. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities. However, in the same year, when Jharkhand police identified 13 focus areas for combating Maoist extremism, Hazaribagh district was not one of them. Geography Padma is located at .

It is the sequel to Pike's #1 New York Times best-selling debut, Wings, which introduced readers to Laurel Sewell, a faerie sent among humans to guard the gateway to Avalon. Spells was released in the United States on May 4, 2010, and debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. It also debuted on the Indie Bestsellers list. Plot summary Six months after discovering that she is a faerie scion and saving the gateway to Avalon, Laurel is summoned to her faerie home to hone her skills as a Fall Faerie. She expects to be able to return to normal life after her classes have ended, but she quickly realizes that danger is still coming. She must also choose between her two worlds ‚Äì and the two guys in them. Spells begins six months after Laurel's close encounter with death due to Barnes the troll. She steps out of her car, ready to go to the Academy of Avalon to train as a Fall faerie and is greeted by Tamani. Her supposed summer vacation isn't all that fun because she has to work hard honing her skills as a Fall faerie in order to be prepared to defend herself against situations like the one that happened six months ago. She gets a little time off every now and then, much to her relief, when Tam comes to visit and take her on a tour of Avalon. As summer ends, so does Laurel's trip back to her roots. On her return she is greeted by some pleasant, and some not so pleasant, changes. School starts and she gets back to her normal life as a human. Then comes fall, when Laurel's flower blooms again. This time, with her family knowing everything, it's much easier to deal with. However, in the last days she is attacked again but is saved by a woman called Klea whose sole mission in life is to hunt down supernatural beings, particularly trolls. She then goes to the land to tell Tamani everything that happened and is warned to be careful. For some time, things cool down and in the meanwhile she receives an invitation to attend the Samhain festival in order to welcome the New Year ‚Äì and a note from Tam which says he'll escort her. She sneaks out without telling either David or her family about her visit to Avalon and has fun watching all the dramas and shows put up by the Summer faeries for entertainment. At the end of the festival Tam kisses Laurel and tells her that he's tired of waiting, after which they have an argument. Later, Shar announces that David has come, at which time Tam asks her to tell him the truth: does she love him or not? Laurel says that she doesn't and asks him to go away. At that moment, he pulls her in and kisses her ‚Äì with David staring at them. Laurel and David have an argument after which David says he needs some alone time. That very night she receives a note from Barnes. She goes to David and tells him that Barnes has Chelsea as his hostage. They both go to save her; on their way to the lighthouse they stop at Laurel's mom's store to get some ingredients for 'monastuolo serum', something that will help them defend themselves from the trolls. Once there, Laurel uses the serum against the trolls. All of the trolls except Barnes are affected by it; she then points a gun at him and demands for some answers. However, during this little chat Barnes tricks her and makes her the target once again. At this moment Klea enters and kills Barnes. It is revealed that Chelsea had her suspicions all along that Laurel was a faerie. Laurel apologizes to David and tells him that she loves him; he forgives her, but she also tells him that she'll be going to visit Tamani the next day to tell him that she cannot handle juggling two worlds any more, and that she will not come to visit him. Things also get cleared up between Laurel and her mom. The next day when she visits the land, instead of Tam it is Shar who receives her and tells her that Tamani no longer guards that post. He went away because Laurel told him to. He also tells her that he didn't hate her, just the way she treated Tamani, and tells her about the depth of his love for her. Laurel then tells Shar that what she had come to tell Tam: that she won't be visiting him again, and can't handle two worlds, which Shar praises. He asks her about the cause of her getting blisters. At first she doesn't tell, but eventually gives in when realizing the grave danger she is putting Avalon in by hiding what had happened. When she leaves, it is revealed that Tamani had been there and was hiding from her so that he could get the real details about what happened. The book ends with Shar and Tam talking about Tam's new assignment. The assignment is not revealed, but it said to be something that Tamani would like to do. Critical reception Spells met with critical acclaim prior to its release. Booklist gave Spells a starred review and wrote, \\"Mixing a little bit of Harry Potter and a lot of Twilight . . . Pike has hit on a winning combination. Yet it is her own graceful take on life inside Avalon that adds a shimmering patina sure to enthrall readers.\\" Romantic Times awarded Spells a \\"Top Pick,\\" noting that \\"[s]urprises and suspense abound, making Spells harder to put down than Wings. Laurel is blossoming into an intriguing woman. Her conflict of heart won't come as a surprise to others who have been torn between two things they love dearly.\\" Salt Lake City Weekly found that \\"...Pike's tale is more than another derivative hero-quest narrative. While telling a fanciful story about faeries and trolls, she cleverly interweaves an effective teen coming-of-age yarn\\". Spells was endorsed via a cover blurb by Carrie Jones, who said, \\"Spells is brilliant and lovely. Aprilynne Pike's talent just continues to bloom and I am almost afraid to see how awesome her next book will be.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Aprilynne Pike ‚Äì Author Website Category:2010 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:American children's novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:American romance novels Category:Contemporary fantasy novels Category:Novels about fairies and sprites Category:HarperCollins books Category:2010 children's books ","title":"Spells (novel)"},{"id":"26984915","text":"The background of the occupation of the Baltic states covers the period before the first Soviet occupation on 14 June 1940, stretching from independence in 1918 to the Soviet ultimatums in 1939‚Äì1940. The Baltic states gained their independence during and after the Russian revolutions of 1917; Lenin's government allowed them to secede. They managed to sign non-aggression treaties in the 1920s and 1930s. Despite the treaties, the Baltic states were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 in the aftermath of the German‚ÄìSoviet pact of 1939.  Independence process  Signing the Treaty of Tartu. Adolf Joffe (Soviet Russia, left). The Russian Empire acquired the Baltic areas as autonomous Duchies administered by Baltic German nobility via the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 and Courland in 1795.Hiden & Salmon (1994). pp. 12‚Äì13. In 1914, World War I broke out and by 1915 German armies had occupied Lithuania and Courland incorporating the areas into Ober Ost.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 24. As the Russian Empire began to collapse, independence movements sprung up on many regions. After the 1917 October Revolution in Russia, Baltic political leaders attempted to establish the independent states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; however, German control continued throughout the area until early 1918. Later in 1918, the area was drawn into the Russian Civil War and proclamations of independence were issued in Lithuania on 16 February, in Estonia on 24 February and in Latvia on 18 November 1918.Gerner & Hedlund (1993). p. 49. Between years of 1918‚Äì1920, the bolsheviks tried to establish Soviet republics in the Baltic area. In November 1918 the Red Army conquered Narva. They proclaimed the Commune of the Working People of Estonia, but it was able to function only for six weeks.Gerner & Hedlund (1993). p. 56. In December, the Latvian communists controlled Riga and proclaimed the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic. In May 1919, the communist control ended when the city was taken by combined German, Latvian and White Russian troops.Gerner & Hedlund (1993). p. 57. By 1920, German troops had withdrawn and the Russian Civil War was in its final phase. Consequently, the Baltic states signed peace treaties with Soviet Russia. Estonia signed the Treaty of Tartu on 2 February, Lithuania signed the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty on 12 July and Latvia signed the Latvian‚ÄìSoviet Peace Treaty on 15 August 1920. In 1920, all three Baltic states adopted constitutions including universal suffrage, a multi- party system and parliamentary with a president. However, the communists were prohibited from participation in politics.  Diplomacy in the 1920s and early 1930s = Baltic states seek security guarantees  The Bolsheviks could not prevent the independence of the Baltic states, but the West had to be persuaded to accept it. By 1921 Lithuania, and by 1922 Estonia and Latvia, all obtained de jure international recognition.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 59. All three states joined the League of Nations in 1921.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 61. The Baltic states begin to build a regional alliance system with their neighbours in Scandinavia and eastern Europe. In the south, Poland was reconstituted with consolidation of territories from Germany and Russia. Furthermore, in summer 1920, Lithuania cooperated with Bolsheviks trying to seize Vilnius, which poisoned Lithuanian relations with their neighbours. In the north, Finland had also been under Russian control from 1809 until its independence in 1918, but the Finns looked to Scandinavia rather than towards the Baltic states. In the west, Sweden followed a policy of neutrality, but during the 1920s, it took a more active regional role.Hiden & Salmon (1994). pp. 62‚Äì63. Between 1917 and 1934, the Baltic states worked to improve security, and unsuccessfully attempted to build a regional bloc stretching from Scandinavia to Romania.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 63. The Estonians and Latvians concluded a military convention in 1923, which Lithuania joined in 1934. Further, the Estonians and Latvians held a joint military exercise in 1931, but it was not repeated and collaboration remained a dead letter thereafter. However, the Finns and the Estonians had secret military exercises in the early 1930s, reconstructing the tsarist naval batteries. Finally in 1934, the three Baltic states reached the Baltic Entente agreement.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 64. In spite of the Vilnius issue, the Baltic states were open to the Polish option. The Warsaw Accord was signed in March 1922 by Finland, Poland, Estonia and Latvia, but the Finnish parliament failed to ratify it.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 65.  German‚ÄìSoviet trade and non- aggression agreements  The April 1922 Genoa Conference between Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Allied powers was an attempt to reconstruct Europe. Soon the Germans and the Soviets agreed on the Rapallo Treaty which provided mutual liquidation of war debts and the recognition of the Soviet state. It was also a begin of the direct economic co-operation between these two giants. The Baltic leaders had lost their chance of planned international consortium to trade with the Soviets.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 67. Next, the Locarno Conference in 1925 gave a framework for European security. The Locarno treaties guaranteed Germany's western borders, but left open questions about Germany's eastern borders. The Germans and Soviets agreed to the Treaty of Berlin in 1926 as the Soviets feared the West could use Germany in its anti- Bolshevik crusade. The Baltic states were warned to not become military outposts of Great Britain against the Soviet Union.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 68. Germany developed positive relationship with the Baltic states, especially with Latvia. Latvia represented itself as a bridge to an improved relationship with the Soviet Union. Latvia managed to sign a trade agreement with Germany in 1926 and with the Soviet Union in 1927.Hiden & Salmon (1994). pp. 69‚Äì70. Similarly, Lithuania signed a trade agreement with Germany in May 1926. Lithuania was the key to improved relationship with the Soviet Union. In exchange for Soviet recognition of Lithuania's claim to Vilnius, the countries signed a non-aggression pact in September 1926.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 70. The situation appeared to be stable for the Baltic states. The Soviet Union was not a significant threat as Joseph Stalins rise to power was underway, and the state retreated to the Socialism in one country ideology. The Soviets signed non-aggression treaties with their neighbor states between 1926‚Äì1933, including Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Poland.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 71.  Europe becomes unstable = Rise of totalitarian regimes  The early 1930s saw the international community became unstable. First, the stock markets collapsed in 1929, causing an economic slump. Second, economic woes and fear of Communism saw the rise of totalitarian regimes in Japan, Germany and Italy. Economic crises destabilized the internal politics of the Baltic states, causing the rise of authoritarian regimes.Hiden & Salmon (1994). pp. 88‚Äì89. Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras had already taken power in a coup d'√©tat in 1926; both Estonia and Latvia followed the example in 1934. The Elder of State Konstantin P√§ts took power in Estonia, and shortly afterward Prime Minister KƒÅrlis Ulmanis took power in Latvia.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 51. Furthermore, because of the Great Depression, the Baltic states' two leading trading partners, Britain and Germany, limited their imports from the Baltic region.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 89. Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany increased Soviet fears, and made the Baltic position between these two giants difficult. The Germans responded to the banking crisis of 1931 by introducing the policy of Grossraum wirtschaft. It was a clearing agreement where states exchanged material goods instead of money. This increased German trade with the Baltic states and it integrated their economy with Germany, but it never dominated their trade as effectively as in the Balkans.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 93. In January 1934, the Germans and the Poles signed a non- aggression pact. In March 1934, the Soviet commissar for foreign affairs Maxim Litvinov proposed to the German ambassador in Moscow Rudolf Nadolny, a German- Soviet guarantee for the Baltic states which were \\"previously a part of the former Russian empire\\". Hitler vetoed the proposed deal and Nadolny resigned. Next, the Soviets turned to the \\"Eastern Locarno\\" plan, which was originally proposed by French foreign minister Louis Barthou. The proposed plan would have allowed Soviet troops to enter the Baltic states in the name of mutual assistance.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 95. External threats led to the Baltic Entente of September 1934, in which the Baltic states concluded a collective foreign policy, though it had no formal military provisions.  Road to Nazi‚ÄìSoviet co-operation  Germany increased the scope of its power and authority with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935 and the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936. In response, Baltic chiefs of staff were invited to the May Day celebration in Moscow in 1936. During their visit an Estonian officer was warned about German influence and offered a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov made a speech to the eighth Soviet congress in November 1936, in which he warned border states against acting on behalf of the fascist powers and hinted at an intervention by the Red Army on the other side of the border.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 96. Next, Germany annexed Austria in March 1938. A few days after this Poland delivered an ultimatum, demanding that Lithuania sign a peace treaty with Poland. Without support from their Baltic neighbours, the Lithuanians had to accede to the ultimatum. In September, the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia. Next, the Germans aimed to regain the Polish Corridor and Klaipƒóda in Lithuania.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 97. On 20 March 1939, the Germans demanded Klaipƒóda from Lithuania. Two days later the Lithuanians agreed, losing 30 percent of their industrial capacity and their only major sea port.

However, during the same period the Soviet Union built defences on the borders of Finland, Estonia and Latvia, and committed airspace infringements. In early 1939, the Germans and Soviets started secret meetings toward an agreement. The British had abandoned the idea of naval intervention in the Baltic with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935. However, British politicians made visits to the area, and exported armaments.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 99. In 1939, the British and French tried to arrange a \\"guarantee\\" of the Baltic states to the Soviet Union. The Baltic states would have preferred to remain neutral, but the only security systems on offer were German or Soviet.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 102. In June 1939, Estonia and Latvia yielded to German pressure and signed non- aggression pacts.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 103. In late June, the German general Franz Halder visited Estonia and Finland, and later Admiral Wilhelm Canaris visited Estonia. The visits were merely political demonstration, but the Soviets saw them as unfriendly. Germany and the West raced for Soviet favours. The French were prepared to hand over the Baltic states to the Soviets in order to purchase an agreement but the British refused.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 104. The French and British went on to hold military conversations in Moscow in August 1939. The Soviets demanded that the Western powers occupy bases in Finland and the Baltic states and then hand them over to the Red Army. Soon afterward, German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop traveled to Moscow to negotiate the final stage of a new pact, later known as Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. In its secret protocol, the Germans and Soviets divided Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Bessarabia between their spheres of influence.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 105. After the German invasion of Poland on 1 September, a second secret protocol of 28 September consigned Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of interest.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 106.

Lithuanian tanks heading to Vilnius in 1939 after the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. On August 23, 1939 the Soviet Union asserted its control over the Baltic states with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which declared them as Soviet sphere of influence. On September 16, the Soviets and Japanese governments signed a cease-fire agreement. Next, the Soviets invaded Poland on 17 September, concluding operations on 6 October. After occupying eastern Poland, the Soviets pressured Finland and the Baltic states to conclude mutual assistance treaties. The Soviets questioned the neutrality of Estonia following the escape of a Polish submarine on 18 September. A week later, on 24 September, the Estonian foreign minister Karl Selter was given an ultimatum in Moscow. The Soviets demanded the conclusion of a treaty of mutual assistance which included the establishment of military bases in Estonia. In early 1939, the Leningrad Military District had already allocated 17 divisions, about 10% of the Soviet Army, to the Baltic states. Mobilizations followed shortly. The 8th Army was dispatched to Pskov on 14 September 1939, and the mobilized 7th Army placed under the Leningrad Military District. Invasion preparations were by now nearing completion. On 26 September the Leningrad Military District was ordered to \\"start concentrating troops on the Estonian-Latvian border and to finish that operation on 29 September.\\" The order noted, \\"for the time of starting the attack a separate directive will be issued.\\"Tannberg. Tarvel. _Documents on the Soviet Military Occupation of Estonia_ , Trames, 2006. On 24 September, warships of the Soviet Navy appeared off Estonian ports and Soviet bombers began threatening patrols over Tallinn and the nearby countryside. Moscow's Week at Time Magazine on Monday, October 9, 1939 The USSR then entered the airspace of all three Baltic states, flying massive intelligence gathering operations on 25 September.The Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by David J. Smith, Page 24, After four days of negotiations, the Estonians had no choice but to accept naval, air and army bases on two Estonian islands and at the port of Paldiski. Soviet troop numbers in Estonia were put at 25,000. The mutual assistance treaty was signed on 28 September and the Soviets made similar treaties with Latvia on 5 October and Lithuania on 10 October. The latter treaty transferred Vilnius district to Lithuania.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 110. Finland was invited to enter similar negotiations on 5 October. Unlike the Baltics, the Finnish-Soviet negotiations lasted weeks without result. The Soviets invaded Finland on 30 November.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 111. The Finns were able to resist the Soviets for over three months; the nation lost over ten percent of its land area, though it retained its sovereignty.  Occupation and annexation  Soviet Tanks in center of Riga, 1940 In December 1939, Latvian communists were called to consultation in Moscow. Their activities included, among others, collecting information on those who held opinions hostile to the Soviets. In May 1940, the Soviets turned to the idea of direct military intervention, but still intended to use a puppet regime.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 113. Their model was the Finnish Democratic Republic, a puppet regime set up by the Soviets on the first day of the Winter War.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 112. The Soviets organised a press campaign against the allegedly pro-Allied sympathies of the Baltic governments. In May, the Germans invaded France; the country was overrun and occupied a month later. In late May and early June, the Baltic states were accused of military collaboration against the Soviet Union. On 15 June, Lithuanian government had no choice but to agree to the Soviet ultimatum and permit the entry of an unspecified number of Soviet troops. Prime minister Antanas Smetona proposed armed resistance to the Soviets, but the government refused, proposing their own candidate to lead the regime. However, the Soviets refused and sent Vladimir Dekanozov to take charge of affairs while the Red Army occupied the state.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 114. On 16 June, Latvia and Estonia also received ultimatums. The Red Army occupied the two remaining Baltic states shortly thereafter. The Soviets installed Andrey Vyshinsky as leader of Latvia and Andrei Zhdanov in Estonia. New Baltic state governments were formed on 18 and 21 June along popular front lines. They were confirmed in office by rigged elections on 14‚Äì15 July.Misiunas & Taagepara (1993). p. 28.Gerner & Hedlund (1993). p. 59. A few days afterward, on 18 July, \\"demonstrators\\" in major Baltic cities called for incorporation into the Soviet Union. Three days later, all three parliaments declared their states to be Soviet republics and applied for membership.

Hannaford, Captain Donald Grant Millard and Captain John F. Lorraine. All three died, becoming direct casualties of the Cold War in Europe.  Background  The Cold War developed between the Soviet bloc and the United States, Canada, and Western European nations. Tensions were highest between the United States and the Soviet Union in the regions bordering the Iron Curtain, notably West Germany and East Germany, and relations between the two superpowers were characterized by hostile attitudes, spying, and numerous incidents resulting in loss of life and equipment. One of the most famous of these is the 1960 U-2 incident when the Soviets shot down a Lockheed U-2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers over the Soviet Union in May 1960.  Event  On 28 January 1964, an unarmed USAF North American T-39A Sabreliner twin engine jet trainer, 62-4448, of the 7101st Air Base Wing, departed Wiesbaden, West Germany, at 14:10 hours on a routine three-hour training flight. On board the trainer were three men, Captain John F. Lorraine and students Lieutenant Colonel Gerald K. Hannaford and Captain Donald G. Millard. Lorraine was the qualified instructor, while Hannaford and Millard, both pilots with experience on other types, were being trained in order to qualify on the T-39. The flight proceeded uneventfully until, 47 minutes after takeoff, radar at two U.S. air defense stations noticed that the trainer was heading toward East Germany at . Hoping to divert the T-39 back on course, each station began hailing the plane on Air Force frequencies and a Soviet- monitored international distress band. Repeated calls to the T-39 went unanswered. It appeared that the T-39's radio systems malfunctioned and the crew were unable to respond. The T-39 crossed the border into East Germany. Within five minutes, two blips appeared near the American jet. For 11 minutes, radar blips indicated the three planes were moving eastward, then two blips suddenly veered west and the third blip disappeared. American personnel monitoring the T-39's flight could not determine what had happened, although it was later reported that residents in Vogelsberg, from the border, had heard machine-gun and cannon fire and had witnessed the plane crash. The incident is believed to have occurred at 15:14 hours. At 17:00 hours on 28 January the United States Military Liaison Mission (USMLM), in Berlin, received a warning to stand by for possible search and rescue of American airmen. By 18:00 hours, a search team left Berlin for the Erfurt area of East Germany. At 19:15 hours, the chief of the USMLM met with his Soviet counterpart to request help in finding the plane and rescuing survivors (in accordance with the Huebner‚ÄìMalinin Agreement). At 20:00 hours, a second search team left Berlin. About this same time, the first team arrived at the crash site, north of Erfurt. The first team received a report from an East German civilian that a U.S. plane had crashed and burned, and that the crew was dead. Throughout the night, the American teams tried to approach the aircraft and were repeatedly sent away by the armed Soviet forces on site. These forces denied that any aircraft had crashed, and two American search teams were detained briefly before being released at 14:00 hours on 29 January. Memorial to the three aircrew, near Vogelsberg (Thuringia)  Aftermath  By 29 January, the United States State Department charged that the Soviet Union shot down an unarmed plane and caused the needless deaths of three officers. Secretary of State Dean Rusk called the action a \\"shocking and senseless act.\\" Through the Soviet press agency, Tass, Moscow claimed that the plane had intruded over East German territory and failed to react to signals, and then a warning shot. The Soviets said they were compelled to take the measure that brought down the U.S. plane. On 30 January, the Soviets agreed to allow US personnel access to the crash site. This occurred the following day and later the bodies of all three servicemen were returned to the United States through Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. General Curtis E. LeMay met the plane and participated in an honors ceremony. The aircraft wreckage was also recovered and was taken to Berlin, arriving there on 1 February 1964.

Genes Couse released Genes on his own record label, Beep Beep. It is very much a solo affair, with all songs but one written by Couse, and mostly performed by Couse, although he enlisted old friend Edwyn Collins as producer. Many of the songs are also very personal, with Couse himself referring to it as \\"somewhat introspective affair\\". An important theme is that of family, as represented by the title and also the artwork (which seems to include old family photos), and specifically of Couse's relationship to his father who had only recently died when the record was being made. The song that Couse didn't write is John Cale's \\"(I Keep a) Close Watch\\" (listed as \\"Close Watch\\" on Genes), which addresses the fear of loss associated with love. This song is for many the highlight of the record, perhaps because the indirection of a cover performance helped Couse in the face of his grief over his father coupled with the apprehension of becoming a father himself. John Cale and The Velvet Underground are also significant musical influences on Couse.Couse cites Cale, The Velvet Underground, and Lou Reed as influences on his myspace page. A cover of the Velvet Underground song \\"Sunday Morning\\" shows up on one of his later singles (\\"Batman and Robin\\", 2005).

A \\"local landmark,\\" Shorty's has been owned by the Alexas family since the 1930s. It has two locations, including the main facility on West Chestnut Street in Washington, as well as in Canton. The main restaurant has old wooden booths, a dining counter, as well a large storefront, showing the grill to pedestrians. Products The trademark menu item is an Albert's frank with chili sauce, mustard and onions, as well as french fries with gravy. The food is inexpensive, with the hot beef dinner being the most expensive menu item at $7. Shorty's main location sells 600-700 hot dogs a day. Three of Shorty's trademark dogs with chili sauce, mustard and onions. The chili sauce is especially favored by customers. The secret recipe takes 4 hours to prepare each 7 to 10 gallon batch. American soldiers serving abroad in England, Germany, Japan, and Vietnam have all received shipments of Shorty's chili sauce in the mail from their mothers. The favored supplier of the hot dogs has changed over time from locations in Germantown, Johnstown, and Green Valley Packing in Taylorstown. Reputation and customer base The Pittsburgh Post- Gazette says that \\"[t]he Shorty's name commands a customer loyalty many businesses only dream of developing.\\" That customer loyalty extends to former residents, who make a point to return to Shorty's when they're in town, especially during the holidays. The Observer-Reporter describes Shorty's as having a \\"local brand recognition that a lot of companies can only dream about\\" and that a book could be written on the restaurant. An associate professor of entrepreneurship at the nearby Washington & Jefferson College said that the customer loyalty and business model represents \\"almost a case study for a franchising class.\\" A common belief among customers is that the secret to Shorty's resides within the grill, with many believing that it remains the original from the 1930s. However, when the original grilltop malfunctioned in the 1980s, the custom crafted steel replacement was installed under the cover of night, no one noticed. Documentarian Rick Sebak regretted not being able to profile Shorty's in his hour-long documentary on hot dog shops, A Hot Dog Program, saying that \\"There's no other place like it. They haven't changed a thing in there since the place openend in the late 1930s. That's what's great about Shorty's. It has a high funk factor.\\" Photographs of Shorty's have been sold as fundraisers for the Citizens Library in Washington. In 1993, Shorty's was recognized by the Observer-Reporter for raising funds for the Free Care Fund at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Clientele The shop has claims a wide variety of clientele, ranging from judges to Tex Ritter. During the 2006 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, Republican candidate Lynn Swann used Shorty's as a campaign stop. History=Founding In the 1920s, George Contakos owned Everybody's Lunch on West Chestnut Street from 1924 through 1932, when he bought the Try Me Lunch at 34 West Chestnut Street and renamed it Shorty's Lunch, in honor of his nickname and 5'4\\" height. In 1938, Peter Alexas became joined with Contorakes to become partners. Partial ownership passed to George Contorakes's son John G. Contorakes, a Washington native and former student at nearby Washington & Jefferson College, until his death in 2001. Shorty's originally operated 24 hours per day; during the first decade of operation, the doors didn't even have locks. However, World War II brought reduced hours because of the lack of workers. The interior decor and structure has remained relatively unchanged from the original construction, including the 8 original booths that were purchased used during the 1930s. Threats from development In 2003, plans for the Crossroads Project, a redevelopment effort in downtown Washington, Pennsylvania, revealed that developer, Millcraft Industries, and the Washington Redevelopment Authority intended to use several \\"blighted\\" city blocks to build a private business development, including outlets similar to Grove City Premium Outlets, lofts and apartments designed to attract students from Washington & Jefferson College, and a 1,200 space parking garage. All told, the project would have been as ambitious as the nearby Southpointe development. The $100 million project would have required the demolition of several buildings through eminent domain, including the building housing Shorty's original 34 Chestnut Street location, and would have significant tax breaks through a tax increment financing program. In spite of offers by the developer to assist with moving costs, the Alexas family refused to move, gathering 23,860 signatures in a petition to keep their current location, an amazing number in a city with a population of 16,000. They received support of local officials, including the town's mayor. The efforts to keep Shorty's open in the face of pressure for developers has inspired other small business owners, including Shelley's Pike Inn in Houston, Pennsylvania. While the effort to raze Shorty's appears to have stalled, the Alexas family has begun to expand into other locations, to protect themselves from future redevelopment efforts. They have pursued a franchising effort to place stores in Southpointe Shopping Plaza, downtown Canonsburg, and Franklin Township. Other locations The owners of the Washington Mall informed the Alexas brothers in late 2004 that they would have to vacate in order for the mall to be turned into a strip shopping center. To replace this store, the Alexas family built another location in Canton Township.

Rear view. Saint Mary's Cathedral (), better known as Lugo Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic church and basilica in Lugo, Galicia, north-western Spain. The cathedral was erected in the early 12th century in a Romanesque style, with Gothic, Baroque and Neoclassicist elements. History A church existed in the site from 755. In 1129 Bishop Peter III commissioned a new edifice in the latest architectural style from Raimundo, a local architect and builder. This Romanesque structure was completed in 1273. Later renovations and restorations added elements in other styles, such as the Renaissance retablo at the high altar. It was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and fragments of it are housed in the church. The cathedral received from the Pope the privilege to permanently expose the Holy Sacrament. Structure The cathedral has a Latin Cross structure, with a length of 85 m. It has a nave, covered by a barrel vault, and two aisles, with an ambulatory and five apse chapels. The triforium features triple ogival mullioned windows. The apse houses a calvary sculpture from an unknown date. The fa√ßade is a Renaissance design by inspired by a plan proposed by Ventura Rodr√≠guez for the Cathedral of Pamplona. Its construction was finished in the late 19th century, with the completion of the two side towers. The northern entrance's narthex is in Gothic style, dating to 1510-1530. Internally showing a starred vault, it is formed by three archivolts with a lintel showing Christ Pantocrator and with a pinjante (glove-shaped decorative pendant) that features a depiction of the Last Supper. To the right of the entrance is the Gothic Torre Vella (bell tower), surmounted by a Renaissance top floor finished by Gaspar de Arce in 1580. The sacristy (1678) and the cloister (1714) are in the Baroque style, as is the central chapel of the triforium (1726). The chapel of St. Froil√°n is in Renaissance style, dating to the 17th century. Notable is the choir, built by Francisco de Moure (early 17th century).

They primarily serve to deliver ambience and diffuse sounds in a film or music soundtrack. History Dolby Stereo (1975) was the first standard cinema sound system using a single matrixed mono rear channel (note Disney's Fantasound from the 1930s used a surround channel). Dolby Surround (1982) was the first home audio system to use a rear channel. It and its successor, Dolby Pro Logic (1987), used a single rear surround channel, but often using two speakers connected in anti- phase or a dipole radiator, as shown in the speaker configuration diagram to the right in gray. Implementation Unlike most typical speaker placements, surround speakers are often intended to radiate such that the sound reflects off walls so that the sound arrives at the listening position indirectly as a reflection rather than a direct wave. Often dipole (sometimes even quadrupole) speakers are used to do this, especially in small or home theater applications where an array of surround speakers as in a movie theater is not practical or possible.http://blog.stereotype.co.nz/2009/02/why-dipole-rear-speakers-are- better/ A common misconception is that surround channels are \\"rear channels.\\" However, when only two speakers are used, they are meant to be placed on the side walls at 90-110 degrees relative to the screen. Surround speakers are placed above the listeners ears and are not angled towards the listener. In cinema setups, many more than two surround speakers are often used, being placed along the side walls and along the back wall, creating a very diffused sound in the auditorium.http://www.axiomaudio.com/surroundsexplained.html For music surround channel information is intended to be more direct as in a soundstage there would be direct noise from all around and not ambience as in a movie setting. For this reason surround speakers should not be set up to be strictly diffuse. Optimally there should be discrete surround channels for diffuse and direct effects. This is part of the design for Tomlinson Holman's 10.2 surround sound. For movies surround channel information is usually more diffuse ambient noise. Some surround sound systems such as Dolby Digital EX and Pro Logic IIx incorporate a third (back surround) or even fourth surround channel (back left and back right). These channels are matrixed from the standard surround channels; they are not discrete. Rear/back surround channels Some matrix encoding surround sound systems use a single back center channel surround (Dolby Digital EX, Dolby Pro Logic IIx 6.1) or a back left and back right (Dolby Pro Logic IIx 7.1) speaker configuration. Often the standard surround channels are misconceived to be \\"rear channels\\" when they are in fact meant to be placed at 90-120 degrees. Surround arrays In commercial cinema, where there is a large area to cover, it would be impractical to use a single speaker for each surround channel. Theater auditoria are often lined with speakers all along the side and back walls. This is to increase the size of the listening area. JBL states that surround speakers should be spaced evenly along the side and back walls, starting at no closer than 1/3 of the room length from the screen (so the surrounds do not interfere with the front channels) and should be located at about 10‚Äì12 feet high and angled down to face the opposite wall-floor boundary.http://www.jblpro.com/pub/cinema/cinedsgn.pdf References Category:Surround sound ","title":"Surround channels"},{"id":"26985071","text":"The Yamaha XJR1200 is a motorcycle manufactured by the Yamaha Motor Company.

It is one of four species in the genus Xantho. Description The juveniles of X. poressa are cryptically coloured as camouflage among the epibionts on the leaves of Posidonia with a variable carapace colour, which can be yellowish, reddish, brown, or dark grey with patches of another colour, usually white. The pereiopods are usually banded with dark brown or black bands alternating with white or translucent stripes or spots, although the fifth pereiopod is brighter and often unmarked. The adults are uniformly dark grey in colour and they leave the seagrass beds for more open, rocky substrates. Distribution X. poressa is distributed throughout the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea and into the warmer parts of the north eastern Atlantic to the Canary Islands. Biology The larvae of X. poressa go through four zoeal and one megalopal stages, which are typical of most of the related species of crabs in the subfamily Xanthinae. The duration of each zoeal stage is 2‚Äì4 days and the megalopa stage lasts an average of 10 days, with the first juvenile crab stage being reached after 23 days. Juveniles live in Posidonia meadows until their last moult, when they migrate to the nearest rocky substrate. In the Black Sea, X. poressa is common near the shoreline at depths less than 1 m; it is mainly found stones on substrates of pebble and crushed rock; it is rare on the other substrates and may occur down to 15 m in depth.

The castle is a group of buildings around a courtyard, comprising two stone keeps, or towers; one 15th-century, one 18th-century, a range of workshops and stables and the modernised remains of an 18th-century servants' wing. In 1280 the Norman Fitzgerald family settled at the site, then known as Gort na Tiobrad. The Fitzgeralds married into the local ruling class, the Gaelic O'Colleains and assumed the title Lords of Claonghlais. During the 15th century their descendants built a stone keep. Recently restored the keep contains a fine example of a mural staircase (stone steps built within the thickness of the external wall). During the mid-17th century the Fitzgeralds gave shelter and patronage to the Irish poet D√°ibh√≠ √ì Bruadair (1625‚Äì1698), who wrote an elegy about the family, as well as recording their lives and exploits.\\"David O'Bruadair\\", Catholic Encyclopedia at newadvent.org. As the family prospered, a second keep was built during the 18th century to garrison soldiers. In 1691, following the confiscation of their lands by the King of England, the Fitzgeralds left Springfield and returned to France. The property was bought by William Fitzmaurice, a younger son of the 20th Lord Kerry. His son, John Fitzmaurice, built a large three-storey mansion in Early Georgian style, adjacent to the 13th-century keep, which survived until the Irish Republican Army burnt it down in 1921. In 1780 Ann Fitzmaurice, sole heiress, married Sir Robert Deane, 1st Baron Muskerry. Following the fire in 1921, Sir Robert Deane, 5th Baron Muskerry rebuilt the Georgian mansion's servants wing and renovated parts of the other buildings. It is these parts of the complex, with of land and several lodges, which are today inhabited by his descendants. The castle is owned by Robert Deane, 9th Baron Muskerry.

The eruption of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano in Iceland on 20 March 2010 affected the economic, political and cultural activities in Europe and across the world. There was an extensive air travel disruption caused by the closure of airspace over many countries affecting the travel arrangements of hundreds of thousands of people in Europe and elsewhere. Sporting, entertainment and many other events were cancelled, delayed or disrupted when individuals or teams were unable to travel to their destination.

Air travel and transport throughout the world was cancelled due to the airspace restrictions and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated the airline industry worldwide would lose ¬£130 million ($200 million) a day as a result. IATA stated that the total loss for the airline industry was around US$1.7 billion (¬£1.1 billion, ‚Ç¨1.3 billion). The Airport Operators Association (AOA) estimated that airports lost ¬£80 million over the six-and-a-half days. Over 95,000 flights had been cancelled all across Europe during the six-day travel ban, with later figures suggesting 107,000 flights cancelled during an 8-day period, accounting for 48% of total air traffic and roughly 10 million passengers. Following the travel disruption, EU ministers agreed to accelerate the integration of national air traffic control systems into the Single European Sky and also to the immediate creation of a crisis coordination group to handle future transport disruptions.  European economies  Several sectors that depend on air-freighted imports and exports were badly affected by the flight disruptions. Imports of medications were affected, and local stocks, as they expire.Ash disrupts deliveries to British shops, UPI.com, 17 April 2010/ Business people and officials expressed concerns about imports of fresh food and other essential goods into the United Kingdom.\\"Volcanic ash cloud causes economic concern\\" BBC News, 18 April 2010 FedEx, DHL Express and other logistics companies were unable to transport goods by air.\\"Volcano's eruption beginning to hurt Europe's economy\\" The Star, 17 April 2010 Instead they had to transport packages to alternate destination (such as Istanbul or Madrid) and then ship by road to the final destination.

It stopped production of 2,000 vehicles in two plants. Honda also announced a partial halt to production. Factories in China's Guangdong province saw air shipments of clothes and jewellery delayed. In South Korea, Samsung and LG were unable to air-freight more than 20% of their daily electronics exports and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries said hotels and restaurants in Hong Kong were facing shortages of European produce.  New Zealand economies  The New Zealand fisheries economy was helped by the disruption caused to air transport in Europe.

The current implementation as of April 2010 uses Python and works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server databases. HTSQL was prototyped and developed by Clark Evans (who proposed YAML in 2001YAML) and implemented by Kirill Simonov,http://pdfind.com/hyper-text-structured-query-language-htsql- is/ both of Prometheus Research. Scope HTSQL's intended audience is business users who are not SQL programmers. It seeks to simplify non-intuitive relational queries, such as aggregates and projections. The goal is not completeness in replicating SQL, but simplicity and intuitiveness. HTSQL allows users who are familiar with the data, but not SQL syntax, to directly access the database without going through an application.http://www.htsql.org/tutorial.html Syntax HTSQL uses a URI- based query syntax. Queries typically begin with a single table, optionally prefixed by a schema and followed by a filter expression to limit the number of rows that are returned.http://clarkevans.com/tmp/spec.html Examples Joins can be made across tables by referencing the column name preceded by the table name. This example requests the title of a degree program from the program table and the school name from the school table: /program{school.name, title} The result of this query from the HTSQL command- line system is: program ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ school.name  title \\\\--------------------------+----------------------------------- School of Art and Design  Post Baccalaureate in Art History School of Art and Design  Bachelor of Arts in Art History School of Art and Design  Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art School of Business  Graduate Certificate in Accounting ... Aggregate expressions can be used when there are many-to-one relationships in the database. /school{name, count(program), count(department)} The result shows the count (number) of programs and departments in each school: school ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ name  count(program)  count(department) \\\\-------------------------+----------------+------------------ School of Art and Design  3  2 School of Business  5  3 College of Education  7  2 School of Engineering  8  4 Applications HTSQL can be used for ad hoc database queries. Its developers consider it to be more concise and intuitive and therefore less error-prone than SQL for non-technical users.http://clarkevans.com/tmp/spec.html HTSQL can also be used by \\"accidental programmers\\", such as data analysts and UI developers. Besides more readable, HTTP-based queries, HTSQL's developers claim it helps avoid common SQL mistakes like accidental joins.http://htsql.org/talks/20100804.html Versions and licensing HTSQL follows a dual license model.

Life Born in Bern in 1944, Burkhard was apprenticed to photographer Kurt Blum. After opening his studio in 1965, he was retained as documentation photographer by the Kunsthalle Bern, cooperating closely with curator Harald Szeemann and portraying many artists. This triggered Burkhard's interest in contemporary art. He came to international attention in 1969 through the exhibition of large-format photographs created together with the Bernese artist Markus Raetz, which included a 1:1 scale photograph of Raetz's study. Burkhard and Raetz were the first artists worldwide to expose photographs directly onto canvases using a self-developed technique.Niederhauser (2010): \\"Als erste K√ºnstler weltweit belichteten die beiden in einem selber entwickelten Verfahren Leinw√§nde.\\" After moving to the United States, Burkhard tried to find work as an actor in Hollywood, thinking that his distinctive face might make him suited for a career as a movie villain. Instead, he was appointed Visiting Lecturer of Photography at the University of Illinois in Chicago, where he taught from 1976 to 1978. His first dedicated exhibition in 1977 at the Zolla/Lieberman Gallery in Chicago was followed by regular stays in New York and participation in film projects. After his return to Switzerland in 1983, he worked in La Chaux-de-Fonds and Bern, cooperating with several other artists. His works came to be regularly exhibited worldwide, at times in up to 20 group exhibitions simultaneously. From 1990 to 1992, Burkhard taught as a visiting lecturer at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de N√Æmes, having moved to France in 1990. Towards the end of the 20th century, he began to focus on urban photography and directed the film Ciudad (film). In 2007, he married Vida Rudis, a teacher whom he had met in Chicago. Work Burkhard, who almost always worked in black and white, was best known for his large-format photographic series. These images have been described as centering \\"on a stock of clearly defined subjects which he carefully extracts one by one from their context\\", as for instance with the photograph of an arm that filled an entire exhibition hall in the Kunsthalle Basel in 1983. His work has been praised for its \\"hermeticism and poetic depth\\", characterized as that of a \\"hyperrealist dreamer\\" and placed in the tradition of Tanizaki Junichiro and Gustave Courbet, whom Burkhard admired; his photographic reflections on the painter's work were made part of the great Courbet exposition of 2007 in the Grand Palais. A central theme in Burkhard's work was the depiction of the female sex, in an approach that has been interpreted as the \\"search for the primordial goddess, the focus of all desires\\". Women were notably the focus of a 1970s Polaroid nudes series with Markus Raetz, the theme of a noted series of photographs on the nape and feet of a geisha, and the topic of a number of huge images shown in 2008 in the Songlines exhibition at the Museum Franz Gertsch in Burgdorf. Burkhard and his work are the subject of an episode of the 2005 3sat documentary series PHOTOsuisse. His photographs have been published in several coffee-table books.

Now Heshan has been added to this historic region, and the prefecture-level city of Jiangmen administers all five of these county-level cities, which is sometimes informally called Ng Yap. Their ancestors are said to have arrived from what is today central China about less than a thousand years ago and migrated into Guangdong around the Tang Dynasty rule period, and thus Taishanese as a dialect of Yue Chinese has linguistically preserved many characteristics of Middle Chinese. The Taishanese are part of the Yue Chinese family and have an identity that distinguishes themselves from the dominant Cantonese people. Among the Han Chinese, Taishanese are a source for many famous international Chinese celebrities and have produced the largest numbers of Chinese actors and singers than any other region in mainland China. Despite their small population size, Taishanese people have produced a number of famous academics and historical figures. Sze Yup or Jiangmen is considered the home of Chinese Academicians. The total of academicians is 31 people, a city with over 20 is considered extremely rare in China. Among Asian Americans, Taishanese are influential in politics and were the first Americans of Asian descent to be elected as governors, mayors, and U.S congressmen. The Taishanese were the first Chinese people to settle in America and the Taishanese language was the lingua franca of Chinatowns but this was replaced with Cantonese after being overwhelmed by immigration from Guangzhou and its satellite cities. Taishanese American laundrymen and shopkeepers were a primary source of funding that helped launch Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's revolutionary activities while he was in exile and raising money from overseas countrymen.  Language and identity  Taishanese is a Yue Chinese language that is distinguished from Standard Cantonese but non-specialists often use \\"Cantonese\\" in a broader sense for the entire Yue subgroup of Chinese rather than specifically the language of Guangzhou. Cantonese and Taishanese are mutually unintelligible. Cantonese speakers often find Taishanese difficult to understand and have an average intelligibility of only 30%. This is also true for other Yue Chinese variants such as the Goulou dialects.Cantonese speakers have been shown to understand only about 30% of what they hear in Taishanese Unlike most varieties of Chinese, Cantonese has de facto official status in Hong Kong and Macau, and has an independent tradition of the written vernacular. Taishanese, who make up one-third of the population of Hong Kong, may identify themselves with Cantonese instead of Taishanese. Since Hong Kong culture is heavily Cantonese-influenced and is a Cantonese-speaking society, Taishanese and other Han Chinese who are Hong Kong-born and raised, assimilate into the Cantonese identity of Hong Kong. Many Hong Kong activists are of Taishanese ancestry such as the late Szeto Wah who was a politician of the pan-democracy camp and sang democratic Cantonese songs with other activists to promote democracy in China. Culture Culturally, Taishanese people are similar to other Yue Chinese peoples. Today, many Sze Yup people have become successful in many areas such as the entertainment industry, business and politics. Hong Kongers of Sze Yup ancestry include: Andy Lau, Beyond (band), Danny Chan, Kenny Kwan, Joey Yung, Ronnie Chan, John Tsang, Andrew Li and many others. The Father of Hong Kong Cinema, Lai Man-Wai also has ancestry from the Sze Yup region of province. As a result, Sze Yup people have dominated in the entertainment industry and play most major roles in the music and movie sectors. In many films, Taishanese can be heard, especially in many of Karl Maka's films such as Merry Christmas and Aces Go Places. It is said that over a hundred famous people come from the Sze Yup region of Guangdong province, making the region famous for producing more stars than any other city/region in mainland China. As a result, the local government in Jiangmen which administers the Sze Yup or Ng Yap cities of Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, Xinhui, and Heshan, decided to build a Stars Park called Jiangmen star park (). Taishan county is famous for being the Birthplace of China's volleyball, that was brought to Taishan by Overseas Chinese, and the city won many provincial and national championships. Taishanese are well known for their love for Volleyball and being China's champions. Premier Zhou En-Lai once stated, \\"Taishan is Half of the Country's (China) System.\\" Architecture upright=1.2 In 2007, UNESCO named the Kaiping Diaolou and Villages () in China as a World Heritage Site. UNESCO wrote, \\"...the Diaolou ... display a complex and flamboyant fusion of Eastern and Western structural and decorative forms. They reflect the significant role of √©migr√© Kaiping people in the development of several countries in South Asia, Australasia, and North America, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the close links between overseas Kaiping and their ancestral homes. The property inscribed here consists of four groups of Diaolou, totaling some 1,800 tower houses in their village settings.\\" Today, approximately 1,833 diaolou remain standing in Kaiping, and approximately 500 in Taishan. Although the diaolou served mainly as protection against forays by bandits, a few of them also served as living quarters. Kaiping has traditionally been a region of major emigration abroad, and a melting pot of ideas and trends brought back from Overseas Chinese. As a result, many diaolou incorporate architectural features from China and from the West. Tong Laus which are mixed-used buildings where the ground floor is reserved for commercial use and the top floors for residential are also prominent in the region, as are traditional Lingnan architecture aesthetics which are commonly found throughout Guangdong province.  Economy and business  Besides dominating the entertainment industry, they are quite dominant and influential in Hong Kong's Business Industry, founding such companies as the Bank of East Asia (), Lee Kum Kee (), Hang Lung Properties, Maxim's Catering (), Li & Fung (), Beijing Air Catering Ltd, Hysan Development () and many others. Lui Che-woo once the second richest man in Asia. Famous overseas Taishanese businessmen includes Loke Yew, the richest man of Malaysia in his time and who made significant impact in the growth of Kuala Lumpur, and was one of founder fathers of Victoria institution. Jack Yan who founded his company Lucire, is a magazine publisher in New Zealand and he also owns a software firm that created over 100 typeface designs himself for the firm, and inspired other local typeface designers such as Kris Sowersby to pursue careers in that industry.

Overseas Because the history of going abroad is long, and there are many people sojourning widely in various districts, Taishan is called the \\"No.1 Homeland of Overseas Chinese\\".

The Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) is the former name of the railroad network built between California and Utah that formed part of the \\"First Transcontinental Railroad\\" in North America. About 12,000 such emigrant workers were employed as laborers by the Central Pacific Railroad representing 90 percent of the entire work force.Kraus, \\"Chinese Laborers and the Construction of the Central Pacific,\\" p. 49. J. O. Wilder, a Central Pacific-Southern Pacific employee, commented that ‚ÄúThe Chinese were as steady, hard-working a set of men as could be found. With the exception of a few whites at the west end of Tunnel No. 6, the laboring force was entirely composed of Chinamen with white foremen. A single Irish foreman with a gang of 30 to 40 Chinese men generally constituted the force at work at each end of a tunnel; of these, 12 to 15 worked on the heading, and the rest on the bottom removing material. When a gang was small or the men needed elsewhere, the bottoms were worked with fewer men or stopped so as to keep the headings going.‚Äù The laborers usually worked three shifts of 8 hours each per day, while the foremen worked in two shifts of 12 hours each, managing the laborers.John R.

It is named after James Sullivan, an early 19th-century Governor of Massachusetts. Sullivan Square station on the MBTA Orange Line is located just west of the square. History Prior to the 19th century, Mishawum (later Charlestown) was only connected to the mainland (now Somerville) by an isthmus called \\"the neck\\". Roads to Everett (previously a ferry), Medford, and Cambridge and Somerville fanned out from the Charlestown Neck. An extension of the Middlesex Canal from Medford to a millpond at the neck was authorized in 1795 and completed in 1803, with the canal running through where the traffic circle now stands. The junction was eventually named Sullivan Square after James Sullivan, an early 19th-century Governor of Massachusetts who was among the organizers of the canal. The Boston and Lowell Railroad opened in 1835, followed by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) in 1844. The circumferential Grand Junction Railroad was added in 1849, though it did not have passenger service until the Eastern Railroad used it as Boston access for its main line and Saugus Branch beginning in 1855. The B&M;'s East Somerville station and the Eastern's Somerville station were located along Cambridge Street just west of Sullivan Square. The presence of the railroad station lead to residential development west of Sullivan Square in East Somerville. Owing to competition from the railroads; canal traffic declined rapidly and it closed in 1853. The Millers River and surrounding wetlands were filled primarily in the 1870s and 1880s for railroad yards, though Sullivan Square remained a transportation hub. Horsecar service between Somerville and Charlestown began in 1858, supplanted by electric streetcars around 1890. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) opened its Main Line Elevated in 1901, with a grand enclosed terminus over Sullivan Square at the north end of the Charlestown Elevated section. In February 1950, the city began construction on a highway project intended to relieve congestion in the square. The $5 million project replaced the road junction with a large traffic circle; an underpass from Alford Street to Rutherford Street and an overpass from Broadway and Mystic Avenue to Rutherford Street were constructed. A cave-in occurred in November 1950 during underpass construction, and a section of the under-construction overpass collapsed in May 1952. The work was completed in 1953. Deferred maintenance, salt air corrosion, and complaints about noise led to the downfall of the Elevated (by then the MBTA Orange Line). In 1975, the first phase of the Haymarket North Extension relocated the Orange Line alongside the railroad tracks on the west side of the square; the elevated station was soon demolished. Interstate 93 was simultaneously constructed overhead. In 2002, the overpass was removed due to its deteriorated condition. The construction of Encore Boston Harbor included $11 million of short-term improvements to the rotary and surrounding roads, which were constructed in 2018‚Äì19.Sullivan Square Lower Busway and Parking Lot Reconstruction A longer-term plan which eliminates the rotary entirely and establishes a local street grid is planned for 2021‚Äì2025, with $25 million from the casino and about $150 million from the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization.With Wynn‚Äôs casino rising nearby, city has plans for Sullivan Square ReferencesExternal links Category:Neighborhoods in Boston Category:Squares in Boston Category:Transportation in Boston Category:Charlestown, Boston ","title":"Sullivan Square"},{"id":"26985551","text":"Water pipe with Latin inscription from the reign of Vespasian. The text is unusual for being sunk into the surface and its sizable length of 1 m. A Roman lead pipe inscription is a Latin inscription on a Roman water pipe made of lead which provides brief information on its manufacturer and owner, often the reigning emperor himself as the supreme authority. The identification marks were created by full text stamps.  Manufacture of pipes  Roman thermae of Bath, England Lead, a by-product of the ancient silver smelting process, was produced in the Roman Empire with an estimated peak production of 80,000 metric tons per year ‚Äì a truly industrial scale. The metal was used along with other materials in the vast water supply network of the Romans for the manufacture of water pipes, particularly for urban plumbing.; The method of manufacturing the lead pipes is recorded by Vitruvius and Frontinus. The lead was poured into sheets of a uniform length, which were bent to form a cylinder and soldered at the seam. The lead pipes could range in size from approximately up to diameter depending on the required rate of flow.  Creation of inscriptions  Since the 19th century, the hypothesis has occasionally been put forward that the Roman inscriptions were created by movable type printing.Lanciani 1881, p. 416, A recent investigation by the typesetter and linguist Herbert Brekle, however, concludes that all material evidence points to the use of common text stamps.: Brekle describes the manufacturing method as follows: Lead pipe stamp of the Legio XIV Gemina Brekle lists the following reasons for the employment of stamps and against that of movable type: for printing on lead sheets the way the Romans created them, it would be much more practical to use single stamp blocks than sets of individual letters, since the latter would be unstable and would have required a clamp or some similar mechanism to maintain the necessary cohesion. Neither impressions of such clamps nor of the fine lines between the individual letters typical for the use of movable type are discernible in the inscriptions. By contrast, the outer rim of one examined stamp block left a raised rectangular edge running around the inscription text, thus providing positive evidence for the use of such a printing device. In addition, evidence of the poor positioning of movable type, such as individual letters tilting to the right or left or deviating from the baseline ‚Äì something which could have been expected to occur at least in a few extant specimens ‚Äì is notably absent. In those inscriptions where the letters are not properly aligned, the entire text is blurred, which clearly points to the use of full text stamps. Finally, it needs to be considered that archaeological excavations have never unearthed ancient sets of movable type, whereas moulds with reversed inscription texts for stamp printing have indeed been recovered.

The show reflected the story of six-year- old Kashi who was born in a lower-caste family and her journey to fulfill her dreams. The show also reflected the situation of rural India especially Bihar where lower castes were being exploited by the so-called upper castes. Characters and plot The story is based in a remote village named Dholkipura in the Indian state of Bihar. Parbatram (Pankaj Jha) is a postman who belongs to a lower caste and lives in a joint family with his wife Ishwari (Sai Deodhar) and her daughter Kashi (Jannat Zubair Rahmani). The other members in the family are: Kashi is the main character. Her mother died from drinking poisoned water. Her dream is to go to school, and most of the story is focused on her wanting to study. She is really smart. She does make her dream come true, but it happens after she goes through a lot of pain. Kashi is really hardworking and never lies. After the leap, the viewers learn that Kashi has feelings towards Shaurya. Kashi sacrifices her love for Shaurya for Beyjanti's happiness; when Beyjanti realizes this she call off the engagement. Shaurya (Dev Joshi) is the Malkian's son. At first he is mean to Kashi, but he later realizes that she is good, and he becomes one of her best friends. He tries to help Kashi. When his father and mother see how close they are, they send him to boarding school. After coming back from school Shaurya wants to marry Kashi. But his parents have already fixed his marriage with Beyjanti, though, at the end he and Kashi do get engaged. Beyjanti is one of Kashi's best friends and sticks up for her when she sees someone doing something wrong to her. She also is friends with Shaurya. Beyjanti is really stubborn, spoiled and ill-tempered. She doesn't do that well in school; she went to school because Kashi went to school. After the leap Beyjanti is enthusiastic to marry Shaurya, but she later realizes that Kashi and Shaurya love each other, and it's been evident since their childhood. She calls off the engagement and wants Shaurya and Kashi to get married. Mangat Ram (Sunil Chauhan) is the elder brother of Parbatram and he pulls a cycle rickshaw to earn his living.

Life Statue of Premanand placed near Faculty of Arts in M. S. University, Vadodara He was born in 1645 at Vadodara in the caste of the Nandora Chaturvanshi Brahmins. In colophons of his Akhyanas, he remarked such as, \\"Place of braves called Vadodara, Situated in the middle of Gujarat, caste Chaturvanshi Bramins, Bhatt Premanand is the name\\". In those times, Gujarat was ruled by Mughal governor Aurangzeb. At that time it was openly said: \\"Marwari language is valued at 16 aanas (equiv. to 1 Rupee), Kachhi language is valued at 12 aanas; Marathi language is valued at 8 aanas, While Gujarati language is valued at 4 paise (equiv. to 1 aana)\\" Born at the time when Gujarati language was devalued in such a manner, Premanand vowed that: \\"I shall not put on a Turban on my head till the time I earn a respectable position for Gujarati Language\\" By supposed divine inspiration, Premanand undertook the commendable but Herculean task of taking The Ramayan, Mahabharat, Bhagwat, Harivansh Puraan and life episodes of Devout-Poet Narsinh Mehta through \\"Maankala\\" (with the help of playing Maan) across numerous villages of Gujarat. Premanand provided invaluable service to Gujarati Language as well as to the people of society by poetically narrating the religious and social inheritance of Middle Ages, i.e. episodes from epics and scriptures in a simple and effective language and also performed valuable act of cultural awakening. Premanand's creations are priceless possessions of Gujarati literature; they are the cultural inheritance of Gujarati populace. Renowned Gujarati Poet Narmad has noted that: \\"Premanand's language is universally uniform. The depiction of customs, traditions and nature of people; and verbal depiction of incidents garnished with exaggerated descriptions have found their prominent place in the vernacular language. This is the beauty of Premanand's verses. And the eminent Gujarati novelist Navalram has mentioned: \\"It is not surprising that Premanand who hails from Vadodara, who has written poetry on pure and profound love and whose name has become so dear to those art-loving people who have experienced divine love and pleasure; enjoys the supreme position amongst the contemporary poets. I personally believe that it is his modesty and humbleness that he obliges the other three frontline poets by allowing them to sit near the steps of his artistic kingdom! Really! Gujarati people should be proud of Premanand\\" Raskavi Premanand has structured his poetic verbal recitals as per time and incidences. For example, importance of \\"Okhaharan\\" (Abduction of girl named Okha) in the month of \\"Chaitra\\" (6th month of the Vikram year), the pleasure of listening to a detailed poetic depiction of the marriage of \\"Shamalsha\\" (son of Narsinh Mehta) in the month of \\"Vaishakh\\" (7th month of the Vikram year) which is the season for marriages, while in \\"Bhadarvo\\" (11th month of the Vikram year) ‚Äì the month of making ceremonial offerings to the dead ancestors ‚Äì he would present a poetic recital on the description of such offerings to the deceased father of Narsinh Mehta. He wrote Okhaharan. Contribution He was known by the title of \\"Ras-Kavi\\". His known creations are \\"Nalakhyan\\", \\"Sudamacharitra\\", \\"Dashamskandh\\", \\"Rannyagna\\", Okhaharan, Kunvarbainu Mameru.

The Cambridge Water Company were a company responsible for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards on the presence of perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It was found that the Sawston borehole was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a tannery owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE should be avoided or that it could cause harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather anyway. The case first went to the High Court of Justice, where Kennedy J dismissed claims under nuisance, negligence and Rylands v Fletcher because the harm was not foreseeable. His decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, who cited an \\"obscure decision\\" to justify doing so. The case then went to the House of Lords, where a decision was read by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993. Goff first countered the Court of Appeal decision, restoring Kennedy's dismissal of the case, before moving on to the deeper legal points. Based on the original decision in Rylands, Goff argued that it had always been intended for foreseeability of harm to be a factor, something not previously put into law by the English judiciary. He then stated that Rylands was arguably a sub-set of nuisance, not an independent tort, and as such the factors which led him to including a test of foreseeability of harm in Rylands cases also imposed such a test on all nuisance cases. The decision in Cambridge Water Co made an immediate change to the law, for the first time requiring foreseeability of harm to be considered in cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher and the general tort of nuisance. It was also significant in implying that Rylands was not an independent tort, something later concluded in the Transco case. Goff's judgment has been criticised on several points by academics, who highlight flaws in wording which leave parts of the judgment ambiguous and a selective assessment of Rylands that ignores outside influences. Facts The Cambridge Water Company Ltd was established by a private Act of Parliament in 1853 to provide water to the residents of Cambridge and the surrounding area; by 1976, the population served had risen to approximately 275,000.Wilkinson (1994) p.799 With the rising demand, the company purchased a borehole outside Sawston, constructing pumping equipment and integrating the water from that borehole into their system in 1979. Tests undertaken both before the purchase, and in 1979, had demonstrated that the water was safe for public consumption.Quinn (2000) p.290 During the late 1970s, concerns were expressed about the presence of perchloroethene (PCE) in water, and as a result a European Directive was issued in 1980 requiring nations of the European Community to establish maximum acceptable levels of PCE in water; the United Kingdom did this in 1982. PCE was discovered in the borehole; it was not tested for earlier because there was no need to regulate the levels. As a result, the Cambridge Water Company was forced to cease pumping the water, and instead find a new borehole elsewhere.Kutner (1995) p.77 An investigation immediately ensued. The investigators concluded that the PCE had come from Eastern Counties Leather plc, a leather tannery in Sawston. The tannery used PCE as a degreasing agent, beginning in the 1960s; by 1976, of this chemical were used by the tannery each year, with up to on the premises at any one time. PCE was leaking out of the drums it was carried in, first by being spilt when it was tipped into the degreasing machines and second by leaking from near-empty drums. Although these spills were individually small, it was estimated around of PCE were spilled each year. These spills collected in the chalk underlying Sawston until groundwater swept them into the Cambridge Water Company's borehole.Quinn (2000) p.291 Judgment=High Court and Court of Appeal The Royal Courts of Justice, where the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal are based. The Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather in the High Court of Justice, wanting ¬£1 million in damages for the cost of finding a new borehole and an unsuccessful attempt to decontaminate the original one, and an injunction to prevent any more use of PCE.Wilkinson (1994) p.800 They argued that Eastern Counties Leather were liable in three ways; first, in negligence, second, in nuisance, and third, under the rule developed in Rylands v Fletcher.Kutner (1995) p.78 The case came before Kennedy J, who dismissed all three of the Company's claims. On the matter of negligence, he held that the damage had to be reasonably foreseeable, as was required under Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd; he applied this same test to the claim under nuisance. Applying the case of Hughes v Lord Advocate, Kennedy found that the harm was not reasonably foreseeable, and both actions under nuisance and negligence must fail.Morton (1993) p.60 Rylands v Fletcher contained the principle that \\"the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril, and, if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape\\", with a requirement that this use of land be \\"non-natural\\". On the Cambridge Water Company's third claim, Kennedy was forced to consider the meaning of \\"non-natural\\" in this setting. He held that the use of industrial chemicals was not \\"non-natural\\", given that it was on an industrial site, and that for a claim to succeed under Rylands the use must be \\"some special use bringing increased danger to others, and must not merely be the ordinary use of the land or such a use as is proper for the general benefit of the community\\"; Eastern Counties Leather created jobs in Sawston, and was thus providing a benefit for the community. As such, the Company's claim under Rylands was not valid. Kennedy also chose to consider foreseeability of harm a factor in cases brought under Rylands, and stated the fact that harm was not foreseeable was a factor in his decision.Wilkinson (1994) p.801 The Cambridge Water Company then appealed to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, but only on the claim under Rylands v Fletcher. The court, composed of Nolan LJ, Mann LJ and Sir Stephen Brown, reversed Kennedy's decision.Kutner (1995) p.79 Despite a lack of comment by the appellants on the claim under nuisance, the court addressed this ground, relying on the \\"obscure decision\\" found in Ballard v Tomlinson,[1885] 29 ChD 115 concluding that \\"where the nuisance is an interference with a natural right incident to ownership then the liability is a strict one\\". As such, Kennedy should have applied Ballard, and it was unnecessary to consider Rylands because the claim under nuisance was valid. House of Lords The case was again appealed, this time to the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Templeman, Lord Goff, Lord Jauncey, Lord Lowry and Lord Woolf. The judgment was given by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993, and reinstated the decision of Kennedy J in the High Court of Justice; unlike the Court of Appeal decision, it directly addressed the issue of Rylands v Fletcher. Goff first addressed the Court of Appeal's use of Ballard v Tomlinson, stating that the decision there as based on the facts of the case, and did not establish either a rule that there was a right to clear water, nor that there was strict liability attached to that right.Kutner (1995) p.80 Goff looked at the relationship between nuisance and Rylands v Fletcher, particularly how they treat strict liability. In nuisance, liability is strict in that the defendant can be liable even if he has taken reasonable care, but this is kept \\"under control\\" by the principle that a defendant is not liable for actions a reasonable user takes on his land. He took into consideration an article published by F.H. Newark in 1949, in which Newark called the decision in Rylands \\"a simple case of nuisance\\" rather than a revolutionary doctrine that established strict liability outside nuisance.Kutner (1995) p.81 Goff also found similarities between the principle of \\"non-natural use\\" under Rylands and that of the \\"reasonable user\\" requirement in nuisance, concluding that \\"[I]t would lead to a more coherent body of common law principles if the rule [in Rylands] were to be regarded essentially as an extension of the law of nuisance\\".Quinn (2000) p.292 Lord Goff's judgment was primarily based on whether or not foreseeability of damage should be a factor in Rylands cases, and was that the matter was \\"open for consideration\\", saying that the need for foreseeability of damage to be a criterion was \\"a matter of principle\\".Clearwater (1994) p.335 He considered the case of Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co, in which the Privy Council concluded that foreseeability of damage was an essential part of determining liability in nuisance. The Council stated that \\"It could not be right to discriminate between different cases of nuisance so as to make foreseeability a necessary element in determining damages in those cases where it is a necessary element in determining liability, but not in others\\". If, as Goff was stating, Rylands was an element of nuisance, this decision should apply to it. In the original judgment in Rylands, the judge had stated that it covered \\"anything likely to do mischief if it escapes\\", and that liability should be to \\"answer for the natural and anticipated consequences\\"; this wording implies that he intended for \\"knowledge to be a prerequisite for liability\\".Kutner (1995) p.82 Significance Goff's judgment made several significant and immediate changes to the law. First, it was the first decision which imposed a requirement of foreseeability of harm to cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher; \\"it must be shown that the defendant has done something which he recognised, or judged by the standards appropriate at the relevant place or time, or ought reasonably to have recognised, as giving rise to an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if there should be an escape, however unlikely an escape may have been thought to be\\".Bermingham (2008) p.253 Secondly, it was the first decision to state that Rylands may be a sub- set of nuisance, and as such applied the same requirement of foreseeability of harm to nuisance, where previously such a requirement had not existed.Kutner (1995) p.86 Academic Tom Clearwater criticises some of the language Lord Goff picked out of Rylands v Fletcher for his judgment. In particular, Goff's use of \\"anything likely to do mischief if it escapes\\" and \\"answer for the natural and anticipated consequences\\" to justify his argument that Rylands had always intended foreseeability to be a factor suggests Goff \\"[overstepped] an appropriate reach of interpretation in drawing his conclusion...most cases gloss silently over the [wording]... three cases imply that foreseeability of damage is not a relevant consideration at all\\".Clearwater (1994) p.338 The reliance on Newark's article was also criticised, since \\"Neither he nor Goff attempted to justify their opinion with reference to anything external to [the Rylands] judgment\\". Clearwater points out that the original judgment in Rylands required modification \\"the price paid for which was legal uncertainty\\" to make it socially acceptable, which he sees as evidence that Rylands was, despite what Newark says, a significant change to the law.Clearwater (1994) p.344 Peter Kutner, a professor of law at the University of Oklahoma, argues that there is a significant ambiguity in Goff's judgment. Cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher now have a requirement that the harm was foreseeable, but it was not defined whether or not it was sufficient that it be foreseeable that harm could occur, or that it be foreseeable that the use of land is \\"non- natural\\", that the substance be capable of doing \\"mischief\\", and all the other requirements of Rylands. He also states that the decision did not explain precisely whether Rylands should be treated as a development within the law of nuisance, or something which sprung from nuisance and retains a separate existence.Kutner (1995) p.87 He interpreted the Cambridge Water Company decision as not being sufficient to completely write out Rylands as a distinct doctrine; this was later done by the House of Lords in Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council.Kutner (1995) p.88 ReferencesBibliography * * * * * Category:House of Lords cases Category:English tort case law Category:1993 in British law Category:1993 in case law ","title":"Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc"},{"id":"26985633","text":"The Casa di Riposo per Musicisti (literally 'rest home for musicians') is a home for retired opera singers and musicians in Milan, northern Italy, founded by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi (whose statue is outside the building) in 1896. The building was designed in the neo-Gothic style by Italian architect, Camillo Boito. Both Verdi and his wife, Giuseppina Strepponi are buried there. A documentary film about life in the Casa di Riposo, Il Bacio di Tosca (Tosca's Kiss in the US), was made in 1984 by the Swiss director Daniel Schmid.Goodman (24 July 1985) History Verdi's grave at Casa di Riposo, Milan Grave of Giuseppina Strepponi at Casa di Riposo, Milan In the last years of his life, Verdi wrote to his friend Giulio Monteverde: > Of all my works, that which pleases me the most is the Casa that I had built > in Milan to shelter elderly singers who have not been favoured by fortune, > or who when they were young did not have the virtue of saving their money. > Poor and dear companions of my life!\\" Lubrani (2001) p. 82.

The following year, he turned to his next philanthropic project, a home for retired opera singers and musicians who had fallen on hard times. In 1889, he wrote to Giulio Ricordi that he had acquired a large piece of empty land in Milan outside the Porta Garibaldi on which he planned to build his Casa di Riposo. He then announced his plans publicly in an 1891 interview in the Gazetta musicale di Milano. Construction did not begin until 1896, but in the intervening years Verdi and wife, Giuseppina Strepponi, met frequently with the architect, Camillo Boito to plan the project. (Camillo Boito was the brother of Verdi's friend and librettist, Arrigo Boito.) He also sought out information on how other hospices for the elderly were run. In 1895, Verdi made provisions in his will to fund the Casa after his death, bequeathing the future royalties from his operas to the Casa di Riposo per Musicisti - Fondazione Giuseppe Verdi. Construction was completed in 1899, but Verdi did not want any residents to move in until after his death.

The site has been the subject of controversy between developers and conservationists, as it contains a large iron ore deposit. The Bagla Hills are one of the habitats of the endangered Jentink's duiker. The deposit was first discovered in the 1970s by the now defunct American company Bethlehem Steel. Their preliminary evaluation produced \\"an ore reserve estimate of 384 million tons of primary ore (magnetite) at 18.1% Fe [iron] and about 90 million tons of haematite ore at 34.3% iron.\\" In 2005, SL Minerals was awarded the exclusive prospecting license for iron ore in the Bagla Hills area. However, in May 2009, Global Witness reported it had been told by the Director of Geological Surveys that SL Minerals had defaulted on a payment and gone into liquidation. Around 2009, President of Sierra Leone Ernest Bai Koroma went to London, seeking investors to help his nation recover from the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991-2002). Steve Cosser, an Australian pay-TV tycoon, proved receptive and came up with plans to mine the ore, while at the same time developing social programmes to benefit the people living there. In 2010, Cosser purportedly obtained a 72-year lease from the 23 families living on the land. Sable Mining Africa Limited claimed to have obtained a 50-year lease in a 7 April 2011 press release, but the government of Sierra Leone stated a week later that \\"all Mineral Resources within the confines of Bagla Hills is (sic) not for prospecting, exploration or mining, as they fall within a reserved area\\" and that it would begin an investigation of both Sable Mining and Cosser's Red Rock Mining (SL) Limited regarding the alleged lease acquisitions. In 2012, the government made \\"a commitment to not allow any form of mining inside the National Park.\\" In October 2016, The Standard Press reported that the High Court had ruled that two leases awarded to Cosser dated 20 December 2010 and 2 February 2011 were forgeries and awarded 50 million Sierra Leonean leones in costs to the plaintiffs.

About 61 percent of Mexican Americans live in just two states, namely California (36%) and Texas (25%). According to the 2010 census, the distribution of Mexican Americans in the United States by region is: 51.8% live in the West, 34.4% in the South, 10.9% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast. Mexican Americans are found in all 50 states. The number of Mexican Americans has been increasing dramatically since the late 20th century. The largest communities by population are located in Los Angeles (esp. East Los Angeles (region), which became a Chicano community since the end of World War II), and unincorporated East Los Angeles (97% Hispanic/Latino - highest in LA county). East L.A. was 65% Mexican-American in the 1970 US census reports, peaked at 85% in 2000, but has dropped to 40% out of 97% Latino in 2015 and according to the US Census in 2015, 88% of Mexicans living in East L.A. are now immigrants. The suburb of Maywood is another largely Mexican and Latino community. Then there's Santa Ana, California (70% out of 80% Latino) in Orange County - esp Barrio Logan (more Central American than Mexican today), San Diego and San Bernardino in Southern California; and San Francisco (the San Francisco Bay Area) including San Jose, California. The state's highest percentage is in Calexico on the Mexican border.https://www.census.gov/programs- surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html Tecate is an unincorporated community on the border is similarly 96% Mexican or Latino. The other 9 largest communities by percentage are found in the California cities of Coachella, Huron, McFarland, Mecca (unincorporated), Mendota, Oasis (unincorporated), Parlier, San Fernando, and Thermal (unincorporated). There are Mexican American majority regions in Central California and Southern California as well in southern Texas and southern Arizona. The majority of Mexican American persons in northern New Mexico are Hispanos. In Texas, some are Tejanos. Tejano or Texano (Spanish for \\"Texan\\") is a term used to identify a Texan of criollo Spanish or Mexican heritage. Some also use Texian, an archaic demonym which defined a resident of Mexican Texas and the Republic of Texas and the same region after annexation by the United States of America in 1845. In addition to Texian, several other names were used during the period, including Texasian, Texilingan, Texican, and Texonian. 450px Map of Los Angeles County, California showing percentage of population self-identified as Mexican in ancestry or national origin by census tracts.

Elsewhere  Many Mexican-Americans and immigrants alike have settled in other regions of the Central, Midwest (esp. Iowa and Wisconsin), Northeast and Southeast US states. Urban areas of Cincinnati; Cleveland; Fox Cities; Madison, Wisconsin; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Montana; Newark, New Jersey; New York City; Northern New Jersey (developed in the 1990s-2000s); Orange County, New York; Quad Cities; Sioux City, Iowa; South Florida with Miami; Southern New Jersey; and Suffolk County, New York along with Farmingville, New York are notable. And farming areas with often seasonal Mexican migrant labor populations like Buena Vista, Iowa; Cherokee, Iowa; Dubuque, Iowa (depends on economic situation); Eastern Iowa; Fort Dodge, Iowa; Iowa City, Iowa; Kenosha, Wisconsin; Lexington, Nebraska; Northwest Wyoming (esp. the Jackson, Wyoming area); Postville, Iowa; Racine, Wisconsin; Rapid City, South Dakota; Storm Lake, Iowa; and Western Nebraska. Other areas of equally high Mexican immigration are Akron, Ohio and nearby Canton, Ohio; Atlanta-Northern Georgia (including Dade County, Georgia depending on economic conditions); Baltimore; Billings, Montana; Boise/Snake River Valley; Charlotte, North Carolina Metro area; Columbus-Phenix City; Northwest and western parts of Louisiana; Helena, Montana/Western Montana; Huntsville, Alabama/North Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; Kansas City, Missouri metro area; Kentucky; Louisiana; Milwaukee; Mississippi Gulf Coast; Northern Mississippi (poultry plants); North Carolina; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Providence R.I.; Shenandoah Valley in Virginia (also Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads area); and Tennessee. This is from a wave of Mexican immigration in the 1990s and 2000s.  Growth of Mexican-Americans  According to the 2010 United States Census, there had been a phenomenal growth of Mexican Americans, mostly are immigrants who are Mexican nationals. In the Midwestern United States, places and states such as Michigan (the Detroit metropolitan area); Chicago and its near-in suburbs; Northern Indiana; Southern Wisconsin; Omaha; Kansas City; St. Louis and Minneapolis-St. Paul have developed large Mexican (immigrant and American-born) populations. The states of Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Nebraska attracted Mexican and Latino immigration in the late 20th century (but the trend began to reverse in the 2000s with most of these communities decreased in size when Mexicans returned home) to work in meatpacking plants and agricultural harvests, now many of the states' counties and towns have high growth of Mexicans or Latinos. Ohio has a growing Mexican and Latino population, especially in cities like Akron and Canton. Another destination was the Northeastern United States, in places such as the Monongahela Valley, Pennsylvania; Mahoning Valley, Ohio; Hudson Valley and Long Island of New York state; the Jersey Shore region and Southern New Jersey, especially in Freehold Borough; the New Haven, Connecticut area along with other Latin American nationalities; throughout Massachusetts; Washington, D.C. with Maryland and Northern Virginia included; some parts of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Delaware; and the area's largest Mexican immigrant population is the Philadelphia metropolitan area with the Delaware Valley when the local economy boomed in the 1990s and 2000s, but in all US regions, the Mexican national population has begun to decline from the late 2000s recession. A lot of Mexicans and Hispanics currently reside in many places along the Delaware Valley (housing construction employment boom), such as Bridgeton, New Jersey; Camden, New Jersey; Lambertville, New Jersey; Salem, New Jersey; Trenton, New Jersey; Bensalem, Pennsylvania; Chester, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania; North Penn Valley, Pennsylvania; Pocono Mountains (PA) region; Souderton, Pennsylvania; and West Chester, Pennsylvania. There has been large growth in Mexican and Latino communities in Providence, Rhode Island; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Wilmington, Delaware and Youngstown, Ohio areas. Communities that consist mostly of recent-arrived immigrants from Mexico, are also present in other parts of the rural Southern United States, in states such as Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas and (part of the Southwest) Oklahoma. A growing Mexican-American population is also present in urban areas such as Orlando, Florida with the Central Florida region included; the Lake Okeechobee area of Florida; the Atlanta metropolitan area; the Memphis, Tennessee area; Charlotte, North Carolina-with a majority Hispanic enclave of Eastland; and Mexican immigration throughout the Piedmont of North Carolina: i.e. Siler City, North Carolina and Henderson County, North Carolina; New Orleans which increased after Hurricane Katrina in Sep. 2005; the Hampton Roads, Virginia area; housing construction and remodeling brought large numbers of Mexicans into Oconee County, South Carolina; the Charleston, South Carolina and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina areas; and Ridgeland, South Carolina. There is also a large growth of Mexican Americans moving to suburbs and desert regions in the West Coast.https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/economy_and_business/real_estate_and_development/census- hispanic-residents-moving-to-suburbs-rural-outskirts-of- frederick/article_5e3ceb12-97b8-5f65-a99b-1c5af20b7f74.html References Mexican-American communities Category:Ethnic enclaves in the United States Category:Mexican-American history ","title":"List of Mexican-American communities"},{"id":"26985688","text":"Yan Soibelman 2006 Yakov Soibelman (Russian: –Ø–∫–æ–≤ –°–µ–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –°–æ–π–±–µ–ª—å–º–∞–Ω) born 15 April 1956 (Kiev, USSR) is a Russian mathematician, professor of Kansas State University (Manhattan, USA), member of the Kiev Mathematical Society (Ukraine), founder of Manhattan Mathematical Olympiad.

They are the most common type of cone cells in fish, reptiles, birds, and monotremes such as the platypus and are present in most vertebrates, though they have been noted as absent in most placental mammals (including humans), elasmobranches and catfish. There are many gap junctions between the cells of fish double cones. Their function, if they have any unique function compared to single cones, is largely unknown; proposed uses include achromatic (non-colour vision) tasks such as detecting luminance, motion and polarization vision. Some double cones have members with identical visual pigments (twin cones), while others have members with different cone types (members have a different spectral sensitivity). Behavioural research on the reef dwelling triggerfish Rhinecanthus aculeatus has provided evidence that individual members of double cones can act as independent channels of colour information. In a book about vision in fishes, James Bowmaker writes that double cones tend to be sensitive to longer wavelengths of light than single cones. He also states that the single cones are usually smaller than the individual members of the double cones. Further reading *Walls, G. L. (1942).

The film is based on the play of the same name by Enda Walsh.A Trio of Clips from Hideo Nakata's 'The Chatroom' Plot William Collins (Aaron Johnson) is a depressed boy recovering from self-harm and regularly goes online to chatrooms. One day, he decides to open a chatroom himself and calls it \\"Chelsea Teens!\\" and where he meets Jim (Matthew Beard), another kid; Eva (Imogen Poots), a model; Emily (Hannah Murray), a goody two-shoes; and Mo (Daniel Kaluuya), a normal kid. There is no real subject matter in \\"Chelsea Teens!\\" which instead focuses on the lives of each one as they talk. Even though they only really communicate through text, the film depicts them in an old hotel-like room and actually having contact. William is a loner who lives with his parents (Megan Dodds and Nicholas Gleaves). He hates both his parents, blaming them for his past, and lives his entire life on the internet. Jim is another loner who is suffering from depression following his father leaving him and his mother. Eva is constantly made fun of by her co-workers about her appearance. Emily feels distant from her parents and does not feel like she gets enough attention. Mo thinks he is a pedophile because he is attracted to his friend's prepubescent sister, Keisha (Rebecca McLintock). William sees it to himself to help them in a crude manner. He Photoshops embarrassing pictures of Eva's co-worker and posts them online. He convinces Jim to flush down his anti-depressants to make himself feel more relaxed and to reveal his face behind the depressants, his true identity. He tells Emily to do some dirty work, teaming up with Eva. They come up with ways in which Emily could be more violent and make it look like somebody is harassing her family, which makes her parents try to protect her more. He tells Mo to tell his friend Si the truth but this backfires when Si calls him a pervert and attacks him. William becomes darker and more menacing and even begins to watch people commit suicide. He then takes it upon himself to coerce Jim into committing suicide. His plans are halted though when his computer and phone are taken away from him by his father, who when looking through William's computer, finds one of the suicide videos. William gets his backup computer and phone and goes after Jim, who meets up with him at London Zoo. Mo and the others find out about William's intended actions and go to stop him, meeting up in person and trying to follow William and Jim around London. Jim makes it to the zoo first but decides to not do it. He tries to leave but William goes right after him. William catches Jim, but he refuses to shoot himself and throws the gun to the floor. When William gets it and comes back, Eva punches him and the rest of the crew comes, followed by the police. William tries to escape but is only able to climb up some crates. He then falls in front of the speeding train behind the crates and is killed. The teens leave without talking to each other; William's account is shut down and the credits roll.

He is sure she will exert proper influence over Irwin. Lola begs Hampton, whom she loves, to marry her instead. She tells him of her son, David (played by Giraci), who she sent away to school. But Hampton insists that he must not spoil his son's future. In revenge, Lola decides to marry Irwin. Getting the young man intoxicated, she gets him to propose and they go to the minister. Because Irwin is drunk, however, the clergyman refuses to perform the marriage ceremony. As he was so drunk, Irwin does not realize that there was no actual wedding. He brings Lola home and introduces her to his father as his wife. Hampton, naturally, denounces her. Lola then receives a call that her son, David, has been badly injured by a fall at school. His new wife, Paula, goes to Hampton and convinces him to operate on David, which saves the boys life. In gratitude, Lola relents. Admitting that the marriage was a hoax, she lets go of Irwin.

The Conference will add football as a conference sport in 2017-18. Conference opponents include Curry, Eastern Nazarene, Gordon, Nichols, Endicott, Roger Williams, University of New England, Wentworth and Western New England College. Sailing at SRU is governed by the Intercollegiate Sailing Association (ICSA), and its subdivision, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. In 2012 the Rugby teams moved into the newly formed Colonial Coast Rugby Conference, where the men compete nationally at the USA Rugby Division II level, and the woman compete in the National Small College Rugby Organization (Division III).
