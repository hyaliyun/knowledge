It is at 1 Jalan Changkat Kia Peng in central Kuala Lumpur, near significant city landmarks like the Kuala Lumpur City Centre and Bukit Bintang. History The establishment of a Philippine diplomatic presence in the then-Federation of Malaya was first called for in the second State of the Nation Address of President Carlos P. Garcia, which led to the opening of a legation later that year shortly after the country attained independence. The legation was later upgraded to a full embassy in 1961, with Yusup Abubakar, deployed at the time to the Philippine legation in Cairo, and who a decade earlier was appointed as consul to Singapore, Malaya and North Borneo by President Elpidio Quirino, becoming the first resident Philippine ambassador. The Embassy was ordered to close twice in the 1960s, both times because of the North Borneo dispute. In 1963, the Philippine government closed the Embassy and recalled all its diplomats shortly after the formation of the Federation of Malaysia, aiming to force the Malaysian government to settle the dispute. Five years later, President Ferdinand Marcos ordered the Embassy to close again after Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. exposed the Jabidah massacre, leading to Malaysia breaking off all diplomatic relations with the Philippines. The dispute has led to occasional demonstrations outside the Embassy, most recently after the 2013 Lahad Datu standoff. Building The current chancery of the Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur is a two-story residential structure built in 1962. Previously the home of Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first prime minister, the property was acquired by the Philippine government in 1987. Since then the chancery had been renovated three times: in 1993, 2011 and 2012, with the 2011 renovation entailing the replacement of the building's roof and electrical wiring, as well as the construction of a gazebo within the compound, although the property itself had never been truly renovated even before it came to the Philippine government's ownership. The 2012 renovation, the most extensive of the three, entailed converting the building from its previous residential layout, which was said to look \\"undistinguished\\", to an open floor plan more suited to the office functions of an embassy, while still retaining the exterior of the historically significant property. Led by Malaysia-based Filipino architect Bart Vista, the renovation, which began in February 2012, included converting and expanding the former dining room into a new community hall, extensively replacing flooring and other features, updating the building's electric wiring and air conditioning systems, installing new stained glass and lighting fixtures, repainting the building's exterior, and redoing the compound's landscaping. Completed on June 10, 2012, just before Independence Day, the renovation, which cost ‚Ç±19 million, came at no cost to the government, with the bill footed by Vista, his contractors and suppliers, and other members of the Filipino community in Malaysia, including the Kuala Lumpur chapter of the United Architects of the Philippines. Within the main chancery, the Embassy's consular and assistance-to-nationals sections are located on the first floor, as is the community hall, while the political, economic and finance sections are located on the second floor, along with the ambassador's office and other administrative offices. The compound also has an annex building, where the offices of the Embassy's service attaches are located. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur is headed by the Philippine ambassador to Malaysia, Charles C. Jose. Prior to being Ambassador, Jose, a career diplomat, was the spokesperson of the Department of Foreign Affairs. He was initially appointed to the position by President Benigno Aquino III, which was announced on January 23, 2016, less than four months before that year's presidential election, but was blocked two weeks later by Senator Juan Ponce Enrile while it was being debated by the Commission on Appointments (CA), reasoning that the appointment would be unfair to the incoming President who would be deprived of the opportunity to appoint whoever they may prefer. Although this reasoning was opposed by Senate President Franklin Drilon, the CA ultimately bypassed his appointment on procedural grounds, and Jose returned to his previous position until he was then reappointed by Aquino's successor, Rodrigo Duterte, on October 6, 2016. His appointment was then confirmed by the CA two weeks later, and he departed for Kuala Lumpur to assume his post on Black Saturday, April 15, 2017. The Embassy's activities center around providing to the needs and welfare of the large community of Overseas Filipino Workers and other Filipinos in Malaysia, a point made by those who have lived in the country. It continually monitors the situation of Filipino laborers entering Malaysia, particularly in the wake of the Lahad Datu standoff, while also warning those seeking employment in Malaysia to be vigilant against illegal recruitment. The Embassy has also helped facilitate the legalization of Filipinos who may be in Malaysia illegally, and cooperates with the Philippine Bureau of Immigration and other government agencies to regulate the flow of OFWs to Malaysia. In addition to providing consular assistance to the local Filipino community, the Embassy has also facilitated the furthering of cultural and educational ties between the Philippines and Malaysia, including hosting art exhibits by Mindanao-based Filipino artists, organizing food-themed events, and even forging official links with the University of Malaya. Activities in Sabah Despite being located in Kuala Lumpur, the Embassy also conducts extensive activities in Sabah, where there is a large Filipino population. In 2016, Ambassador Jose Eduardo Malaya III and two other Embassy officials were awarded the Gawad Mabini for setting up alternative learning centers for Filipinos and other migrant children in Sabah. Owing to the North Borneo dispute, the Philippine government has refused to set up a consulate there, as that would imply a recognition of Malaysian sovereignty over the territory. Instead, it has tried to set up a presence short of setting up a full consulate, although all attempts at doing so have been shut down by the Malaysian government. The most recent attempt at setting up a consular office in Kota Kinabalu, spearheaded in 2002 during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was shut down by the Malaysian government in January 2003, while urging the Philippine government to set up a full consulate instead: something that DFA Undersecretary Lauro Baja called \\"too political\\". Instead, the Embassy fields mobile teams to Sabah to provide consular services there.

Shelley is also Vice-President of the executive board of the Publishers' Association. He began his publishing career at the age of 23 working as an editorial assistant at the independent company Allison and Busby, founded in 1967 by Clive Allison and Margaret Busby, and after five years running the company he moved on to become editorial director of Little, Brown in 2005, publisher at Sphere in 2007, then in 2009 Deputy Publisher at Little, Brown, and Publisher there in 2011. Shelley oversees Hachette's inclusion initiative, \\"Changing the Story\\", which he founded in 2016. Biography=Education and career David Shelley grew up living above the second-hand bookshop in Lewes, East Sussex, that his parents ran, and after a state education he became the first in his family to attend university, graduating from Oxford, where he read English (1994-97). In 1997 he began his career in the publishing industry by working at Allison and Busby as an editorial assistant (\\"cum-dogsbody\\") to the company's then publisher, Peter Day. Shelley went on to run the company as Publishing Director at the age of 23 when his boss retired in 2000. In 2009 Shelley joined the Little, Brown Book Group as Deputy Publisher, and was Publisher from 2011 to 2015, subsequently becoming Chief Executive Officer of the Orion Publishing Group and the Little, Brown Book Group, and in 2018 taking on the role of Group CEO of Hachette UK. Diversity initiatives Shelley has been outspoken about the need for inclusivity and diversity in leadership roles in the publishing industry as well as in the books published. In 2016 he started an Hachette initiative called \\"Changing the Story\\", aiming to make the company more diverse and inclusive, in which was launched an imprint called Dialogue Books, headed by Sharmaine Lovegrove, to \\"publish books by writers from diverse backgrounds who may otherwise not have been picked up by the establishment\\". He has said: \\"Unfortunately, there've been too many decades where nothing has happened, so there's a lot of ground we have to make up for in the industry. And the sad thing is that there are potential classics that were never published in the 60s‚Äì90s because the industry was very much one way. I'm reminded of Allison and Busby, the first company I worked for. It was started by two people ‚Äì a man called Clive Allison and a woman called Margaret Busby. Margaret was the first black British woman to have a publishing company. They started that in 1967, and she published some amazing writers like Ishmael Reed and CLR James ‚Äì just some fantastic BAME writers. What's also sad is that from 1967 till up to two or three years ago, there were very few other Margaret Busbys and things didn't move on. I think there's an awful lot of ground the industry has to cover\\". Following the murder of George Floyd on 25 May 2020, Hachette UK donated ¬£10,000 to The United Families and Friends Campaign (a grouping of families and friends of those who have died in the custody of police and prison officers), and ¬£10,000 to The Inclusive Indies Fund, to help diversity-led independent publishers survive the coronavirus crisis. Shelley said: \\"...there is a more urgent need than ever for us to stand together and educate ourselves, become better allies and offer financial support where we can. These events highlight the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement and, closer to home, they underpin the vital work of THRIVE, Hachette's network for BAME employees, Changing The Story, our strategy to make the company more inclusive at all levels, and Dialogue Books, our imprint focused on illuminating voices often excluded from the mainstream.\\" After the publication on 15 June 2020 of an open letter from the newly formed Black Writers' Guild, calling for change in the UK publishing industry to address inequalities in output and personnel, Shelley was quoted in The Guardian as saying that \\"the industry could and should do a lot more ‚Äì and that we could and should do a lot more at Hachette\\". Shelley has also expressed a commitment to regional diversity, with plans for Hachette to open new offices in Sheffield, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Manchester and Bristol, so as \\"to forge closer links to the brilliant pool of creative talent outside the 'London bubble' and connect more closely with readers, authors and booksellers around the UK to enrich our publishing.\\" Recognition Shelley was on the Progress 1000 list of \\"London's most influential people 2016 ‚Äì Literati\\". In 2017 and subsequent years, he was named in the Financial Times annual OUTstanding list of LGBT+ executives, becoming the second senior executive from Hachette UK to be listed, after his predecessor Tim Hely Hutchinson.

On her first night traveling with the company and staying in a large hotel with all its members, she finds herself too excited about her new career to sleep. Bored, she leaves her room in just her dressing robe or, as it is referred to in 1911 reviews, her \\"kimono\\".Independent/'Lost in a Hotel'\\", The Moving Picture World, October 7, 1911, p. 41.

Now well past midnight, the young woman tries to return to her own room, but she realizes that she forgot its number and all the rooms in the hotel's long hallways look identical. The remainder of the film consisted of her awkwardly entering room after room and meeting other various odd, erratic characters in the troupe. After she finally relocates her room, she concludes from those strange encounters that a career as an entertainer is certainly not filled with glamor, now seems far less appealing, and involves a lifestyle not meant for her. The short ended with the enlightened \\"maiden\\" returning home to her mother.

Retrieved June 17, 2020. Combining films onto one reel not only reduced the number of reels shipped to theaters by distributors, it also reduced the number of reel changes on the projectors at those locations. In September 1911, when Powers Moving Picture Company distributed its split-reel copies of Lost in a Hotel and An Old-Time Nightmare, this comedy comprised the first half of all the shared reels released. The few available reviews of the film in 1911 are positive. In its October 7 issue, the trade journal The Moving Picture World compliments the \\"speedy comedy\\" for evoking \\"several laughs\\" and curtly ending its assessment with \\"It is commendable.\\" \\"Lost\\" film status No copy of this Powers short is listed among the motion-picture holdings of the Library of Congress, the UCLA Film Archives, in the collection of moving images at the Museum of Modern Art, the George Eastman Museum, the Library and Archives Canada, or in other major film repositories in the United States, Canada, or Europe.Online and hard-copy searches for this comedy/fantasy in the cited collections were conducted in June 2020, as well as in the Library and Archives Canada, BFI National Archive, and in EU film repositories through the European Film Gateway. The film is therefore presumed to be a lost production. Powers Moving Picture Company continued producing films as a single, independent studio for only seven months after the release of Lost in a Hotel. In May 1912 Powers formally merged with other production companies to form Universal Film Manufacturing Company.Horsley, David (1914). \\"David Horsley Tells History of Hollywood\\", The Arizona Republican (Phoenix), February 16, 1925, p. 12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers, Ann Arbor Michigan; subscription access through The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library. Retrieved June 8, 2020. All the resources of those companies were later consolidated by Carl Laemmle and transferred in 1915 to Universal's new, burgeoning studio complex in Universal City, California. If any master negatives and prints of this film and others by Powers were later physically transferred to Universal, that footage may have been lost in devastating fires that often occurred throughout the motion-picture industry in the silent era, including at Universal. At any given time, many millions of feet of old and new films that had been shot on unstable, highly flammable cellulose nitrate stock were stored in film vaults and in various studio warehouses. It is more likely, however, that subsequent studio managers deemed this short and its split-reel companion An Old-Time Nightmare to be inconsequential releases by a short- lived, secondary production company and were discarded or perhaps were simply left unattended and allowed to decay and disintegrate over time.

From Camp II they climbed an icefall and tried to open the route to a saddle in between Lampak South and an unnamed peak (21,340 feet). This route had to be abandoned after three attempts on it. On September 20 Camp III was established following a reconnaissance of the southwest ridge just below the towering spur. The next morning they climbed the spur, traversed the ice wall and reached summit through the southwest ridge. An Indian expedition of seven members led by Swaraj Ghosh from West Bengal made the probable third ascent of this peak between the Siruanch and Kalla Glaciers above the road head at Malari. On August 29, 2001 they established their Base camp at 4500m and the summit was reached on September 5 through the southeast ridge. The summiteers are Swaraj Ghosh, Sibrata Banerjee, B. Biswas, Gautam Chatterjee, Amal Das, B. Jetty, and N. P. Rao. A 10-member Punjab Police team led by PM Das climbed both Lampak I and Lampak II peaks in the Eastern Garhwal. They expedition established their base camp at 4,700m in the Kala Kharak to the west of the mountains, and then a higher camp I at 5,127m, from which both peaks could be attempted. on 4th june, camp II established at 5638m. On June 7, 2003 Lampak II was climbed by eight members including leader P M Das, Nari Dhami, Inder Kumar, Kulvinder Kumar, Mohan Lal, Anand Singh, Palvinder Singh, and Sangram Singh. They started in the morning 2 A.M. and reached the summit at 11.27 A.M.

Background O'Keefe was born in December 1948 in North Shields, and grew up in Tyne and Wear in north east England. He attended Ushaw College, a Catholic seminary for 8 years. He began studying philosophy at Durham University but changed direction and completed an undergraduate degree in Geography from Newcastle University, and a doctorate at The School of Oriental and African Studies in London. This was awarded in 1978 and concerned the underdevelopment of a village in Murang'a, Kenya (Gakarara: a study in the development of underdevelopment), supervised by the geographer Richard Hodder. In the 1970s he conducted his doctoral fieldwork in Tanzania, establishing a relationship between rural soil erosion and increased migration and urbanisation trends in Kenya. He then taught in the Sudan, although he reports, unsuccessfully: as a Commonwealth lecturer at the University of Khartoum in 1973, he says \\"I did little teaching that year. First, the students shut the university. Then, the army shut the university to keep out the students.\\". He then was a researcher at the Disaster Studies Unit at Bradford University. From 1976 to 1980 he was Visiting Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University, Worcester MA, USA, co-editing the radical journal Antipode for two years and interacting with US based radical scholars, students and geographers.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14678330/homepage/editor_s_past_reflections.htm#Okeefe In 1980 he joined the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences as Senior Research Fellow, leading large programs in energy, environment and development at the Beijer Institute (now the Stockholm Environment Institute), largely working in eastern and southern Africa. Projects included the Kenya Woodfuel Cycle addressing wood/charcoal in the energy balance, and the LEAP modelhttps://leap.sei.org/default.asp?action=introduction, an energy analysis tool. The emphasis was on demand-side analysis that informed the design of agroforestry and improved woodstove interventions, used in Zimbabwe and with the SADC. In 1984, he returned home to Newcastle upon Tyne, partly for family reasons (he and his partner Di Jelley went on to have 4 children), and to Newcastle Polytechnic, now Northumbria University, later becoming Professor of Economic Development and Environmental Management. At his inaugural Professorial lecture in the mid 1990s, he finished by renouncing the professorship, as a protest against the title being rendered meaningless by its award to others in the university who lacked research records. He established an arm of a Dutch development consultancy, ETC International, in 1988. The office was in Tynemouth above a pub and it handled over 200 contracts and development projects, and two over $10 million in value. ETC work was used to support rural communities, largely in Africa, and positions and doctoral scholarships at the Polytechnic and then the University. In addition, it provided research projects for Northumbria's Masters Programme on Sustainable Development and Disaster Management, which has graduated 350 students since 1990. O'Keefe served 12 years as a local Labour councillor on North Tyneside Council. He was also a supporter of the African National Congress before and after it gained power in South Africa in 1994, fundraising to assist its transition to a political party, working on the preparation of the Reconstruction and Development Programme for ANC takeover, and serving on the Mineral and Energy Board of the incoming ANC government.O'Keefe, P. and J. Kirkby. 1994. Energy and Sustainable Development in Southern Africa. In Cole, K. (ed.) Sustainable Development for a Democratic South Africa. Routledge. O'Keefe died peacefully in September 2020, after a short battle with cancer. Contributions O'Keefe argued, based on fieldwork conducted in Africa and work conducted with colleagues at Bradford University on early forms of Disaster risk reduction, that political and economic forces render people vulnerable to so-called 'natural' disasters such as drought and flooding. This was an early effort to rethink human vulnerability, recognising its social origins beyond 'natural' disasters, using fieldwork and analysis. In the 1970s these ideas were deemed radical, and were developed with scholars including Ben Wisner and Ken Westgate. O'Keefe also formulated a 'production of nature' thesis with fellow radical geographer Neil Smith.Smith, N. and P. O'Keefe. 1980. Geography, Marx and the concept of nature. Antipode 12(2): 30-39. https://antipodeonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OKeefe-2020_Production- of-Nature-Re-Visited_Antipode-Online.pdfThis continued to receive critical interest.Castree, N. 2000. Marxism and the Production of Nature. Progress in Human Geography 24(3): 5-36. His contributions to radical thinking in the social sciences concern the structural origins of vulnerability and poverty, the theorization of human-environment relationships, and the importance of political economy in understanding these relationships. In applied research work, there were links between ETC projects and academic output, particularly when working for European-funded projects, and in South Africa. O'Keefe and colleagues argued that humanitarian assistance has important political dimensions, in conflict zones and linked to the power of states to conceal, deny aid, or practice new contemporary forms of colonialism. His humanitarian aid evaluations began with the first ever formal evaluation of such aid in Somalia, prior to the Rwandan genocide, and ETC conducted 70 evaluations trying to change accountability structures, governance, leadership responsibilities and architecture of the aid system. Humanitarian aid, he argued, needs to respond to medium- or long-term crises, fostering livelihoods and development through working with affected populations.Middleton, N. and P. O'Keefe. 1998. Disaster and development: the politics of humanitarian aid. London: Pluto. Several of O'Keefe's books and reports resulted from detailed surveys of biomass use and supply for rural energy. Other work addressed the effective incorporation of the poor into national policymaking; critiques of the Bruntland Report and formulation of the Millennium Development Goals; and the political economy of climate change adaptation. Another Dutch-funded project was the rehabilitation of game parks and forestry in Mozambique. From the late 1990s, working with ETC, he led studies of climate-change adaptation to poverty for the Netherlands Climate Assistance Programme, arguing for a shift in focus to better development and resilience, and publishing two books.Taylor P.J., G.

History The construction of the building dates back to the 17th century and, over the centuries, belonged to the families of the Saluzzo marquises, then to the Morando, the Serra (1815) and finally the shipowner Carlo Barabino who sold it to the Municipality of Genoa in 1926 for the value of 2,200,000 lire. It was the Serra family (in the person of Gerolamo Serra) who mostly restructured the primary villa with expansions and modifications on several occasions, and transformed the original land of olive and citrus fruit into one of the most admired gardens of the Nervi park. Among the illustrious personalities who visited or stayed in the villa are the daughter Luisa Maria Amalia of King Ferdinand IV of the Two Sicilies, Frederick William III of Prussia, Queen Maria Cristina of Spain and the French historian Jules Michelet.Near the villa there is a noble chapel. Garden In 2018, the garden was part of Euroflora.

It was published in 1945. Ross Poldark is the protagonist of the novel. As the book opens, it is 1783. Poldark returns to Cornwall after serving with the British army in the American Revolutionary War. The war has left him with a prominent facial scar and a pronounced limp. When he returns, he discovers that his father has died, his family home has fallen into disrepair, the hard-drinking servants are selling off the household items, and the woman he loves is engaged to marry his cousin. Poldark's character emerges throughout the book in a number of subplots involving his relatives, women with whom he has romantic entanglements, the local gentry, servants, tenants, miners, poachers and competitors. Poldark stands up for the impoverished and attempts to protect the vulnerable. While by virtue of his birth and land ownership, he is a member of the gentry, his attitudes about justice generally are at variance with those of his peers. Without concern for his social standing, he marries the daughter of an impoverished miner who has been working for him as a housemaid and kitchen assistant for several years. He is focused on rebuilding his farm and reopening a family mine, partly in order to ameliorate living conditions for his tenants and local families who rely on mine work for income. The novel consists of three sections, with Book One covering October 1783 to April 1785 in eighteen chapters, Book Two covering April to May 1787 in eight chapters, and Book Three covering June to December 1787 in eleven chapters. Characters The main characters Ross Poldark interacts with are: * The family servants Jud and Prudie Paynter. The Paynters are mostly written as comic characters. They initially resent Ross's choice to bring on additional household help in the form of Demelza Carne. Prudie comes to value Demelza. Jud is, almost unfailingly, portrayed as engaged in heavy drinking. * Charles Poldark, uncle of Ross. Charles was the older brother of Ross's father, Joshua. Charles therefore inherited Trenwith House and Grambler. He suffers a heart attack on the day his grandson Geoffrey Charles is christened. He opposes and acts against a budding romance between his daughter, Verity, and Captain Andrew Blamey. He dies in 1787. * Ross's cousin Francis Poldark; son of Charles and brother of Verity. He marries Elizabeth Chynoweth and is the father of her son, Geoffrey Charles. Several years into the marriage, Elizabeth reveals to Ross that under the influence of George Warleggan, Francis is gambling and losing significant sums of money. Elizabeth asks Ross to intervene and talk to Francis; this does not go well. Later, Elizabeth again asks Ross to intervene in the marriage by investigating rumors she has heard that Francis has taken up with another woman. * Ross's first love, Elizabeth Chynoweth. She marries Francis Poldark and gives birth to their son, Geoffrey Charles. Her marriage grows increasingly unhappy over the course of the novel, because Francis is gambling away money and may be unfaithful. Elizabeth is described as possessing a fragile beauty. She has several extended bouts of ill health. * Demelza Carne. After observing her drunken father beating her at the Redruth Fair, Poldark impulsively hires Demelza as a kitchen maid. She is thirteen years old. A stray dog, Garrick, comes along with her. Poldark is interested in getting Demelza into a state of cleanliness that involves not having lice. She is interested in getting the lice removed from her dog, so that the dog will also be allowed into the house. As Demelza grows into her role, she is portrayed as lighthearted, cheerful, hardworking and practical. She loves bringing fresh flowers into the house. When she is 17, her father visits and tells her that he expects her to return to the Carne household to help with a baby about to be born to his new wife. To avoid this, she engineers a sexual encounter with Ross, who is portrayed as having had no sexual interest in her hitherto. Shortly thereafter, he marries her. While Demelza is characterized as adoring Ross, he is not romantically infatuated with her. He is fond of her, enjoys her company, and appreciates her in many ways. Part of his heart is still with Elizabeth. Demelza fears interacting with his family; she believes they will look down on her and that her manners are not adequate to the task. Demelza develops a trusting relationship with Verity Poldark during a several-week visit to Nampara; Ross asked for the visit because he is worried about Verity's languishing spirits and poor health. The novel concludes with a moment of triumph for Demelza when she and Ross are invited to Trenwith for Christmas; the guests are charmed by her singing, poise and wit. She is pregnant, but Ross doesn't yet know. * Tom Carne, father of Demelza and a widower. He has six sons. Carne strongly objects to his daughter taking up a position as a kitchen maid in the home of Ross Poldark, believing that she has been seduced or tricked into the arrangement. He attempts to secure her return to his household; at least two fights break out over this. * Jim Carter and Jinny Martin, who marry during the novel. Ross takes an interest in helping this young couple; this includes giving them a home rent-free in Mellin and a job at Nampara as a farm laborer. Prior to their marriage, Jinny attracts the unwelcome interest of Reuben Clemmow. Her family asks Ross to intervene to protect her. He speaks to Reuben and asks him to leave Mellin. After Jim and Jinny are married and have their first child, Jim's health declines and he takes up poaching. One night when he is gone, Reuben Clemmow reappears, invades her home, and stabs Jinny and the baby. They survive, but Reuben dies in the altercation. Jim is later caught in the act of poaching. Ross speaks up for him in court. This does not endear Ross to the local gentry. It leads to a somewhat reduced, but still very significant prison sentence. Jinny is hired by Ross and Demelza Poldark to work at Nampara while Jim is in prison. * Reuben Clemmow. Clemmow is a tenant of the Nampara estate who takes an unwelcome interest in Jinny Martin. He dies while attacking Jinny and her baby. * George Warleggan. George is the grandson of a country blacksmith. He is the son of Nicholas and Mary Warleggan. Nicholas becomes wealthy from building up a smelting works in Truro. George is introduced in the novel at the wedding of Francis and Elizabeth as \\"a name that was to become famous in mining and banking circles.\\" He grows close to Francis and Elizabeth Poldark, who often visit his home. Francis is led into gambling by George; this results in a significant amount of gambling debt. By the end of the novel, Francis owes an amount to George equal to half of the value of his estate. * Captain Andrew Blamey, who is first introduced as \\"master of one of the Falmouth-Lisbon packets\\". He falls in love with Verity Poldark, and she with him. He was previously married, and an alcoholic. His first wife died when he was drunk and pushed her. When Verity's family learns of this, they forbid her to see him. Verity asks Ross if she can visit with Blamey at Nampara. He reluctantly agrees. Charles and Francis Poldark learn of these visits; on one of them, they confront the couple. Francis insults Blamey and Blamey insults him back. This leads to a duel during which Francis receives a non-life-threatening injury. Verity renounces Blamey and returns to a life of quiet and increasingly depressed spinsterhood at Trenwith, still very much in love with Blamey. Settings and mines=Settings * Truro. Truro is Cornwall's only city. In \\"Ross Poldark\\", it is described as \\"A port and coinage town, the shopping center and a meeting place of fashion, the town had grown rapidly in the past few years, new and stately houses having sprung up among the disorderly huddle of old ones to mark its adoption as a winter and town residency by some of the oldest and most powerful families in Cornwall.\\" * Trenwith House. Trenwith is occupied by the Charles Poldark branch of the family, including his children Francis and Verity, and Aunt Agatha. Ross, coming within sight of Trenwith, \\"reflected again on the inevitable failure of his father to build anything to rival the mellow Tudor comeliness of the old home\\" which gave an impression \\"of having been put up when money was free and labor cheap\\". It was built in 1509. * Nampara House. Nampara is the homestead and estate inherited by Ross Poldark from his father Joshua. It is about three miles from Trenwith and is considerably more modest. * Mellin. This is a \\"cluster of cottages\\" situated on Nampara. The occupants are tenants of Ross Poldark and it is first encountered in the novel in this way: \\"There Ross went in search of cheap labor.\\" * The village of Sawle. Sawle is near \\"the shallow inlet of the bay\\" and includes two fish-packing houses. It is also where Sawle Church is located; this is where Ross and Demelza are married. Mines :: See also: Mining in Cornwall and Devon * Grambler Mine. When it is first introduced, Grambler is described this way: \\"It was the mine around which the varying fortunes of the main Poldark family centered. On its vagaries depending not merely the prosperity of Charles Poldark and his family but the subsistence level of some three hundred miners and their families scattered in huts and cottages about the parish.\\" Grambler is a copper mine. * Wheal Maiden. Wheal Maiden has been played out for forty years. * Wheal Leisure. This mine sits on the boundary between Nampara and the neighboring property of the Treneglos family. It was historically mined for tin. At the beginning of Book Two of \\"Ross Poldark\\", Poldark and five local businessmen decide to invest in efforts to determine whether copper can be found in the mine. * Wheal Grace, described as \\"the mine from which had come all [Ross's] father's prosperity and into which it had all returned.\\" Citations Category:Cornish culture Category:Novels set in Cornwall Category:1945 British novels Category:History of Cornwall ","title":"Ross Poldark (novel)"},{"id":"64303656","text":"Arb√´r Mehmetllari (born 19 April 2000) is an Albanian professional footballer who currently play as a centre forward for Albanian club Luft√´tari, on loan from Croatian club Lokomotiva.

Born in Candor, New York, she attended the New York State normal school and became a teacher. After teaching briefly, in 1913, she entered Cornell University and earned a degree in Domestic Science. While in school, she founded and managed the Cornell Women's Review. After graduation in 1917, she became a food conservation demonstrator for the New York Extension Service and then returned after a year to teach and manage the publications office for the Extension Service at Cornell. Moving to New York City in the early 1920s, Blinn became a research editor for The Delineator and a designer for the Delineator Home Institute. She designed the kitchen remodel for Dartington Hall in Devon, England, though only part of her plan was utilized. In 1935 she became an associate editor with the Ladies' Home Journal and remained with them until her retirement in 1952. A noted feature series she was involved in during her tenure was a project which remodeled and renovated kitchens of celebrities like Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and Edna St. Vincent Millay and Eugen Boissevain. In 1944, she became the sixth woman ever elected to serve on the Board of Trustees of Cornell and served through the early 1950s. Early life and education Alice M. Blinn was born on April 18, 1889, in Candor, Tioga County, New York, to Mary S. (n√©e Kenyon) and Samuel E. Blinn. After graduating from Candor High School, she attended the New York State Normal School in Cortland. After completing her teacher certification, Blinn taught briefly before enrolling in the College of Home Economics at Cornell University in 1913. While she was in school she met Margaret Cuthbert, who would become her life partner and in 1915, founded and served as the managing editor of the Cornell Women's Review. Career Faculty of the department of home economics about 1918‚Äì19. Blinn is in the back row, third from the right After graduating in 1917 with a Bachelor of Science degree, Blinn worked for Chenango County, as a food conservation agent. After one year, she became a teacher back at Cornell, for the New York Extension Service, which was a partnership between the US Department of Agriculture and Cornell. From 1919, Blinn also headed the publicity and publication for the extension service and produced pamphlets for consumers. Though she remained in charge of the Office of Publications and News Service for the Extension until 1926, Blinn moved to New York City and worked as a consumer consultant with an advertising agency, Barton Durstine and Osborne until 1925, Cuthbert, who had been working in Washington D. C., moved to New York around the same time, and the two women resumed their relationship, moving into an apartment together with Cuthbert, Cuthbert's mother, and a housekeeper. In 1925, Blinn became an associate research editor with The Delineator and a designer for the Delineator Home Institute. During that time, she served as the director of the Cornell Women's Club from 1927 through 1928 and then as a governor of the American Woman's Association from 1932 to 1940. In 1928, Blinn was contacted by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst to design a kitchen for Dartington Hall in Devon, England. The Elmhirsts had bought the derelict estate in 1925, with the idea of creating a model industrial village with a farm, school, manufacturing facilities, as well as entertainment venues for the arts and sporting events. Blinn prepared a report giving an overview of initiatives that could be implemented to improve the domestic activities of the village, including education, apprenticeship programs, a laboratory, as well as a modern kitchen, cafeteria, laundry, and lavatories, with modern equipment and plumbing, based on what was available in a modern American home. Unable to persuade Blinn to move to England and operate a training center, Elmhirst abandoned the plan of a demonstration kitchen. Because the wife of the headmaster did not like the efficient kitchen design, Blinn's recommended equipment was arranged in a typical English manner. Blinn left The Delineator at the end of 1934 and joined the Ladies' Home Journal in 1935 as an associate editor. In addition to magazine work, she was a regular speaker to educational and women's groups. She was the director of the Federation of Cornell Women's Clubs from 1937 through 1939 and in 1941 joined the University Council as a representative of the College of Home Economics. She received the American Woman's Association's Anna W. Porter Memorial Award in 1939. In 1944, she was elected to the board of trustees for Cornell, as the second woman to serve on the board at that time. When World War II ended, the Ladies' Home Journal did a series of articles on kitchens, traveling through Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. They selected different home styles, from apartments to mansions to represent a broad section of American living and improved them by remodeling and renovation. They did feature articles on the kitchens of celebrities, like Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. Blinn worked with the designer-decorator C. Eugene Stephenson to create the layouts and select the appliances. The series also designed the kitchen remodel of Steepletop, home of Blinn's friends Edna St. Vincent Millay and her husband Eugen Boissevain, which was featured in the magazine in 1947. Blinn and Cuthbert both retired in 1952 and moved to Captiva, Florida. They wintered in Florida and spent their summers on Cape Cod, until Cuthbert's death in 1968. Death and Legacy Blinn died on January 20, 1982, in Salisbury, Litchfield County, Connecticut. A collection of the letters she and Cuthbert exchanged with Millay, Boissevain, and their family members from 1924 to 1965 are housed at Vassar College. Blinn left bequests to the Cornell Plantations and established a book purchasing endowment for the Cornell Library Association in Cuthbert's name.

She was a leading suffragette who founded the National Land Council which trained women during the first world war to work on the land. After the war she championed the rights of Palestine and resisted the rise of Bolsheviks. Life Broadhurst was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock in 1860. Her parents were Maria (born Hutchinson) and William Broadhurst and she was their first born. Her father was a city councillor in Manchester and a bookkeeper and accountant. She came to notice before the first world war as a leader in the women's suffrage movement. She and Margaret Milne Farquharson had been the salaried Liverpool organisers for the Women's Freedom League, but the WFL failed to establish a voice distinct from the WSPU despite some novel campaigning. Money was requested for a full time organiser but the posts were not supported after January 1909. In 1911 she formed the National Political League which was an apolitical group supporting reform. Suffragette and funder Janie Allan, socialist Ethel Annakin Snowden, suffragette Laura Ainsworth, MP George Lansbury and John Scurr were amongst the league's supporters. She was the President and Margaret Milne Farquharson was the secretary and the NPL was based in St James Street in London. Women being trained by the National Land Council in 1916 During the war the NPL created the National Land Council. This body created eleven locations in Britain where women could be trained to work on the land. The National Political League changed its name in 1917 to the National Political Reform League. By 1922 the NPL had aligned themselves with supporting the Palestinians and Arabs in general. Broadhurst wrote a nationalistic letter to the Times and to parliament. It would appear that the NPL were supporting the Arab cause as they objected to the UK governments support for Zionism and they wanted to resist that and the rise of Bolshevikism. The NPL was funded by leading Muslims and UK government cabinet members were advised to avoid it. It was trying to undermine or overturn the Balfour Declaration. Broadhurst died in 1928. From 1929 the NPL continued its work and it was in touch with the Muslim‚ÄìChristian Alliance of Palestine.

Kuldƒ´ga Castle regiments gathered here, where they were provided with food and ammunition. The Kuldiga Command was one of the most populous in Livonia. In 14th century there were 5 city courts in Kuldƒ´ga municipality: Aizpute, Alsunga, Durbe, Kuldƒ´ga and . Each castle district was further divided into villages and villages divided in farmsteads.Armin Tuulse. Die Burgen in Estonia and Latvia. Dorpater Estnischer Verlag, 1942 As Kuldƒ´ga was located on the Livonia - Prussia road, it was the duty of the commander to welcome high guests of the order at Prussia's borders, to receive him in the castle and to continue to Riga.  Palace of the Dukes of Courland  After the establishment of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, Kuldƒ´ga Castle became one of the residences of the after 1575. After the death of the first duke Gotthard Kettler in 1587, his sons Friedrich Kettler and Wilhelm Kettler decided to divide the duchy into two parts, and Wilhelm became the ruler of the Kurland part with a seat in Kuldiga Castle. On October 28, 1610, in Kuldƒ´ga Castle, he had a son Jacob, but the son's mother Duchess Sophie of Prussia died soon after giving birth. Duke Wilhelm held a luxurious funeral for his wife and buried the deceased on December 26 in the basement of Kuldiga Castle. In November 1613, Duke Wilhelm solemnly received the Duke of Pomerania, Philip Julius, in Kuldiga. After the conflict with the representatives of the Kurzeme nobility, on April 4, 1617, in the Kurzeme Landtag, which met at the , Duke Wilhelm was deprived of the title of duke and permanently deported from the duchy. After coming to power, Duke Jacob chose Jelgava as his main residence, in 1543 he ordered the remains of his mother to be transferred to Jelgava Castle. In 1652, Duke Jacob appointed , the former Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Duke of Courland, to the court of King Louis XIV of France. Description of Kuldiga Castle inventory in 1656 Second Northern War 1658. In November, the Swedish invaders, led by Field Marshal Douglas, went to Kuldiga after being captured by Aizpute, who was defended by only 200 men - Kuldiga housewives and Lithuanian soldiers. 1658. At the end of December the castle capitulated. Although the Swedes had promised not to rob us by accepting the capitulation, the promise was not kept. All the property, archives, church equipment, horses and grain stores kept in the duke's and nobles' palace were hijacked. The rich loot was taken to Riga. Then until 1660 Kuldiga remained in the hands of the Swedes. Then the castle was handed over again to the troops of Duke Jacob. The duke's allies - the Poles and the Brandenburgers - were not much different from the enemies, as Kuldƒ´ga and the castle looted the last one left after the Swedish robbery. The castle archive was partially destroyed and partly taken away, however, Kuldƒ´ga Castle, unlike many others Kurzeme was not destroyed. Duke Jacob visited it 1660. in August and ordered repairs. In 1664-1666, the duke could already settle here. The Duchess also moved in [Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg  Louise Charlotte], who was solemnly greeted in the Anna field near Kuldiga by pathetically armed housewives, which testified to the city 's scarcity. The Duchess did not stay here long in 1668. However, the castle was put in order, and the rooms were re - painted with silk and wool wallpaper. In later years, Duke Jacob often stayed here with his whole family. Construction work on the castle resumed with a new scope. This is evidenced by the Governor of Kuldƒ´ga . Report to the Duke of 10 May 1678 that more than 50 000 tiles, 8 to 10 000 bricks and 10 000 floor tiles have been prepared for the construction of the castle. Jacob's son Frederick Casimir Kettler, who became the duke after his father's death 1681, also stayed at Kuldƒ´ga Castle every year. On 12 July 1691, Kuldƒ´ga received the Duke Frederick Casimir Kettler and his new wife, Brandenburg, Princess Elizabeth Sofia. Before that, wallpapers were procured for the as yet unpainted castle premises, which the townspeople brought back from in 5 large carts. Duke Frederick Casimir visited Kuldiga Castle every year, although not always for a long time. He stayed here the longest in the winter of 1693, when the construction of the zoo was completed, and in the summer of 1695, when the castle underwent major repairs. On May 4 1693, the duke ordered the repair of the bridges and walls of Kuldƒ´ga Castle damaged by the floods.  18th century: the destruction  At the beginning of 1701 approaching the danger of Great Northern War the regent of Kurzeme and the later duke Ferdinand Kettler ordered all the luxuries, furniture and wallpaper from Kuldƒ´ga castle to be supplied to Mƒìmele (Klaipƒóda), this was done so in June of the same year in 18 large carts accompanied by three ducal guards. From Mƒìmele, Duke Ferdinand went to Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk), where he stayed until 1738. It is possible that somewhere in Poland or Germany the remains of the ancient glory of Kuldiga Castle are still stored. On August 22, Swedish Chief Lieutenant Rotlieb settled in the castle with 450 dragoons. Everything that had not yet been taken away was looted by the Swedes, and so thoroughly that King Charles XII, who 1702. From 17 to 27 January, he stayed in Kuldiga, could not settle in the castle, but moved into the later mayor on Baznƒ´cas Street. Occupied castle until 1707. was inhabited by Swedish officers. 1708 and 1709. Russian soldiers also destroyed and looted to such an extent that most of the castle after that was uninhabitable. Some of the furniture was taken into storage by the owners of Kuldiga. 1711. The Duchy 's government ordered the surviving objects to be placed in a locked room on the third floor opposite the duke' s apartments. After the Great Northern War, the castle was no longer inhabited and began to collapse. Kuldƒ´ga Castle suffered the same fate as most of the medieval castles of Kurzeme after the Great Northern War. Although the damage of the war was not great, the castles, which were not needed by the duke living abroad or the nobles of Kurzeme, were not inhabited and repaired. What had not been destroyed by the enemies was destroyed in a short time by rain, frost and mold. Abandoned castles, which were located near larger settlements, were not very lucky - the inhabitants used them as quarries. The superintendent moved with his chancellery to a house in the city. The castle mill collapsed the fastest. On 15 August 1713, Duke Ferdinand Kettler ordered them to be offered to the housekeepers of Kuldiga for rent, but due to the poor condition of the mill, no one wanted it. 1717\\\\. The roof of the northern wing of the castle was invaded in 1727. The gate tower, the forecourt buildings and part of the outer wall had already collapsed. There were still some cannons on the walls. Useful windows and doors from the buildings were removed and delivered to Kuldƒ´ga Manor. The rafters of the roof of Castel were completely rotten, the roof of one of the towers fell, and the castle church was completely ruined. The only inhabitant of the castle was a guard who lived in a log house in the courtyard of the forecourt. 1729\\\\. The hall of the castle convent, called the ship hall, collapsed in 1743. The outer wall of the northern hull collapsed in. However, not all the castle's life was lost. In a locked and sealed room on the second floor stored things from the dilapidated castle church and the duke's rooms: many wood carvings, including the duke's coat of arms, doors, painting pedestals and decorative columns, 16 paintings, robes, chairs and tables, carved bed parts, trays, trays frames, torn gilded leather wallpaper and various stuff. The locked arsenal still contained a large number of weapons: 1,014 muskets, 12 carbines, 64 unusable muskets, rifle parts, cold weapons: partisans, spades, ashes, bullet molds, as well as plowshares, perches, iron pots. Property stored in the castle 1743. In 1769, the clerk of the court of the governor of Kuldƒ´ga deposited it with the widow of the castle guard, but 1769.  19th century and since: the ruins  In 1801, Goldingen Castle was already a ruins with towering walls. Kuldƒ´ga Governor von Zaks ordered the demolition of the castle ruins. In the drawing of Kuldƒ´ga in 1826, the castle ruins are no longer depicted, which indicates that the castle ruins had already disappeared from the earth surface. In the 1960s, Kuldƒ´ga city authorities established a city park on the territory of castle ruins.  Characteristics of the Ducal Palace  A drawbridge and a large double gate in the large gate tower led to the forecourt of Ducal Palace. On the first floor of the tower, under which there was a basement, there was a guard, on the second floor - the living quarters of the mayor. The gates of the old bridge over the Venta from the suburb were also preserved. The long two-storey building along the Venta, which was directly attached to the gate tower, housed the chancellor's court and servants' premises, the cash desk, the chancellery, the apartments of the court prosecutor, the finance manager and the pastor, the kitchen and the arsenal. A round powder tower stood in the southeast corner of the forecourt. On the southern side, during the dukes, an arena and a brick hall were built, as well as a large duke's horse stable with 36 windows and 72 stalls. Also on the side of the forecourt, on the side of the present Kalna Street, inside the wall was a relatively large two-storey building, which housed the lower servants of the court: horsemen and butlers, as well as cattle barns and a stable stable. Separately, there was a smithy on this side, as well as bakeries and new brewery buildings. The watermill operated on the north side, next to the gate tower. There was a wooden sauna in the castle garden behind the southern wall. Below the duke's family residence - the castle - there was a cellar with an entrance from the courtyard. To the right of the castle gate opening, a door led to the basement, to the left - to the prison (the present surviving vaulted room on the ground floor). The vaulted rooms on the first or ground floor had a food barn, a storage and wine cellar, as well as a drink manager's apartment. The doors of the upper floors of Castella led from the two-storey gallery. A parade staircase led from the castle courtyard to the duke's living quarters on the second or main floor on the Venta side. The doors of the high living rooms and the common bedroom of the dignitaries were decorated with wood carvings, the rooms were luxuriously furnished: white glazed tiled stoves, chairs draped with leather and velvet, a mirror, an octagonal stone table. The duchess's rooms gave access to the Great Hall, most likely the former Knights' Chapter Hall in the northern corps. In addition to several smaller rooms, the second floor had a large dining room (presumably in the southern building) and a castle church. It housed an altar with two large brass candlesticks, a pulpit, a pulpit covered in white and black velvet, a wood-carved, gilded baptismal font, a duke's seat in front of the altar decorated with wood carvings, and a balcony with an organ.  The zoo  In 1690 Duke Frederick Casimir Kettler ordered to build a zoo in the south of the castle garden Venta s shore was. As the territory belonging to the castle was too small for him, the Duke until 1693. bought land from Kuldiga landlords for 2400 dallers. Trees were planted in the zoo, it was covered by a fence of 882 sections. Reindeer were raised in the garden and hunted there by the dukes and their guests. 1691. A special hunting lodge was built in the garden in. After the Great Northern War in 1710 there were only about 20 deer left in the zoo, which was supervised by the Duke 's official - a garden supervisor who lived in a house at the end of the zoo. The house was still visible in the early 1930s. In 1720 the widow of the Duke of Courland Anna of Russia ordered the remaining deer to be taken to Saint Petersburg. As the relocation took place in the autumn, all but one deer died along the way. In 1780 territory of the zoo was transferred to the manor of the Duke of Kuldiga. The name Kuldƒ´ga - Bird Garden has been preserved as a testimony to the former duke's zoo. In ancient times in Kurzeme, birds were called not only flying creatures, but also four-legged creatures.

He drew on memories, dreams and observations, pulling out of himself the feelings and imagery which moved and excited him and channeling them into his multi-facetted body of work. He particularly enjoyed commissions and delighted in rising to such occasions, whether they be book illustrations or murals.  Biography  Louis de Niverville was born in England but his Canadian parents, √âm√©la No√´l and Albert de Niverville, brought him to Canada when he was a one-year-old to live in Montreal. Over time, there were 13 children in the family: he was the fifth from the last. When he was six years old, he was hospitalized for five years (1939-1944) due to spinal tuberculosis. He attributed much of the fantasy of his later work to his habit of fantasizing during this period of his life. In 1953, the family moved to Ottawa where, in 1957, de Niverville worked as an office clerk for the Federal Department of Transport. He has written that he was introduced to visual art by the witty illustrations in Saul Steinberg's book All in Line (1945). In 1957, encouraged by freelance art director Paul Arthur he came to Toronto, and found work as a freelance illustrator for Mayfair magazine, then joined the graphic art department of the Canadian Broadcasting Company, working there with Graham Coughtry and Dennis Burton under the direction of David Mackay, art director. His real start as an artist came in 1967 when he did a mural for Expo theatre in Montreal, he believed. Critics often described his work as surreal. His tone varied from the witty to the acerbic, and he addressed subjects as varied as recollections, observations or dreams, and even embellishments on a given word, such as the two monumental paintings titled Folly (c.1979), painted for his friend Toller Cranston, the Olympic skater and fellow artist. Of his working process, he said that his work often started with one very small idea, an impulse and that he just played around with ideas that developed. Morning Glory, a mural by de Niverville at Toronto's Spadina station His participation in one-person and group exhibitions were many and numerous. He had two museum retrospectives, both at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa. The first, in 1978, showed 20 years of his paintings and travelled to 13 Canadian museums including the Art Gallery of Ontario and Montreal Museum of Fine Arts; the second, in 1997, was of his collages. In 2007, Ingram Gallery in Toronto held a third retrospective. His commissions include two murals for Toronto International Airport (1963), one for the atrium of The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto) (1993), and one for the Toronto Transit Commission, located at Spadina station, titled Morning Glory. He also created a mural for Patrick Lannan in 1979 which was in the Lannan apartment in New York but moved later to the Lannan Foundation, Palm Beach and still later, was donated to the Dennos Museum Centre in Traverse City, Michigan. He also had commissions for books which he illustrated such as The Fully Processed Cheese and the film Lady B. He lived in Toronto from 1957 to 1988, when he moved to Vancouver, BC, then lived in the West until 2005 when he moved back to Ontario, to Oakville. De Niverville met his partner, Tom Miller, at a party in 1981; they were in a relationship for 37 years, until de Niverville's death. In autumn 2018, de Niverville was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. He died at his home in Oakville on February 11, 2019, from cancer.

Definitions = Prerequisits  A bornology on a set X is a collection ‚Ñ¨ of subsets of X such that 1. ‚Ñ¨ covers X (i.e. X = \\\\cup_{B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}} B); 2. ‚Ñ¨ is stable under inclusion (i.e. if B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨ then every subset of B belongs to ‚Ñ¨); 3. ‚Ñ¨ is stable under finite unions (or equivalently, the union of any two sets in ‚Ñ¨ also belongs to ‚Ñ¨). in which case the pair (X, ‚Ñ¨) is called a bounded structure. Elements of ‚Ñ¨ are called ‚Ñ¨-bounded sets or simply bounded. A subset ùíú of a bornology ‚Ñ¨ is called a base or fundamental system of ‚Ñ¨ if for every B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨, there exists an A ‚àà ùíú such that B ‚äÜ A. Given a collection ùíÆ of subsets of X, the smallest bornology containing ùíÆ is called the bornology generated by ùíÆ. If (X, ùíú) and (Y, ‚Ñ¨) are bounded structures and f: X -> Y is a map then f is called locally bounded or just bounded if the image under f of every ùíú-bounded set is a ‚Ñ¨-bounded set; that is, if for every A ‚àà ùíú, f(A) ‚àà ‚Ñ¨. If (X, ùíú) and (Y, ‚Ñ¨) are bounded structures then the product bornology on X √ó Y is the bornology having as a base the collection of all sets of the form A √ó B, where A ‚àà ùíú and B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨. One may show that a subset of X √ó Y is bounded in the product bornology if and only if its image under the canonical projections onto X and Y are both bounded.  Vector bornology  Let X be a vector space over a field ùîΩ, where ùîΩ has a bornology ‚Ñ¨ùîΩ. A bornology ‚Ñ¨ on X is called a vector bornology if its vector spaces operations of addition and scalar multiplication are bounded maps. Explicitly, this means that when X is endowed with the bornology ‚Ñ¨ then: 1. the addition map X √ó X -> X defined by (x, y) ‚Ü¶ x + y is a bounded map, where X √ó X has the product bornology, and 2. the scalar multiplication map ùîΩ √ó X -> X defined by (s, x) ‚Ü¶ sx is a bounded map, where ùîΩ √ó X has the product bornology induced by (ùîΩ, ‚Ñ¨ùîΩ) and (X, ‚Ñ¨). Usually, ùîΩ is either the real or complex numbers, in which case we call a vector bornology ‚Ñ¨ on X a convex vector bornology if ‚Ñ¨ has a base consisting of convex sets.  Characterizations  Suppose that X is a topological vector space (TVS) over the field ùîΩ of real or complex numbers and ‚Ñ¨ is a bornology on X. Then the following are equivalent: 1. ‚Ñ¨ is a vector bornology; 2. addition and scalar multiplication are bounded maps. 3. the balanced hull of every element of ‚Ñ¨ is an element of ‚Ñ¨ and the sum of any two elements of ‚Ñ¨ is again an element of ‚Ñ¨.  Bornology on a topological vector space  If X is a topological vector space (TVS) then the set of all bounded subsets of X from a vector bornology on X called the von Neumann bornology of X, the usual bornology, or simply the bornology of X and is referred to as natural boundedness. In any locally convex TVS X, the set of all closed bounded disks form a base for the usual bornology of X. Unless indicated otherwise, it is always assumed that the real or complex numbers are endowed with the usual bornology.  Topology induced by a vector bornology  Suppose that X is a vector space over the field ùîΩ of real or complex numbers and ‚Ñ¨ is a vector bornology on X. Let ùí© denote all those subsets N of X that are convex, balanced, and bornivorous. Then ùí© forms a neighborhood basis at the origin for a locally convex TVS topology.  Examples = Locally convex space of bounded functions  Let ùîΩ be the real or complex numbers (endowed with their usual bornologies), let (T, ‚Ñ¨) be a bounded structure, and let LB(T, ùîΩ) denote the vector space of all locally bounded ùîΩ-valued maps on T. For every B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨, let p_{B}\\\\left( f \\\\right) := \\\\sup \\\\left f\\\\left( B \\\\right) \\\\right for all f ‚àà LB(T, ùîΩ), where this defines a seminorm on X. The locally convex TVS topology on LB(T, ùîΩ) defined by the family of seminorms \\\\left{ p_{B} : B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\right} is called the topology of uniform convergence on bounded set. This topology makes LB(T, ùîΩ) into a complete space.  Bornology of equicontinuity  Let T be a topological space, ùîΩ be the real or complex numbers, and let C(T, ùîΩ) denote the vector space of all continuous ùîΩ-valued maps on T. The set ‚Ñ∞ of all equicontinuous subsets of C(T, ùîΩ) forms a vector bornology on C(T, ùîΩ).

She is a professor of Biomedical Sciences at Imperial College London, where she leads the Crystallization Group in Computational and Systems Medicine. She is best known for developing the microbatch method and inventing novel nucleants for protein crystallization which have been applied to high-throughput screening for rational drug design.  Education and career  Chayen earned her first degree in pharmacy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. During her undergraduate studies, she visited the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology to learn histochemistry. She subsequently pursued MSc and PhD research at the Kennedy Institute. In 1983, Chayen submitted her thesis on stimulus-response coupling in smooth muscle cells and received a PhD from Brunel University London. Chayen began her first postdoctoral fellowship at Imperial College London, where she studied the biophysics of muscle proteins. When her grant was not renewed, she joined the lab of David Mervyn Blow to develop novel protein crystallization techniques. There, she began her influential work of utilizing phase diagrams to optimize conditions for crystal growth. Currently, Chayen is a professor of Biomedical Sciences and head of the Crystallization Group in Computational and Systems Medicine at Imperial College London.  Research  Chayen is best known for her invention of novel protein crystallization methods. In 1990, she first published a method of suspending droplets of protein solution and precipitant solutions in low-density paraffin oil to prevent evaporation during the microbatch crystallization process. The microbatch process can be suitable for membrane proteins, which are ordinarily difficult to crystallize. Chayen's method has since been applied towards the analysis of many biomolecules that are relevant to human diseases such as cancer, HIV, diabetes, and heart disease. In addition to her work on microbatch methods, Chayen invented a novel gel-glass nucleant now known as \\"Naomi's Nucleant.\\" Naomi's Nucleant has been used to crystallize more than 20 proteins, the most of any single nucleant. In 2015, she collaborated with Subrayal Reddy at University of Central Lancashire to develop the first non- protein nucleant, a semi-liquid molecularly imprinted polymer designed for high-throughput screening. The nucleant was commercialized as \\"Chayen Reddy MIP.\\" Chayen's current research interests include protein crystallization, structural biology, and structural genomics and proteomics.  Awards and honors  Chayen holds nine patents and has launched several commercial products for protein crystallization, such as \\"Chayen Reddy MIP\\" and \\"Naomi's nucleant.\\" In addition, she has won the following awards: * Women of Outstanding Achievement for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Commendation, WISE Campaign (2012) *Investigator of the Year, Select Biosciences Life Sciences Awards (2011) * Innovator of the Year, CWT everywoman in Technology Awards (2011) Chayen was the Sterling Drug Visiting Professor of Pharmacology at Yale School of Medicine in 2009.

Renown for his short lined poems who were in vogue before the early 20th century. Many of his poems are still known today  History  Originally from the Aden Yonis section of the Makahil Samaron (Gadabursi). A renown poet from the 19th century among the ranks of Adan Gurey and Mahamed Abdille Hassan (Sayidka). Ali Bu'ul has produced numerous poems that still to this day are read and presented at gatherings. He was born in the Awdal region in the district of Borama. He opposed the Abyssinians from taxing the Somali inhabitant in current area we know Somali region of Ethiopia. He was celebrated for his geeraar (a Somali term indicating a shorter version of poetry, shorter lines compared to conventional poetry or gabay). Geeraars are traditionally mostly recited during challenging times of war and battle. The Gadabursi were renown for praising their horses in their geeraar and echoing their name. Ali Bu'ul as a military leader he met the Sayyid or Mahamed Abdullah Hassan somewhere within the current borders the Somali region of Ethiopia. The Sayid was amazed to hear that the Gadabursi are known for praising their horses in their geeraar and echoing the horses in their names. The religious leaders Mahamed Abdullah decided to hear for himself and challenged Ali Bu'ul. They slinged insults and threats at each other. It was then that the famous poem Amaan Faras was recited by Ali Bu'ul while riding his horse, which till this day is taught in Somali schools and is widely known among the Somali people.

Already during his studies he participated in a field trial with young workers, which he documented and reflected in his book about youth work in the industrial world. In 1959 Kentler presented his first book publication about it (Youth Work in the Industrial World); in it \\"Christian faith bond ... still explicitly proclaimed\\" (so R√ºdiger Lautmann 2008 in his obituary on Kentler for the Humanistische Union), in later publications this was no longer the case. In 1960 he passed the main diploma examination for psychology.  Educational work for the Protestant Church, change to science  After completing his studies he initially worked as a youth education officer at the Evangelische Akademie Arnoldshain. Afterwards he worked from 1962 to 1965 as a research assistant and \\"first pedagogue\\" in the Studienzentrum Josefstal (protestant youth work) at Neuhaus am Schliersee. The theory of an emancipatory youth work, which he played a decisive role in developing, made him known nationwide.{} retrieved on 12 March 2012 The following year he was assistant to Klaus Mollenhauer at the PH Berlin. Afterwards he became head of the department for social pedagogy and adult education at the Pedagogical Centre Berlin and from 1967 to 1974 departmental director there. 1975 doctorate (PhD) he received his doctorate in Hanover with the dissertation Parents learn sexual education, which also appeared as a book and reached a total circulation of 30,000 copies by the 1990s. In 1976 he was appointed as a university lecturer for the training of vocational school teachers for special education at the University of Hanover, where he taught until his retirement in 1996.  Activities  Kentler was one of the advocates of an \\"emancipatory\\" youth work and counts among the representatives of sexual education of the 1960s and 1970s. In his work as a court expert and expert on child and adolescent sexuality, he achieved recognition in professional circles. From 1979 to 1982 he was president of the German Society for Social- Scientific Sexual Research, later he was on the advisory board of the Humanistische Union. He was also a member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sexualforschung. For Helmut Kentler, theory and practice belonged closely together throughout his life. His insights into a theory of emancipatory youth work grew out of his work with adolescents and young adults during his studies and the five years he spent working in church educational institutions. He made it possible to experience in theory and practice what group pedagogy and what team work as a trusting and respectful cooperation of pedagogues with different professional competence and what insight into psychosocial connections means for the learning and emancipation process for young people and adults.See: Youth work in the industrial world ‚Äì Consequences for youth work This was an innovation for church educational work in the 1960s. In addition to his professional duties, he also worked in various fields of pedagogical practice in an advisory and teaching capacity, for example from 1970 to 1974 on the pedagogical advisory board of the first Wohngemeinschaft for Trebeg√§nger and runaway F√ºrsorgez√∂glinge at Maxdorfer Steig, sponsored by the Berlin Senate.see: Neuer Rundbrief. Information on family, youth and sport, Berlin, 3/1970, 2/1972, 2/1974 During the student riots in Berlin, Kentler was temporarily active as a \\"psychological consultant for police issues\\".Berlin / Polizei: Feind im Innern, Der Spiegel, 7. August 1967 The sexual liberation attempts of Berlin students in communities and shared flats resulted in his advocacy of an emancipatory sexual education already at home,Parents learn sexual education, Rowohlt, 1975 which was also scientifically reflected in his dissertation in 1975 and made him an expert in sexual education in the further course of his professional life. At the end of the 1960s, in a model experiment, he placed several neglected 13 to 15-year- old boys, whom he considered \\"secondary mental defectives\\", with pedophiles he knew, in order to reintegrate them into society under their care and to allow them to grow into mature adults.Nina Apin, Astrid Geisler: Der Versuch. In: taz of 14 September 2013, retrieved on 26 July 2017. Due to the criminal offence associated with it, he made this public only after its statute of limitations more than a decade later. Kentler hoped that the experiment would help the young people to regain social stability through the men. He was aware, that the adults would most likely perform sexual acts on the minors. The scandal was publicly debated in 2015 and the Senate Youth Administration then commissioned the scientist Teresa Nentwig from the University of G√∂ttingen to investigate the incident and the responsibility of the authorities. At a factional hearing of the FDP in 1981 he reported: \\"These people only endured these moronic boys because they were in love, infatuated and infatuated with them.\\"Liberalism: FDP was more tolerant towards pedophiles than previously known, Spiegel Online, 1. September 2013. In an expert opinion for the Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Familie, Frauen und Jugend he described the results of the 1988 trial as \\"a complete success\\". At that time he did not have to fear any criminal consequences because of the statute of limitations. He also maintained contacts with the former participants during his teaching activities in Hanover and, in an expert opinion for the Berlin Family Court in the early 1990s, recommended that one of the abused youths continue to stay with his paedophile foster father, whom he described as a pedagogical natural talent.Jutta Rinas: Sexual abuse: The professor and the little boys, in: Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, 12 January 2018, p. 18 Kentler was single, homosexual and had three adoptive sons and one foster son. At the beginning of the 1990s, Kentler, having previously lived in a \\"huge, tall apartment in an old building\\" in Berlin, lived in the Gartenhofsiedlung in the Hannover district Marienwerder.Dagmar Albrecht (Ed.) et al.: Experiences of the inhabitants, in this: Today in Marienwerder. Ein Stadtteilbuch √ºber verschiedene Leute, historische Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten, Umwelt und Natur, 199 pages, with drawings by Gisela Blumenbach et al. and photographs by Kristin Beier et al., Hannover-Marienwerder: D. Albrecht, 1992, p. 25f.  Positions = Sexuality and Society  In Kentler's view, it is not enough that parents do not put obstacles in the way of their children's sexual desires; rather, parents should introduce their children to sexuality, because otherwise they \\"risk leaving them sexually underdeveloped, becoming sexual cripples\\".Parents learn sexual education, S. 32 Parents would bear a high degree of responsibility here: \\"Parents must be made aware that a good relationship of trust between children and parents cannot be maintained if children are denied the satisfaction of such urgent and urgent needs as sexual ones.\\"H. Kentler: \\"Sex education. 1970, p. 179 Early experiences of coitus are useful, because teenagers with coitus experience \\"demand an independent world of teenagers and more often reject the norms of adults\\".Kentler: Sexual Education, p. 171 One of Kentler's particular concerns was the reduction of sexual repression against girls: \\"Often the repressive education was so successful that they no longer feel any sexual pressure. A sexually open- minded boy then calls such a girl 'uptight', 'unfashionable' ‚Äì he is probably not so wrong about that.\\"Kentler: Sex Education, p. 173 Based on the realization that children can have sexual needs even before puberty, he clearly distinguished their free satisfaction among peers or with adults from sexual abuse of children: \\"Sexually satisfied children who have a good relationship of trust with their parents, especially in sexual matters, are best protected against sexual seduction and sexual attacks. \\"Parents learn sex education, p. 103 Kentler warned the parents against making too much of a problem of also involuntary sexual contacts of children with adults: \\"The wrong thing to do now would be for parents to lose their nerve, panic and run straight to the police. If the adult had been considerate and tender, the child could even have enjoyed sexual contact with him.Parents learn sexual education, pp. 103 f. Kentler considered equal and non-discriminatory sexual relationships between adults and children to be hardly problematic: \\"If such relationships are not discriminated against by the environment, then the more the older one feels responsible for the younger one, the more positive consequences for personality development can be expected\\", he wrote in 1974 in his foreword to the brochure Zeig mal!Zeig mal! Wuppertal 1974, foreword  Activity as court expert  Kentler also acted as a forensic expert in abuse cases. In 1997, he declared about the almost 30 cases he had dealt with up to that point: \\"I am very proud that so far all cases I have dealt with have been terminated with the discontinuation of proceedings or even acquittals. Kentler did not attribute injustice to the sexual activity of adults with children, but only to the violence that may have been used. This, however, is atypical, since real paedophiles do not use violence, but on the contrary are \\"highly sensitive to damage to children\\".Does the psycho wave roll over the law? In: Emma, Nov/Dec. 1997, p. 30‚Äì38 In 1999, Kentler announced a book publication about \\"the approximately 35 lawsuits against innocent people that I have accompanied as an expert witness,\\" but then left the manuscript (Parents Under Suspicion ‚Äì Of Sexual Abuse) unpublished.R√ºdiger Lautmann: Obituary for Helmut Kentler, on the website of the Humanistische Union; quoted after Sp√§th/Aden: Die missbrauchte Republik, p. 145, 148. In the same year he declared:  Reception  Kentler did not hide the fact that he placed young people with pederasts he knew, he reported about it in his book Leihv√§ter from 1989. After the magazine Emma had reported about it in 1993, he was shouted down by feminist activists at an event in Hannover in 1993 and received a punch in the face from a listener. Jan Feddersen praised Kentler in an obituary in the Tageszeitung' of 12 July 2008, as a \\"meritorious fighter for a permissive sexual morality\\".obituary of July 12, 2008 on taz.de Protestant-church authorities expressed a similar opinion. In an obituary the Study Centre for Protestant Youth Work pointed out Kentler's controversial positions, but nevertheless acknowledged his impulses for \\"institutional structure and professional socialisation\\" and the attempts to make homosexuality socially acceptable in the church. While the Working Group of Protestant Youth in Germany immediately removed the obituary after a synod motion, the Kentler Study Centre defended Kentler without addressing the misconduct for the protection of children from sexual exploitation, which was broadly presented in the motion. Rather, Helmut Kentler \\"has had a lasting influence on the conceptual development and the student research project in Josefstal to this day\\".Cf. www.evangelische-jugend.de (as of the beginning of 2010) and Sp√§th/Aden (2010), p. 147. The Humanist Union pays positive tribute to Person and life's work of Kentler. In her obituary it says: \\"A lighthouse of our advisory board has gone out. Like no other, Helmut Kentler embodied the humanistic task of an enlightened sex education, and he was also a role model for public science. (...) His habitus combined the qualities of competence, authenticity and closeness in a rare way, with which Kentler impressed his readers and listeners alike ... Since he immediately aroused sympathies, many have confided in him.\\"R√ºdiger Lautmann: Obituary for Helmut Kentler. In: Communications from the Humanist Union. Journal of Education and Civil Rights. Issue no. 202 (issue 3/2008) of 30 October 2008, p. 26‚Äì27. retrieved on 23 June 2013. Ursula Enders, the founder of the victim support association \\"Zartbitter\\", criticizes Kentler as a man with pedosexual-friendly positions.Ursula Enders: Is there an \\"abuse with the abuse?\\" In: Ursula Enders (Ed.): Zart war ich, bitter war's. Sexual Abuse Manual. 4th edition. Kiepenheuer & Witsch, Cologne 2009, , S. 454‚Äì469th (Chapter from the 2001 edition online) Stephan Hebel assessed in an editorial of the Frankfurter Rundschau in March 2010html Frankfurter Rundschau of 8 March 2010, viewed on 21 April 2013 a passage from Kentler's foreword to the 1974 brochure Zeig mal! as an \\"open call to paedophilia\\"; similarly Alice Schwarzer expressed herself in the magazine Emma'. The Protestant authors Andreas Sp√§th and Menno Aden also sharply attack Kentler in their book Die missbrauchte Republik ‚Äì Aufkl√§rung √ºber die Aufkl√§rer.Cf. literature (Sp√§th/Aden (eds.): Die missbrauchte Republik. S. 127‚Äì148) Due to an article by Ursula Enders in Emma in 1997 \\"at the last minute\\" Kentler was prevented from receiving the Magnus Hirschfeld Prize in 1997. He should receive the prize mainly for his commitment in the ecumenical working group Homosexuals and Church. In Die Zeit in October 2013 Adam Soboczynski critically examined Kentler. Soboczynski explained that Die Zeit had offered publication opportunities to the \\"pedophile-friendly scientist\\" at the end of the 1960s with a lack of sensitivity based on the connection between anti-fascism and sexual liberation, as Kentler had claimed in reference to Wilhelm Reich.Adam Soboczynski: Pedophile anti-fascism. In: The Time of 10 October 2013, p. 49 f. (online, accessed 23 March 2014). Georg Diez criticized this text in his column on Spiegel online: Soboczynski had neither taken Kentler seriously nor really analysed him. His text stands in the series of obsessive, confused settlements with the 68er-movement, he makes hardly provable, \\"tightly screwed assertions\\", for example that sexual liberation was regarded as an anti- fascist project.Georg Diez: The defilement of the 68ers, Spiegel online, 11 October 2013, access on 23 March 2014. In 2013, the political scientist Franz Walter from the G√∂ttingen Institute for Democracy Research, who at the time was investigating the former position of parts of the Greens and FDP on pedophilia, assigned Kentler a key role in German networks of pedophile activists.  Allegations against Kentler  It is clear that Kentler used his position to turn children over to a powerful pedophile network disguised as research.https://www.dw.com/en/germany-allowed-pedophiles-to-foster- children/a-53839291 In 2015, after public pressure, the Berlin Senate Administration commissioned a study from the political scientist Teresa Nentwig of the Institute for Democracy Research in G√∂ttingen on Kentler's pedosexual \\"experiment\\" conducted in Berlin in the late 1960s with the support of the Youth Welfare Office. In this context the Berlin Senator for Education Sandra Scheeres called the \\"experiment\\" at that time a crime in state responsibility.Olaf Wedekind, Berlin Senate mediated youths to convicted pedophiles, Berliner Zeitung, 2. December 2016 Affected persons, who had contacted the responsible senator in 2017, expressed their disappointment about the low support.Affected persons disappointed by the senate, DER SPIEGEL 7/2018 p. 24 In 2017/18, Nentwig was also commissioned in Lower Saxony to research the effects of Kentler. Kentler also dealt with young people with behavioural problems in Hanover, also had contacts with the youth welfare office in Hanover and on their behalf was supposed to provide scientific support for the first care of a lesbian couple, but this did not come about because the couple decided to withdraw from the care for personal reasons.Jutta Rinas: Paedophilia advocates taught at university. In: Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, 12 January 2018, p. 15. Whether Kentler himself was sexually assaulting young people, such as his foster and adopted sons or his tutoring students, is still an open question.Interview by Teresa Nentwig. In: Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, 12 January 2018, p. 18. In January 2018 the Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover announced that it had initiated further investigations into Kentler. \\"I am downright shocked that at that time the executive and the judiciary let themselves be swallowed up by it,\\" said President Volker Epping at the New Year's reception. \\"I am also completely irritated that the professional community of this acting Kentler did not comment, did not cry out!\\" Only after the completion of the project \\"The Role of the Sexologist in the Discourse on Pedosexuality ‚Äì for example Helmut Kentler\\", which was funded by the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture, did the university (nine years after Kentler's death) realise the extent of the case. The aim of the further investigation will be to examine the circumstances of Kentler's doctorate, appointment and work until his retirement. This also includes the behaviour of the university, faculty and department with regard to his person. For a proper processing of the case, contracts are awarded to external, independent persons.{, Press release of Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover of 17 January 2018Now an expert report sheds light on the responsibility of the University of Hannover. On 15 June 2020, a report prepared by scientists entitled \\"Helmut Kentler's Work in Berlin Child and Youth Services\\" was presented in Berlin.

He is said to be the first religious worker among the Burmese monks left for a foreign country to do Buddhist missionary work by living there for long years, to be exact, 14 consecutive years in England.. He served as a lecturer on Buddhist philosophy known as Abhidhamma at the University of Yangon, took part in compiling the Burmese-English dictionary, jointly working with Dr. Hla Pe, and wrote a few books in English and Myanmar. He is the one who translated Vibha·πÖga, the second part of Abhidhamma Pitaka, from Pali to English for the first time. He also worked as a librarian at Adyar Library of Theosophical Society Adyar and the library at Buddhist Society in London. He could give inspiration and brought many other Buddhist monks from Myanmar to a new level of Buddhist missionary work around the world. He travelled throughout the world to do a great number of talks on Buddhist teachings, particularly Abhidhamma, at a variety of universities and events.  Biography = Youth  He was born in 1896, in Badigon village, Pyawbwe Township in Myanmar, to parents, U Aye and Daw Htwe, who earned their living as farmers. Mg Khin, as his birth name, at the age of seven, would go to the village monastery called Badigon Vihara, where he learnt some Buddhist scriptures from the abbot Sayadaw U Kavinda. The Biography of U Thittila, p.7-9 His teacher U Kavinda took him to Mandalay to be made aware of a sermon on Abhidhamma. Afterwards he made up his mind to enter the monkhood.  Monkhood and learning  When he reached fifteen, he was ordained a novice (samanera) and had already knew a few Buddhist Suttas and other scriptures well and truly. In 1916, his full ordination occurred in Mawlamyine, under Sayadaw U Okkantha as his preceptor. The Biography of U Thittila, p.20,21 Before his full ordination, he had studied hard under the guidance of Sayadaw Ashin Adiccavamsa, a distinguished scholar lecturing at Masoyein monastery in Mandalay by then.The Biography of U Thittila, p.17 He succeeded in holding the Pathamagyaw title in 1918, after he ranked first in the Pathamagyi examination. In 1923, he passed the Sakyasƒ´ha examination held by the Pariyattisasanahita Association in Mandalay, one of the most difficult examinations then, and only four of one hundred and fifty candidates passed for that year. Anyone who passes this exam gains the honorific suffix (abhivamsa) so his name Thitila became Thitilabivamsa.The Biography of U Thittila, p.22 Afterwards he became an abbot of a monastery of three hundred monks. Additionally, he took charge of the education department of the monastery in Yangon established by his teacher Ashin Adiccavamsa.The Biography of U Thittila, p.24 He also learnt Buddhist scriptures under various scholar monks, both in Mandalay and Yangon. In those days the monastic community and many people who held firmly to conservative views condemned a monk learning English because it was once thought in Myanmar that English was not the academic work for a monk to do.The Biography of U Thittila, p.23,24 That was why Myanmar monks could not carry out as much work in the stream of Dhamma propagation in the West as those of Sri Lanka or Thailand, due principally to the language barrier. But he started to learn English with great diligence and got to understand English grammar to some extent.The Biography of U Thittila, p.27,28  Learning abroad  He travelled India with the sole purpose of learning Sanskrit and English in 1924. While studying at Shantiniketan University, India, he had to return to Myanmar for his bad health.The Biography of U Thittila, p.29,30 When he returned, his preceptor Sayadaw Adiccavamsa set off for India and England for further studies. While his teacher was absent, he took charge of the monastery. Six years after his return from India, he planned to go abroad for learning English but this time his choice of country was Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he spent two years. Then he moved to Madras (now Chennai), India again around 1934.The Biography of U Thittila, p.30-36 It was in Adyar where he was able to learn English from English people. There was a section of Theosophical Society in Adyar, and he made several tries at both becoming its member and staying there for the reason of learning English. Although, at first, he was denied membership in the Society, he got its membership when he was approved by the Yangon branch of the Society. Soon he became the librarian at its library, where he had a chance to learn library science, which was a basic necessity for a large monastery holding tons of books randomly placed on shelves.The Biography of U Thittila, p.37-38 During his stay there, he was elected president of the South India Buddhist Associations and contributed much to them. To brush up on his English and to study the English way of education, especially for children, he went to England in 1938, then he was invited by the secretary of London Buddhist Society to address a sermon on Dhamma, simply the teachings of Buddha. Despite lack of wider knowledge of English when he first arrived in England, his then skill in English was well enough to do the talks to the English audience. Then came his second talk at the Sorbonne University in Paris, entitled ‚ÄòWorld Fellowship Through Buddhism', at the invitation of Sir Francis Younghusband, president and founder of the World Congress of Faiths. After these two talks, he took an English proficiency course at the London Polytechnic.  Second World War  Unlike the East, the life of a Buddhist monk seemed novel to western communities. Ashin Thittila suffered hardships when the second world war started to spread in London on September 1939. Many people from Myanmar who had come to England for further studies returned to their homeland but Ashin Thittila, being stubborn and having missions to complete for which he had been there, did not make a homeward journey. The war got worse and worse, and he even lost contact with his country, Myanmar. Not a penny was even left to spend on food except for that day's lunch. He saw no way out of the very situation. At last, he swore an oath of fidelity to the Three Jewels or Gems: > I am the one who has a noble purpose and walks in the Truth with dogged > determination. By these words of truth, I wish I would get over these > troubles. The Biography of U Thittila, p.45,46 Soon after his oath, about 11 a.m, a kindly Christian clergyman, one of his acquaintances, came to him and asked him what he needed. When the clergyman knew his difficulties, he took him to the nearby restaurant and offered lunch, then gave shelter in his home. But When the air raids on London were frequent and more heavy, the clergyman, with Ashin Thittila, moved to Somerset, a rural country of England, where he had another large house. He told Ashin Thittila that he could stay there until the end of the war.The Biography of U Thittila, p.46 Ashin Nyanika (), a learned monk and author of Ashin Thittila‚Äôs biography, commented on this scene. > A manner of gentleness, a heart of sympathy and an act of empathy are gifts > of nature. Serving as members in their respective religious communities, > they work with people from all walks of life so the power of their natural > spirits gets higher and more mature. When the fact that they are religious > service personnel; one is a Christian clergyman and another is a Buddhist > monk, is added to this situation, brotherly love has just been developed. A > world of difference between the two religions cannot hamper the tie of their > friendship The Biography of U Thittila, p.47 The house was like a mansion, in which a room was given to him and he would have had a guilty conscience if he had stayed doing nothing so he helped as he could like switching off the lights when bombers were heard, cleaning the compound around the house while observing Buddhist codes of conduct (Vinaya). He also did voluntary work as a medical attendant for the injured during the war. This kind of social service, a practical form of sympathy and love, is highly praised by every Buddhas so he did very actively by staying at the rural house for about five months.The Biography of U Thittila, p.47-50  Social Services  BBC service in Burmese began in 1940 and it was broadcast only for a quarter of an hour. The service department asked Ashin Thittla for help to report the news in Burmese, where he did the broadcasting for two years. Although this was not a missionary work for a monk, he took up the duty based on common sense for the love of his nation and people.The Biography of U Thittila, p.50 In May 1946, he participated in compiling the Burmese-English Dictionary led by Dr. Steward, in which project he worked with Dr. Hla Pe. After the war, he visited people in hospitals, prisons and schools too.  Missionary Work in the West  When the war ended, he could fulfill his wish to spread the teachings of Buddha. And his talks returned to normal by the arrangement of many supporters. Two separate series of seventeen talks were performed at Workers' Educational Association. When London Buddhist Society founded in 1924 was restored in 1945 at the end of the war, Mr. Humphreys, president of the society, organized some talks for Ashin Thittila to deliver. Mr. Humphreys wrote about Ashin Thittila : > \\"The bhikkhu Thittila became of more and more service to the Society, > foreshadowing the time when, in September 1947 he would be able to give it > whole time, and became one of the leading figures in English Buddhism\\" Those talks of Ashin Thittila were only arranged by Mr. Humphreys, which were strictly kept to his schedule. So after some time, the Myanmar audience turned out to be displeased with the arrangements of Mr. Humphreys. To provide shelter and food for the monk, Myanmar Dayakas made an effort to build a monastery but in vain.The Biography of U Thittila, p.56-57 Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka is an eminent characteristic of Ashin Thittila‚Äôs knowledge of Dhamma. So he introduced it to the West by teaching Abhidhammattha-sangaha, for more than four years in a row, to a group who expressed their interest in Buddhist scriptures, especially in Abhidhamma, of which part they also requested to be taught. As a result his teaching of Abhidhamma could provide a solid foundation for those who were very enthusiastic about Dhamma. He was such a patient and skilful teacher and his way of teaching and explanation made his students understand better by giving examples from the Buddhist perspective in order for them to differentiate between religious and philosophical matters, of which they had found it difficult to understand in their traditional way. It was extremely hard for a Buddhist monk to live in the western countries, especially for a monk without having a shelter in a monastery. For these reasons, a group of nine Myanmar Kappiya (lay manciple) created a monastery called the Sasana Vihara in London to support Ashin Thittila for the sake of convenience. It was the first time he experienced the Eastern way of supporting the Sangha and could also get out of his struggle for survival. But after some time, unfortunately, donations to the Vihara did not even support a monk sufficiently. According to Mrs. Claudine W. Iggleden, the period of two years (March 1949- March 1951) saw his two hundred and fifty teaching engagements. As he was the only monk living in England at that time, he had many other things to do within the time available to him.  A lecturer on Abhidhamma  By the year 1952, the University of Yangon aimed to teach Abhidhamma studies as a philosophical subject, for which purpose it would need a skilful teacher to lecture. In long search of a Abhidhamma lecturer, for which position two striking conditions had to be met; he must have been a citizen of Myanmar and proficient in English language, the patrons of the university at last found Ashin Thittila through some contacts and invited him to take up the post to teach BA and MA students. U Hla Bu, head of Philosophy Department, raised an objection to the decision to teach Abhidhamma studies in the university, for any university on earth had not taught the subject. But his objection came to nothing because the chancellor and patrons were U Nu, the then prime minister and notable figures of Myanmar, who were Sir U Thwin and U Thein Maung, the Chief Justice of Supreme Court. Dr. Htin Aung, the rector, sent an official invitation letter.The Biography of U Thittila, p.161-163 Ashin Thittila at first accepted the appointment for six monthsThe Biography of U Thittila, p.163 or one year but he lectured on the studies in the university till his eighth consecutive year. A problem as to whether or not he should have been given a salary arose because of his dual role of being a bikkhu and lecturer, in that a bikkhu (Buddhist monk) cannot work like an ordinary person for a living. So the university authorities solved the very problem by donating an appropriate amount of money in the name of 'almsgiving'.The Biography of U Thittila, p.165-167  To Europe again  Two of his English students requested him to visit England to teach Abhidhamma again in 1964. While the subject was being taught, he translated the second part of Abhidhamma Pitaka, Vibha·πÖga, which was published, under the title of 'The Book of Analysis', by the Pali Text Society in 1969.tr U Thittila, 1969/1988, Pali Text Society, Bristol Again in 1982, at the age of 86 or 87, he went to England with Sitagu Sayadaw, both of whom were welcomed by Mrs. Claudine W. Iggleden, the author of his biography sketch in the book, 'Essential Themes of Buddhist Lectures'. She made her home in a village near Reading (about 8 miles) for the stay of Ashin Thittila and two other monks, Ashin Nyanika, who came a month later after them, and Sitagu Sayadaw, both of whom arrived in United Kingdom for the first time. For convenience, she moved to stay at her relative's house because it is strictly restricted for a bikkhu not to share a place with a lady. He gave some talks in Oxford and Manchester. He did not go very far from the house due to his old age. Still he went to Scotland by plane to preach upon invitation.The Biography of U Thittila, p.205-210  Passing away  At the age of over 100, he passed away on 3 January 1997 while striving for much Buddhist missionary work both locally and internationally.  Activities on Dhamma = Talks around the world  When he first reached England in 1938, his very first talk on Dhamma was carried out upon the invitation of Mr. Humphreys, the secretary of the Buddhist Society in London. His second Dhamma talk, under the title of 'World Fellowship Through Buddhism', occurred at Sorbonne University in Paris, France. After the second world war, he gave a number of talks at Workers' Educational Association and at certain schools, where he was invited to do. At the invitation of the Association for Asian Studies at the University of Michigan, US, he travelled around the United States in 1959 and gave more than one hundred and sixty lectures at numerous universities and other meetings planned for that purpose, spending six months in the States. In Honolulu University alone, he had to deliver twelve talks, of which ten talks were on Abhidhamma. He then visited Toronto in Canada. He went to Australia three times after his missionary work in England. In April 1954, for the first time he arrived in Australia and made a talk at Sydney university, where about three hundred students as attendees came to listen with interest.The Biography of U Thittila, p.148 But life is full of things, good and bad. he met both warm welcome and unwelcome remarks and criticism of his arrival to preach. A reporter in The Sun-Herald newspaper wrote : There were also some good news about his arrival there. The second journey to Australia was from 19 May 1956 to 14 June 1956 and the last was from 29 December 1963 to 14 February 1964. He delivered many talks during those three visits.The Biography of U Thittila, pp.140-148 He toured Japan, where he had a chance to observe Zen Buddhism and meditation techniques and also could discuss with Zen masters. He visited many other Asian countries to do religious work, including Singapore, Hongkong, Indonesia, Cambodia, Nepal, Thailand, and European countries like Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Holland. Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and France to give talks upon invitations.  Classes  In the West, there were two types of groups who were interested in Buddhism in those days : *The first type was those who searched and read many other books on Buddhism to study because they had read certain English translated books on Buddhism and found interesting points in them. *The second was those who came to love Pali, the medium of sacred texts of Theraveda Biddhism or southern Buddhism, through learning ancient oriental languages such as Sanskrit and Pali = Course on Pali studies = It is certain that anyone who learns Pali meets Buddhist texts written in Pali so one in contact with this language would not be satisfied with the translations. In this way, one may change course through learning languages to Dhamma studies. To fulfil the above requirement, he gave a course on Pali language.The Biography of U Thittila, p.58 'A Practical Grammar of the Pali Language' by Charles Duroiselle and 'The new Pali course' by Polwatte Buddhadatta Thera were set as textbooks and Visuddhimagga was also made to be read together with its English translation. He taught the class by dividing a long Pali sentence up into short segments, explaining the rules of grammar, grammatical functions and meanings of texts from Majjhima NikƒÅya. He also asked his students to read some English translations, in which books he clearly explained to them, pointing out which part of translation was not sufficient to cover the original text, which part was unnecessary, how to make a literal translation and also how to interpret something written in Pali exactly. In the long run, just learning Pali was not to their satisfaction. Consequently, they requested Ashin Thittila to teach more.The Biography of U Thittila, p.99,100 = Course on NikƒÅya = While he was teaching Pali, he gave a Nikaya course for advanced-level students to take, starting from the Majjhima NikƒÅya, the collection of middle-length discourses of Buddha Dhamma. Then the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya, the collection of long discourses, was lectured. Through those texts, the students could learn social classes, way of life, ritual practises at the time of Buddha. Apart from his students, interested attendees came to study or discuss. Among them, there were some who did not accept the Buddhist concept of Anatta (non-self) or some were Christians who came to the class just for discussion. In teaching those Suttans, he related the subject matter to the Adhidhamma concept in order to make them understand better. The result was that a course on Abhidhamma happened to be given.The Biography of U Thittila, p.99-103 = Course on Abhidhamma studies = Ashin Thittila gave a series of lessons on Abhidhamma to his students, who were very enthusiastic about the studies. A few books like 'Abhidhamma Compendium' by U Shwe Zan Aung were set texts and 'A Manual of Abhidhamma' by Bikkhu Narada was the book to read and study. He always told them its background story, event and related subjects before he taught something. He then set the exam to know how much they learnt.The Biography of U Thittila, p.103-111 According to Mrs. Iggleden, he, for the first time in the West, taught Abhidhamma systemically for four consecutive years.. = Course on meditation = Some students who learnt under him thought that a theoretical approach to Buddhist Dhamma was not enough for them, so they requested him to teach them how to meditate in Theravada Buddhist way. By their request, he taught two meditation techniques, namely samatha (tranquility) and vipassanƒÅ (insight).The Biography of U Thittila, pp.171-180  Honors  In 1956, he received a Buddhist honorific title Agga Maha Pandita, which was the only title for outstanding monks annually awarded by the British colonial government from 1915 to 1942. After Myanmar gaining her independence, the government continued this tradition. In the year 1990, the State conferred AbhidhajamahƒÅra·π≠·π≠haguru, one of the highest title, on Ashin Thittila. Another Buddhist missionary title known as AbhidhajaaggamahƒÅsaddhammajotika was bestowed by the government in 1993. During his stay in Myanmar (1966-1982), he became 'OvƒÅdacariya Sayadaw' (the Elder and adviser) in Sangha Mahanayaka. He was also a trustee monk of the Shwedagon Pagoda, Sule Pagoda, Kaba Aye Pagoda. He was the examiner of the Abhidhamma Propagation Society in Yangon, too.

She was Professor of Byzantine and Islamic Art at American University of Beirut, Lebanon, and at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  Life  Erica Cruikshank was born in Beirut, Lebanon, within an academic family. She grew up in the family home that her father, Dr. W. D. Cruikshank, who was Professor of Surgery at the American University of Beirut, had built on the AUB campus. She graduated from Wellesley College, Massachusetts, with a B.A. in History of Art in 1951, and earned a PhD in Byzantine Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, in 1958. She then went on to undertake post-doctoral training in Islamic Art at the Centre for Middle East Studies, at Harvard University between 1960 and 1963. She married Peter C. Dodd (19302010), an academic who, like her, taught at the American University of Beirut for 20 years from 1965 to 1985. They had four children together. She lived for many years in Pakistan, where her husband was the Director of the Fulbright Foundation in Islamabad, and worked as an unpaid assistant for the Foundation from 1989 to 1996.  Academic career  After teaching art history for 20 years at the American University of Beirut, she became Senior Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks Centre for Byzantine Studies at Harvard University, Washington, D.C., from 1986 to 1987 and Visiting Professor of Islamic and Byzantine Art at the Department of History of Art, University of Victoria, Canada, from 1987 to 1989.

Medieval Lebanese Art  Cruikshank's book Medieval paintings in the Lebanon has been praised by Robin Cormak, writing in Speculum, as ‚Äúan invaluable contribution toward the description of what remains in that region‚Äù. The book contains photographs of paintings in religious buildings in the Lebanese region collected over a period of 33 years (1971-2004). Of particular importance are the photographs of 1971, which represent a ‚Äúrecord of lost paintings‚Äù, as most of these deteriorated over the years it took for her research to complete. As Cormak wrote in Speculum, it is \\"a matter of considerable satisfaction that the key monuments are now accessible in the art-historical literature‚Äù.  Islamic Art and Architecture  Cruikshank's book, The Image of the Word: A Study of Quranic Verses in Islamic Architecture, contains a collection of 4000 Quranic inscriptions on Islamic buildings. Its publication was received ‚Äúwith gratitude‚Äù by the International Journal of the Middle East Studies, which recognized the value of a work ‚Äúlong overdue‚Äù and acknowledged ‚Äùthe herculean nature of the task‚Äù.

The collection was initiated in the 1940s by Ansel Adams and Edwin Land. Following the company's 2008 bankruptcy, the collection was broken up for sale in 2010. History Beginning in the 1940s, the Polaroid Corporation hired noted artists to test their film and cameras, and then acquired some of the results. In 1949, Polaroid's founder Edwin Land hired one of these photographers, Ansel Adams, to consult on the collection. Adams remained a consultant to the collection for 35 years. By the 1960s, Land's informal offers to artists to use the company's equipment and film eventually evolved into its Artists Support Program, which also provided access to its dedicated 20√ó24 inch Polaroid camera studio. Selected artists were also able to borrow the cameras to use outside of the Polaroid 20x24 studio. The artists in turn provided the Polaroid Collection with examples of the work they produced using Polaroid's technology. In parallel with Land and Adams' work on the collection, and the photographs produced by the Artist's Support Program, Polaroid's European branch also purchased photographs by photographers such as David Bailey, Sarah Moon, Helmut Newton and Josef Sudek under the name of the International Polaroid Collection. In 1990 the two collections were merged. The Polaroid Collection grew to include works by Dorothea Lange, Margaret Bourke-White, Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, William Garnett and Adams himself. Dissolution=American sale Following the second bankruptcy of the Polaroid Corporation in 2008, 1200 of the 16,000 photographs in the American-held portion of the collection were sold at auction in 2010 by order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. Some controversy followed the decision to auction the works, as several artists said that they had lent or given their work to the collection with the expectation that it would remain in the collection in perpetuity. The auction was very successful, generating $12.4 million USD. Some works were sold for record-setting values; Ansel Adams' Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park sold for a $722,000 USD, the highest ever paid for an Adams work at the time. European sale In 2011 the Westlicht Museum in Vienna, in collaboration with the Impossible Project, acquired a cache of 4400 prints from the collection that had been stored in Lausanne's Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e. The two organizations paid $705,000 USD for the prints, which included works by Marina Abramoviƒá and Ulay, Ansel Adams, Walker Evans, Chuck Close, David Hockney and Andy Warhol. 1400 of the photos in the European sale were 20x24 inch Polaroids that had been produced under Land's Artists Support Program.

It contains the city's historic Maine Avenue Fish Market, hotels, residential buildings, restaurants, shops, parks, piers, docks and marinas, and live music venues. The first phase of The Wharf opened in October 2017 and the second and final phase is currently under construction. When construction is complete, the neighborhood will encompass 24 acres (9.7 ha) of land, 50 acres (20.2 ha) of water, and contain 3.2 million square feet (297,290 sq m) of retail, residential, and entertainment space along 1 mile (1.61 km) of the Potomac River shoreline from the Francis Case Memorial Bridge to Fort McNair. The idea of redeveloping the waterfront gained momentum with District officials in the early 2000s when the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation was created to oversee the redevelopment of the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood. The redevelopment was intended to reconnect the neglected and isolated portions of the southwest quadrant with downtown Washington, D.C., and make the area accessible and attractive to pedestrians while enhancing the existing community. Developers settled on The Wharf as the project name at the suggestion of D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who recalled that this section of the Southwest Waterfront was known as The Wharf during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Geography District Pier - the District Pier extends 425 feet into the Washington Channel, making it the longest pier in the city. District Pier houses the Dockmaster Building, a 2,000 square foot building with 270-degree views of the channel and waterfront. Transit Pier - The Transit Pier provides access to water taxi services and hosts a floating stage for live music, and an ice rink. Recreation Pier - The Recreation Pier provides public access to the water as well as kayak and stand-up paddleboard rentals. District Square - The Wharf's pedestrian mall that hosts boutiques, shops, and restaurants. Blair Alley - A residential entrance and fountain dedicated to the memory of Blair Phillips, a young architect who worked on The Wharf project and died in a ski accident. History Opened in 1805, the Municipal Fish Market is the longest continually operating fish market in the United States. For a time known as Maine Avenue Fish Market, it served as the inspiration for the redevelopment project. The fish market and other businesses on the waterfront were relatively prosperous throughout the 19th century, but by the early 20th century the area was in decline. By 1945, the Southwest Waterfront had become a target for urban renewal, and the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act allowed the U.S. federal government to acquire property using eminent domain.https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/79th- congress/session-2/c79s2ch736.pdf The federal government removed twenty-three thousand residents, primarily African Americans, from their homes and demolished a majority of the structures. The cleared land was redeveloped into housing complexes and federal office buildings, and was used for the construction of highway I-395, which now runs between the waterfront and the National Mall. Planning and Development In 2003, Mayor Anthony A. Williams renewed interest in revitalizing the area and created the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation to oversee development on the waterfront.https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2004/08/23/story2.html In 2006, PN Hoffman was chosen from a field of 17 companies and tasked with reimagining the waterfront. PN Hoffman originally partnered with Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse of Baltimore on the project,https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2006/09/25/daily58.html but the company dismantled as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. By 2008, Hoffman had acquired most of the land required for development of The Wharf, and the Council of the District of Columbia had allocated $198 million in tax increment financing bonds for infrastructure improvements to support the project. In 2010, Hoffman partnered with Madison Marquette and formed Hoffman- Madison Waterfront to bring the project to fruition. U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced two bills in Congress that made the redevelopment of the waterfront possible. One bill solidified the District's ownership of the Southwest Waterfront, and the other gave the District control of portions of the Washington Channel. In honor of the congresswoman's contributions, Hoffman-Madison Waterfront named the largest park in The Wharf development after Norton.https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2014/12/03/the-wharf- will-include-eleanor-holmes-norton-plaza.html Hoffman-Madison Waterfront hired the architectural firm Perkins Eastman to serve as The Wharf's master architects, and by March 2013 the D.C. Zoning Commission had approved plans for phases 1 and 2 of the project. Groundbreaking for phase 1 occurred May 19, 2014, and The Wharf opened to the public October 12, 2017. Hoffman-Madison Waterfront broke ground on the second phase of the project in March 2019. Phase 2 is expected to cost $1.25 billion by the time it is complete in 2022, bringing the total cost of redevelopment to $2.5 billion. The second phase will bring the addition of three office buildings, an apartment building, a hotel, a 96-unit condominium building, additional retail space, and two new underground parking garages. The project has created 2,800 construction jobs and, at completion, will have added 3,000 permanent jobs. Residential Buildings The Wharf is currently home to two apartment buildings and two condominiums, totaling 868 residential units. More apartment and condominium buildings are under construction in Phase 2. The Channel ‚Äì This 12-story apartment building is built on top of The Anthem music venue.

Water taxi service connects The Wharf to Georgetown, Alexandria, Virginia, and the National Harbor in Oxon Hill, MD. Visitors may also take guided boat tours to view Washington attractions and monuments from the Potomac River. The Wharf operates a free jitney service which shuttles passengers from the Recreation Pier across the Washington Channel to East Potomac Park. Kayak and stand-up paddleboard rentals are also available seasonally. A wood-burning firepit is located along the waterfront at District Square. A retrofitted camper known as Camp Wharf offers supplies for s‚Äômores, including marshmallows, chocolate, graham crackers, and sticks for roasting. The Wharf is accessible by car, with underground parking available. A two-way cycle track runs the length of The Wharf, and the curbside is entirely reserved for rideshare and parcel pick-up and drop-off. Public transportation options include water taxi, metro, multiple Capital Bikeshare stations, and a free community shuttle. The shuttle stops at L‚ÄôEnfant Plaza Metro Station, the International Spy Museum, and the National Mall adjacent to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.

After winning his only race as a juvenile in 2018 he won again on his three-year-old debut but ran poorly on his next start and was subsequently gelded. He returned to the track in the autumn of 2019 and recorded victories in the Cambridgeshire Handicap and the James Seymour Stakes. The gelding made further progress in 2020 when he won the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and the Prince of Wales's Stakes. Background Lord North is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation. He raced in the colours of Zayed bin Mohammed and was sent into training with John Gosden in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the tenth crop of foals sired by Dubawi, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Ghaiyyath, Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Old Persian, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Lord North's dam Najoum showed modest racing ability, winning two minor races from four starts. She was a half-sister to the Blue Grass Stakes winner Bandini and a great-great-granddaughter of the outstanding racemare Moccasin. Racing career=2018: two-year-old season On his first and only appearance as a two-year-old, Lord North started the 7/2 third choice in the betting for a novice race (for horses with no more than two previous wins) over one mile at Redcar Racecourse on 19 October. Ridden by Robert Havlin he started slowly but made steady progress in the closing stages, took the lead 50 yards from the finish and won by a length from Fox Leicester. 2019: three-year-old season On 29 April Lord North began his 2019 campaign in a novice race over one mile on the synthetic Tapeta track at Newcastle Racecourse and won \\"very easily\\" by eleven lengths from his only opponent, a filly named Neesan. The colt was then stepped up in class for the Listed Heron Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse in May. He was reluctant to enter the starting stalls and finished last of the eight runners behind King of Comedy after being denied a clear run in the final furlong. Three weeks after his poor run at Sandown, Lord North was gelded. Lord North returned to the track on 6 September and finished second, beaten half a length by the five-year-old Bless Him in a handicap race over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. Three weeks later the gelding carried 122 pounds when he started the 9/2 favourite in a thirty-runner field for the Cambridgeshire Handicap over nine furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Frankie Dettori he took the lead inside the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length from the four-year-old Beringer. After the race Dettori \\"once I got daylight he came alive and just took off. I was just laughing at the end, but at my age you have to enjoy yourself. I had to be patient and wait for my gaps ‚Äì but wow, he had plenty left... he was a bit of a boy in his younger days but he is learning and maturing into a proper racehorse.\\" At Ascot on 19 October Lord North was assigned top weight of 134 pounds in the Balmoral Handicap. He started favourite but was beaten half a length into second place by the five- year-old Escobar. On his final run of the year the gelding contested the Listed James Seymour Stakes over ten furlongs on heavy ground at Newmarket on 2 November. Ridden by Havlin and starting the 10/11 favourite he won by two and a quarter lengths from Pablo Escobarr after taking the lead in the last quarter mile. 2020: four-year-old season The 2020 flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the group 3 Brigadier Gerard Stakes was run a week later than usual on 7 June at Haydock Park. Lord North, on his seasonal debut, went off the 3/1 second favourite behind the York Stakes winner Elarqam in a five-runner field which also included Sangarius (Hampton Court Stakes), Telecaster (Dante Stakes) and King Ottokar. Havlin settled the gelding behind the leaders before taking the lead from Elarqam approaching the final furlong and held off the renewed challenge of the favourite to win by a short head. John Gosden's son and assistant trainer Thady commented \\"He travelled very well into the race and when Rab asked him he picked up smartly. That looked a very strong race so it was pleasing he could win it first time out... our horse will probably benefit from the run.\\" Ten days after his victory at Haydock Lord North contested the Group 1 Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in which he was partnered by James Doyle and went off the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Japan and Addeybb (Queen Elizabeth Stakes). The other four runners were Barney Roy, Headman (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano), Medaayih (Prix de Malleret) and Bangkok (Sandown Classic Trial). After being restrained towards the rear of the field Lord North was switched to the outside in the straight took the lead a furlong out and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by three and three quarter lengths from Addeybb. Doyle commented \\"He quickened up like a really nice horse, a proper horse. He travelled into it great and showed a good turn of foot. I'd like to ride him again, put it that way\\", while John Gosden said \\"This horse had to be gelded, because he wasn't prepared to play ball, and he's the happiest fellow ever now, a great character. It was an end-to-end gallop, which suited us, and he just picked them off\\".

Malone is currently working on a Digital Archives Project documenting her 1970s excavations of the building. In Twelfth-Century Sculptural Finds at Canterbury Cathedral and the Cult of Thomas Becket (2019) Malone reconstructs finds from the restoration of the Perpendicular Cloister as architectural screens that were built around the time of Becket‚Äôs canonisation (1173) to manage pilgrimage to his tomb and the site of his assassination. In doing so, Malone was the first person to study the way in which the crowds of pilgrims to Canterbury were accommodated during the fifty years before Becket‚Äôs body was moved from the crypt to a shrine in the Trinity Chapel. Reconstruction of these screens provides new evidence about early pilgrimage in a monastic site, and also establishes unusual sculptural activity during a previously unknown building phase at Canterbury Cathedral.

The buildings are at 36 ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska Street on a lot previously occupied by a 1960s 10-storey office building. Its overall approximate floor area will be 40,000 sqm. Building A will have from 4 to 9 stories and its total floor area will be approximately 11,500 sqm. At 40 stories, the taller Building B will stand 155-metre tall, with approximately 28,000 sqm of floor area. The ground floor and level -1 of the set will feature retail space of 3,000 sqm with shops, restaurants or service points.  Facilities  Under each building there will be a 3-storey underground parking lot offering approximately 140 parking spaces in total, charging stations for electric vehicles and approximately 200 parking spots for bicycles. SKYSAWA will be one of the first buildings in Warsaw to be connected directly to the metro ‚Äì the adjacent Rondo ONZ metro station will be accessible through an underground passage.  Name  The name SKYSAWA combines the words sky and Sawa (the name of a legendary Polish character). The first part refers to the shape of the 155-metre tall tower. The second part of the name draws on the legend of mermaid Sawa and fisherman Wars, who started a small settlement at the bank of the Vistula river called Warszawa (Warsaw).  Architecture  SKYSAWA was designed by Projekt Polsko-Belgijska Pracownia Architektury. The external structure of the building will consist mostly of transparent surfaces with matte concrete elements and aluminum razors. The structural elements visible from the street perspective will be made of structural concrete. Each of the two buildings will feature terraces located on a variety of levels.  Certification  The buildings will undergo BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) certification aiming for the highest, OUTSTANDING rating. Building A of the SKYSAWA complex has already been awarded the BREEAM Interim certificate with the OUTSTANDING rating. BREEAM is an established method of assessment used worldwide for rating and certifying the sustainability of buildings at the design and construction stage, as well as during use. BREEAM assesses how environmentally-friendly and comfortable the building is for its users. A BREEAM Outstanding certificate indicates the highest possible rating and is awarded only to buildings in which the requirements of sustainable construction and solutions have been met at an above-standard level.  Construction  Construction of SKYSAWA began at the end of June, 2019, with dismantling, construction and earthworks carried out during stage one.

Biography  Born in Egypt, his father Moses ben Mevorakh was the scion of a distinguished family of physician-courtiers in Egypt. In his early years, he held the post of Av Bet Din at the Yeshivah shel Eretz Israel in Damascus. He later served as a diplomat and possibly the physician for the Fatimid court, whom he developed a close relationship with. In 1170, he succeeded his brother Nethanel ben Moses HaLevi as Nagid. Following the collapse of the Fatimid caliphate, he was disposed from this position by the Ayyubids when they came to power in 1171. He was replaced by Maimonides who had a close relationship to the Ayyubid family, serving as their court physician. However, only two years later, in 1173, Sar Shalom regained his post and held it until at least 1195. His tenure is considered to be immensely controversial and political, as described by Megillat Zutta, written in 1197. The work recounts and criticizes the tenure of Sar Shalom, and celebrates the reinstatement of Maimonides‚Äôs as Nagid in 1195. The author, Abraham ben Hillel accuses Sar Shalom and his father, of having gained the headship of the Jews by corrupt means, including winning the favour of the government by farming taxes via local leaders and informing on fellow Jews. Additionally, the author describes Sar Shalom (who he calls Zuta meaning \\"little one\\") as a \\"despotic ignoramus\\" blinded by his aristocratic pedigree. Letters and documents found in the Fustat Genizah provide additional details of how Sar Shalom attempted to appoint tax-farming governors in El Mahalla, Alexandria, and Bilbeis. Maimonides also confirms these accusations in his commentary on Pirkei Avot 6:4 where, in response to these events, he interpolated a passage forbidding the collection of taxes by religious leaders. Many of the local Egyptian governors resisted Sar Shalom's efforts to force them to farm taxes and from 1169 to 1170, the Jewish community of Alexandria banned anyone who recognized Sar Shaloms authority and officially excommunicated him. However, Maimonides overruled the ban in fear that it would lead to a greater divide in the community. It was also during this time that many influential Jews lobbied the Ayyubids to dispose Sar Shalom. After the Jewish governor of El Mahalla, Perahya ben Joseph, refused to help Sar Shalom farm taxes, Sar Shalom threatened to appoint his own governor. However Perahya's supporters threatened to excommunicate anyone who recognized or cooperated with Sar Shalom's appointee. To this Maimonides ruled in a responsum that the excommunication was binding on those who had accepted it. This prevented Sar Shalom from replacing Pera·∏•ya. In 1187, Maimonides threatened to excommunicate anyone who recognized or interacted with Sar Shalom's governors. The ban further excommunicated anyone who granted authority to perform marriages and divorces to rabbis who were not experts on marriage and divorce law, (a direct blow against Sar Shalom). Since the Nagid possessed the exclusive power of appointing judges, the ban was representative of the public rejection of Sar Shalom's authority. Maimonides reiterated the ruling once he assumed the office of Nagid in 1195. After the death of both Sar Shalom and Maimonides in 1204, Maimonides' son Abraham Maimonides was appointed as Nagid in 1205, this led to members of Sar Shalom‚Äôs family attempting to undermine his power by falsely claiming that he attempted to Islamize synagogue liturgy.

The church, which is a Grade II listed building, was designed in the Gothic Revival style by Cuthbert Brodrick and completed in 1866. It was the only church to have been designed by Brodrick, who is noted for Leeds Town Hall and the Corn Exchange. Its congregation moved out in 1978 to merge with St Columba Presbyterian Church and form Headingley St Columba URC with a new building in the centre of Headingley. After this, Headingley Hill Congregational Church was converted to offices. It was returned to religious use in 1996 and renamed the Ashwood Centre, when the independent Pentecostal City Church bought the building and relocated there from the city centre. Due to falling congregations, this closed and it has been vacant since at least 2014, when it was offered for sale. Planning consent for conversion to flats was secured in 2018. History Drawing of the south elevation by Cuthbert Brodrick, 1864 The church and grounds in 1945, before losing its wooden gates Foundation In the Victorian era, Headingley, being at that point a village separate to the busy town of Leeds, became a popular residential area, and therefore by the 1860s had many large stone villas, such as Ashwood Villas close by the church. New amenities were required for the expanding population. Access via [leeds.gov.uk], within planning application 18/02761/FU. The Headingley Hill Church Building Committee was set up on 22 January 1864, with the objective of constructing \\"an elegant structure\\" with the capacity for six hundred people. The choice of architect was considered at a meeting one month later; from a list of eight, four were selected ‚Äì Joseph James of London, J P Pritchett of Darlington, and William Hill and Cuthbert Brodrick of Leeds.The other suggested names were Thomas Ambler, Paull & Ayliffe, Lockwood & Mawson, and James Barlow Fraser. An architectural competition was initiated, being a popular method of getting the best design from a surplus of architects, with each of the four invited to submit. However, Brodrick chose to not submit an entry, and was replaced as the fourth contestant by Thomas Ambler. The style stipulated by the committee was \\"Gothic with a spire or spirelet\\", and the cost was to be no more than ¬£3,500 (later raised to ¬£4,500). Headingley Hill was a congregational church based on the Unitarian principle, in line with Protestant beliefs and reformed traditions but without a need to follow the traditional church architecture plan or the more Catholic practice of pictorial representation. Three of the four architects put forward a design, and though the one from Hill was considered best, the committee rejected them all and decided to start anew, directly inviting Brodrick to be their architect that May. Construction and opening Brodrick's plans, elevations and specification were submitted on 25 June 1864, and a foundation stone laying ceremony held on 22 October. The stone had a time capsule placed inside, and was laid with a silver trowel by Mr W Scholefield, the chairman of the building committee. A report of the day from the Leeds Mercury stated that over ¬£3,000 had already been subscribed \\"principally by the more influential residents in the district\\", and that contracts had been let for ¬£1,300, but that adding the cost of the land, boundary wall and organ would take expected total expenditure to about ¬£6,000 (). The building was completed in the summer of 1866, opened on 29 August, and formally constituted on 26 September. The total cost was ¬£3,062 11s 5d. It was the assumption and intention that the congregation would grow and the church would expand seating provision when it was needed, by erecting side galleries to seat about 150 more, but these were never built. Headingley Hill Congregational Church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 19 December 1975. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to \\"buildings that are nationally important and of special interest\\". The boundary walls, railings and gates were given a separate listing on 11 September 1996, also at Grade II. Recent history Headingley St Columba United Reformed Church In 1979, the congregational church united with St Columba Presbyterian Church, which had previously been based at Cavendish Road Church (now known as the Clothworkers Centenary Concert Hall), and moved out of the building. Worship is now based at the 1966-built Headingley St Columba United Reformed Church close to central Headingley. No movable evidence remains of church use; the pews, font and altar were all removed. In 1981, the building was converted into photographic studios and the offices of a firm of local architects, Gillinson, Barnett & Partners, and during this time a spiral staircase was inserted into the organ gallery to enable the space to be used, as well as the removal of the bells and gates. However, it was returned to religious use in 1996 and renamed the Ashwood Centre, when the independent Pentecostal City Church bought the building and relocated there from the city centre. Since the closure of City Church, it has remained empty, with development proposals following its sale. Planning applications to form self-contained flats within the interior have been approved but no works yet started. Description=Architecture The eastern elevation to Cumberland Road, with porch, gables, and base of tower The ceiling, including timber elements Although constructed in the Gothic Revival style, Cuthbert Brodrick's design is not a particularly conventional interpretation nor from a specific phase of this style. The sloping nature of the site enabled him to create a basement level, containing classrooms and ancillary space, and to elevate the church above this, providing the main entrance above a flight of grand steps well above the level of Headingley Lane, giving the building impact in the suburban landscape. The exterior of the church building is constructed of rock-faced coursed gritstone with carved ashlar details and dressings, and leaded glass windows. On a rectangular plan, each long side of the church has six gabled bays, which each contain a tall two-light window within a pointed head. A buttress topped with a crouching grotesque is between each pair of bays. On the main south frontage to Headingley Lane, there is a Gothic entrance portal with two non-original doors separated by a central red stone colonette, and two similar colonettes to the side of each door. Above, within a larger pointed arch, is a rose window made up of ten small roundels around a large central pane. To the right side, making the frontage asymmetric, is a tall, slim steeple, with a louvred belfry and terminating with an ashlar obelisk- like spire topped with a cross, unusual for a Congregational church, of which the four angles are given a slight inward curve towards the top. It also features corner grotesques, three stepped lancet windows at entrance level and a further three lancet windows about halfway up. The whole of the front elevation features sections of high quality, intricate detailing within the larger expanse of stonework so as to give the impression of a restrained and simple form, but which seen close up is of higher quality than a standard church building of this size. All around the building are carved rosettes, a favourite of the architect. In terms of grounds, the church is set within a larger plot with a car park to the west side. Pathways from each entrance gate converge at the main steps, which are very wide with a central cast iron handrail, to form a grand ascent. The surrounding gritstone ashlar wall is separately listed along with its gates, piers and cast iron railings. There is also a secondary porch entrance on Cumberland Road. Interior Internally, the church is unusual in having a vast and complex timber roof structure rather than the usual stone arches. In the main internal space, the roof is supported by four pairs of tall, slender cast iron columns, quatrefoil in section and with moulded collars and foliated capitals. These columns support fretwork spandrels, pierced with dagger motifs and quatrefoils which in turn support dark stained rafters decorated with a sawtooth pattern. The ceiling is painted a deep orange colour between the timbers, but was originally white. Though all original seating has been removed, evidence of raked pews is visible on wall surfaces on the gallery above the main entrance.

After a solid education in classical letters and a period of apprenticeship, Lambert joined the apothecaries' and surgeon's guild overseeing standards and education at the Collegium Medicum. In 1688, he became the director of this institution, and, along with associates and collaborators, botanist Jan Commelin and anatomist Frederik Ruysch he had a hand in its herbalist Hortus Medicus flowering into the global Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam) of today. His various learned works in Latin and Dutch deal with plants, with Mennonite religious issues and with different historical themes, contemporary, biblical and literary. Among these Bidloo is best known for the curious Panpoeticon Batavum, (Amsterdan, 1720), a figurative and visual poet's gallery of Golden Age Dutch literature. This he produced as a joint undertaking with the noted artist and art historian Arnold Houbraken who was then also launching The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters, (Amsterdam, 1718-21). Early life  Lambert was the first son of Mennonites Maria Lambertz Fellers and Govert Bidloo, (b. 1603), a hatter by trade. Govert was thirty five when his first son was born in 1638. Eleven years later a second son, Govert, named after himself, was born in 1649. Both brothers pursued scientific careers: Lambert in botany as an apothecary, and Govert in anatomy and as a professor of surgery. As writers, both wrote many poems, religious treatises, scientific and historical works and translations, and theatrical and musical pieces, including the first Dutch opera. Bacchus, Ceres en Venus 1686, music by Johan Schenck and libretto by Govert Bidloo In contemporary Amsterdam, Bidloo's intellectual and literary pretensions were perceived as conceited.Luuc Kooijmans.

He was not the only poet-pharmacist of his time: Joannes Antonides van der Goes, a noted disciple of the great poet Vondel was not only a fellow pharmacist but a Mennonite as well, along with Jan Brouwer.  \\"Amstela dulcis\\"  alt= In 1665, Bidloo's first publication‚ÄîMenno's Church‚Äîwas printed as part of the \\"Lammerenkrijg\\" among the Amsterdam Mennonites. From his marriage with Maria van der Lys in 1666 he had four children: John, a merchant who settled in Lisbon; Maria, who became her father's amanuensis; Nicolaas Bidloo, who went to Russia and served as a personal physician to Peter the Great; and Celia, who married Cornelis De Bree, compass maker. Ecartico In 1672 (also known as the Rampjaar), Bidloo composed a mythological paean to the Batavian river gods who had rescued Holland from the French and English river deities set on Dutch destruction. His Latin poem \\"Amstela dulcis\\" appeared in 1674. 1674 It recounts the upheavals of war on land and sea, including the flooding of the Dutch Water Line and the rescue of Amsterdam from the country's occupation by Louis XIV. The work is dedicated to two men at the top of Amsterdam's political leadership: burgomaster Gillis Valckenier and counselor Johannes Hudde.

Aside from studying botany, chemistry, and pharmacology, he also became proficient with languages. Commelin's first publication was in Dutch Nederlands Hesperides 1676. This treatise on lemon and orange trees in Holland was published in English in 1683.The Belgick or Netherlandish Hesperides.

In the same year, Commelin's first work in Latin was published in collaboration with Bidloo. it is frequently referred as Nederlandse Flora in Dutch, though only the Latin text exists. Commelin's Catalogus plantarum indigenarum Hollandiae opens with Bidloo's essay \\"De re herbaria\\". Amsterdam In 1688, Bidloo was elected as the supervisor of the medical college.

Likeness drawn by Nicolaas Bidloo, encomium in Dutch, Lambert Bidloo Herman Schijn, 1662-1727, Zonist minister and Mennonite historian Bidloo was a leading member of the Amsterdam Mennonites called \\"Zonists\\" for the name of their meeting place on the Singelgracht, \\"op te Zon\\". The Mennonites (also known as Doopgezinden) were an independent Anabaptist group originating in the Netherlands at the onset of the Protestant Reformation. During the Munster Rebellion (1534‚Äì35), a splinter group staged a temporary social revolution which endangered their existence and were ostracised for their role in the Radical Reformation. The group was severely persecuted for their dissident beliefs, such as believer's baptism, foot washing, \\"defenseless\\" pacifism, and the ban on swearing oaths. These Mennonite principles are enumerated in the 18 points of the Dordrecht Confession of Faith (1632) . By Bidloo's time his church was emerging from its clandestine status into congregational meetings that were tolerated by the Calvinist officialdom out of the public eye. By 1660 the differences between liberals and conservatives provoked a major schism among the Mennonites that would persist, despite repeated attempts at reunification, until 1801. The liberal \\"Lamist\\" Mennonites were led by Galenus Abramsz de Hann while the conservative \\"Zonists\\" were led by Samuel Apostool. The Zonists disapproved of the Lamists' practices; therefore, they set up their own congregation and organized against what they saw as the betrayal of their traditions and the heresy of their former co-religionists.Francesco Quatrini, Adam Boreel (1602 ‚Äì 1665): His Life and Thoughtore.ac.uk/download/pdf/80203718.pdf Bidloo was a fervid Zonist from the beginning of the schism and wrote contentious pamphlets against the Lamists' more inclusive and tolerant views of the \\"Flemish\\" congregation: \\"Op te Lamm\\".Mennoos kerck, in en uyt Babel, ofte den aenvang, voortgang en redderinge van der verwarringen der Vlaemsche Doops-Gesinden, vergeleken met de tseventighjarige gevangenisse en bestellinge der Isra√´liten, Lambert Bidloo, T'Amsterdam : Voor Samuel Imbrechts, 1665 Bidloo's contemporary and fellow Zonist, Thieleman J. van Braght, produced a martyrology‚ÄîMartyrs Mirror‚Äîfor his co-religionists.The full English title of the book is The Bloody Theater or Martyrs Mirror of the Defenseless Christians who baptized only upon confession of faith, and who suffered and died for the testimony of Jesus, their Saviour, from the time of Christ to the year A.D. 1660 The book became a fundamental text for all Anabaptists, especially through Jan Luiken's illustrated second edition of 1685.Het bloedig tooneel, of Martelaers spiegel der doops-gesinde of weereloose christenen, die, om 't getuygenis van Jesus haren salighmaker, geleden hebben, ende gedood zijn, van Christi tijd af, tot desen tijd toe Amsterdam 1685 In a similar vein, but with a smaller scope was one of the first publications of Lambert's brother Govert, Letters of the Marytyred Apostles (1675). Govert Bidloo, Brieven der gemartelde apostelen (Amsterdam: Hieroymus Sweerts, 1675). Plates by Romeyn de Hooghe. During Govert's lifetime there were 20 editions of his work which include a poem contributed \\"by his brother\\". While Mennonite beliefs were an important components in the art (Rembrandt) and poetry (Vondel) of the Dutch Golden Age, Bidloo's conservative religious beliefs distanced him from the Dutch origins of the \\"Radical Enlightenment\\". Cf. Jonathan Israel, Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity, 1650‚Äì1750 2001.  Panpoeticon Batavum Lambert Bidloo, presenting his \\"\\"Kabinet\\" Panpoeticon Batavum.Mezzotint by Arnoud van Halen Bidloo contributed poems to artist Arnoud van Halen as part of the Panpoeticon Batavum (1720). This, Bidloo's best known work, is the poetic component of a fascinating gallery of miniature portraits,Visualising literary heritage: A viable approach? The case of the Panpo√´ticon Batav√ªm, Lieke van Deinsena, Timothy De Paepeb, 2017. partially preserved in the Rijksmuseum. Bidloo's poetic review of the best Dutch writers constitutes one of the first historical presentations of this literary tradition. Een Geletterd Man verdadigd en verbetterd Een Geletterd Man verdadigd en verbetterd, 1722 Among several projects the elderly Bidloo fulfilled his commitment to translate L'huomo di lettere (1645) of the Ferrarese Jesuit writer, Daniello Bartoli (1608-1685). For those aspiring to the title of man of letters this treatise was celebrated as the template of Italian eloquence during Bartoli's lifetime. By 1722 the book had been translated into German, French, Latin, English, and Spanish. Bidloo's Dutch rendering of the Italian work is entitled Een Geletterd Man verdadigd en verbettererd, proposing the defense and bettering of Bartoli's \\"lettered\\" man, as a Stoic model of Christian humanism. His preface begins with a dedication to his faithful daughter Maria, his \\"bibliothecaria\\". In his foreword Bidloo describes his introduction to Bartoli's Baroque bestseller years earlier at the Congress of Nijmegen (1677‚Äì78) by the papal nuncio of Innocent XI. This dignitary, Aloysius Bevilacqua, touted it to him as a challenging literary summa. Before the text there are several occasional poems attached by other poets, including fellow Mennonite Pieter Langendijk. Bidloo innovates by adding numbers to the series of headings; in Part I, 1-11 ; Part II, 1-27 .Een Geletterd Man Verdadigd, en Verbeterd door Daniel Bartholi1722 After Lambert's death in 1724, Hendrik Bosch, his Amsterdam printer, together with his two daughters as publishers, issued a final work in three volumes on the resonant theme of the downfall of the Jewish people.

While the two women discussed and finalized the matter, Justine took her first canoe trip with someone who was a college friend and a guide. They went down Granite River to Saganaga Lake. At the time Justine had just finished her undergraduate work and planned to become a physician. Justine had agreed with her mother to come up during the summers while in school and help her run the resort. During the Great Depression her family lost almost everything except for the lodge. They moved to the lodge which had no plumbing or electricity. Justine learned how to put the plumbing in herself. She also learned how to mush sled dogs, repair cars, fix telephone lines, build furniture, and fur trapping.\\"City Girl Justine Kerfoot became a North Woods Icon\\", Star Tribune, May 5, 2019. At the time of the purchase it was 5 cabins plus small lodge building with a store carrying supplies for the Indians and fishing tackle for the guests, plus a dining room to serve meals. After 5 years of associating with them the Chippewa Indians trusted her. They taught her wilderness skills. She met Bill Kerfoot, the son of Hamline University‚Äôs president, whose foreign service ambitions were dashed in the Depression camped on a beach, desperate for work. Justine offered him room and board in exchange for resort work. In 1934 she married Bill Kerfoot. They had 3 children; Neal (1935-1935), Bruce, Pat and Sharon. She once led a winter hunting trip while 8 months pregnant. They eventually divorced. The lodge burned in 1953 and the family rebuilt it. Their son Bruce bought the lodge from his parents. He ran it until 2016 when he sold it. She played an important role in the shaping of the Gunflint Trail. She served as Cook County Commissioner from 1965 to 1968, serving as Chair in 1968.

Life  Kenyon was born on May 5, 1843 in Grosvenors Corners, Schoharie County, New York. His parents were Charles Grosvenor Kenyon and Helen Snyder. He was beginning to study law when the American Civil War broke out. Kenyon enlisted in the 3rd New York Volunteer Cavalry in October 1861 and was mustered in as a private in Company D. By December 1862, he was promoted to second lieutenant. He was mustered out as supernumerary in May 1863, but he re-enlisted as a private in Company H in January 1864. He was promoted to corporal in December 1864. He was mustered out in July 1865. On May 15, 1862, his regiment was fighting Confederates along the Trent River in North Carolina when they were ordered to retreat. When a man from his company fell, Kenyon turned and galloped towards the injured soldier. Under fire from Confederates, he dismounted, put the man on his horse, and ran beside him until they made it back to their unit. In 1897, he was awarded a Medal of Honor for his action. After the war, Kenyon moved to Baldwinsville, where he worked in the flour and paper milling business. In around 1876, he moved to Syracuse. He was originally a member of the Democratic Party, but he became a Republican shortly after moving to Syracuse. He served as secretary and chairman of the Onondoga County Republican General Committee and as secretary of the New York Republican State Committee. In 1874, Kenyon was appointed Canal Superintendent of the Oswego Canal. He was appointed Deputy Clerk of the New York State Assembly in 1877. He served as Assistant Clerk of the New York State Senate in 1881, 1882, 1886, and 1887. In 1882 and 1883, he was the Reading Clerk of the United States House of Representatives. He served as Clerk of the New York State Senate in 1888, 1889, 1890, 1891, 1894, 1895, 1896, and 1897.

Kurdish separatism At the beginning of the 21st century, the Kurds remain the largest of the groups without their own statehood. The Treaty of S√®vres between Turkey and Triple Entente (1920) provided for the creation of an independent Kurdistan. However, this agreement never entered into force and was cancelled after the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). In the 1920s and 1930s, Kurds several times unsuccessfully rebelled against the Turkish authorities. In August 1984, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) declared war on the Turkish authorities, which continues today. Until 1999, the PKK made the most radical demand - the proclamation of a single and independent Kurdistan, uniting the Kurdish territories that are now part of the state borders of Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Since 1999, the PKK has put forward requirements that are close and understandable to the bulk of the Kurdish population, namely: granting autonomy, preserving national identity, practical equalization of Kurds in rights with the Turks, opening of national schools and introduction of Kurdish TV and radio broadcasting. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230513082_6https://journals.openedition.org/ejts/4008https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/08/12/473508/state- turkish-kurdish- conflict/https://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38e91e.htmlhttps://fas.org/asmp/profiles/turkey_background_kurds.htmhttps://www.amazon.com.br/Secession- Turkey-Abdullah-Kurdistan-conflict/dp/1157615732 File:Kurds_of_Central_Anatolia.jpgKurds of Central Anatolia File:Kurdish_languages_map.svgKurdish languages map File:Zaza Map.gifZazas in Anatolia File:Kurdistan_of_Turkey_(CIA).pngTurkish Kurdistan Armenian separatism The planned partition of the Ottoman Empire according to the superseded Treaty of S√®vres of 1920 The modern concept of United Armenia as claimed by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Orange: areas overwhelmingly populated by Armenians (Republic of Armenia: 98%; Nagorno-Karabakh: 99%; Javakheti: 95%) Yellow: Historically Armenian areas with presently no or insignificant Armenian population (Western Armenia and Nakhichevan) Western Armenia (Western Armenian: ‘±÷Ä’•÷Ç’¥’ø’•’°’∂ ’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂, Arevmdian Hayasdan), located in Western Asia, is a term used to refer to eastern parts of Turkey (formerly the Ottoman Empire) that were part of the historical homeland of the Armenians. Western Armenia, also referred to as Byzantine Armenia, emerged following the division of Greater Armenia between the Byzantine Empire (Western Armenia) and Sassanid Persia (Eastern Armenia) in 387 AD. The area was conquered by the Ottomans in the 16th century during the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1532‚Äì1555) against their Iranian Safavid arch-rivals. Being passed on from the former to the latter, Ottoman rule over the region became only decisive after the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War of 1623‚Äì1639. The area then became known as Turkish Armenia or Ottoman Armenia. During the 19th century, the Russian Empire conquered all of Eastern Armenia from Iran,Timothy C. Dowling Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond pp 728‚Äì729 ABC-CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 and also some parts of Turkish Armenia, such as Kars. The region's Armenian population was affected during the widespread massacres of Armenians in the 1890s. The Armenians living in their ancestral lands were exterminated or deported by Ottoman forces during the 1915 Armenian Genocide and over the following years. The systematic destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which had endured over 4000 years, is considered an example of cultural genocide. Only assimilated and crypto-Armenians live in the area today, and some irredentist Armenians claim it as part of United Armenia. The most notable political party with these views is the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Laz separatism Lazistan The population of Lazistan was made up of Sunni Muslim Laz, Turks, and Hemshin people. The Christian population were around and made up of Pontic Greeks and Armenian Apostolic Christians. After the Ottoman conquest of Trebizond Empire and later Ottoman invasion of Guria in 1547, Laz populated area known as Lazia became its own distinctive area (sanjak) as part of eyalet of Trabzon, under the administration of a Governor who governed from the town of Rizaion (Rize). His title was \\"Lazistan Mutasserif\\"; in other words \\"Governor of Lazistan\\". The Lazistan sanjak was divided into cazas, namely those of: Ofi, Rizaion, Athena, Hopa, Gonia and Batum. Not only the Pashas (governors) of Trabzon until the 19th century, but real authority in many of the cazas (districts) of each sanjak by the mid-17th century lay in the hands of relatively independent native Laz derebeys (\\"valley-lords\\"), or feudal chiefs who exercised absolute authority in their own districts, carried on petty warfare with each other, did not owe allegiance to a superior and never paid contributions to the sultan. This state of insubordination was not really broken until the assertion of Ottoman authority during the reforms of the Osman Pasha in 1850s. In 1547, Ottomans acquired the coastal fortress of Gonia, which served as capital of Lazistan; then Batum until it was acquired by the Russians in 1878, throughout the Russo-Turkish War, thereafter, Rize became the capital of the sanjak. The Muslim Lazs living near the war zones in Batumi Oblast were subjected to ethnic cleansing; many Lazes living in Batumi fled to the Ottoman Empire, settling along the southern Black Sea coast to the east of Samsun and Marmara region. Around 1914 Ottoman policy towards the Christian population shifted; state policy was since focused to the forceful migration of Christian Pontic Greek and Laz population living in coastal areas to the Anatolian hinterland. In the 1920s Christian population of the Pontus were expelled to Greece. In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, Lazs became citizents of Democratic Republic of Georgia, and eventually became Soviet citizens after the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921. Simultaneously, a treaty of friendship was signed in Moscow between Soviet Russia and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, whereby southern portions of former Batum Oblast - later known as Artvin, was awarded to Turkey, which renounced its claims to Batumi. The autonomous Lazistan sanjak existed until the end of the empire in 1923. The designation of the term of Lazistan was officially banned in 1926, by the Kemalists.Thys- ≈ûenocak, Lucienne.

Boyd is an American pediatrician and child and community health advocate. Boyd is a popular science communicator, making use of social media to amplify a diverse range of voices in an effort to improve the heath of communities of colour.  Early life and education  Boyd grew up in Los Angeles and Akron, Ohio. As a child, Boyd attended a predominantly-white Catholic school. She wanted to be a physician. In 2006, Boyd received a bachelor's degree in a customized program of Africana studies and health from the University of Notre Dame. While in college she was a journalist for the student newspaper, where she wrote about race in America. In 2010, Boyd received a medical degree is from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. She moved to California, completing a residency in pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)'s UCSF Medical Center in 2013. While a medical resident at University of California, San Francisco Boyd launched a blog about being a paediatrician. Boyd was part of the Paediatric Leadership for the Underserved residency, which trains paediatricians to provide healthcare for children from marginalised backgrounds. In 2017, Boyd completed a Master of Public Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. She held a Commonwealth Fund Mongan Minority Health Policy Fellowship. Career Boyd works as a clinical physician. Since she has partnered with San Diego 211 as chief medical officer. Boyd has taught academic programs on structural inequality and health. She specialises in child and community health. She has worked with physicians, professional bodies, local organizers and tech founders in the San Francisco Bay Area to increase access to health services. Following the success of her early blogging experience, Boyd launched an independent platform (Rhea.MD), where she discussed the intersection of race, gender and health. Boyd is particularly concerned about the impact of police brutality on the health and wellbeing of Black boys and men. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Boyd has spoken about the health disparities experienced by Black Americans. In response to the murder of George Floyd, Boyd became more involved with political activism and the fight for social justice. Boyd was one of many physicians who supported the George Floyd protests throughout the pandemic, saying ‚Äúprotest is a profound public health intervention‚Äù. In an interview with Time magazine, Boyd said, ‚ÄúIf people were to understand that racism, and all of the social and political and economic inequalities that racism creates, ultimately harms people‚Äôs health. they would see that protest is a profound public health intervention, because it allows us to finally address and end forms of inequality,‚Äù. On June 17, 2020, Boyd gave expert testimony to the U.S. Congress' House of Representatives' House Committee on Energy and Commerce on ‚ÄúHealth Care Inequality: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 and the Health Care System‚Äù. Boyd worked with Monica McLemore to devise new standards on publishing racial health inequities. Unfortunately, the academic publishing process has allowed scholarship that confuses and often attempts to minimise the role of racism in determining health outcomes. Boyd and McLemore believe that ‚Äúthe solution to racial health inequities is to address racism and its attendant harms and erect a new health care infrastructure that no longer profits from the persistence of inequitable disease‚Äù.Their suggestions included; (1) Denouncing Biological Race And The Insidious Harms Of Patient Blame, to stop (2) Obfuscating The Role Of Racism In Determining Health And Health Care and the implementation of more (3) Rigorous Standards For Publishing On Racial Health Inequities.

She has been the president of the Free Destourian Party since 2016 and a member of Parliament since 2019.  Biography  Abir Moussi was born on 15 March 1975 in Jemmal to a father working in the national security service (from Beja) and a mother who was a teacher (from the Sahel).  Professional career  Holder of a Master's degree in law and a DEA in economic and business law, she became a lawyer at the Bar of the Court of Cassation, the highest court in Tunisia. She is also vice-president of the municipality of Ariana, president of the litigation committee and member of the national forum of lawyers of the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD) and secretary general of the Tunisian Association of Victims of Terrorism.  Political career  On 12 January 2010, she was appointed Assistant Secretary General in charge of Women at RCD. Following the fall of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime and the dissolution of the RCD in 2011, which she opposed as a lawyer, Moussi joined the Destourian Movement, founded by former Prime Minister Hamed Karoui. On 13 August 2016, Moussi was appointed President of the Destourian Movement, renamed the Free Destourian Party. Regularly referred to as an extreme right- wing party, the latter brings together sympathisers of the former Democratic Constitutional Rally which dominated the country before the revolution. Moussi thus takes the lead of those nostalgic for the authoritarian dictatorship of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, under which, according to her, \\"there was neither unemployment nor poverty\\", the revolution that brought it down being \\"a plot by Europeans and Zionists\\". She therefore does not recognize the 2014 Constitution and advocates for the establishment of a presidential system. Moussi has declared herself opposed to the decriminalization of homosexuality. On 16 August 2018, the NGO Association of Help, Homosexual Defense for the Equality of Sexual Orientations (ADHEOS) called for Moussi to be banned from the Schengen Area following homophobic and hate speech, in which she called for the systematic imprisonment of homosexuals, whom she associated with criminals. The NGO also called on the authorities to take measures to protect the rights of homosexuals in the Schengen area. In September 2019, Moussi also supported the practice of \\"anal testing\\" of homosexuals by law enforcement officials, if it takes place \\"following a judicial decision\\". Although she is in favor of equality between men and women in matters of inheritance, Moussi is opposed to the current government's plan to implement it, arguing that by extending rights to children born out of wedlock, it represents an attack on the institution of the family. She is also opposed to the proposal of the current government to implement it. The proposal of the Individual Freedoms and Equality Committee (COLIBE) to introduce this equality while leaving the legatees the choice of using the old system based on the Qur'an also attracts criticism from the candidate, who sees it as \\"the door open to customary marriages and discrimination between women themselves\\". She was elected deputy for the second constituency of Tunis in the legislative elections of 2019. In June 2020, Moussi sharply criticized speaker of the parliament Rached Ghannouchi and his political party the Ennahda Movement for his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and for spreading Islamist ideology in Tunisia. Moussi claimed that Ghannouchi were trying to divide Tunisians based on religious views and re-write Tunisian history.  Personal life  She is married and has two daughters.

Pinto was the last entrant into a crowded field that included Jack Evans, who resigned following multiple ethics violations. Pinto was the only candidate who did not take public financing, which avoided campaign finance limits faced by all other candidates and allowed outside donors to contribute thousands more to her campaign. She was the largest donor to her campaign, loaning or contributing more than $65,000, while relatives gave more than $7,000. Pinto had never previously voted in a DC election. Her platform included opposition to outside interest groups. She touted that she was the only candidate with business, tax, and legislative experience, which was needed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

History  The park was created in the 13th century by Richard of Cornwall. The estate formed part of a royal park until 1632, when Charles I sold the land to William Stonor of the nearby Stonor Park in order to raise funds for his government. Around the middle of the 18th century it was sold to John Tilson, who built the mansion which essentially still exists today. In the late 19th century, Watlington Park exchanged hands multiple times, until Oliver Brett, 3rd Viscount Esher, bought it in 1920, renovating and extending the house. His son, the architect and city planner Lionel Brett, 4th Viscount Esher, inherited the property upon his father's death in 1963, pared down the property to its earlier design removing much of the 19th and 20th century additions, and lived as well as ran his architectural practice together with Francis Pollen from there. The house became Grade II* listed in July 18 1963, meaning it is considered a \\"particularly important building of more than special interest\\". Some time in the 1960s, Lionel Brett gave the house to his eldest son, and built a new house of his own, somewhat unusual design, named The Tower, on the grounds of the estate, as a country residence for himself and his wife. In several instalments during the 20th century, large parts of the estate were donated to or otherwise placed under the administration of the National Trust, including the adjoining Watlington Hill. In 1941, the Esher family donated a large portion of the park to the National Trust. Then, in 1946, the family donated Greenfield Copse, Lower Deans and Howe Wood to the National Trust. In 1974, they gave a larch plantation to the National Trust. In the 1990s, the National Trust bought the remainder of Watlington Hill. The hill is now under total administration by the National Trust. The property stayed in the Brett (Viscounts Esher) family until 2003, just before the 4th Viscount's death, when it was sold for a rumoured ¬£15 million to an undisclosed buyer.

Bear sculpture at the International Financial Services Centre, Dublin Guinness advertisement featuring a bear Bears were once common in Ireland but are now extinct on the island, dying out in the 1st millennium BC. History The cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) lived in Ireland before going extinct c. 22,000 BC. The brown bear (Ursus arctos) lived in Ireland also, eating red deer, wild boar, Irish hare and Atlantic salmon. Bears in Ireland often hibernated in caves; several of them died while hibernating and their bones found by later archaeologists. The most famous examples are in Poll na mB√©ar (Cave of the Bears) in County Leitrim, and Aillwee Cave, County Clare. Remains have also been found at Lough Gur; County Kildare; and County Longford. Perforated bear teeth (worn on necklaces) have been found in caves in County Clare. A bear patella bearing butchery marks has been dated to 10860‚Äì10641 BC; it was found in the Alice and Gwendoline Cave, County Clare and is the earliest known evidence of human activity in Ireland. DNA studies have shown that the Irish bear was intermediate between the modern brown bear and modern polar bear.https://www.wildireland.org/bears#:~:text=The%20Brown%20Bear%20is%20one%20of%20the%20largest%20land%20carnivores%20in%20Europe.&text;=Ireland%20was%20once%20clothed%20in,in%20our%20salmon%20rich%20rivers. This suggests that the Irish bear interbreeded with archaic polar bears during the Pleistocene. The bear is believed to have died out c. 1000‚Äì500 BC, due to habitat loss and hunting. Terminology In Old Irish, there are three words used for bear: *art, from Proto-Celtic *artos and Proto-Indo-European *h‚ÇÇ≈ïÃ•t·∏±os; related to Greek ·ºÑœÅŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ (arktos). *math, from Proto-Celtic *matus, as in the Gaulish names Matugenos, Matuus, Teutomatus. *beithir; its meaning \\"bear\\" is borrowed from the Germanic (Norse bera, English bear); it is believed to derive from a Proto-Celtic *betrix which referred to a monster or beast (as in Latin bƒìstia). The word art fell out of use, with the word gamuin (\\"calf\\") being added to math to create mathgamain, and the word beithir being respelled as b√©ar. Personal names The elements art and math often appear in personal names. Mathghamhain was a soldier of Brian Boru's and died at the Battle of Clontarf; his descendents formed the MacMahon family. In the 12th century Mathghamhain mac Conchobar Maenmaige Ua Conchobair was a prince of Connacht; Mathghamhain Maonmhaighe √ì Briain was King of Thomond in the 15th century; and Mathghamhain √ì hIfearn√°in was a poet of the 16th century. Art mac Cuinn, Art Imlech and Art mac Lugdach were legendary High Kings of Ireland; King Arthur's name is believed to be Brythonic for \\"bear-man\\"; and Art √ìg mac Murchadha Caomh√°nach was a 14th-century king. The name Artr√≠ (\\"bear-king\\") is also recorded; Artr√≠ mac Cathail was King of Munster in the 8th‚Äì9th centuries, and Artr√≠ mac Conchobair was briefly Abbot of Armagh in the 9th century. The surname O'Hart also derives from Ua hAirt, \\"descendant of Art\\"; they were based around the Hill of Tara before losing their land in the Norman invasion and resettling in County Sligo. Legend and myth Bears occasionally appear in Irish mythology and folk tales, for example, in the tale of The Brown Bear of Norway. Toponyms Bears died out in Ireland prior to the coming of the Celts, so their name does not appear in very many place names. The Beara Peninsula, Bear barony and Bere Island are not named for the mammal; the name is believed to have the same root as Iberia. Lismaha (Irish Lios Matha), a townland in County Roscommon, possibly means \\"bear ringfort\\", although it could also be \\"Matthew's ringfort.\\" Captive bears and reintroduction Arms of the Earls of Granard, featuring three bear heads. As is common in British heraldry, the bears are depicted wearing muzzles, perhaps reflecting the lack of wild bears in Great Britain and Ireland. Bear-baiting took place in Ireland in the early modern period, with it being common in Belfast; a baiting in Dublin in 1726 led to a bull and bear escaping, with one bear \\"[seizing] one man by the leg and tore it to pieces.\\"https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/columnists/paul- rouse/cockfighting-cruelty-and-irelands-history-of- bloodsports-464524.html#:~:text=The%20popularity%20of%20bear%2Dbaiting,and%20tore%20it%20to%20pieces'. A bear-baiting took place in Cork in 1769. Two polar bears lived in Dublin Zoo between the early 1980s and 2003. The female bear's behaviors caused concerns and an independent study was commissioned which found bears needed to be able to spend time alone when they choose. It was later moved to a zoo in Hungary where their needs can be accommodated better. Habitat loss has made it impossible to reintroduce the bear to Ireland, but there are three brown bears ‚Äî rescued from a private zoo in Lithuania ‚Äî residing in Wild Ireland, a reserve on the Inishowen Peninsula.

The district currently has three fire stations with three fire fighters each. Its territory covers 247 square miles and includes two cities, plus much of the county's unincorporated area. The incorporated cities are: Antioch, Brentwood, and Oakley. Unincorporated community areas are Bethel Island, Discovery Bay, Byron, Knightsen and Marsh Creek/Morgan Territory. As of 2020, the district claims that it serves a population of 128,000.\\"About the District.\\" East Contra Costa Fire Protection District. 2020. Accessed June 18, 020. Financial support is primarily from property taxes collected by the county. Mutual aid agreements Various fire protection districts have mutual aid agreements, but in May 2019 these were modified based on numbers of engines available at the time the aid was summoned. For example, ECCFPD (Battalion 5) covers Brentwood, Oakley, Discovery Bay, Byron, Bethel Island, Knightsen, Morgan Territory while Contra Costa Fire Protection District (CONFIRE) (Battalion 8) normally covers Antioch, Pittsburg and Bay Point.\\"Editorial: East Contra Costa Residents About to Feel Pain of Reduced Fire Services.\\" East County Today. May 1, 2019. Accessed June 17, 2020. CONFIRE has 8 engines, and has already said it is willing to send a maximum of four to another district when requested. However, if one or more of its engines are unavailable for any reason, then it will deduct one from the number it will send. In other words, if all eight are unavailable, then CONFIRE will send none to the requesting district. In such a situation the aid will have to be requested from stations farther away (e.g., Central CC: Concord, Martinez or Pleasant Hill or CALFIRE in Rio Vista, Tracy, Stockton or Livermore.. On June 8, 2020, ECCFPD Fire Chief Brian Helmick announced that as of July 1, 2020, the district will only allow its fire fighters to enter burning structures if occupants' lives are at stake. \\"Otherwise,... you need to do the best you can to fight the fire from the exterior to the interior, but you cannot be aggressive and overextend yourself.‚Äù Moreover, only a maximum of three of the department's five fire engines will be sent to a structure fire.

FD: FFs will no longer enter burning structures if lives are not at risk.\\" East Bay Times. June 12, 2020. Accessed June 17, 2020. The ECCFPD headquarters is now located in the Brentwood City Hall, 150 City Park Way in Brentwood, California. Response times Based on national standards, a fire service in an urban or suburban area should have a station located within five miles of any structure. This is based on having the first engine arrive on scene within four minutes of leaving the station. However, ECCFPD's 3-station model cannot meet these criteria because funding is inadequate to build and staff new stations. The Dispatcher normally calls for both an ambulance and a fire truck on the first call. If the ambulance arrives first, the EMS crew can start work on the patient(s) immediately, and if no fire is involved, can cancel the fire truck call, letting it return to the station right away. One member of the fire crew is also a trained EMS person, who can quickly assess the medical issues and even start basic life support procedures and prepare the patient for transport to an emergency room. Pension restructuring At the end of August, 2020, Chief Helmick announced that the Contra Costa County Employees Retirement Association had granted permission for his district to disconnect from the larger CCCFPD by paying the pensions of its own employees directly instead of through sharing with the costs of other agencies. He said that this would save his district about $1.2 million per year in retirement costs.Prieve, Judith. \\"East Contra Costa Fire Splits from ConFire.\\" East Bay Times. August 30, 2020. pp. B1-B2.] Accessed August 20, 2020. In December 2018, ECCFPD had 24 retirees in the pension plan, while the much larger ConFire had 565 in the plan, resulting in the smaller group subsidizing the larger. ECCFPD will reduce its annual pension cost from $1.17 to $0.79 for every dollar of base pay. The smaller district intends to use the savings to service its own district, rather than continuing its past practice of calling heavily on CONFIRE for aid.

Bulkington is referred to only by his last name and appears only twice, briefly in Chapter 3, \\"Spouter Inn\\", and then in Chapter 23, \\"The Lee Shore\\", a short chapter of several hundred words devoted entirely to him. Critics and scholars, however, have paid attention to his role. Some see Bulkington as representing a historical or contemporary figure, or take his early appearance and then disappearance to bolster the theory that Melville composed the novel in several stages and Bulkington became unnecessary when Melville expanded his conception. The Bulkington Pass is on the south side of the Flask Glacier and west of Bildad Peak, a series of features that the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-names Committee named after characters from Moby-Dick. U.S. Geological Survey Antarctica Detail Appearances In Chapter 3, \\"Spouter Inn\\", the crew of the ship USS Grampus celebrate their return from three years at sea. Bulkington stands aloof but Ishmael says \\"this man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned)\\", that he will give a \\"little description of him\\". Bulkington is tall, with \\"noble shoulders\\", muscular, with a face that is \\"deeply brown and burnt\\", while his voice indicates that he was a Southerner. He slips away and is soon missed by his shipmates, who pursue him with cries of \\"Where's Bulkington?\\". Bulkington does not appear again until Chapter 23, \\"The Lee Shore\\", and does not appear after it. Ishmael calls the chapter the \\"stoneless grave of Bulkington\\", since in it he announces Bulkington will die, and, because it is so short, a \\"six inch chapter\\" (in fact, 361 words). Since Bulkington had just returned from four years at sea, Ishmael is amazed to see him standing at the helm of the Pequod, guiding it from the harbor. Bulkington, he muses, is driven to sea just as a ship is driven to the lee shore ‚Äì \\"the land seemed scorching to his feet\\". Ishmael sees a parallel and a paradox: A favorable wind drives a ship toward the warmth and safety of its home port, but when a gale drives it to destruction on the shore, the ship must avoid the seeming warmth and safety of home to put on all sail to seek safety in the \\"landless sea\\". Bulkington, says Ishmael, should recognize that, likewise, the soul must keep to the \\"open independence\\" of her sea. \\"But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God ‚Äì so better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!\\". Ishmael fortells Bulkington's death by drowning: \\"Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing ‚Äì straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\\". Critical discussion Bulkington's striking physical appearance and the poetic force and thematic resonance of Ch. 23 have intrigued critics. Andrew Delbanco writes that Bulkington is a \\"natural aristocrat ‚Äì an almost cartoonish paragon of manly virtue\\", the \\"democratic leader who commands respect out of trust and comradely love\\". Critics see resemblances to historical or mythological figures, such as Hercules, the Greek god, or a tribute to J. M. W. Turner (1775‚Äì1851), one of the many references in the novel to that painter of sea scenes and storms, and to Edgar Allan Poe. Ch. 23 may represent the virtues of Emersonian \\"self-reliance\\" in the quest for truth, and the preference for philosophical realities. Scholars and critics offer other answers to the question of why he appeared so briefly. The literary critic Richard Chase postulated that Bulkington was the novel's \\"'true' Promethean and democratic hero\\", but one who could not play an important role because such a hero would have to resist Ahab, the novel's \\"false\\" Prometheus. He must disappear because \\"if he had been more a part of the story it would have been inevitable that that he should do what Starbuck can only try to do: oppose the command of Ahab and save the ship\\". But he is also the heroic American, the \\"hope of the world\\". In Melville's process of composition Critics have long speculated that Bulkington was introduced in an early draft but was no longer needed when Melville changed his concept of the novel from a whaling adventure to a metaphysical tale focused on Ahab's quest. The second version needed a different sort of character to contrast with Ahab, a character who turned out to be Starbuck, Pequods first mate. Melville, some scholars speculate, then inserted Chapter 23 to explain Bulkington's disappearance. \\"Detailed reconstruction of Melville's revision of Moby-Dick\\", says Delbanco, \\"is impossible since no manuscript or notes survive. But that he changed his ideas about who should lead and who should resist aboard the Pequod can hardly be doubted\\". Delbanco argues that Bulkington seems destined to play a major role in the book for he has \\"dignity, bearing, refinement\\", which make him Melville's first candidate to resist Ahab. Instead, Melville gives that role to a lesser man, Starbuck, who recognizes Ahab's madness but does not have Bulkington's strength to challenge him. \\"But why leave him in the book at all?\\", Delbanco asks. His own answer is that long before Freud, Melville was representing the unconscious in words, and Bulkington was what Freud would call a \\"memory-trace\\". One critic speculates that Melville chose not to revise chapter 3, \\"The Spouter-Inn\\", to remove Bulkington, but to add a chapter apotheosizing him as a character who, \\"though absent, represents his own artistic strivings for truth and independence of thought in the face of forces that would conspire to cast him 'on the treacherous, slavish shore'\\". Harrison Hayford speculates as part of a larger argument that Bulkington is one of a group of \\"unnecessary duplicates\\", one who was left \\"vestigial\\" when Melville changed the relation between the characters. Hayford speculates that when Melville added the character Queequeg, he took Bulkington's role as Ishmael's companion, or \\"sleeping partner\\". His implied role as \\"truth-seeker\\" was given to Starbuck. Hayford offers no guess for why Melville did not remove Bulkington entirely, \\"beyond the humdrum one that Melville, like lesser writers, found it hard to throw away good words he had written\\".

Biography Johanna Elisabeth (\\"Betsy\\" or \\"Betsie\\") Osieck was born in Amsterdam 29 December 1880 to the merchant Philip Willem Osieck and Catharina Agnes Briel. She was one of a family of five, but one of them died as a child. Westendorp-Osieck attended a French secondary school before going to a German boarding school. She intended becoming a pianist but when that proved improbable she took up art. She initially studied with the Day Drawing School for Young Ladies in 1898. Westendorp-Osieck then studied with Lizzy Ansingh in 1902. Ansingh was also one of the Joffers painting group. She went on to study in Amsterdam at the Teekenschool voor den Werkenden Stand from 1905 to 1910 and at the State Academy of Fine Arts. Her first commission was to draw a certificate for the Amsterdam cradle for Princess Juliana made by Karel de Bazel in 1909. Westendorp-Osieck married on June 21, 1917 to Herman Karel Westendorp at which point her name changed. Her husband was an art collector of Asian art and a banker. Career Westendorp-Osieck was a member of Arti et Amicitiae and the St. Luke Artists in Amsterdam. She was also a member of the Pulchri Studio in The Hague and the Dutch Watercolors Circle. As an etcher Westendorp-Osieck created a number of illustrations of the \\"Old Amsterdam garden houses\\" which was published by Bernard Houthakker in 1923. Westendorp-Osieck traveled extensively around America, Belgium, Cambodia, Ceylon, Egypt, France and Japan where she made travel sketches. Those from her 1931 trip through Asia were exhibited in both Amsterdam and The Hague. Another of her collections of etchings was published in 1932. Her husband published a book in 1933 which included etchings by Westendorp-Osieck. Westendorp-Osieck won a number of awards, a silver medal for her entry in the DeVrouw Exhibition 1913, the Willink van Collenprijs in 1915, the St. Lucas Prize in 1930, and gold medals in 1936 and at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris. In 1941 Westendorp-Osieck became a widow. She was unable to exhibit in The Netherlands because she had not joined the Kultuurkamer. After the Second World War she exhibited again. Westendorp-Osieck died in 1 March 1968 at the age of 87 in her hometown Amsterdam. Her work is in the Rijksmuseum and the Centraal Museum in the Netherlands. The best of the couples Asian art collection was donated to the Rijksmuseum, where it is known as the Westendorp-Osieck Collection.

Research  As a postdoc Schmitz developed technologies for determining the methylation status of individual cytosines in plant genomes using sequencing technologies, and used them to quantify how methylation patterned varied across different individuals of the same species. He used the same technology to map segregating differentially methylated regions in recombinant inbred populations of soybean, finding underlying genetic haplotype did not consistently predict which parent's methylation state would be observed in a given genotype. He demonstrated that the loss of Chromomethylase 3, a plant methyltransferase abolishes gene body methylation and that this loss has occurred repeatedly in wild plant species. His research group is working to use epigenetic variation to modify the phenotype of plants. They work with naturally occurring epimutations but have also developed sets of epi-RILs which have identical DNA but different DNA methylation. By using an enzyme from humans, they can remove the methylation from specifically targeted genes in plants, waking up genes which have been long dormant in the genome.https://news.uga.edu/uga-researchers-develop-new-method-improve-crops/ He is also working to apply epigenome profiling to the discovery of noncoding regulatory sequences in different plant species.

She was appointed a vestal by the Pontifex maximus, who was at that time the same person as the Emperor. In 211, Emperor Caracalla succeeded to the throne. During his reign, four vestal virgins were prosecuted for having broken their vow of chastity (crimen incesti): Aurelia Severa, Pomponia Rufina, Cannutia Crescentina and Clodia Laeta. In contrast to the usual trials of this kind, no men were named and accused as accomplices of the crime. The accused vestals were all judged guilty as charged and sentenced to death. Cannutia Crescentina avoided the execution by committing suicide. Clodia Laeta was the central figure of the trial. The trial was regarded with suspicion because no men were named or accused as the lovers of the vestals. According to Cassius Dio, it was the Emperor himself who had raped Clodia Laeta; that other three vestals were witnesses, and that they were all falsely accused to hide the crime of the Emperor.Philip Matyszak, Joanne Berry: 79.

She became the New York State Regent and a member of the National Board of Management, highest ranking woman of color in the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR),https://tv.cuny.edu/highlight/SP2000065 since it was founded in 1890. She was a pioneer of African-American genealogy. Born and raised in Brooklyn, she was a local Brooklyn historian and member of the Society of Old Brooklynites (SOB), one of the borough's oldest civic organizations. She was the author of books on Bedford-Stuyvesant as well as the Crown Heights and Weeksville sections of Brooklyn, and family genealogy books tracing her family's American roots.  Early Life & Education  Wilhelmena Rhodes Kelly was born in Brooklyn, on December 11, 1946 to George Morrell Rhodes, Jr. (b. Barnwell, South Carolina, 1921) and Dorothy Hamlin Rhodes (b. Brooklyn, New York 1924.) She was the second of two children joining her older sister, Linda Marie (b. Brooklyn, NY, 1944). The surname Kelly, acquired through an early unsuccessful marriage, was retained throughout her life. As a child, she was called \\"Mena\\". She attended Brooklyn neighborhood public schools; Lefferts Junior High School, Erasmus Hall High School and Brooklyn College (class of 1970).https://www.frankrbellfh.com/obituary/Wilhelmena-RhodesKelly Wilhelmena Rhodes Kelly was the third generation of her family to live in Brooklyn. Her grandparents had bought a brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant in 1932, and she was raised there until the age of thirteen when the family moved to Union Street in the Crown Heights section of the borough. The Brooklyn Historical Society interviewed her about her childhood experiences for their Crown Heights Oral History Project. Based upon her personal and historical knowledge of these Brooklyn areas, she later wrote books about Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights, two historically Black sections of Brooklyn. These books contain both personal and archival photographs of the borough. The importance of community activism through participation in civic life, and service to country was taught to Wilhelmena at a young age. While living at the Union Street home, the young Wilhelmena participated in Brooklyn Day and Concord Baptist Church of Christ Sunday School. An avid reader, she was especially drawn to books on history. At home, this manifested itself in her questions to her paternal grandparents about what it was like growing up in the 1890s American South, then making the move in 1930 to New York City during the Great Migration, a time period from 1916-1970 during which approximately 6 million African Americans migrated to urban Northeast location from the Southern United States. These tales also led to her life-long interest in Brooklyn history and the African American community. She was fascinated by the genealogy work of her mother and uncle, John ‚ÄúDukie‚Äù Hamlin on the Hamlin family of Virginia, who hired a professional genealogist in the 1970s to trace the family history. She later traced her interest in genealogy to these incidents. Her father, George Rhodes, was a resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant whom graduated from Boys High School and Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. He qualified for the special Army Air Force Program at Tuskegee Institute. Lt. Rhodes won distinction as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. His military exploits in an air battle in Europe were celebrated on the front page of the Amsterdam News on August 26, 1944.

She served the New York Company as its Governor for one term from early 2017 until March 30, 2019. In July 2019, she attended the 400th Anniversary of the First Meeting of the General Assembly speaking in recognition of the \\"20 and odd\\" Africans brought to Virginia in 1619.

As a Quaker and farmer, Stephen H. Hamlin did not actively participate in battles. He is documented as providing critical goods in supports of the American Revolution. These included: 1 horse (age 6 years), 3 \\"beeves\\" (750 pounds of beef), 3 sheep, 135 bushels of corn, 600 pounds of fodder and an additional 590 bushels of corn. This aid delivered to the fight for freedom qualified the family to file for membership in the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR). Wilhelmena Rhodes Kelly joined the Manhattan Chapter of the DAR in July 2004, eventually becoming Chapter Regent.https://www.post- journal.com/news/page-one/2019/04/famed-daughters/ In July 2012, she was the Organizing Regent for the Increase Carpenter Chapter of DAR, located in Jamaica, Queens, New York. In that capacity, she often served as a link between the Borough of Queens and its colonial history. That first year, she was a guest at the Kingsland Homestead in Flushing, Queens, site of the Weeping Beech, the mother of all European weeping beeches in the United States. Here, she presented a Newtown Pippen apple tree to the Queens Historical Society on behalf of the chapter. The tree was deemed the official apple of New York City in 2009 by a New York City Council resolution. Within DAR, she served as National Chairman of Public Relations and Media, National Vice Chairman of the Commemorative Events Committee, during which she designed a tri-color flag in recognition of the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011.

Designed at Vandestadt, the Sirius 21/22 was an innovative boat and indeed is said to be the first North American production-built, ballasted cruising boat with positive flotation. In a more expensive procedure, closed- cell foam was injected into some compartments, then into the gap between the inner and outer hull the full length and up to the deck level. The foam stiffened the hull, provided sound and head insulation as well as buoyancy. Of course, with foam-injection construction, there is some loss of space in the interior as well as in stowage lockers.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Cal 20 *Core Sound 20 Mark 3 *Flicka 20 *Halman 20 *Hunter 19 (Europa) *Hunter 20 *Hunter 212 *Mistral T-21 *Paceship 20 *Sandpiper 565 *San Juan 21 ReferencesExternal links * Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Trailer sailers ","title":"Sirius 22"},{"id":"64306345","text":"Major-General Richard Deare Furley Oldman (31 June 1877 ‚Äì 1943) was a British Army officer.

Lenna Hall is recital and rehearsal hall, located on the grounds of the Chautauqua Institution, in western New York. Background The facility was built and dedicated in 1993. It was the first major program facility to be built at the Chautauqua Institution in 65 years. The building was a gift to Chautauqua Institution from Reginald Lenna (le-nƒÅ'), a retired local industrialist, in honor of his wife. The original cost of the hall was $2 million, which is (equivalent to $ million in ). Design Chautauqua Institution had long needed a rehearsal facility for its world-class symphony orchestra, which is in residence during the summer season each year. Also needed was a recital hall that could seat several hundred. The result was a dual-purpose building that uses state of the art acoustic control to accommodate both functions. A small hall works well for recitals, but sound can be overwhelming in a small hall when an orchestra performs. Moveable automated draperies and sound-absorbing panels were included in the design of the 8,000-square foot hall to absorb and dampen sound and control reverberation. Tiers of seating collapse into the walls and into a pit in the floor for rapid conversion from recitals to symphony rehearsals. The building has cedar exterior and blends well with the rural landscape of the location. It was designed by Assembly Places International of Philadelphia. Acoustical consultants were Klepper and Marshall and King of White Plains, New York. Uses The Elizabeth S. Lenna Hall is the rehearsal facility for the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra and the Music School Festival Orchestra. It is also a recital hall for chamber music, voice, and piano and hosts many events each season. The facility can accommodate a recital audience of 500 with 30 performers or a 100-piece symphony orchestra in rehearsal with no audience. In 1996, Bill Clinton used the facility to prepare for a televised presidential debate with his opponent, Bob Dole.

Now a farmhouse, it stands at the top of Newby Head Pass on the B6255 road between Ingleton and Hawes. Newby Head is around above sea level. Drover's Inn When Newby Head was an drovers' inn, it was the fourth highest inn in England. There was plenty of custom from the drovers bringing sheep and cattle to and from Scotland. The land around Newby Head is mostly peat and limestone and has the source of the River Ribble bubbling out of it. Newby Head Inn was an alternative to the renowned drovers inn and weekly market at Gearstones selling meat, flour, animals and vegetables just a couple of miles down the road. Winters are very harsh in the Yorkshire Dales. In the past winters the RAF was drafted in to drop hay and food supplies for the farmers and animals. There are also signs of now-abandoned settlements around Newby Head. The inn at Newby Head was a drovers' inn and roadside inn for travellers on the Richmond to Lancaster Turnpike road. There drovers, packmen and other travellers called in for a drink and to stay the night. The lodgings were basic and not only were rooms shared, but beds were shared as well as was often the custom of the past centuries. In January 1843, an inquest was held at Newby Head Inn by the Skipton coroner Thomas Brown. Isaac Mason, a native of Kendal, had been found dead in bed. According to the landlord and the person who shared the bed, he went downstairs to get a candle for light. When he returned he found Isaac Mason dead. The verdict was died by the 'visitation of God'. The inn stood at 1425 feet above sea level in desolate countryside. Thomas Guy was innkeeper in 1821. Edmund Thistlethwaite was landlord in 1841 and by 1851 John Swinbank had taken over. In 1905 the landlord changed from Christopher Swinback to Simeon Parker. The Swinbanks had been at Newby Head at least since 1851 when John Swinbank was 'victualler and farmer' with 170 acres of land. It was one of the outlying inns which the magistrates were keen to close around the turn of the century mainly because it was too far out from the towns to supervise and they saw no real need for it. It was always a farm and after its closure as an inn in 1919 it returned to full-time farming.  Newby Head Pass  Newby Head Pass is a mountain pass situated on the top section of the B6255 between Hawes and Ingleton, North Yorkshire in England. Newby Head Pass was named after the Drovers Inn at Newby Head at the top of the Pass. Newby Head Pass stands at an altitude of above sea level and sits in two districts, Craven and Richmondshire.

St Gerard's Catholic Catholic Church is situated in Borrowdale, Greystone Park in Harare, Zimbabwe. The church is styled on the circular cathedral in Liverpool except that it is smaller. History It was in 1959 when Fr Gerald Hughes, C.Ss.R, who was the Provincial Superior of the Redemptorists in London, got a request from Archbishop Framcis Markall SJ to come and work in the Archdiocese of Harare. When the request came the Redemptorists who were already in South Africa, began to plan to come to Zimbabwe. This eventually became a reality in 1960 when Fr Gerald Hughes sent out Fr Phillip Foster and Fr Antony Pathe to Zimbabwe (Rhodesia). They arrived in August 1959. The Redemptorists at the time where very much interested in coming to work in Harare precisely because they felt that through living and working in this place they would be very close to fulfilling the very reason why the Congregation was founded ‚Äì service of the marginalised poor. When they were given the parish of St Gerard it was not always affluent, but a farming community. Therefore, they were not only serving the elite white community but also the marginalised black community that lived in the farms as farm labourers. At the time, there were very few schools available for the farm labourers children. Therefore, the Redemptorists were the first to put up makeshift schools for these children and to teach them formal education in the parish of St Gerard's. This was eventually stopped by the Smith regime, the white government at that time putting an end the Redemptorist's desire to spread the good news through the ministry of education.

He then moved back to University of Manchester as a Lecturer and was promoted to Chair of inorganic chemistry in 2007. McInnes's research in general is based on inorganic chemistry and magnetochemistry, specifically on molecular magnetism, EPR spectroscopy and coordination chemistry. Apart from research and lecturing, McInnes was also the Chair in the 50th, 51st and 52nd international meeting of the Royal Society of Chemistry ESR group.

Chilton, Richard Winpenny, David Collison, Grigore Timco and Floriana Tuna.  Notable work  In 2016, McInnes confirmed the capability to use pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure the covalency of actinide complexes in a research in collaboration with Floriana Tuna and David P. Mills at the University of Manchester. Prior to this research, the extent of covalency in actinide complexes was less understood as this nature of bonding was not studied due to limited technology and methods of experimentation at the time. The use of pulsed EPR spectroscopy was able to determine the covalency of thorium(III) and Uranium(III) complexes for the first time and this paved the way to further research on the use of these complexes in the separation and recycling of nuclear waste.

It is located within Olympic National Park. At high, Martin Peak is the seventh-highest peak of the Olympic Mountains, and the second-highest peak in The Needles range, which is a subset of the Olympic range. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Johnson, to the north-northwest. Precipitation runoff from this peak drains west into headwaters of Gray Wolf River, or east into Royal Creek, both of which are part of the Dungeness River drainage basin. Martin Peak was given its name based on the first ascent in 1940 by George W. Martin (1901‚Äì1970), and Elvin Johnson. Climate Martin Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. However, Martin's location puts it in the rain shadow of the Olympic Range, resulting in less precipitation than Mount Olympus and the western Olympics receive. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing this peak.Martin Peak, climbersguideolympics.com Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

She bequeathed all of her property to the National Trust. Biography Rosalie Caroline Chichester was born in Arlington Court in Devon on 29 November 1865. She was the daughter of Sir Alexander Palmer Bruce Chichester and Rosalie Amelia Chamberlayne. Her paternal grandfather Sir John Chichester was the MP for Barnstaple in 1831. Chichester was educated at home by a governess and was trained in etiquette and genealogy. Chichester was presented as a debutante in 1885. Despite this and her sizable estate, Chichester never married. She gave her time and support to the local charities and events and held positions in a number of local clubs. Though her father died when she was sixteen, leaving the family in serious debt, Chichester managed to keep the estate debt free though it took from 1881 until 1928 to do so. Chichester was a member of the Primrose League from 1885 to 1890. She was also involved with botany and photography. She took and processed photos of the tenants of the estate and won awards for her photography. She was also a competent artist and has left a number of pieces which are on display in her home. A supporter of wildlife, Chichester's land was a sanctuary against hunting and shooting. From her travels, Chichester wrote articles for the North Devon Journal and the Daily Sketch. Chichester's paid companion from 1912 until World War II was a Miss Chrissie Peters. The First World War saw Chichester on the Devon War Agricultural Appeal Tribunal as well as supporting the Women's Land Army. Chichester joined the suffrage movement in 1913 but was opposed to violent actions. Chichester believed in the National Trust and gave Morte Point, Devon to them by 1911. She left the intact Arlington Court estate to the trust when she died on 17 January 1949 in Parade House, Woolacombe, Devon.

He was the second abbot of the great monastery of Mount Izla after its founder, Abraham of Kashkar. Giuseppe Assemani conflated him with Dadisho ø Qa·π≠raya, who lived a century later. The biography of Dadisho ø written by his successor as abbot, Babai the Great, is lost, but it was used as a source for Isho ødna·∏•'s Book of Chastity (8th century) and Thomas of Marga's Book of Governors (9th century). According to Isho ødna·∏•, his family came from Beth Aramaye, but Babai says in another work that they were from Beth Daraye. In his youth, he studied in the school of Nisibis and later that of Arbela. Upon completing his formal education, he went into the mountains of Adiabene to live as an anchorite. In Adiabene, Dadisho ø was joined by several disciples, including Sahrowai, the future bishop of Arzun. He moved to the diocese of Marga and lived seven years in the monastery of Risha under Abbot Stephen the Great. He was one of Abraham of Kashkar's first disciples at Mount Izla, which is why he was chosen as Abraham's successor. Later sources, however, do not treat him as one of Abraham's spiritual children. According to Isho ødna·∏•, he governed the monastery as ri≈°dayra (leader of the community) for only three months after the death of Abraham in 588. His rule is ignore completely in the Khuzistan Chronicle. He died at the age of 75 in the year 604, as shown by the Chronicle of Seert. He was regarded as a saint. Eastern saints' calendars list him among the founders of Mount Izla. Thomas of Marga called him \\"meek and lowly\\". Dadisho ø extended and completed the monastic rule written by his predecessor. He took it in a more centralizing and cenobitic direction. It is preserved in the Synodicon Orientale.

This was in 1945 while advising Jay Forrester in developing flight simulators and anti-aircraft fire control devices during World War II, before practical digital computers had been produced.; ; His similar foresight on related issues led to his heading twelve years later the design team for IBM's SABRE project, the ticketing system for American Airlines, the first large-scale commercial application of real-time computer systems, which became the model for on-line transaction processing. Early life and education Crawford was born in Medford, Oregon, where his father, Perry Crawford Sr., an engineering graduate of Stanford University, oversaw construction on the Klamath River Hydroelectric Project. His mother, Irma Zschokke Crawford, also a Stanford graduate, was an artist and a descendant of the Swiss writer and revolutionary figure, Heinrich Zschokke.; When his father became president of American Utilities Service Corporation in Chicago, Crawford attended New Trier Township High School in Winnetka, Illinois. He entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1936 to study electrical engineering and came to work under Vannevar Bush with fellow student Claude Shannon on the differential analyzer. The theses for his two degrees are considered to be among the earliest modern computer design documents. His B.Sc thesis, \\"Instrumental Analysis in Matrix Algebra\\" was completed in 1939. In summary: > Sketches the design of \\"an automatically controlled calculating machine\\" > capable of performing a variety of matrix calculations, and incorporating > means for scanning digital data represented on punched tape, for adding, > subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers, and for storing and > printing or punching the data. A punched tape was to be used for sequence > control, which would specify the selection of the numbers to be operated on, > the operation to be performed, and the disposal of the result. When Shannon completed his doctorate, Crawford succeeded him in the Center for Analysis as a postgraduate student. His M.Sc. thesis, \\"Automatic Control by Arithmetic Operations,\\" (1942), continued the theme: > It is the purpose of this thesis to describe the elements and operation of a > calculating system for performing one of the operations in the control of > anti-aircraft gunfire, which is, namely, the prediction of the future > position of the target. It is to be emphasized at the outset that little > progress has been made toward the construction of automatic electronic > calculating systems for any purpose. ... It can be proposed only that this > thesis shows a possible approach to the design of a number of calculating > system elements and to the structure of an arithmetical predictor. ... In > this introduction, equipment for performing the operations occurring in > automatic calculating is described. This equipment includes electronic > switching elements, devices for multiplying two numbers, finding a function > of a variable, recording numbers, translating mechanical displacements into > numerical data, and for translating numerical data into mechanical > displacements. The thesis included a description of a matrix \\"selector switch,\\" for implementing an arbitrary function or control sequence. Independently invented by Jan A. Rajchman, this device was incorporated, with acknowledgments, in the ENIAC.; in a 1975 interview, J. Presper Eckert, a designer of the ENIAC, described another contribution: > I had gotten the idea of using disks for memory, digital memory, from a > master's thesis written by Perry Crawford at MIT. He had not built any such > disks; it was just speculation.  Career = Office of Naval Research  From 1942 to 1945 Crawford served as a civilian attached to the Navy's Special Devices Section (a predecessor of the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division) at Sands Point, Long Island. In 1946 this became the Special Devices Center under the newly created Office of Naval Research (ONR). Crawford supervised the Navy Ballistics Computation Program until September 1948 when he accepted a temporary position with the Research and Development Board of the Department of Defense. As head of the computer section in ONR he came into contact with Jay Forrester at MIT who, with his collaborator Robert Everett (computer scientist), headed a project that had roots in developing flight simulators for pilot training and evolved into the Whirlwind Project which in turn prepared the way for the air-defense application SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). From Forrester's point of view, Crawford was a significant contributor and supporter whom he described as \\"uninhibited, not restrained by protocol or chain of command, and a freewheeling intervener in many circles of activity\\": > Perry Crawford was an electrical engineering graduate of MIT and a person > with continually unfolding visions of futures that others had not yet > glimpsed. He was the first person in about 1946 to call my attention to the > possibility of digital rather than analog computers. He was always looking, > listening, and projecting new ideas into the future. ... In the fall of > 1947, following conversations with Perry Crawford, we wrote two documents, > numbered L-1 and L-2, that showed how digital computers could manage a Naval > task force and interpret radar data. In July 1948, at a conference at the > University of California in Los Angeles, Crawford proposed using computers > for the control of aircraft. On March 18, 1949, at a panel meeting of the > Research and Development Board, he pushed the idea of digital computers in > an air defense system. Crawford also contributed to the Moore School Lectures with a talk entitled \\"Applications of Digital Computation Involving Continuous Input and Output Variables\\" (August 5, 1946). It discussed such topics as missile and combat simulations and was originally classified as confidential and not published until . He stressed his conviction that these applications could best be performed with the aid of digital computers, a thesis many did not agree with at the time. He gave a talk at a session on electronic computers at the 1947 conference of the Institute of Radio Engineers on \\"Applications of Electronic Digital Computers\\" which was summarized in the program: > A discussion of computer applications, including scientific calculations, > wave propagation, and aerodynamics. Comments will be made on the future > relation of analogue and digital computers, and also on the possible > engineering application of electronic digital computers to automatic process > and factory control, air traffic control, and business calculations.  International Business Machines  Crawford left his civilian service in the Navy in 1952 to join IBM. The company had been working with the military on SAGE and anticipated further developments in real-time applications. in 1954 Thomas J. Watson, Jr., son of IBM's founder, oversaw Crawford's placement, along with Hans Peter Luhn, to head the design team for creating a digital computer system for managing American Airline's reservations and ticketing.; Named SABRE (Semi-Automatic Research Environment), it soon grew to managing the total operation: flight planning, crew schedules, special meals, etc. > The project was at the time easily the largest civilian computerization task > ever undertaken, involving some 200 technical personnel producing a million > lines of program code. ... By the early 1970s all the major carriers > possessed reliable real-time systems and communications networks that had > become an essential component of their operations, second in importance only > to the airplanes themselves. Crawford continued in IBM until his retirement in 1988 working towards what he saw as a necessary \\"computer transition\\" as outlined in his 1979 publication below, but otherwise rarely publicized outside of IBM. In a 1980 interview R. Blair Smith, the IBM marketing manager whose contact with American Airlines initiated SABRE, described Crawford's Imaging project: > It's a shame we didn't bring it out, but there was a great need for Perry > Crawford's concept of imaging. ... Perry's idea was to eliminate typical > application programming altogether by having a master program; then have all > of the data concerned with, say, running a given business available and > identified in the computer. Then if somebody wanted a report of any kind, > all he had to do was to tell the computer what was wanted, identify the data > from which it would be drawn, and out would come the result. Now, that's an > over-simplification. Obviously it would be terribly complex to do. It was a > most difficult job, and it never got off the ground. ... I told him he'd > have a tough time, because with the status of programming the way it is > today, after all of these years of programming, and the programming > languages we have developed, introducing the Imaging concept would be about > as difficult as converting the typical American to the metric system today.

On 20 September, the post was attacked by Chinese forces from the Thagla Ridge to the north, and sporadic fighting continued till 20 October when an all-out attack was launched by China leading to the Sino-Indian War. Facing an overwhelming force, the Indian Army evacuated the Dhola Post as well as the entire area of Tawang, retreating to Sela and Bomdila.  Location and background  The McMahon Line in the Tawang sector The disputed territory is the area adjacent to the Nyamjang Chu river, which originates in Tibet and flows into Indian-controlled Assam Himalayan region (North-East Frontier Agency, now called Arunachal Pradesh). The map attached to the 1914 Simla Convention, displaying the border between Tibet and the Assam Himalayan region (called the McMahon Line), showed a straight line border running east‚Äìwest in the vicinity of the Nyamjang Chu river, cutting across a ridge called Tsangdhar. Immediately to the north of Tsangdhar ridge is a higher Thagla Ridge (or Tang La Ridge or Che Dong in Chinese nomenclature). The Namka Chu river, long, flows in the valley between the two ridges, west to east, joining Nyamjang Chu at the bottom. At the foot of the Thagla Ridge in the Nyamjang Chu valley, about 2.5 km north from the mouth of Namkha Chu, is a grazing ground called Khinzemane. At the northeastern tip of the ridge is located the Tibetan village of Le (also spelt Lei or Lai). The villagers of Le as well as those of the village Lumpo to the south are said to have traditionally used the Khinzemane grazing ground. The Indian government claimed that the grazing ground belonged to Lumpo and the villagers of Le had to pay rent to Lumpo for its use. The Indians held that the boundary was supposed to follow the Himalayan watershed, which was clearly on the Thagla Ridge. They believed that the 1914 map incorrectly depicted the border due to inadequate exploration at that time and that the correct border was on the Thagla Ridge. In 1959, India had placed a post at Khinzemane at the foot of the Thagla Ridge. The Chinese forces attacked it and forced it to retreat. After some exchanges in the diplomatic channels, India reinstated the post. During the officials' level border negotiations between the India and China in 1960, the issue was thoroughly discussed, even though it did not result in any agreement.: \\"[Indian] Army Headquarters had been sent the minutes of the officials' talks of 1960, as well as the final Officials' Report, in which this issue had been addressed. During the officials' talks the Chinese had also been told of the Indian view on correcting a map-drawn line; that is, the need to correlate it with the actual features on the ground. If a feature such as Thagla Ridge had not been explored when the map was issued, and if the map-drawn boundary was supposed to be set by the watershed ridge, then the line lay on the watershed ridge despite the error on the map.\\" China continued to maintain that Khinzemane was Chinese territory.  Establishment  In late 1961, India settled on what came to be called a 'forward policy' to circumvent the Chinese expansion into the disputed areas, asking its Army to \\"go as far as practicable ... and be in effective occupation of the whole frontier\\". In the northeast frontier, Assam Rifles was tasked with setting up posts all along the McMahon Line. The Dhola Post came into being as part of this effort. The Dhola Post was located on the northern slopes of the Tsangdhar ridge, close to the Namkha Chu valley, at about 300 metres above the level of the river. The Indian official history of the war states that the post was able to dominate the Namkha Chu valley, but it was itself dominated by the Thagla Ridge to the north. The terrain was extremely difficult: thickly wooded mountain slopes led to the area via walking tracks in narrow gorges. The closest inhabitable place was the village of Lumpo at a distance of . The posts had to be supplied by air and the nearest air drop location was on top of the Tsangdhar ridge. A walking track was established along the mountain slope facing the Namjyang Chu valley, leading from Lumpo to a depression called Hatung La on the Tangdhar ridge. At an intermediate location called Zirkhim (or Serkhim) a helipad was constructed. The villages of Lumpo and Zemithang also had helipads, the latter able to take MI-4 Russian helicopters. The army officer who commanded the Assam Rifles platoon, Captain Mahabir Prasad, questioned the siting of the post immediately after returning to base. He informed the Divisional Headquarters that, according to the local Intelligence Bureau sources, the Chinese knew about the Dhola Post and regarded the location as Chinese territory. They would be ready to occupy it as soon as they received orders. The Divisional Commander, Maj. Gen. Niranjan Prasad, queried the higher officers whether the territory was properly Indian, but did not receive a response. His superior, Lt. Gen. Umrao Singh commanding the XXXIII Corps, expressed his own doubts about the legality of the territory, which were also greeted with no response. Eventually the matter was referred to Sarvepalli Gopal heading the Historical Division of the Ministry of External Affairs, who answered in the affirmative, citing the Officials' Report. But before the information trickled down to the commanders, matters came to a head.  Indian hesitations  When General Prasad, the divisional commander, did not receive a reply to his query about the boundary, he assessed that it made tactical sense to occupy the Thagla Ridge preemptively. He sought permission from the Army headquarters to do so. Before the headquarters made up its mind, the Chinese occupied the Thagla Ridge on 8 September 1962.: \\"Prasad thought that if the area did belong to India it made better tactical sense to occupy the Thagla ridge itself. He sought permission for a pre-emptive occupation of the ridge. By the time the army headquarters obtained a clarification from the MEA‚Äôs historical division and passed it on, the PLA had occupied the Thagla ridge on 8 September.\\": \\"The division commander referred the question of whether the territory was properly Indian to higher echelons in the army command chain, and two weeks later... asked for permission to occupy the Thagla Ridge preemptively. Before any reply was received, he learned that the Chinese had recently carried out military exercises in the Dhola area and had already constructed brigade-strength (but not permanently occupied) defensive positions on Thagla Ridge. To Prasad this news precluded Indian occupation of the ridge, since the Chinese could now move onto it at short notice.\\" Scholars find the inefficiencies of the Army command responsible for the Indian inaction, but at the same time the lack of clarity on where the border lay and indecision on how far to go in confronting the Chinese seem to have played a role. In contrast, the Chinese moved decisively.: \\"Therefore, the unresponsiveness of higher echelons to the questions raised by Prasad..., the need for personal intervention by Palit, the referral to the MEA..., and the fact that Army Headquarters did not respond to Gopal's information with a clear decision...‚Äîall served to prevent a preemptive Indian move. The Chinese were allowed to occupy Thagla Ridge first, starting on 8 September.\\" Having occupied the Thagla Ridge, the Chinese entered the Namka Chu valley on the southwestern side of the ridge and threatened the Dhola Post. The Indian Army high command saw the Chinese action as an attempt to replicate in Assam Himalaya the kind of encroachments they were already conducting in Aksai Chin. It was felt that a show of determination was called for to forestall any further encroachments; a 'no alternative' situation, in the words of scholar Steven Hoffmann. Indeed, the opposition parties were vying for blood. The Swatantra Party led by Rajagopalachari asked for Nehru's resignation. In a meeting chaired by defence minister Krishna Menon, it was decided that India would use force \\"to expel the Chinese from the south of the Thagla [Ridge]\\". The Army headquarters ordered 7th Infantry Brigade to move to Dhola to deal with the Chinese investment of the post. The local commanders thought the operation to be utterly infeasible. Umrao Singh argued that the Chinese could easily outstrip any effort by India to induct new troops into the area since they had a roadhead leading to their positions. He recommended withdrawing the Dhola Post to the south of the map-marked McMahon Line. He was overruled by General L. P. Sen, in charge of the Eastern Command. In Sen's view any intrusion into Indian territory was unacceptable to the Indian government and the intrusion must be thrown out by force. Fighting broke out on 20 September and continued for ten days. L. P. Sen asked for plans for dislodging the Chinese from the Thagla Ridge. The corps commander, who thought it infeasible, produced logistical requirements that were impossible to meet. Sen asked the high command for Umrao Singh to be replaced. The high command divested Umrao Singh's XXXIII Corps of responsibility for Assam Himalaya, and gave it to IV Corps. The Chief of General Staff B. M. Kaul was asked to head the new formation. IV Corps' troops in the area were inadequate and Kaul is said to have lacked combat experience.: \\"Lt. General Kaul, who had no combat experience, was made Commander of the IV Corps, a newly raised Corps.\\"  Skirmishes  Kaul toured Dhola Post and nearby locations on 6, 7 and 8 October. Despite the obvious difficulties Kaul perceived, Kaul remained determined to execute the plan of evicting the Chinese. His orders were to complete the operation by 10 October. The few days he had been there, Kaul knew that Thagla was tactically out of reach, so on the 9 October, he sent soldiers of 9 Punjab to Thagla Ridge and establish themselves anywhere on it towards Yumtso La which was adjacent to Thagla. The soldiers came face to face with the Chinese and a brief skirmish took place at Tseng Jong.  Clash at Tseng Jong  The clash at Tseng Jong resulted in Indian casualties of 6 dead and 11 wounded; Chinese media announced their casualties as 77 dead. Both sides had numerous injures.Sanjay Sethi (Autumn 2013). Confrontation at Thag La: Indo China War 1962. pp 120‚Äì123. Scholar Warrior, CLAWS. Following the clash at Tseng Jong it was clear to General Kaul that the Chinese meant to confront Indian actions. Leaving Brigadier Dalvi incharge, Gen Kaul went to Delhi to explain the situation. Arriving in Delhi on 11 he unsuccessfully tried to convince the leadership to pull back the troops to a defensible position. Gen Kaul went back to the front, but on 17 October Kaul fell ill and returned to Delhi. Brigadier Dalvi had not been informed of Kaul's departure for Delhi. Further, Brigadier Dalvi was at Zimithang, and when the attack on Namka Chu did start, he could not give out clear instructions due to cut communication lines as well as the lack of staff at Zimithang. On 20 October, when the Chinese attacked, there was no one in command of IV Corps.  Massacre at Namka Chu  The battle of Namka Chu started at 5:14 am on 20 October 1962 with Chinese artillery bombardment on Indian positions in Namka Chu and Tsangdhar. After an hour, the Chinese infantry assault began. Indian defences at Namka Chu were attacked from both the front and rear. Positions of the 2 Rajputs and 1/9 Gorkhas were soon overrun with rear positions also being infiltrated by the Chinese. In one hour 7 Infantry Brigade was dismantled. By 8 am some \\"stragglers\\" from 1/9 Gorkha reached Brigade HQ. Brigadier Dalvi got permission to withdraw to Tsangdhar but since it had been overrun, he moved to Serkhim. However on 22 October they were also captured by a Chinese patrol. 9 Punjab and Grenadiers managed to escape through Bhutan after receiving orders for the same. It took them 17 days, ending the battle of Namka Chu. 2 Rajput had consisted of 513 of all ranks out of which 282 killed in the morning and many were captured while 60 men escaped. The Gorkhas lost 80 with 102 captured. 7 Infantry Brigade lost 493 men in the morning of 20 October.

A. Cotton was a Confederate sidewheel partial ironclad gunboat that was burned by her own crew in Bayou Teche off Brashear City, Louisiana, United States on 15 January 1863 to prevent her being captured by Union forces after she was badly damaged in a battle against United States Navy gunboats.  Construction  J. A. Cotton was built in Jeffersonville, Indiana, United States in 1861. Where she was launched and completed that same year. The ship was taken into Confederate service by 1862. She was assessed at and was armed with a 32-pounder smoothbore and a 9-pounder rifle. The ship was also modified with a cotton-and-timber casemate. She also had a small amount of railroad iron fitted onto her side, which could classify her as an ironclad.  American Civil War Service and Loss  J. A. Cotton was in use as a gunboat for the Confederate side of the American Civil War and mainly operated in Berwick Bay and Bayou Teche. It was in Bayou Teche where she would see her first action of the war as on 3 November 1862, J. A. Cotton engaged the four Union gunboats USS Kinsman, USS Calhoun, USS Estrella and USS Diana near Cornay's Bridge. J. A. Cotton stood her ground against the combined 27 gun barrage from the Union gunboats for one and a half hours, being only hit a few times but without causing major damage to the vessel. In comparison all Union gunboats were hit and slightly damaged with USS Kinsman being hit more than 50 times, resulting in the deaths of two crew with four more being wounded. During the following two days, the Union gunboats engaged J. A. Cotton twice more in battle. Both encounters had the same outcome as the first with both sides suffering only light casualties and damage.Gaines, p. 67. J. A. Cottons next encounter would occur on 14 January 1863 as she was ordered to attack Union general Godfrey Weitzel's forces at Berwick Bay, Louisiana. However Weitzel had learned of her plan and send out the four gunboats which had encountered J. A. Cotton in November 1862 to fight her again. The Union gunboats steamed into the Bayou Teche alongside Union transports to attack J. A. Cotton and Confederate shore batteries stationed at Bayou Teche below Franklin, Louisiana. When the opposing forces finally met, the Union gunboats fought J. A. Cotton again while the Union's land-based units engaged the Confederate infantry in rifle pits. The battle would carry on into the following day and by the night of 15 January 1863 with J. A. Cotton had gotten badly damaged in the fighting. Seeing no way of saving the ship, her crew set the ship ablaze to potentially serve as a blockship and especially to avoid being captured by the enemy off Brashear City, Louisiana, United States.

The organization‚Äôs mission statement is as follows: ‚ÄúRemineralize the Earth (RTE) promotes the use of natural land and sea-based minerals to restore soils and forests, produce more nutritious food, and remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere‚Äù. RTE‚Äôs vision is to overcome desertification, increase food security by increasing the yields and nutritional values of food grown in healthy soils, and stabilize the climate by amending soils and forests across the globe with readily available and finely ground silicate rock dust and sea minerals. Education and increasing public awareness about soil remineralization's potential benefits are some of RTE's primary efforts. They are currently working on a science curriculum for K-12 students encompassing multiple aspects of the soil remineralization topic, such as botany, sustainable agriculture, nutrition, and geology. The curriculum draws from information compiled on the organization's website, which happens to contain the only research database entirely dedicated to soil remineralization and related projects around the world. The projects and research papers on the website include information and case studies on \\"reversing global desertification through agroforestry and reforestation, sequestering carbon, and stabilizing the climate.\\" Working from that body of knowledge, RTE has recently partnered with the University of Brasilia on an agricultural remineralization project, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst on researching combinations of biochar and rock dust, again for agriculture.  History = Origins  From the mid-80's, Joanna Campe has been folding rock powders into her garden after she came across the work of John D. Hamaker, an engineer turned farmer and writer, who argued that rock dust could mimic the action of soil-enhancing glaciers. Later in 1986, Joanna Campe launched Soil Remineralization, A Network Newsletter in Northampton, Massachusetts with the goal of facilitating the international grassroots movement of soil remineralization. In 1991, it became Remineralize the Earth Magazine, with a circulation of 2500 people, before making its transition in 1995, to become the 501(c)(3) non-profit organization it is today. Remineralize the Earth was founded on the principles and growing movement of soil remineralization, advocating the use of natural mineral sources as fertilizers. Although the use of rocks and minerals for agricultural development has been around for centuries, investigating the power of soil remineralization through natural mineral sources only began in the 19th century. RTE‚Äôs foundation can be credited to the individuals and groups who pioneered work in this field. They belonged to one of three distinct groups/areas of work: European research, agrogeology, and the grassroots movement of soil remineralization.

Guill√©n had been missing since April 22 when some of her dismembered remains were found buried along the Leon River on June 30. Upon hearing about the discovery of Guill√©n‚Äôs remains, Robinson fled Fort Hood, and fatally shot himself when law enforcement attempted to apprehend him in Killeen, Texas, shortly after midnight. A local woman, whom authorities said was Robinson's girlfriend, was taken into custody and is alleged to have assisted Robinson in disposing of Guill√©n's body. On July 2, she was charged with one federal count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.  People involved  Vanessa Guill√©n in 2018 *Vanessa Guill√©n, 20, was from Houston, Texas. She was born in Ben Taub Hospital in Houston on September 30, 1999, to parents Rogelio and Gloria Guill√©n, who originated from Zacatecas State in Mexico. She had five siblings. She attended Hartman Middle School and, according to her family, graduated from C√©sar E. Ch√°vez High School in 2018 in the top 15% of her class, played soccer (association football), loved to jog, and enjoyed sports and learning. She joined the Army in June 2018 and trained as a 91F, small arms and artillery repairer. Guill√©n was posthumously advanced from private first class to the rank of specialist on July 1, 2020. *Aaron David Robinson, 20, was from Calumet City, a southern suburb of Chicago, Illinois. Robinson joined the Army in October 2017 and trained as a combat engineer. He held the rank of specialist at the time of his death. *Cecily Anne Aguilar, 22, described by authorities as the girlfriend of Aaron Robinson and estranged wife of another soldier. Investigation Guill√©n was last seen around 1:00 p.m. on April 22, 2020, in the parking lot of her unit, the Regimental Engineer Squadron Headquarters of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment (3CR). Fort Hood is a U.S. Army post approximately in size and home to III Corps and the First Cavalry Division. Guillen's car keys, identification card, bank card, and barracks key were found inside the armory where she worked. Her family felt Guill√©n disappeared under suspicious circumstances. The case was investigated under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation with Bell County Sheriff's Office, Killeen Police Department, Belton Police Department, Texas Parks and Wildlife, the United States Marshal Service, and the Texas Rangers in support. Multiple Fort Hood units, including 3CR, began searching within two weeks of her disappearance. Before Guill√©n went missing, she had told her family that she was being sexually harassed by an unnamed sergeant at Fort Hood, and that complaints by other female soldiers made against him had been dismissed. Her mother advised her to report him, but Guill√©n responded that \\"she could put a stop to it herself\\" out of fear that her mother would be harmed for making a report. In early June, her mother told reporters she did not trust the U.S. Army's handling of the investigation, and her attorney, Natalie Khawam, said she believed the family was \\"being kept in the dark\\" because few details had been released regarding Guill√©n's disappearance. On June 13, 2020, hundreds of people assembled at the gates of Fort Hood to protest what organizers felt was a lack of information on the case. CID reported that they found no evidence that Guill√©n was assaulted, but said investigators believed foul play was involved in her disappearance. A United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel hearing, chaired by Jackie Speier, about the killing of Guill√©n in July 2020. On June 17, the League of United Latin American Citizens added a $25,000 reward to the existing $25,000 reward announced by the U.S. Army for finding Guill√©n. On June 23, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, in whose district the Guill√©n family resides, met with Fort Hood officials to discuss the ongoing search for Guill√©n. The authorities said that more than 300 interviews and over 10,000 hours were spent investigating Gulli√©n's disappearance. On July 27, 2020, Gloria Guillen, mother of Vanessa Guillen, was granted parole in place by DHS, through the assistance of Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia and immigration attorney Luis Gomez Alfaro.  Discovery of remains  On June 30, 2020, Army Investigators were called when contractors discovered partial human remains along the Leon River, in Belton. The area had previously been searched by Texas Rangers, detectives, and cadaver dogs on June 20 after a burn mound was discovered nearby. Investigators theorized that the remains, previously buried under concrete, had been dug up by wildlife. Tim Miller, Director of Texas EquuSearch, stated that it was the most sophisticated burial site he had ever seen. Later that evening around 8:30pm, authorities re-interviewed Cecily Anne Aguilar, a local area woman who was the estranged wife of a soldier at Fort Hood. Aguilar was reported to be the girlfriend of Aaron David Robinson, a junior enlisted soldier. Robinson was one of the last known people to see Guill√©n on the day of her disappearance and had previously been interviewed by authorities in the case, where he‚Äôd stated their contact that day was about equipment she was working on. Aguilar told police that Robinson told her about killing a female soldier on Fort Hood. At the request of law enforcement, Aguilar placed a controlled telephone call to Robinson, who said \\"baby they found pieces\\" and texted Aguilar multiple news articles, to which he never denied anything in response. According to a criminal complaint filed in the Western District Court of Texas, Aguilar allegedly helped Robinson dismember and dispose of Guill√©n's body on April 22, 2020, after Robinson told her he had bludgeoned Guill√©n to death with a hammer inside the Armory in which he worked. Arrests On the evening of June 30, Robinson left the base unobserved, after hearing the news of the discovery of remains. Soldiers were supposed to be confined to their barracks rooms, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the early hours of July 1, 2020, Killeen police located and attempted to make contact with Robinson, who produced a handgun and killed himself before he could be taken into custody. Aguilar was arrested by Texas Rangers and held at the Bell County Jail. On July 2, Bell County officials stated Aguilar would be transferred to federal custody due to being charged with one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence by the United States Attorney's Office Western District of Texas. Assistant United States Attorneys Mark Frazier and Greg Gloff are prosecuting the case on behalf of the United States Government.

O'Grady (born 1929) is a former law enforcement official who served as Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department and Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois. Early life O'Grady was born in 1929 in Chicago. His father was a police officer. Chicago Police Department career=Early career In 1952, O'Grady became a member of the Chicago Police Department. While working in vice control, earned a reputation for tackling organized crime and prostitution rackets. In 1968, he was knocked unconscious after a rock was thrown at him during disturbances at the Cabrini‚ÄìGreen Homes. In 1971, while off-duty, he was shot in his left hip whilst chasing a purse-snatcher in The Loop. By the mid-1970s, O'Grady had become the department's Chief of Detectives. Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department After the resignation of James M. Rochford as Superintendent of Police, mayor Michael Bilandic appointed O'Grady as his replacement on April 10, 1978. In 1978, during his tenure as Superintendent, a police fleeing O'Grady after O'Grady ordered him to stop his car came close to running O'Grady over. O'Grady promoted the first black woman to the rank of sergeant in Chicago's police force. In his tenure, he won praise for being tough on police corruption. However, the Better Government Association criticized him for failing to sufficiently curb illegal spying by officers on citizens and political organizations. Another controversy arose when the media reported that police officers were strip searching female motorists stopped for minor traffic offenses. Despite having had an already ten-month long investigation of this practice, O'Grady did not put an end to it until the media reported on it. Another controversy occurred in the department when Thomas Donovan, then the patronage chief of the mayor's office, called police officers to his home following the arrest of his son for bicycle theft. During the 1979 Chicago mayoral election, candidate Jane Byrne pledged to remove O'Grady as police chief if elected, accusing him of having \\"politicized\\" the department. Byrne defeated Bilandic for the Democratic nomination, and was elected mayor. Days after her inauguration as mayor, O'Grady resigned his position of Superintendent. His tenure as Superintendent was just over a year in length. Cook County Undersheriff For two years he left the Chicago Police Department to work for the Cook County Sheriff's Office as the undersheriff to Sheriff Richard Elrod. Return to Chicago Police Department In 1981, he returned to the Chicago Police Department this time as First Deputy Superintendent. Mayor Byrne rescinded her past accusations that he had politicized the department while Superintendent. In 1983, after Harold Washington was elected mayor, he resigned from the police force, ultimately ending his Chicago Police Department career. Interim private sector career O'Grady founded the private security firm Special Operations Associates (SOA), which he co-owned with James Dvorak, Daniel M. Davis, and Mike Caccitolo. He served as its CEO for a while. Amid O'Grady's bid to be Cook County Sheriff, the firm was contracted to investigate the unsolved murder of Diane Masters, and uncovered evidence which pointed to her husband being responsible. Cook County Sheriff=1986 election O'Grady was elected Sheriff as a Republican in the Democratic Party-dominated Cook County, Illinois, unseating incumbent Democrat Richard Elrod. He was the first Republican elected to countywide office there since Bernard Carey, who had been elected to his final term as Cook County State's Attorney in 1976. Upon his victory, he spoke of creating, \\"a new generation of politics\\" in Cook County. His victory came from winning the county's suburbs by a 2-1 margin. He had also performed well in some of the ethnically white wards of Chicago, being able to carry 14 of the city's 50 wards. O'Grady, a former Democrat, had switched parties to run as a Republican. He had been courted by President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush to run for office. O'Grady's campaign had been run by James Dvorak, who he would later hire as Undersheriff once he took office. He was a first-time candidate for political office. During his campaign he pledged to get rid of political influences in the sheriff's office (such as all political fundraising activities by the office), strengthen jail security, and develop a disaster plan. He also pledged to combat corruption in the office. O'Grady won the endorsement of the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune. During his campaign, O'Grady had strong network of campaign workers, and strong fundraising totals. He received strong support from police officers. Tenure O'Grady was, early in his tenure, a popular politician, speculated for a potential future run for Chicago mayor, County Board president, or governor. In 1988, his undersheriff James Dvorak made a successful bid to be Chairman of the Cook County Republican Party. Dvorak had been backed by Governor James R. Thompson against incumbent Donald Totten. Despite having campaigned against vice, under O'Grady, the number of arrests made for gambling and prostitution greatly declined. This occurred during a restructuring of the office's previously scandal-plagued vice unit. O'Grady ultimately had failed to live up to his campaign promises of disposing of politics and corruption in the Cook County Sheriff's Office, and had become unpopular among his constituents. =Scandals= Corruption was significant in the Cook County Sheriff's Office under O'Grady's tenure. In 1989, it was revealed that his chief bodyguard and another officer had interfered with a gambling raid being conducted by the office's vice officers. In 1989 a newspaper reported allegations that the department had, for as many as fifteen years, been suppressing investigations of murders and internal corruption. O'Grady immediately moved for the dismissal of two officers after this story broke. Federal investigators began investigating both O'Grady and his undersheriff James Dvorak in 1989. In November 1989, the Chicago Tribune released a two-part series which alleged that, \\"Sheriff O'Grady has demanded thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from deputies and given sensitive law-enforcement jobs to political cronies.\\" The report alleged that at least four high ranking employees in the Sheriff's office, including Dvorak, ran political organizations which solicited contributions from their colleagues and subordinates. It also alleged job selling and other corruption in the office. Two weeks after this report, Dvorak resigned, followed by Richard Simon, the head of the Sheriff office's part-time deputy program. In early 1990, O'Grady and Dvorak were investigated by a federal grand jury for directing a $1.8 million contract to Home Incarceration Systems of Illinois (HISNI). HISNI was run by an attorney for Special Operations Associates Inc. (SOA), which was a private security firm co-owned by O'Grady and Dvorak with Daniel M. Davis. In August 1991, Davis was indicted for obstruction of justice for hiding a document which detailed a stock purchase arrangement between HISNI and SOA. In 1990, it arose that alleged mob boss Ernest Rocco Infelice had, on tape recorder, shared allegations with a federal informant that he had paid $10,000 on a monthly basis to Dvorak for protection from vice investigations. Corruption from O'Grady's tenure continued to surface after he left office. In May 1992, James Novelli, who had been the chief investigator for the Sheriff's Merit Board, pled guilty to accepting bribes to rig test grades and to change applications for correction officer jobs. Novelli would later plead guilty to additional charges of bribery and conspiracy. Prosecutors ultimately would file a document with the court that suggested that 1,500 applicants were given a free pass before taking the exam during O'Grady's tenure. The FBI also later found that 367 people had received jobs with the sheriffs office despite filing the test. In 1993, 1994 and 1996, Dvorak pleaded guilty to tax and bribery charges which stemmed from both from payoffs from organized crime and from a large scheme he and others operated during O'Grady's tenure which rigged hiring tests for unqualified applicants and placed more than twenty \\"ghost jobs\\" on the sheriff's payroll. O'Grady was not indicted. 1990 reelection campaign Corruption allegations took a toll on O'Grady's prospects for reelection. Amid the 1990 reelection campaign, a Cook County correctional officer was shot and critically wounded while hanging signs for O'Grady's Democratic opponent Michael Sheahan outside of the South Side bar. Three men, including a correctional officer who supported O'Grady, were arrested for this. This led to a decline of O'Grady's support in the polls. Additionally, an incident soon after occurred where Sheahan had a campaign office shot at. In 1990, he was defeated for reelection by a broad margin by Sheahan. His defeat was one of the biggest defeats that a Republican Party nominee had experienced in a countywide Cook County election in years. Sheahan had managed to beat him in 24 of the county's 30 suburban townships. The ethnically white wards of Chicago, where O'Grady had performed well in 1986, went to Sheahan in 1990, with O'Grady failing to carry a single ward of the city. O'Grady had even failed to carry many of the county's Republican strongholds. Within the city of Chicago, O'Grady even trailed Harold Washington Party nominee Tommy Brewer, who was considered a political unknown.

Turner screened documentary films, and held discussions, on photography in Wellington over 1969/70. They and their audience noted the prevalent lack of attention to, or analysis of,Oettli, M. (2016). They say you want a revolution. Landfall, (231), 191. photography in New Zealand other than as a commercial profession or an amateur activity. Photography publications existed but were mostly books presenting the country's landscape often with an eye to tourism, and hobby, trade, technical and photographic society journals; New Zealand Studio, the journal of the New Zealand Professional Photographers‚Äô Association 1952‚Äì1975; New Zealand Camera, journal of the Photographic Society of New Zealand, launched in 1954; and Photographics New Zealand magazine 1961‚Äì1963.  Publication  Kelly and Turner met Bruce Weatherall who subsequently in 1970 published the newsletter Photographic Art & History, which was the precursor to Photo-Forum magazine. Its first issue covered conservation of photographs, appreciation of fine art photography, collecting photographic equipment, and the history of photography, and called for expressions of interest in contributing to further newsletters. Kelly and Turner became co-editors of the magazine with Weatherall from issue 2. They turned attention to New Zealand photographers Tudor Collins, Mac Miller, John Daley, and the current Maori in Focus exhibition, and in issue 3 covered Ans Westra, Mac Miller, and Hill & Adamson in New Zealand. After issue 4, featuring reviews of the 19th Century New Zealand Photography exhibition; Photography, A Visual Dialect, Gernsheim‚Äôs History of Photography; Hardwicke Knight‚Äôs First Century of Photography exhibition; and an article on the photographer J.N. Crombie, the journal was renamed New Zealand Photography. Under the new title New Zealand Photography and from 1971 the content was more internationally focused and included Keri McCleary's reviews of New Zealand exhibitions of Brassa√Ø and Photography 1971 exhibitions, and articles on the American Bruce Davidson and the French photojournalist Cartier-Bresson, with others on New Zealanders J.W. Chapman- Taylor and others. Through 1972/3 more attention was given to New Zealand photographers and exhibitions, with articles on, and photographs by, Alan Leatherby; Richard Collins; Roger Leach; James McDonald; Lloyd Homer; Keri McCleary; Max Oettli; D.L. Mundy; Simon Buis; John Fields; Walter Logeman; Mike Hammersley; Allan McDonald; Don Roy; Clive Stone; John Milnes; Jim Payne; Harry Foster; Ans Westra; Barry Lett Galleries; Bryan James; Historical New Zealand photographs in Australia; Bryan James; Ken Foster; Corynne Bootten; Graham Mitchell; Grant Douglas; the Elam Workshop; John Daley; Victorian photographs of Wellington; Michael Hawkins; the Photographic Communication Symposium; Barry Myers; Barry Hesson; Paul Cooper; Gary Baigent; Paul Gilbert; Rev. John Kinder; Christchurch photographers at Victoria Market Gallery; Leith F. Jennings. After Weatherall departed for a position as Lecturer in Journalism at the University of Canterbury in 1974, Turner took over New Zealand Photography magazine and re-launched it as Photo-Forum magazine in February 1974, the title inspired by the American Artforum. As well as its magazine, the organisation also produced posters, postcard sets, diaries, calendars, newsletters and books. PhotoForum ceased publication as a magazine in 1984, replaced by the irregular issue of book-format titles which continued the magazine numbering and its ISSN. Subscribed members received MoMento, published from January 2008.  Organisation  On December 12, 1973, founders Ken Browning, Paul Fudakowski, Bob Jones, Peter Maughan, Max Oettli, Peter Robson, Larence N. Shustak, and John B. Turner contributed $1000 each to register PhotoForum as an Incorporated Society. Max Oettli became first President of the Society, Treasurer was Wendy Turner; Secretary, Janet Mayo; Photo-Forum (originally hyphenated thus) Editor was John Turner, and Associate Editors Laurence Shustak and Do Van Toan.

Julia Parker Wightman was born on December 25, 1909; she was the daughter of prominent New York City physician Dr. Orrin Sage Wightman (1873-1965) and Purl Parker. She was noted for her impressive collection of rare books. The collection was especially known for its miniature books and childrens' books, but also included herbals, incunabula, illuminated manuscripts, and fine bindings. In 1965, following her father's death, she converted his offices at the family home into a bindery, where she created bindings and cases for some of the volumes in her library. She had previously studied bookbinding with Edith Diehl. She was a longtime member of the Hroswitha Club, which she joined in 1955. She later served as its president from 1978 to 1994, and often hosted club meetings at her home. She was also a member of the Grolier Club; she was elected in 1977, and was one of the first women to be admitted. After Wightman's death on July 11, 1994, her collections (as well as her bookbinding equipment) were bequeathed to the Morgan Library & Museum.

Bay-Fair, later Bay Fair, Bayfair Mall) is a regional shopping mall and power center in San Leandro, California. It was among the first malls in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. Anchor stores are Macy's, Target, Kohl's, Staples, Old Navy, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Cinemark, and 24 Hour Fitness. History=Launch (1950s) Announced in April 1953, the shopping center was built on the 48-acre site of the former Oakland Speedway automobile racing stadium, and cost $25 million to build, and an additional $6 million to build the anchor department store, a , three-story Macy's. The mall construction did not begin until 1956. The architect (including for the interior) for the Macy's store was John Savage Bolles, who had designed Candlestick Park and also designed interiors for Macy's Hilltop Mall in Richmond, Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo, and Valley Fair in San Jose, and interiors for the renovation of the Macy's Union Square San Francisco flagship store. Macy's was the first unit to open, on August 8, 1957, with mall shops opening in the months following. On November 8, 1957, 19 new stores (besides Macy's), including a supermarket, celebrated their grand opening. The mall shop area (outside Macy's) was open-air and in an L-shape, split-level (i.e. on two levels, but not two stories one on top of another). It claimed to be the first shopping center in the Western United States to be built across two stories. Expansion (1960s‚Äì1990s) The mall continued to expand, and a new department store anchor, Montgomery Ward opened a two-story, store and auto center on August 4, 1971. With Ward's the mall had grown to in size and had 62 stores. In 1972, Bay Area Rapid Transit opened Bay Fair station adjacent to the mall to the south, providing access via rapid rail transit. In 1977, owner Macy's announced a major renovation of the mall. It was enclosed and added escalators, air conditioning and carpeting. On the ground level, of retail space was added on and a further atrium and \\"specialty court\\" for boutiques and restaurants. On the new second level, of retail space was added. In a second pase, of retail space was adjacent to Macy's and elsewhere. In total, of space was added for about 40 additional shops, for a total of about 100 shops. A T.J. Maxx anchor opened April 28, 1994. Hybrid power center (2000s‚Äìpresent) In 2001, Montgomery Ward went bankrupt and closed its stores nationwide. The abandoned Ward's store was demolished and in October 2002, a Target Greatland opened on the site. Also In late 2002, the mall was acquired by Chicago-based M & J Wilkow Ltd. The updated shopping center measured . Bayfair's owner planned to remodel the ailing center into an open-air power center, renamed \\"Bayfair/580,\\" which would have several big-box tenants and upscale \\"lifestyle-oriented\\" stores. The plan never came to fruition, however, and the mall was sold to Madison Marquette in late 2003. The Macy's continues to operate and the mall is enclosed, but by 2012, the other anchors were more typical of those in a power center: big box stores Kohl's, Staples, Old Navy, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, and 24 Hour Fitness. There was also a Cinemark cinema multiplex. According to the city of San Leandro in a 2016 study, Bayfair has been successful in transforming itself to a tenant mix that meets with current needs.\\"Market Analysis, Bay Fair BART TOD Specific Plan\\", City of San Leandro, 2016 Plans for transit-oriented village In 2018, the city of San Leandro adopted a plan to transform the Bay Fair neighborhood, including the mall and areas around it, into a transit- oriented \\"village\\", a high-density, mixed-use neighborhood with a street grid of small blocks to encourage walking and cycling, and including small parks and space for community events.

In India, media bias or misleading information is restricted under the certain constitutional amendments as described by the country's constitution. The media crime is covered by the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which is applicable to all substantive aspects of criminal law. Nevertheless, freedom of the press in India is subject to certain restrictions, such as defamation law, a lack of protection for whistleblowers, barriers to information access and constraints caused by public and government hostility to journalists. The press, including print, television, radio, and internet are nominally amended to express their concerns under the selected provisions such as Article-19 (which became effective from 1950), though it states freedom of \\"occupation, trade or business\\" and \\"freedom of speech and expression\\" without naming \\"press\\" in clause \\"a\\" and \\"g\\". The article allows a journalist or media industries to cover any story and bring it to the audiences without impacting the national security of the country. To protect the intellectual, moral, and fundamental rights of the citizens, the government has taken several countermeasures to combat circulating fake news and restricting objectionable contents across the multiple platforms. The law of India prohibits spreading or publishing fake news through social or mass media, and could lead to imprisonment of a journalist or newspaper ban.  Global ranking  In 2020, India's press freedom rank dropped to 142 out of 180 countries in Press Freedom Index, an annual ranking of countries published by Reporters Without Borders (RWB), an international non-governmental organization dedicated to safeguard the right to freedom of information. In 2019, the country's press freedom was recorded 140 rank in Press Freedom Index, making it a slight decline than in previous annual report. The India's global index rank was declined for several issues such as killings of journalists, restrictions imposed on news media, censorship in Kashmir, and Jammu and Kashmir which has been a subject of dispute between India and Pakistan. Targeting victims such as physical abuse against journalists and prejudice is one of the other reasons for the decline in the world ranking index. In 2017, the country was ranked 136 out of 180 nations, and later it declined to 138 in 2018 in the world index report.  Reactions  The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting criticised the report published by the Reporters Without Borders in 2020 citing \\"the surveys portray a bad picture about freedom of press in India\\".  Censorship on press  In 2020, the Press Council of India, a state-owned body argued that government authorities, including state police's censorship on mass media is unfavorable citing \\"intimidate\\" journalists and \\"curtail\\" press freedom. The country's news outlets and their associated journalists were allegedly charged with sedition and criminal prosecution charges by the authorities. The Press Club of India (PCI) described charges against journalists \\"string of seemingly malafide actions\\". The organization claims federal government of India responsible for unfavorable-censorship on press and journalists. The International Press Institute (IPI), an international organizations dedicated to the improvement of journalism practices claims government of India responsible for restricting journalists covering COVID-19 pandemic-related reports in the country. In 2020, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting blocked the MediaOne TV temporarily for covering a news about the \\"mob attacks on Muslims\\" in the country's capital New Delhi. The channel was later resumed after a period of 48 hours. The Jammu and Kashmir Police, a law enforcement and counterinsurgency agency often interrogate journalists while some are charged and arrested over national security reportage and nominally defamatory news stories involving government. The state administration of Jammu and Kashmir also indefinitely stopped giving government ads to newspapers, including Greater Kashmir and Kashmir Reader running in the Jammu Jammu and Kashmir union territory, while the federal government banned Times of India, The Hindu and Telegraph India temporarily from running government ads on their platforms. In 2019, the government of India restricted media coverage on Citizenship Amendment Act protests claimed to prevent law and order in the country. The federal administration along with prime minister of India stated the coverage on CAA demonstrations as \\"promotion of anti-national attitudes\\". Sometimes, only news that favours the regime is published by the local media, whilst news that covers the economic and political problems in the country, or criticisms of the regime faces government-issued warnings. The print and broadcasting media claims carrying stories on the bases of emotions or under the political pressure since Bhartiya Janata Party came into power, while the domestic media outlets are claimed to support leaders' arguments. Indian media is often argued for carrying media war during military conflicts, expressing one-sided identification with vigorous support for its interests. Several media outlets cheerleaders by publishing political agenda of the ruling party's leaders. Freedom of the press is controlled by the state. The constitution of India protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press. In practice, however, the press is controlled, and the government only allows speech that supports it and the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party since 2014 it came into power. The government according to Scroll.in, is falsely labelling independent press with \\"fake news\\" to try to evade critical observation of the media. In 2020 or earlier, the government of India issued warnings against the foreign newspapers, including The New York Times, The Guardian, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, Time Magazine, The Economist, BBC, and Huffington Post for portraying the India's image negatively.  Cult of personality  The media have consistently upheld the personality cult of the leaders since the country's formation. It reported on the activities of the leader, regularly reporting on their political campaigns, frequently including \\"advertisements\\" to ruling parties through radio, television and Newspaper display ads. Previously, media would refer to 2014 Indian general election campaign of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a major political party as the \\"Abki Baar, Modi Sarkar\\" (this time Modi government). The political slogan was heavily covered by news media in the country. While supporting the regime, media reports in India are often one-sided and exaggerated, playing little or no role in gathering true information and providing propaganda on their platforms. The independent newspapers running in the country covered 2019 general election in favour of Narendra Modi, and raised concerns among the villagers the federal government wanted for doing so. The CMS Media Lab, a nonpartisanism subsidiary of the research organisation CMS stated in its report that Modi, the only prime minister till date received 33.21% of the primetime news coverage during his last election campaign while the competitors' political parties such as Aam Aadmi Party led by Arvind Kejriwal received 10.31% media coverage and the Indian National Congress candidate Rahul Gandhi received 4.33% prime-time news telecast coverage.

History=Establishment In the 1940s World War II, the Cacho family, an Ilonggo family of Spanish origin, rebuilt the family's power distribution business, the Panay Electric Company (PECO), by selling the family's property in Calle Eugenio Lopez (Eugenio Lopez St.) to the Philippine Women's College. Thereafter, the Lopez family bought the property to the college converting it to Don Benito Lopez Memorial Hospital, the base hospital for the medical and allied health sciences of the family run Iloilo City College which eventually became the University of Iloilo at present. Government acquisition and founding In February 1982, Former Vice President Fernando Lopez offered the Benito Lopez Memorial Hospital for lease/sale. President Lilia V. Juele, then President of the West Visayas State College took cognizance of the offer and recommended the purchase to the Minister of Education and Culture. On May 7, 1982 the Board of Trustees, governing body of West Visayas State College, through Referendum No. 1 s. 1982 unanimously approved the request for the acquisition of the Benito Lopez Memorial Hospital. Although the contract of sale was made between West Visayas State College through President Lilia V. Juele and Lopez family through former Vice President Fernando Lopez, however it was not realized due to unavailability of funds from the government. In the meantime, a lease contract was made, so that in January 1986 the Gov. Benito Lopez Memorial Hospital was utilized as the base hospital of the School of Medicine with Dr. Angel R. de Leon as Director. On April 5, 1987, Benito Lopez Memorial Hospital was finally purchased thru a GSIS loan and formally turned over by the Lopez family. In May 1987, the hospital became the West Visayas State University Hospital. The Department of Health Bureau of Licensing and Regulation authorized the University Hospital to operate as a 150-bed tertiary training hospital with 100 beds for service/charity patients (25 for Surgery, 25 for Medicine, 25 for OB/Gyne, 25 for Pediatrics) and 50 beds for pay patients. In 1988, the Department of Education Culture and Sports handed to the College of Medicine a revised organizational structure which gave the Dean of the College of Medicine governance of the University Hospital and a non- voting seat in the Board of Regent when matters pertaining to the College of Medicine and the University Hospital were presented. The Associate Dean - Clinics was delegated the day to day supervision and administration of the University Hospital. 1990s to present In January 1991, the Residency Training programs of the four (4) major clinical departments- Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics were accredited. In March 1992, Dr. Ramon S. Guerra, Jr., assumed the position as Chief of Hospital II, as provided for in the organizational structure of the University Hospital. In 1993, the Board of Regents approved Resolution No. 85 series 1993 a Project Proposal to upgrade WVSU Hospital to become a Medical Center envisioned as \\"Philippine General Hospital of the South.\\" The University Hospital already has accredited residency-training programs in Surgery, OB-Gyne, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Psychiatry, and Anesthesiology. For several years the hospital exceeded the 200-bed occupancy for its average daily census. In April 2000, the Third Floor Annex was opened with 4 suite rooms, 18 single air-conditioned private rooms and 3 wards (4 male, 4 female and pediatric patients). The average occupancy rate of the hospital for year 2000 was 122% of the authorized 150 beds. In the middle of January 2001, the University Hospital opened its Fourth Floor with 7 suite rooms and 19 air-conditioned private rooms. There is also an ongoing renovation of the left wing of the hospital to become charity wards. These expansion will bring to a total of 88 beds for pay patients and more than 200 for charity patients (Charity - Medicine - 50; Pediatrics - 50; OB-Gyne - 50; Surgery - 40; Psychiatry - 10; Orthopedics - 20; Pay- third floor - 35 patients; fourth floor - 33 patients; C-Up - 18 patients). In anticipation of the implication of all these development in infrastructure of the University Hospital, last July 17, 2001, Dir. Ramon S. Guerra, Jr., requested for an increase in the bed capacity of the West Visayas State University Hospital from 150 beds to 300 beds. This request was made in the desire to make this institution the best training ground for students and resident physicians, nurses and other paramedical groups, at the same time to render quality service to patients, not only of Iloilo, but the rest of Western Visayas. A milestone for the WVSU happened when the Department of Health Bureau of Health Facilities and Services and the Board of Regents through Board Resolution No. 76 series of 2001, dated November 29, 2001, approved the hospital to become the West Visayas State University Medical Center. In 2018, WVSU Medical Center alongside with another government hospital in Iloilo, received a 900 million Philippine Peso grant for infrastructural expansion. 600 million Philippine peso has been allocated to WVSU Medical Center which include a 3-storey DOH partnered WVSU Cancer Center for Western Visayas and the 10 storey WVSU Lung and Heart Center for Region VI, poising the hospital for its plans years before to become the Philippine General Hospital of the South.Panay News - WVSU Medical Center and Western Visayas Medical Center gets grant for expansion Retrieved 06-19-2020.

Biography From 1887 Schilling studied mathematics at the University of Freiburg and the University of G√∂ttingen, where he received his doctorate in 1893. His doctoral thesis Beitr√§ge zur geometrischen Theorie der Schwarzschen s-Funktion (Contributions to the geometric theory of the Schwarz s-function) was supervised by Felix Klein. At the University of G√∂ttingen, Schilling was from 1891 to 1893 an assistant for the physical model and instrument collection. He habilitated in 1896 in Aachen and was, from August 1897 to April 1899, an adjunct professor (au√üerplanm√§√üiger Professor) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. From 1899 he was an adjunct professor at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he taught descriptive geometry and oversaw the collection of mathematical equipment. In 1904 he became a professor at the TH Danzig, where he was rector from 1917 to 1919. He retired in 1936. In his dissertation, he developed a new interpretation of the formulas of spherical trigonometry as a relationship between the invariants of three quadratic forms and their functional determinants.Schilling: √úber die geometrische Bedeutung der Formeln der sph√§rischen Trigonometrie im Falle complexer Argumente (On the geometric meaning of the formulas of spherical trigonometry in the case of complex arguments), Math.

Schilling also did research on Reuleaux tetrahedra. He took notes on and edited the lectures on higher geometry by Felix Klein from 1892/93, which were initially distributed in autographed form. In 1926 Felix Klein's book Vorlesungen √ºber nichteuklidische Geometrie (Lectures on non-Euclidean geometry) was published posthumously by Springer Verlag. Schilling himself wrote several books on non-Euclidean geometry, which were strongly influenced by his geometric intuition. Felix Klein and Friedrich Schilling also designed geometric models that were manufactured by the Martin Schilling company in Leipzig.Felix Klein mentions an involute/cycloid gear model in his Elementarmathematik vom h√∂heren Standpunkt (Elementary mathematics from a higher point of view), Vol. 2, Springer, p. 125.

Martha 'Marty' Goddard (c. 1941 ‚Äì 2015) was an American victims' advocate who invented the rape kit, used to methodically collect forensic evidence from victims of rape. In the early 1970s, Goddard worked as a victims' advocate in Chicago, where an estimated 16,000 women were raped each year and police often would not believe victims. To improve the chances of offenders being identified and sentenced, she developed the concept and organization of a rape kit, a standardized way of collecting and preserving forensic evidence from victims of rape. She brought this idea to Louis R. Vitullo, who worked in the Chicago police crime lab. At first, he yelled at her and rejected her idea, according to Goddard's colleague Cynthia Gehrie, but then he proceeded to develop a kit similar to Goddard's design, taking personal credit for the invention. In the mid-1970s, Goddard founded the Citizens Committee for Victim Assistance, which advocated and sought funding for the distribution of rape kits; much of the initial funding came from the Playboy Foundation. Goddard continued to advocate for the rights of sexual assault victims through the 1980s, but developed a problem with alcohol and lived her later years in obscurity in Arizona.

Described as a \\"reverse-horror game\\", the game allows players to control a tentacled monster whose objective is to make its way through a facility, stalking and killing humans in its path. Carrion was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One on July 23, 2020. Gameplay Players control a red, amorphous, tentacled monster (hinted at by the game as an unknown species of Tubifex worm). The monster must make its way through a facility, crawling through vents and killing scientists and soldiers. As the game progresses, players can obtain upgrades such as the ability to dash‚Äîwhich can be used to break through wooden barricades and access otherwise unreachable areas‚Äîand to grow in size. Plot The titular organism is held in a containment unit within a research facility owned by a company called Relith Science. The creature breaks out and progresses through the facility in order to find an exit. As the organism progresses through the facility, it fights and devours its way through the facility's staff and security forces. Along the way, the creature discovers pieces of its genetic code removed by the scientists for study and containment, which allow it to evolve, allowing for greater size and more means of both defense and offense. The creature also encounters material analyzers which, upon entering, trigger flashbacks revealing its origins. The carrion was originally found in a dormant state of biomass by three scientists, and upon awakening, killed two and possessed the third. However, Relith security forces arrive and execute the remaining scientist, forcing the creature out. Eventually, the creature returns to its initial containment area and absorbs the last piece of its stolen genetics, allowing it to totally reconstitute a human form as the scientist it originally infected. The disguised creature then escapes the facility into what appears to be a partially quarantined Seattle. Development Carrion was developed by Phobia Game Studio, an indie game developer based in Warsaw, Poland. According to tweets by developer Sebastian Kro≈õkiewicz, development on Carrion began at least as early as October 2017. Gameplay from Carrion was first shown publicly at the 2018 Game Developers Conference. An official reveal trailer for the game was uploaded to YouTube by Devolver Digital on June 9, 2019. Devolver Digital promoted the game during their press conference at E3 2019. Music The soundtrack by Cris Velasco was released by video game label Materia Collective on July 23, 2020. Release Phobia Game Studio released a demo version of the game on Steam in October 2019. The game was released on desktop platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS), Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One on July 23, 2020. Prior to the announcement of the July 23 release date, the game was reported to have a PlayStation 4 release planned, but no PlayStation 4 release date has been announced.

She holds a Canada 150 Research Chair in Mathematics for Evolution, Infection and Public Health at Simon Fraser University (SFU). Early life and education Colijn earned her undergraduate degree from the University of British Columbia before enrolling at York University for her Master's degree in environmental studies and the University of Waterloo for her PhD. She completed her post-doctoral training with Michael Mackey at McGill University and later studied epidemiology with Megan Murray at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Career Following her post-doctoral training, Colijn joined the University of Bristol's Department of Engineering Maths until 2011 when she moved to Imperial College London. While at Imperial College London, Colijn earned an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Fellowship in order to study how to improve scientists ability to infer the ecological processes shaping a pathogen's evolution. In 2017, the Government of Canada announced the hiring of four Canada 150 Research Chairs, including Colijn. The program's initiative was to \\"enhance Canada's reputation as a global centre for science, research and innovation excellence\\" and Colijn's focus at Simon Fraser University (SFU) was on making \\"connections between mathematics and public health, using diverse data to understand how pathogens adapt and spread.\\" Colijn in 2020 In February 2020, Colijn, Jukka Corander, and Nick Croucher published a study in the journal Nature Microbiology regarding vaccines. They proposed a new method for choosing the best vaccine to fight and eliminate certain bacterial strains using genomic data and mathematical modelling. During the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia, Colijn was awarded a Genome British Columbia grant to map the spread of COVID-19 in British Columbia. Leading a group of researchers, Colijn used the grant to measure how successful and effective British Columbia's health policy measures in lowering the risk of COVID-19. Colijn spoke favorably of the effectiveness of random testing and used mathematical modelling to project high-risk trends in the province, allowing health officers to better determine how to effectively treat the pandemic. Colijn explained that \\"the role of mathematical modelling in infectious disease epidemiology is to think about the data we have at the population level, groups of people, links between the groups, rates of infection and case counts, and thinking about what that means for the dynamics of this thing going forward.\\" She was also selected to by the Chief Science Advisor of Canada Mona Nemer to sit on a country wide science expert panel to advise on COVID-19-related scientific developments. In this role, she published a research paper titled Estimating the impact of COVID-19 control measures using a Bayesian model of physical distancing, which concluded that keeping a physical distance had a direct impact on overall contact rates in the population.

The first recorded case was from Yambuku, a small village in Mongala District, northeast of the capital city of Kinshasa. The virus responsible for the initial outbreak, named after the relatively nearby Ebola River, was first thought to be Marburg virus but was later identified as a new type of virus related to the genus Marburgvirus. A total of 318 cases and 280 deaths (an 88% fatality rate) resulted from this outbreak, which, along with an outbreak in Sudan that had begun a few weeks previously, were the first outbreaks of Ebola ever recorded. Epidemiology CDC EIS officers during the Ebola outbreak of 1976 Mabalo Lokela, the headmaster of a local school in Yambuku, was the first case of the 1976 outbreak in Zaire.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4c1711c2-d004-11e3-a2b7-00144feabdc0.html \\"Ebola Ground Zero My Journey Back\\" Financial Times 3 May 2014 Lokela had toured with a Yambuku mission in August 1976 near the Central African Republic border and along the Ebola River. Lokela was initially diagnosed with malaria at the Yambuku Mission Hospital and given quinine. However, Lokela returned to the mission hospital on 1 September with a high fever. Rest was recommended, and he returned home to his village of Yalikonde, about one kilometer from the mission complex. By 5 September, Lokela was in a critical condition with profuse bleeding from all orifices, vomiting, acute diarrhea, chest pains, headache, fever and in an agitated and confused state. Lokela died shortly afterwards on 8 September. On 28 August, a second man presented symptoms, claiming he was from the nearby village of Yandongi. He left the hospital on 30 August, as no clear cause could be identified from his symptoms, and was not seen again. On the same day, Yombe Ngongo, a patient at the hospital receiving treatment for anemia, checked out of the hospital and returned to her village. She soon fell seriously ill, and was tended to by her younger sister Euza. Yombe Ngongo died on 7 September, and her sister Euza followed on 9 September. Soon after Lokela's visit, a number of other cases were presented at the Yambuku Mission Hospital. A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) noted that \\"almost all subsequent infections had either received injections at the hospital or had had close contact with another case.\\" Shortly after family members prepared his body for burial, in accordance with local customs, 21 of Lokela's friends and relatives fell seriously ill and 18 later died. The mission hospital's reuse of unsterilized needles also contributed to the spread of infection. Yambuku Mission Hospital was a remote Catholic hospital and had no doctors and no laboratory facilities to aid in diagnosis. Treatment was conducted by four Belgian nuns, a priest, one female nurse from Zaire, and seven male Zaireians. Urgent pleas for assistance were sent out on 12 September. On 15 September, the first doctor to arrive, Mgoi Mushola, prepared a report in which he noted that none of the many treatments provided met with success; this was the first formal description of Ebola virus disease. Peter Piot, a microbiologist and physician who investigated the ensuing epidemic, concluded that it was inadvertently caused by the Sisters of Yambuku Mission Hospital, who had given unnecessary vitamin injections to pregnant women in their prenatal clinic without sterilizing the needles and syringes.Free accessFree access In all, 318 cases of Ebola were identified in Zaire, and 280 resulted in death. An additional 284 cases and 151 deaths occurred in nearby South Sudan in an unrelated outbreak. Yambuku Mission Hospital was closed after 11 of its 17 staff members died. Belgian nuns serving the community were also infected, and two of them died, along with Mayinga N'Seka, a Zairean nurse, after the group was transported to Kinshasa. With assistance from the WHO, the outbreak was eventually contained by quarantining local villagers in their communities, sterilizing medical equipment, and providing protective clothing to medical personnel. The small Congolese Air Force provided helicopters to allow the outbreak team to visit 550 villages in the area.

Cariye or Cariyes was a title and term used for category of enslaved women concubines in the Islamic world of the Middle East.Junius P. Rodriguez: Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic They are particularly known in history from the era of the Ottoman Empire, where they legally existed until the mid-19th century. History=General meaning The general meaning of the term cariye was a woman enslaved during warfare. This remained the formal definition of the term in the Islamic world. The rights of the enslaved woman was regulated within Islamic law. The enslavement of women was permitted only during warfare of a war deemed \\"just\\"; that is, a war against non-Muslims. Only a non-Muslim woman could be enslaved during warfare, as Islam banned Muslims from enslaving other Muslims.Madeline Zilfi: Women and Slavery in the Late Ottoman Empire: The Design of Difference In Islamic law, the enslavement of a woman was the only case in which concubinage was legally permitted.Junius P. Rodriguez: Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic A woman taken as a Cariye-concubine had to obey her male owner as she would a husband.Madeline Zilfi: Women and Slavery in the Late Ottoman Empire: The Design of Difference The son of a Cariye was not regarded a slave, but born free. A daughter born to a slave woman was however born a slave, though it was customary to manumit her. Ottoman Empire The Cariye system existed in the Ottoman Empire far into the 19th century and is most famous within the Ottoman Imperial Harem of the Ottoman court. It was often been translated to mean \\"lady-in-waiting\\". The Ottoman system formally followed the original Islamic law, but varied from it in practice. After the Ottoman Empire had conquered most of the Middle East, and after the borders to Christian Europe had come to a standstill, there was in practice few opportunities to capture women through warfare.Madeline Zilfi: Women and Slavery in the Late Ottoman Empire: The Design of Difference Because of the general ban for enslavement of Muslims, the non-Muslim Cariye was instead provided to the Ottoman slave market from Christian Europe through the Crimean slave trade and the Barbary slave trade.Madeline Zilfi: Women and Slavery in the Late Ottoman Empire: The Design of Difference Being from non-Muslim countries, with whom the Ottoman Empire could be regarded to be in passive warfare, this was regarded equivalent to enslaved prisoners of war, and thus in accordance with Islamic law. When the Crimean slave trade was closed after the Russian conquest of the Crimea in 1783 (and the Barbary slave trade in the early 19th-century), the Cariye slave trade underwent yet another transformation. From this point on, a majority of the cariye were Circassians from Caucasus, with a minor part coming from the White slave trade. While the Circassians were normally Muslim, the ban against the enslavement of Muslims was overlooked in their case, and their original Muslim status was an \\"open secret\\".Madeline Zilfi: Women and Slavery in the Late Ottoman Empire: The Design of Difference The Cariye was always regarded as sexually available for the master of the house, and if she bore a child by him, she could no longer be sold.Fanny Davis, Sema Gurun, Mary E. Esch, Bruce Van Leer: The Ottoman Lady: A Social History from 1718 to 1918 It was common for a Cariye to be manumitted. However, a manumission did not mean that a Cariye was free to simply leave the household. In a Muslim society based on gender segregation, were women lived in seclusion, it was not a possibility for a manumitted woman to simply leave the house and walk about in the street, as a free unmarried woman without family would have no way to support herself. Fanny Davis, Sema Gurun, Mary E. Esch, Bruce Van Leer: : The Ottoman Lady: A Social History from 1718 to 1918 Instead, the manumission of a woman normally meant that a marriage was arranged for her; often, a male who freed a woman married her himself, or arranged for her to be married to another man.Fanny Davis, Sema Gurun, Mary E. Esch, Bruce Van Leer: : The Ottoman Lady: A Social History from 1718 to 1918 There was a difference between women bought to be domestic servants of Muslim women, and women bought by men; the slave women who were formally the property of a Muslim woman, although legally available for the master of the house, could also be sold by her female owner.Fanny Davis, Sema Gurun, Mary E. Esch, Bruce Van Leer: : The Ottoman Lady: A Social History from 1718 to 1918 In the first half of the 19th-century, slavery had come to be regarded as morally wrong in the Western world. The liberal Sultan Abdulmejid I, who was affected by these views, included anti-slavery laws among his Westernized reforms, and formally banned the Cariye slavery system. This was, however, a formal ban, and in reality, the Cariye continued informally until the end of the 19th century.Junius P. Rodriguez: Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic =Ottoman Imperial Harem= Cariye were provided for the Ottoman Imperial Harem through the Crimean slave trade and the Barbary slave trade, or recruited within the empire. They were selected from among the most beautiful and intelligent girls, and came to the harem as children. They were converted to Islam upon their arrival, and given a new name. They were trained in the discipline of the palace harem, and in the accomplishments for which they had talent. They were then promoted according to their capacities. Cariye had the lowest rank of the women in the Imperial Harem. The A to Z of the Ottoman Empire They differed from the odalisque in that they were all formally concubines to the sultan. However, in practice, they may never be chosen to share the bed of the sultan, so they often acted as the servants of the Valide Sultan, and the wives and children of the sultan. A Cariye who proved to be a valuable servant could be promoted to Kalfa or Usta, which meant she earned wages. If a Cariye was neither promoted to Kalfa nor chosen as a sexual partner by the sultan, she was manumitted after nine years of service. In practice, her manumission would mean that she would have to marry, since an unmarried free woman without family had no means to support herself in the gender-segregated society of the Ottoman Empire. The Cariyes with whom the sultan shared his bed became members of the dynasty and rose in rank to attain the status of G√∂zde (the Favorite), Ikbal (the Fortunate), Kadin (the Woman/Wife) or haseki sultan (legal wife). The highest position was the Valide Sultan, the legal mother of the sultan, who herself used to be a wife or a cariye of the sultan's father and rose to the supreme rank in the harem. No Cariye could leave or enter the premises of the harem without the explicit permission of the valide sultan.

They were founded in 1928, being the oldest active football club in the ABC Region. They also were the first basketball club in the city (achieving great prominence), as well as in volleyball and futsal. Despite being based in one of the richest and most populous cities in S√£o Paulo, the club has never been successful at the state level, having spent most of its years in the lower divisions of the Campeonato Paulista and has yet to qualify for any national division. Their highest state league finish was in the 1986 Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divis√£o, when they finished 3rd in the table, nearly missing promotion for the premier division. During the 1990s, the club often escaped relegation due to other clubs folding or not meeting the criteria for promotion in upper levels. This and a win drought that lasted over a year brought nationwide attention to the club, which at the time was regarded as the worst performing team in Brazil.  History = Formation and amateur era (1928-1950)  Esporte Clube S√£o Bernardo was founded 3 February 1928, being the oldest active club in the ABC region of S√£o Paulo. The club was founded by members of its former rival, Internacional Futebol Clube, being the successor of Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica S√£o Bernardo, which was founded in 1917 and dissolved in 1922. In the period of 1922-1928, football in S√£o Bernardo do Campo was reduced to small ‚Äúlowland‚Äù clubs, which disputed a soccer festival every Labor Day (1 May). While watching these festivals, Dante Setti proposed the idea of creating a new club, which could bring together all the sportsmen and fans in the city around a single association. The idea was well received by three young men, all former players of AA S√£o Bernardo and Internacional FC: Nerino Colli, Vicente Ragghianti and Itagiba de Almeida. They ran the city calling a meeting, to be held in the old Cine Enrico Caruso (later, Cine S√£o Bernardo) at Rua Marechal Deodoro. The meeting, which started on February 2nd, only ended on the 3rd, when Esporte Clube S√£o Bernardo was officially founded. Thanks to the selflessness of partners and interested parties, S√£o Bernardo quickly consolidates itself among the strongest teams in the region, along with more traditional clubs such as Primeiro de Maio FC and Corinthians FC (Santo Andr√©), Ribeir√£o Pires FC and S√£o Caetano EC. In 1931, a poll of over 58,000 people carried out by the newspaper Di√°rio Nacional named the club \\"The Most Likeable of the Countryside\\". The honour elevates the status of S√£o Bernardo, which began being invited to play out of the region and even interstate games. The Cachorr√£o was the first club in S√£o Bernardo do Campo to play a game outside S√£o Paulo, in May 1930, against Minas Gerais clubs Uberl√¢ndia and Uberaba. During the 1930s, the club decided to enter the then-existing amateur state league, competing in the Campeonato Paulista do Interior (current Campeonato Paulista Amador). These leagues had their member clubs divided regionally into zones. Only the stage winners (sometimes the second-placed team would also qualify, depending on the year) advanced to the next stages, where they faced clubs from other regions. In 1939, S√£o Bernardo was the champion of its zone, which generally included the ABC, the coastside and Mogi das Cruzes regions. The club would repeat the feat even more brilliantly in the following decade, where it was three times champion of its zone, in 1947, 1948 and 1949.  Stadium  Since 2019, EC S√£o Bernardo play their home matches at Est√°dio 1¬∫ de Maio, the largest capacity stadium in the S√£o Bernardo do Campo. Previously, as the club played in the lower divisions, EC S√£o Bernardo played at Baet√£o, a smaller capacity stadium with artificial turf. Both stadiums are not owned by the club.  Est√°dio √çtalo Setti (1928-1963)  Originally, the field located where the Est√°dio √çtalo Setti was built was used by other teams in the city, such as Internacional Futebol Clube and Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica S√£o Bernardo. As both clubs folded in the 1920s, the pitch began to be used by local amateur teams. When Esporte Clube S√£o Bernardo was founded in 1928, they also played their home games at the same location. On 14 June 1941, landowner √çtalo Setti donated the 16,000 m¬≤ area to EC S√£o Bernardo in exchange for two conditions: that the stadium should be named after him and, should EC S√£o Bernardo ever cease its activities, the land would be returned back to its previous owners. The club then built its structure at the site, including the aforementioned stadium and basketball and volleyball courts. The Est√°dio √çtalo Setti was the most modern stadium in the region, being the first one to feature floodlights for night games.

The station was owned by radio station KSPR (1470 AM). The station closed as a result of competition from a local cable system; it would be more than 20 years before a second commercial station opened in Casper. History The station went on the air August 12, 1957 as a CBS affiliate, matching the radio station, the only CBS radio outlet in the state of Wyoming. Coinciding with the launch of the television station, KSPR radio and TV moved into new quarters on East Second Street. By July 1959, reports were circulating that KSPR-TV would close before year's end, and the fuel on the fire only accelerated when Rocky Mountain Tele Stations, owner of KTWO-TV (channel 2), announced it would buy KSPR radio from their common owner, Don Hathaway, for $150,000. The rumors were true, and KSPR-TV ceased broadcasting July 21, 1959, despite a well regarded slate of programming. Owner Hathaway would blame cable television for the demise of KSPR-TV. Within less than a year of going on air, the station stated to the Federal Communications Commission that cable had made it harder to get programs and the station might have been off the air even then without the financial support of KSPR radio. In December 1959, the United States Senate subcommittee on communications held a hearing in Casper, at which Hathaway testified that the local cable firm, Able Cable (Community Television, Inc.), had made the sale of advertising difficult by importing Denver stations; this prompted national advertisers, including the Campbell Soup Company, to avoid buying air time on channel 6, which the cable did not carry. In his testimony, Hathaway noted that the cable system, which had 6,000 subscribers prior to the launch of KTWO-TV, had dropped to 3,500 when KSPR-TV took to the air and was growing again with Casper back to one local outlet. KTWO purchased the KSPR building and moved the television station in; Hathaway sold additional equipment to Community Television, whose owner, Bill Daniels, planned to use it to start a television station at Farmington, New Mexico. After KSPR-TV ceased broadcasting, KTWO-TV proposed the removal of channel 6 to Lander for use as a satellite station. This did not take place, though KTWO made a second and even more daring proposal. It proposed the creation of the first television duopoly in the United States by activating channel 6, saying a second independent station was not viable and that it could air more network programs on a second channel. The Natrona County school board voted in 1961 to seek use of the channel for educational use. A further commercial application was made in 1964 by Duhamel Broadcasting Enterprises, owner of KOTA-TV in Rapid City, South Dakota. In 1965, the channel was officially allocated noncommercial and the state launched a bid to put it and channel 8 at Laramie on the air. No facility materialized on channel 6 until December 1981, when Casper College activated a translator for public station KRMA in Denver on channel 6. In 1987, the translator switched from airing KRMA to KCWC, the new public station in Riverton that had signed on in 1983. It was replaced with a full-service license as KPTW in 2007.

Urbana, IL: Univ. of Illinois Press. page 174 In collaboration with Teena Sorenson, Snow developed a framework that identified four stages children go through when disclosing sexual abuse. According to the study, the first stage, denial, occurs when a child claims the abuse did not happen. Disclosure is subdivided into two phases, tentative and active, which occurs when a child acknowledges the occurrence of abuse. Recant is a retraction of a prior disclosure. The final stage, reaffirm, is the final reassertion that the abuse happened.Charles B.

The Utah County Sheriff's Office and Utah Attorney General's Office began an extensive two and a half year investigation. The bishop's children were taken away by family services, but returned in several weeks after no evidence of harm was discovered. After the investigation, a Lehi resident named Alan Hadfield was the only one to be charged with abuse. Before the trial of Hadfield, Snow resigned her position at the Intermountain Sexual Abuse Treatment Center amid controversy over her interviewing methods, and opened a private practice in Salt Lake City. During the investigation, law enforcement personnel deliberately fed false information to Snow, and that information would subsequently show up in children's testimony.STATE of Utah, Plaintiff and Appellee, v. Alan B. HADFIELD, Defendant and Appellant No. 880234 Supreme Court of Utah 128 Utah Adv. Rep. 6; 788 P.2d 506; 1990 Utah LEXIS 14 online at:https://law.justia.com/cases/utah/supreme- court/1990/880234.html At the trial a Utah County chief deputy attorney testified that he observed Snow coaching children through a two way mirror. \\"I was appalled\\", said the deputy attorney, \\"[Snow] had so conditioned those children that I had serious concern about using them as witnesses in cases.\\" Snow countered that as a therapist, not a law enforcement investigator, she needed to create an environment where hesitant children who might have been threatened to be silent could feel comfortable disclosing abuse. Judy Pugh, a colleague of Snows at the Intermountain Sexual Abuse Treatment Center, told the court that she was concerned about how children's stories would homogeneously emerge after interviews with Snow. One ten year old girl testified that Snow asked her as many as fifty times in one session if Hadfield had touched her, and that she finally relented when she became afraid that Snow would yell at her otherwise. Dr. Stephen Golding, director of clinical psychology at the University of Utah testified that Snow's techniques were \\"subtly coercive and highly questionable. There were several inconsistencies in the testimonies of the children. On April 6th the children accused Hadfield of fondling them as they watched a television program, however telephone records showed that Hadfield was on the phone with Snow at the time the abuse was to have occurred. The children said their father had promised to buy them a toy four wheeler for not revealing abuse, but receipts showed that the toy was purchased before the abuse was to have occurred. Hadfield was convicted by an eight member jury on December 19, 1987, and the judge sentenced Hadfield to 6 months in the Utah County Jail. The court placed an order that barred Gay Hadfield, the mother, from hiring Snow as their therapist.Ellen Fagg, \\"GAY HADFIELD DESCRIBES DREAM WORLD GONE BAD\\" By Deseret News Mar 3, 1989, 12:00am MST online at:https://www.deseret.com/1989/3/3/18797286/gay-hadfield-describes-dream- world-gone-bad In 2002 Snow wrote an op-ed in the Deseret News defending her actions, writing, \\"Sexual predators are master manipulators. ... We cannot have it both ways, ... We cannot decry child abuse publicly and tolerate it privately if the offender is a white, upper-middle-class member of our religious congregation.\\" Probation In 2008 Snow agreed to probation by the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing to avoid protracted litigation, for violating the Utah codes of professional conduct and ethical principles defined by the National Association of Social Workers. The state alleged that Snow had convinced her relatives that they were victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse and military testing and that Snow provided fabricated notes from her sessions.

Swan uncovered suppressed memories during therapy sessions with Snow. Swan said of Snow, \\"I still consider her to be one of the best psychologists that I have been to. ... When I started telling her the stories about what was going on with me and childhood, she literally just started crying. It was actually the first time I had a therapist cry.\\" Snow had Swan file a police report with the local police department, calling the police on Swan's behalf.

The police began a preliminary criminal investigation. They performed a medical exam, but found no evidence of ritual abuse.

Snow's therapeutic methods played a significant influence in Swan's \\"Completion Process\\" methods.

Like the Gaudawa and Rumfawa line of rulers, his house is not primarily differentiated based on lineage but rather significant political and social reforms ushered during their era. While the Rumfawa preferred a more centralized system of government, Kutumbi and his descendants dispersed authority through government officials. He created various new government positions and also imposed new forms of taxation, most notably on the cattle of the Fula. His reign was also characterized by successful conquests against Gombe, Bauchi and Kano's principal rival, Katsina. El Kutumbi died of battle wounds after a second expedition against the latter. The Kano Chronicle described him as one of Kano's greatest kings.  Birth  He was the son of Sultan Muhammad Nazaki and his consort, Dada. He succeeded his father as Sultan in 1623.  Reign as Sultan  \\"Kutumbi was a very mighty Sarki in Hausaland.\\" El Kutumbi was said to have exuded great power and wealth. His procession was accompanied by a hundred eunuchs dressed in expensive robes and covered in ornaments of gold and silver. He was also followed by fifty kettle-drums, forty drums and twenty-five trumpets. During conquests or festivals, he always had a hundred spare horses at his beck and call. He built two residences in Gandu and Tokarawa. His residence at Tokarawa was used as a transit where he waited for his army to assemble. His army was renowned for their bravery.  An unstable administration  After his ascension, the most immediate threat to his throne was his father's loyal henchman, Wambai Giwa. The Wambai's wealth, generosity and reputation as the scourge of Katsina had aroused fears that he would revolt against the Sultan. He was promptly stripped of his title by Alwali. Alwali was said to have had a friend called Kalina Atuman whom he made a vizier and entrusted a liberal amount of power. This Vizier gained power that rivaled even that of the Sultan, so much so that people came to believe that their roles were reversed. Atuman, however, died twelve years into Alwali's reign. After his death, Dawaki Kwoshi assumed similar levels of authority and tried to revolt. The Sultan then seized the stewardship of Kofan Kabugga from the Dawaki's wealthy father, Turaki Kuka Allandayi. Dawaki Kwoshi withdrew from the city and garnered the support of powerful government officials but was cajoled by the Sultan into submission. Kutumbi's son, Bako, whose exploits in Katsina earned him the title \\"Jarumi\\" (Warrior) also assumed much power. With six hundred horses and a heavy cavalry of ninety mailed horsemen, he had a formidable force at his personal service. The Kano Chronicle states that no prince compared to him \\"in doing good, or doing ill, in courage, anger, and generosity, he was like a Sarki even while he was only a prince\\". His ascension to the throne in the case of his father's death was feared by his rivals who prayed for the Jarumi's death. Other accounts state that, foreseeing a civil war after his father's death, Bako himself prayed to die to avoid it. Nevertheless, he died before his father.  Other Cabinet members  Alwali introduced the titles of \\"Barde Kerreriya\\", and that of \\"Sarkin Shanu\\"; who was in charge of the state's cattle. He first gave the latter title to his slave, Ibo, later known as Ibo na Kutumbi. He also created the title of \\"Sarkin Samari\\", the leader of the Sultan's younger slaves, a title he gave to a man called Mandawali. Subsequently, he created the titles of \\"Sarkin Dogarai\\" (Leader of the Royal Guard), and Sarkin Shamaki, and appointed a new \\"Sarkin Sirdi\\" (in charge of horse saddles).  Taxation  Alwali was the first Sultan to impose taxation of Fula herders. He invented a new government tax known as \\"Jangali\\", which entitled the State to hundreds of cows.  Wars and conquests = Bauchi  Alwali's Sarkin Dawaki, Magara, went to war against Bauchi and was victorious. On his way back from Bauchi, he created a new settlement at Ganjua, and sent the Sultan two thousand slaves. The Sultan took offense to Magara's new colony and went to attack the Sarkin Dawaki a year later where he forced him to pay a tax and left five hundred of his slaves there.  Gombe  Alwali was said to have defeated and sacked the city of Gombe two years after his first expedition in Bauchi.  Katsina  \\"Alwali shutter of the great gate, Kimbirmi, shutter of the great gate\\" Kano's sister state, Katsina, had been its principal foe in the region. Kano gained the upper hand when it took the strategically located Karaye under Alwali's father's reign and the Wambai Giwa was able to enjoy great successes against them. Alwali's first war with Katsina was in the form of a siege. He camped at Dugazawa where he prevented entry and exit from the State and collected much booty from them. The prince of Kano, Jarumi Bako, also defeated Turmin Dan Ranko, a city in Katsina, earning much spoil. Alwali's second battle with Katsina was, however, much less fruitful. He camped towards the western part of the gate but the army of Katsina launched a surprise attack that sent the men of Kano into flight. In this retreat, a Katsina warrior, Kumaza, attacked Alwali with a spear but was killed by Dan Maji Zartaki before he could finish the job. Kano's army took flight with Katsina in hot pursuit until they reached Yashi.  Death and succession  El Kutumbi died of the battle wounds sustained in Katsina three days later. While some accounts say he died in Katsina, the better version is that he died in Kano. Muhammad Alwali I was the last Kano Sultan to die in battle until Muhammad Alwali II during the Fula Jihad. El Kutumbi was succeeded by his son Al Haji who was quickly deposed. His grandson and Al Haji's son, Shekarau, was then elected Sultan, under whose reign Kano and Katsina would sign a lasting peace treaty brokered by Islamic scholars.

This time, De Jesus remained in power between 2005 and 2006. In 2006, De Jesus failed to be directly elected and once again was appointed suplente. On August 14, 2008, he once again took office as a State Deputy due to a permanent vacancy. This time he succeeded √Ålvaro Lins, impeached due to a corruption scandal. In 2010 and 2014 he failed to be directly elected and was appointed suplente on both occasions. Both times however, no vacancy occurred within his coalition. His political career ended after he decided to not run at the 2018 elections. Death On June 15, 2020, De Jesus died in Rio de Janeiro due to complications brought on by COVID-19.

The album was released on 31 July 2020. The collection features Kelly performing songs from nine of his albums, along with the previously unreleased track \\"True to You\\" and a cover of Cole Porter's \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye\\" to new interpretations by Grabowsky. The album was announced on 17 June 2020 and in a press statement, Grabowsky said \\"The performances are intimate, and shine a light on lyrical moments from the Kelly oeuvre. Paul is a generous collaborator, always listening closely to what I am doing, and giving me the freedom to bring my own interpretation to the songs. I think people will hear, and hopefully enjoy, the deep communication that we are bringing to the performances.\\" with Kelly adding \\"Singing with Paul is like walking a tightrope. It's as if we are acrobats together. We have to pay serious attention to one another to pull the songs off. I like that.\\" Grabowsky said the album was inspired by Frank Sinatra, Nelson Riddle, Bill Evans and Tony Bennett. \\"They're massive influences upon me and they've been massive influences upon this project. That was kind of a baseline for what we were trying to do.\\" Background In the early 1990s, Kelly was booked to perform \\"Winter Coat\\" on The Steve Vizard show in which Grabowsky was the musical director. Kelly and Grabowsky met in 1995 while Grabowsky was making a series of television programs for the ABC about different aspect of music-making called Access All Areas. Grabowsky recalls \\"We talked about song writing. I was struck by the fact that Paul is driven by a similar impulse to my own, namely an ongoing fascination with music in its many forms.\\" The duo first worked together on a project with the Australian Art Orchestra, called Meet Me in the Middle of the Air, which involved a ten- piece ensemble, Vika and Linda Bull and Kelly singing Grabowsky's arrangements of songs of his which all had biblical references. It toured nationally in 2010. In 2019, Grabowsky was asked to curate a series of concerts at the UKARIA Cultural Centre in Mt Barker, South Australia, in which I work in duo settings with various singers. Grabowsky asked Kelly who agreed. Kelly proposed that they record and the recording took place at Monash University Campus late in 2019. Paul Grabowsky told noise11 \\"Pauls songs cover a very wide spectrum. I cannot think of another songwriter in Australia who has covered as much ground as Paul. In the same interview, Kelly said that not all of his older songs would fit this concept saying \\"Certain songs are hard to do away from the way they were originally recorded. A good example of that is 'Before Too Long'. I am always trying to sing my songs differently or find new ways to do them but 'Before Too Long' resists another way to do it; the chords move very quickly, there is just no other way to do that song. Another one of my songs is 'To Her Door'. It's got to have that feel and it has that melody that Steve Connolly laid down in stone. Every guitar player I have played with since sees no reason to try and fuck with it. Some songs resist that change but in choosing songs for this album I chose songs that were more manurable, I guess.\\" Reception Jeff Jenkins from Stack said \\"This affair follows a similar formula (to 2019s Tryst with Kate Ceberano): Grabowsky's peerless piano playing accompanying one voice (and some occasional harmonica). The song selection digs deep, shining a light on some gems in Kelly's catalogue...

Biography After studying classical studies at the Lyc√©e Montaigne in Bordeaux, Roquebert earned a license in philosophy. In 1955, he began working for La D√©p√™che du Midi in Toulouse. He wrote numerous articles on the arts, for which he dedicated a weekly chronicle. In 1970, Roquebert wrote the first volume of L'√âpop√©e cathare, which won the Grand Prix Robert of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. The second volume was written in 1977 and was followed by three more. In 1983, Roquebert retired from journalism and devoted himself to history. He moved to Monts√©gur, where he headed an archaeological research group. In this group, he helped resurface the south facade of the village's castle, restoring it to its original elevation. Additionally, he dedicated the fourth volume of L'√âpop√©e cathare to Monts√©gur. The fifth and final volume of L'√âpop√©e cathare was written in 1998, totalling more than 3000 pages over the five editions. Roquebert was elected into the Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du Midi de la France in 1971. In 2001, he became a corresponding member of the Acad√©mie des sciences, inscriptions et belles-lettres de Toulouse. He joined the Consistori del Gay Saber on 16 January 2011. He was a member of the Centre d'√©tudes cathares de Carcassonne from 1985 to 2011. He was honorary president of the Association d'√©tudes du catharisme from its founding in 2011.

His early work could loosely be termed geometric abstractions, but he is best known for his later representational paintings that combine an interest in architecture, invented machinery and toys. Whitten is also known for his toy-like sculptures. Whitten was the chair of the art department at Rhode Island College (2016-2018) and continues to teach there as part of the faculty. Whitten's work has been displayed in solo exhibitions at the Newport Art Museum, the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, WA, and the Zillman Art Museum (University of Maine Museum of Art). As of 2017, Whitten has been represented by Art Mora Gallery in New York, New Jersey, and Seoul, South Korea, and the William Scott Gallery in Provincetown, MA. He has been represented by the Clark Gallery in Lincoln, MA since 2009.  Life and career  A native of New York City, Whitten attended the Collegiate School. He studied economics at Yale where he received his BA in 1980. He subsequently constructed a personal painting program at Yale, studying with Gretna Campbell and Samia Halaby. In 1987, he received an MFA at the University of California, Davis, under the instruction of Wayne Thiebaud, Squeak Carnwath, David Hollowell, Mike Henderson, Manuel Neri, Harvey Himelfarb, and Robert Arneson. He began teaching at Penn State in 1989. Later, he moved to Rhode Island where he became professor of Painting at Rhode Island College in 2006. Presently he continues in his position of Professor of painting. Whitten's paintings and drawings are representational but have strong ties to geometric abstration.

It was formed when the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) broke away from the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), due to disagreements with the CAHA's agreement with the National Hockey League (NHL) which established the NHL Amateur Draft in 1967. Ron Butlin became president of both the CHA and the WCHL with the objective of the getting a better financial deal for teams in Western Canada which had greater expenses than teams in Eastern Canada, and to fight the age limit on players imposed by the NHL. Butlin was also opposed to the CAHA structure of elected officials who determined hockey policy, rather than representation by team owners and operators of hockey businesses. The CHA added the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League (WOJHL) to its ranks in opposition to how hockey was controlled. The WOJHL was denied the financially desirable junior hockey A-level status by the Ontario Hockey Association despite being based in the industrialized Southwestern Ontario region, and was discontent with losing its best players annually to other leagues in Ontario. The CHA experienced growing pains during its existence, and was unsuccessful in expanding into Northern Ontario and British Columbia. Its attempt to establish an east-west national championship in competition with the Memorial Cup and the CAHA, ended in a default win by the Flin Flon Bombers when the St. Thomas Barons abandoned the series after an on-ice brawl. The CHA and CAHA also competed for the use of on-ice officials, had disagreements over civil law contracts for players, and saw legal action for the WCHL to receive financial compensation from the NHL Amateur Draft. The WCHL signed a two-year agreement with the CAHA in 1970, which gained direct representation on the CAHA junior council, recognition as a top tier league in Canada, the ability to select players from lower-tier leagues, automatic qualification for the Memorial Cup final, and increased financial compensation from the NHL. The WCHL conceded to the NHL's age limit and the CAHA agreed to distribute outstanding draft money. Once the WCHL rejoined the CAHA, the CHA was subsequently phased out and the WOJHL was replaced by the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League in 1970. Background In August 1966, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) and the National Hockey League (NHL) announced a new five-year agreement effective July 1, 1967. The direct sponsorship of junior ice hockey teams by the NHL was to be phased out in the upcoming year, and junior-aged players would no longer be required to sign a contract connecting them to an NHL team. Players became eligible for the NHL Amateur Draft once they reached their 20th birthday, and the NHL agreed to pay development fees to the CAHA for the drafted players. Junior teams in Western Canada disagreed with the changes, and wanted the age limit to be 21, and increased financial compensation for loss of talent to professional teams and since their travel costs were greater than teams in Eastern Canada. The dissenting teams broke away from the CAHA and formed the independent Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL). The league played the 1966‚Äì67 CMJHL season outside of CAHA jurisdiction and its teams were ineligible to compete for the Memorial Cup. The CMJHL negotiated a peace treaty and operated the 1967‚Äì68 season under the CAHA, and renamed itself to the Western Canada Junior Hockey League (WCJHL). In advance of the 1968‚Äì69 season, the league announced it would use an age limit of 21 in defiance of the CAHA and NHL agreement. The WCJHL stopped short of declaring independence from the CAHA, and claimed that the lower age limit would decrease its talent pool and negatively affect ticket sales. In response, the CAHA suspended the league and its players. Formation On June 8, 1968, the WCJHL changed its name to the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), and affiliated with the new Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) as a national governing body in opposition to the CAHA. Ron Butlin was named president of both organizations, which raised their age limit to 21. Butlin stated other leagues and teams were welcome to join the CHA, but the Regina Pats chose to leave the WCHL and remain with the CAHA. Butlin was opposed to the CAHA structure of elected officials who determined hockey policy but were not connected to a team. The board of governors for the CHA was composed entirely by owners of its teams. Butlin stated the main objective of the CHA was to seek better financial return for their teams' efforts. He claimed it cost a team C$1,700 per year to develop a player, and felt $3,000 was too little value for a drafted player who took several years to develop. He also wanted to see more money given to teams for travel expenses to the Memorial Cup final. He also claimed that the National Fitness Council wanted a different organization to run junior hockey in Canada, and planned to present a brief to the council for an operational grant. Butlin looked to expand the CHA eastward, and targeted the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League (WOJHL). The league had previously been denied the financially desirable junior hockey A-level status by the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), despite being based in the industrialized Southwestern Ontario region with high per capita salaries. He made a 20-minute presentation to the league at a meeting in Sarnia, and convinced five teams from the league to join the CHA, instead of remaining a B-level league and lose its best players annually to other leagues in the OHA. WOJHL president Frank Basso assumed the vice-president role of the CHA, and targeted the NHL and other groups which he felt had lowered the age limit to profit from junior players. Butlin had also courted the Border Cities Junior Hockey League in Southwestern Ontario, but the league decided against joining the CHA due to fears of being blacklisted by the NHL. The Canadian Press reported that the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League had met with Butlin, and that he attempted to get the British Columbia Junior Hockey League to join the CHA after the league was outwardly critical of the age limits and development fee changes by the CAHA. Butlin stated that the WCHL would abide by the NHL Amateur Draft agreement with the CAHA, and expected to receive the corresponding development payments for its players. NHL president Clarence Campbell responded that the NHL would not do business with the CHA or the WCHL, and reiterated support for the CAHA. The NHL did not want to get involved with players who had contracts to CHA teams due to potential lawsuits, and had no intention of promoting a relationship with the CHA. Butlin claimed that CHA team had no issue signing players to contracts despite being shunned by the NHL. A month later, Campbell stated that any player registered with the CHA would need to end his contract before an NHL team would negotiate with him, and that the NHL had no intent to make development payments to the CHA. 1968‚Äì69 season The CHA-CAHA dispute continued into the 1968‚Äì69 season. Butlin stated that the CHA was contemplating expansion into minor ice hockey, and felt that working on junior ice hockey and lower levels was a way to \\"change the hockey pattern in Canada\\". The CAHA refused requests to have WCHL teams to play exhibition games against the Canada men's national ice hockey team, and also threatened to suspended on-ice officials for refereeing games under CHA jurisdiction. In October 1968, CAHA executive director Gordon Juckes released the disbursement of development payments from the 1968 NHL Amateur Draft. The statement omitted payments for ten players drafted from the WCHL while the league was under CAHA jurisdiction. Eight of the ten players were active on four teams under the CHA during the 1968‚Äì69 season. The CAHA refused to issue the payments as it considered all teams under the CHA jurisdiction to be defunct when they did not renew allegiance with the CAHA. In January 1969, Butlin announced legal action against the CAHA to seek development payments from the NHL, which totaled $13,200 to the four teams in question. Teams under CAHA jurisdiction were given a deadline of November 30 to add players to their rosters who had departed for the CHA, and teams in Eastern Canada wanted to test the legality of the contract used by the CHA. The Winnipeg Free Press speculated the action would make players and parents hesitant of signing such contracts, and any pending legal action by the CHA might have a negative impact on its future. On November 4, Butlin stated that he would take legal action against the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association, the Quebec Junior Hockey League and its team from Sorel, for using two players who were under contract to the Winnipeg Jets. Later in November, he chose not to test the CHA's contract in court due to differences in civil law in Quebec compared to the rest of Canada. The CHA contract was tested again in February 1969, when the Manitoba Junior Hockey League gave permission for the Dauphin Kings to use Butch Goring, who had been signed by the Winnipeg Jets. Merv Haney also departed the Jets for the Dauphin Kings. Butlin stated that the WCHL would seek a court injunction to prevent both from playing, and that the CHA would seek damages against the Dauphin Kings and the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association. Teams in the WOJHL experienced double the operating costs at the junior A-level in the CHA, and were unable to generate subsidiary income through raffles due to regulations in Ontario. Despite the challenges, league president Frank Basso felt that the talent level had improved and would be at the same calibre as the OHA by the next season. He stated that league attendance figures justified the marketing efforts, and a desire to expand to eight teams for the 1969‚Äì70 season. Cities in Southwestern Ontario that expressed interest in joining the league included Stratford, Windsor and Woodstock; and Basso was actively negotiating with teams from Northern Ontario. Butlin expected the WCHL to expand to British Columbia for the next season, and mentioned that Vancouver was actively scouting for players and he also wanted teams in Victoria and New Westminster. He hoped for at least three teams in each of the provinces in Western Canada, and eventually wanted to see a junior league which spanned across Canada. National championship The Flin Flon Bombers from the WCHL and the St. Thomas Barons from the WOJHL were the respective league champions, and met in the CHA east-west national final for the Father Athol Murray Trophy. It was arranged as a best-of-seven series to begin in St. Thomas, Ontario. The series was the first Canadian national junior ice hockey championship not under the jurisdiction of the CAHA. Butlin also issued a challenge to the CAHA to have the 1969 Memorial Cup champion play against the CHA champion. During the fourth game of the series played on May 5 at the Whitney Forum in Flin Flon, the Barons refused to continue after an on-ice brawl during the second period. The game was awarded to the Bombers who then led the series 3‚Äì1 after four games played. The Barons abandoned the series in the interest of player safety, and departed for St. Thomas despite a scheduled game on May 7 in Flin Flon. The Canadian Press described the Barons as being over-matched in the series and were not up to the calibre of the Bombers of the WCHL. Butlin threatened that CHA would seize the team's assets if the Barons did not play game five, stating that the series cost $10,000 to $12,000 to operate. He later awarded the series to the Bombers and suspended the Barons, and stated any money received from the series would go to cover expenses. The CHA later agreed not to suspend the team, and instead the WOJHL fined the Barons $700 and suspended the coach and manager for one year. Off-season discussions The CHA and a Government of Canada task force on amateur sport both called for changes in the structure of the CAHA, and for better representation and voice for its members. On May 20, 1969, CAHA president Earl Dawson released a restructuring proposal which would implement three separate councils for minor ice hockey, junior ice hockey, and senior ice hockey, to be composed of hockey businessmen and team operators. The CHA and the CAHA met to discuss reuniting, but did not agree on the age limit which was tied to the financial support from the NHL for CAHA development and administration costs. The two sides still disagreed on draft payments from 1968, and legal action on the matter was scheduled to appear before the Alberta Supreme Court in August 1969. On July 30, Butlin and Dawson announced a tentative agreement where the WCHL would rejoin the CAHA, and could use up to five over-age players in the first year. It was expected that the CHA would be phased out, and the WOJHL would continue separate negotiations with the OHA. Other unresolved demands by the WCHL included the right to place a club anywhere in Western Canada without seeking CAHA approval, and to be allowed to take one player from a lower-level junior club in Canada to play in the WCHL. As of September 16, 1969, the agreement was not yet approved by the CAHA. 1969‚Äì70 season On October 4, Butlin stated the WCHL would start its season outside of CAHA jurisdiction. The WCHL demanded that the development fees be paid immediately, whereas the CAHA reportedly wanted to hold the money as a bond until May 1970. Butlin also wanted a joint meeting with the NHL and the CAHA, and threatened to exercise the option clause in its contracts when its players signed with NHL teams. The CAHA terminated peace talks on October 9, but welcomed individual teams in the WCHL or WOJHL to apply for membership. The Winnipeg Free Press reported that the CAHA offered $5,000 in grants each team, but that WCHL teams had asked for $7,000 instead. The WCHL resumed legal action to get development payments from the NHL after negotiations ended. The CHA and the CAHA continued a tug-of-war over the use of on-ice officials, and the CAHA threatened to suspend to any officials who worked games in the CHA. The WOJHL reported that its attendance figures had improved and that were financially breaking even or profiting. The league wanted to continue the east-west CHA championship, and felt that its teams were stronger than the previous season since they had signed players who were not drafted by the NHL and had graduated from other junior league in Ontario who had lower age limits. Butlin did not agree to a national final due to last year's incidents, and concerns about the imbalance of talent. A meeting on March 9, 1970, between the WCHL and the CAHA to resolve all differences ended after 15 minutes. Butlin reported that the CAHA insisted the WCHL accept the same conditions as other junior leagues under CAHA jurisdiction instead of recognizing WCHL concerns. He later claimed that CAHA executives wanted to renegotiate every detail, and called the meeting \\"an absolute farce\\". Merger with the CAHA The CAHA proposed changes the structure of junior hockey in May 1970, which Butlin stated were interesting to the WCHL. Junior hockey would be divided into two tiers, with the WCHL admitted into the top level tier-1 along with the Ontario Hockey Association Major Junior A Series and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The tier-1 teams would be the only eligible participants for the Memorial Cup, would receive greater development payments from the NHL, and be able to select a limited number of players from tier-2 teams. The same proposal would gradually reduce the number of over-age players used in the WCHL from four to two. Later in May, the Alberta Supreme Court ruled in favour of the WCHL being paid $13,200 in development payments based on the wording of the CAHA-NHL agreement. Butlin considered further legal action to seek $40,700 in payments from the 1969 NHL Amateur Draft. On June 24, 1970, the CAHA and the WCHL signed a two-year agreement to reunite the organizations. The WCHL gained direct representation on the CAHA junior council, and paid a flat registration fee per team rather than a percentage of gate receipts. The WCHL was admitted as a tier-1 league, qualified automatically for the Memorial Cup final, and would receive $100,000 in development grants for the 1970‚Äì71 season. The WCHL would be allowed four over-age players in the upcoming season, then reduced to two. The WCHL agreed to abide by the CAHA residency requirements and be limited to transfer six players between branches of the CAHA west of Ontario, and be allowed to select a maximum of two players from a tier-2 team. The WCHL would be expected to abide by any future CAHA-NHL agreements, and the CAHA agreed to distribute outstanding draft money. The WCHL agreed not to expand or relocate teams into other markets without CAHA approval. The CHA was subsequently phased out and the WOJHL was replaced by the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League in 1970, which operated in affiliation to the CAHA.

However, in college she connected with a wise pitching coach who showed her how to let go and just have fun. \\"It broadened my mind more and more\\" she said. \\"And I learned how to enjoy it.\\" Her family was supportive when she decided to become a professional pitcher. Sato left home when she was in high school, \\"so after[wards] ... there was a little distance between the family and [myself].\\" But her parents would follow along with Sato's career through the media ‚Äî she played on her college women's team, and joined the Japan Women's League after it was founded in 2009 ‚Äî and they continue to be \\"very supportive.\\" Sato considered giving up on her dream of becoming a professional baseball player many times. There weren't many opportunities for young women who wanted to pursue a career in baseball. However, the Japan's Women's Baseball League was founded in 2009, just in time for Sato to begin her career.  Professional career = Women's National World Cup  In 2010, at the age of 20, Sato debuted in the 2010 Women‚Äôs Baseball World Cup (WBWC), going 3-0 with a 0.53 ERA, beating Puerto Rico and shutting out Venezuela. She then went on to beat USA, only allowing two hits and no walks, and in effect eliminating them from a shot at the gold. Japan won the title that year, and Sato was named the Cup All-Star starting pitcher. In the 2012 WBWC, Sato was 1-0 with a 0.72 ERA. The Japanese team was undefeated in that tournament and they won their third straight gold medal. During the 2014 WBWC she led with two wins and a 0.00 ERA, pitching 12 innings and 10 strikeouts. She pitched in the gold medal game against USA and out dueled Sarah Hudek. She led her team to a third straight gold medal and received her first MVP award for her dominant performance. In the 2016 WBWC, she had another dominant performance. She led with 21 strikeouts, had a 3-0 record and a 1.33 ERA. She was the starting pitcher in the championship game against Canada, pitching a two-hit, one-walk shutout. She received a second MVP award in a row and was also named All-Star starter. In 2018, Sato won her third straight MVP award in the 2018 WBWC and led Japan to their sixth straight world cup. With that win, she extended Japan's tournament win streak to 30 games. In the championship game against USA, Sato pitched a complete game with only 88 pitches to secure the 21 outs needed. She never allowed a USA hitter to reach third base and was one hit short of a no-hitter. Japan won the game with a score of 3-0. Since Sato‚Äôs debut in 2010, the Japan women's national baseball team has won five world cup medals.  Japan Women's Baseball League  In 2013, Sato made her debut in the Japan Women‚Äôs Baseball League with . She had a record of 6-10 with a 2.23 ERA in 29 starts. She led the league with 62 strikeouts as a rookie. She was 11-9 with a save for North Reia in 2014 and led the loop with 66 whiffs. In 2015, she posted a 9-9, 2.43 record when moving to after North Reia became a development team. During 2016, she improved to 9-3, 2.17, leading the league in wins and ERA. Sato led the league in strikeouts three out of the last four seasons, in wins for the past two, and has a 2.31 ERA over that period. In 2018, Hyogo Dione moved to Aichi from Hyogo and changed their name to . Sato played her sixth year as a professional baseball player with Aichi Dione in 2018.

Early life  Paul Ambrose Tripcony was born in 1901 at Moongalba, North Stradbroke Island on the Myora Aboriginal mission. He was the son of Thomas Tripcony, whose family had emigrated from Cornwall, England and Mary Rose Rollands, whose mother was Ngugi. Thomas Tripcony and his family farmed cattle at Beerburrum and worked oyster banks in Moreton Bay. Paul Tripcony probably attended the local schools on Stradbroke Island. The family moved to the mainland and Paul took up work as a labourer, brewery cellar hand and driver in Brisbane after 1914. He lived with his mother, sister Anastasia and brother Vincent in Kangaroo Point, Brisbane. Both Vincent and their elder brother Albert Tripcony served with the AIF in World War I. Albert Tripcony was killed in France in 1917.  Later life  Paul joined the local trade union and became an advocate for workers rights. He worked at Queensland Breweries, Bulimba from approximately 1917‚Äì1937. Tripcony was sacked by the Brewery for his role as a union representative. He was Queensland Vice President of the Federated Liquor Union from 1936‚Äì1937. He subsequently worked for the Brisbane City Council as a refrigerated machinery operator and steam roller driver after 1937. He was exempted from war service in 1942, but served in civil defence. A keen collector of books, Tripcony was an enthusiast of bookstores, a member of literary and civil liberties societies and amassed a personal library which included a number of rare books. He collected Australian literature, poetry and bush music, books on politics, Australian Aborigines and their culture and collected Aboriginal stone artefacts from around Minjerribah, his childhood home. He visited the shell middens on Stradbroke Island, noting the ancient campgrounds and his knowledge of these informed anthropologists and other researchers who have studied these ancient sites. He and his brother returned to live at North Stradbroke Island for a period before he moved back to the mainland to reside at Lota from the mid-1960s until his death in 1975. He did not marry or have children and was survived by his large extended family, including nephew Robert Anderson, a Quandamooka Elder. Tripcony's ashes were placed in his mother's grave at Dunwich Cemetery on North Stradbroke Island. Many items from Tripcony's artefacts collection were donated to the University of Queensland Anthropology Museum and his book and ephemera collection to the University of Queensland Fryer Library. His handwritten creation story, The Legend of the Lightning's Playground can be found in his nephew's biography and in the Museum of Brisbane. Tripcony interviewed writer and activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal, who had also grown up on Minjerribah and they discussed the languages and history of the island. This recording can be found in the Fryer Library at The University of Queensland, in addition to nine boxes of his papers, correspondence and photographs. His sister, Anastasia's history of the family on Minjerribah can also be found there.

It was founded in 1651 by K√∂sem Valide Sultan, the mother of the Ottoman sultans Murat IV and Ibrahim.  History  View of the main courtyard; many later add-on structures are visible over the original building The han is located in the central historic market district that extends from the Grand Bazaar to the Emin√∂n√º neighbourhood on the shore of the Golden Horn. Since the founding of the first bedesten by Mehmet II in the mid-15th century, the Grand Bazaar developed into the city's main hub of international trade, spawning entire districts of shops, warehouses, and merchant lodgings. A han, a type of urban caravanserai, was a common type of commercial structure in Ottoman architecture (and more broadly in Islamic-world architecture) which served a number of functions including lodging for foreign merchants, storage for goods or merchandise, housing for artisan workshops, and offices from which to conduct dealings. A number of hans were built over the centuries in and around the Grand Bazaar district. Before the construction of the B√ºy√ºk Valide Han, the site was occupied by the 16th-century palace of Cerrah Mehmed Pasha. It was in this palace that one of the first printing presses in the city was set up, in 1567, by Apkar of Sivas. The han was founded in 1651 by K√∂sem Mahpeyker Valide Sultan, the powerful mother of the Ottoman sultans Murat IV and Ibrahim. Its revenues were used to finance the upkeep of the √áinili Mosque she had founded earlier in √úsk√ºdar, the Asian district of Istanbul, through the use of the usual waqf system. In the 19th century the building was inhabited by, and associated with, the Iranian merchant community. An Iranian presence in the city had long existed thanks to Istanbul's position in the Silk Road and due to invasions and political upheaval which had displaced migrants from Iran. By the beginning of the 19th century, most of the Iranian merchant community was established in a small caravanserai called Hoca Han in the Ey√ºp neighbourhood. However the community grew in number and importance during the 19th century following the Treaties of Erzurum (1823-1847) which allowed for the resumption of trade and diplomatic relations between the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran. In order to accommodate this growth, they began to move into the larger and more centrally-located Valide Han. By the late 19th century, many rich Iranian merchant families held their offices here. Iranian Shi'a rituals such as celebrations of 'Ashura were also able to take place in the main courtyard of the han, where a private mosque also served the community. Thanks to the preeminence of the trade route between Tabriz and Istanbul in particular, Iranian Azerbaijanis made up the majority of the community and were specialized in import trades such as carpets and silk. Today the han is severely dilapidated but still partly occupied by offices and businesses, though the occupants are all Turkish rather than of Iranian origin. The Iranian mosque in the middle of the main courtyard still continues to serve as a Shi'a mosque connected to the Iranian community, but it is only open for certain occasions. In recent years the han was also visited by tourists enjoying the views of the city available from its rooftop. The interior of the han also made a brief appearance during a motorcycle chase scene in the 2012 James Bond movie Skyfall.  Architecture  The han covers a large area centered around a vast central square courtyard, measuring 55 meters per side, and two other lesser courtyards. While traditional caravanserais typically featured only one central courtyard, the hans of Istanbul grew in complexity over time and sometimes demonstrated irregular floor plans in order to adapt to limited space in the densely built-up city. The B√ºy√ºk Valide Han's irregular layout was an example of this trend and it may have been the first example to have as many as three courtyards. The first courtyard, as one enters the building, is of an irregular but roughly triangular shape, with one side of the structure aligned with the street outside. To the north is the main central courtyard, and north of this is a smaller, rectangular courtyard which is sometimes referred to as the K√º√ß√ºk Valide Han (the \\"Small\\" Valide Han). The main building has two stories; the ground floor was originally dedicated to housing camels and horses, while the upper floor was used as lodging for merchants and wholesale offices. These are accessed via a two- story gallery with vaulted corridors which surrounds the courtyards. In the middle of the main courtyard is a small mosque, which was first built for the Shi'a Iranian community in the 19th century but burned down in 1947 and was rebuilt in 1951. Although the han remains representative of the commercial architecture of its time, it has been modified frequently over the centuries in order to expand and adapt it to evolving needs. By the end of the 18th century, it had grown to hold 366 rooms. Since then, many small structures and new rooms have been continuously added onto the fabric of the old building. The northeastern corner of the building notably incorporates the substantial remains of a large Byzantine stone tower, though there is still some dispute as to its origin. Known as the Tower of Eirene, it originally stood 27 meters tall and is the only such tower still standing in the city today. In the hans older days the tower's upper chamber was used as a mosque and its lower chamber was used as a weaving mill, but today it is largely disused.

The high stone building in the background is the B√ºy√ºk Yeni Han. As the neighbourhood of the B√ºy√ºk Valide Han is at the heart of the city's historic merchant district, the area is filled with a number of other historic Ottoman commercial buildings. The Valide Han is located just east of Uzun √áar≈üƒ± Caddesi (Uzun √áar≈üƒ± Street) and its entrance opens onto Mercan Caddesi (Mercan Street). A number of other historic hans also adjoin this street within the same vicinity, in varying states of preservation. The most notable examples include: the Yeni B√ºy√ºk Han (founded in 1764 and the second-largest han in the city after the Valide Han), the K√º√ß√ºk Yeni Han (built around the same time), and the K√ºrk√ß√º Han (the oldest surviving han in the city, founded by Mahmut Pasha in the 1470s).

Produced by Ray Benson at Austin Recording and Bee Creek Studios in Austin, Texas, and by Benson and Willie Nelson at Pedernales Recording Studio in Briarcliff, Texas, it was released in April 1985 by Demon Music Group in the UK and Stony Plain Records in Canada. The album was later repackaged in the US with three fewer tracks and released under the title Asleep at the Wheel. Following the release of Framed in 1980, Asleep at the Wheel left MCA Records and underwent a series of personnel changes (Benson predicts over 30 members were present at various times from 1980 to 1985). Recording for Pasture Prime took place over the course of three years, beginning with sessions at Nelson's Briarcliff studio in 1981. In 1985, the album received its initial limited release, before Dot Records issued the self-titled version in the United States later in the year. Despite its long and disjointed production, Pasture Prime received largely positive reviews from music critics, who praised its return to the group's classic Western swing style following more experimentation in recent years. It has been highlighted by commentators as one of the band's best releases, while Benson has credited it for \\"rebounding\\" Asleep at the Wheel's career after several years of dwindling popularity and financial issues. The album did not register on the US charts. Background After suffering the departure of many key band members between 1978 and 1980, Asleep at the Wheel faced dwindling popularity and mounting financial problems in the early 1980s. The band was reportedly $180,000 in debt to the Internal Revenue Service in 1980 following the release of its only album for MCA Records, Framed. Bandleader Ray Benson recalls that \\"From 1981 to 1985, we didn't have a record deal,\\" suggesting the band faced difficulty securing a deal due to the increasing popularity of disco, adding that \\"Traditional country was making a comeback, but they [labels] didn't consider us traditional country ... we were living hand-to-mouth, as far as the band was concerned.\\" During what Benson described as \\"the dark age of disco\\", the band played much smaller venues and recorded music for TV commercials. During this period of uncertainty and low popularity, the group also went through a large number of lineup changes. Benson recalled in a 1998 interview for the reissue of Pasture Prime that \\"Our personnel shifted rather dramatically ... We've had over 80 people in the band, and I think almost 35 or 40 of them were in those five years [1980 to 1985].\\" By the time Pasture Prime was released in 1985, only Benson and co-lead vocalist Chris O'Connell remained from the Framed incarnation. Production Recording for Asleep at the Wheel's eighth album began in 1981 at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Recording Studio in Briarcliff, Texas, initially under the working title The Road Will Hold Me Tonight, with the plan to release it on Nelson's own label Lone Star Records. Speaking about the sessions, frontman Ray Benson recalled that \\"Willie built himself a recording studio ... we were pals and everything and he said, 'Just come on over and record.' And he opened the studio to us ... So we would go in there when Willie was done recording ... we spent hundreds of hours out there ... So we were broke and out of luck, but ... Willie was just so generous.\\" Willie Nelson co-produced four tracks at his own Pedernales Recording Studio, as well as writing and featuring on one. Four tracks from the sessions produced by Benson and Nelson were included on the final album, featuring a lineup of Benson on lead guitar and vocals, Chris O'Connell on rhythm guitar and vocals, Wally Murphy on pedal steel guitar, Spencer Starnes on bass, Falkner Evans on piano, Steve Schwelling on drums and Paul Anastasio on fiddle; guests included former band member Floyd Domino on piano, Johnny Gimble on fiddle, and Bob Myers on trumpet and saxophone. Nelson featured on his own composition \\"Write Your Own Song\\", which details \\"every musician's frustrations with how label people seem to think it's so easy to write hits\\". Additional recording for Pasture Prime took place in 1983 and 1984. Seven tracks on the album were produced at Austin Recording Studio, with a lineup of Benson, O'Connell, Murphy, Evans, bassist Tom Anastasio, drummer Richard Hormachea and saxophonist Michael Francis. The Roomful of Blues horn section is featured on the recording of Big Joe Turner's \\"Switchin' in the Kitchen\\". The final two songs were tracked at Spencer Starnes' Bee Creek Studios with lap steel guitarist Junior Brown, bassist Anastasio, pianist Tim Alexander, drummer Mike Grammar, fiddler Larry Franklin and saxophonist Francis. Continuing to talk about the album's production process, Benson explained that \\"I finally got all the stuff [from the Pedernales sessions] and I said, 'Gosh, we got an album here.' And then this guy came along ‚Äì actually, it's one of the Tysons from the Tyson chicken empire ‚Äì and said he wanted to make a record on us ... and we wound up with a whole record. So I took the cuts from the stuff we'd been doing for two years, combined them with that, and made Pasture Prime.\\" Release Pasture Prime was initially issued in April 1985 as a limited release in the United Kingdom (by Demon Records) and Canada (by Stony Plain Records). A release in the United States followed in late-October, after Asleep at the Wheel signed as one of the first acts on Dot Records following its acquisition by the band's former label MCA. Ray Benson credited the securing of the US distribution deal to the release of the album internationally first, commenting that \\"Europe's the only place to get anything done. We got the MCA deal because of interest overseas.\\" For the US release, Dot removed three tracks (\\"The Chick's Too Young to Fry\\", \\"Big Beaver\\" and \\"The Natural Thing to Do\\") and retitled it Asleep at the Wheel. Reception Critical reviews of Pasture Prime and Asleep at the Wheel were generally positive. Reviewing the 1998 reissue of the original Pasture Prime album for AllMusic, Anne Wickstrom described it as a collection of \\"classic Western swing\\". An uncredited review of the US version on the website claimed that Asleep at the Wheel is \\"a disc that most fans agree is among [the band's] best\\", praising the \\"expert takes\\" on popular compositions within the genres of country and swing music. Pasture Prime has often been hailed as one of the most important releases by Asleep at the Wheel, and credited for rejuvenating the band's career. In the interview featured on later reissues of the album, Ray Benson recalls that \\"Pasture Prime is a very special album, because it contains almost three years of recording ... After that, it just took off. All of a sudden, the career rebounded for whatever reason. I guess if you hang in there long enough, they either kick you out or bring you back.\\" In a later interview, he dubbed it the band's \\"comeback\\" release, a term also used by Wickstrom in her AllMusic review.

Mor Barak is an American social scientist in the areas of social work and business management, a researcher, academic and author. She is Dean's Endowed Professor of Social Work and Business at the University of Southern California. She is known for being the first to offer a theory-based measure for the construct of inclusion. She was among the first to identify and offer differential definitions for diversity and for inclusion. She coined the term Globally Inclusive Workplace, which she developed into a theory-based model with practical applications. Mor Barak's research has focused on diversity and inclusion in the workplace and the development of intervention practices that corporations, governmental and non-profit organizations can adopt to foster an inclusive workplace. Some of her research has dealt with corporate social responsibility, work-life balance and the science of social good. Her research yielded two measures for diversity climate and inclusion within organizations that have been used in research and practice and translated to several languages: The MBIE Inclusion-Exclusion Scale and the Diversity Climate Scale. In 2007, her book, Managing Diversity: Toward a Globally Inclusive Workplace, received the Terry Best Book award from the Academy of Management. In 2017 she was inducted as a fellow into the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare.  Education  Mor Barak received a BA and an MSW from the University of Haifa in Israel. She received a Fulbright Scholarship and moved to the United States, where she joined the University of California, Berkeley for her Ph.D., and continued to do her post-doc there.  Career  Mor Barak joined University of Southern California (USC) as an Assistant Professor in 1988, becoming Associate Professor in 1994. At the same time, she had a joint appointment at the USC Andrus Gerontology Center. She became Full Professor in 2003 with a joint appointment at the USC Marshall School of Business. In 2004, she was endowed as the first Lenore Stein-Wood and William S. Wood Professor of Social Work and Business, and in 2014, she became the Dean‚Äôs Endowed Professor of Social Work and Business. From 2009 to 2016, Mor Barak was the Director of the Ph.D. Program at School of Social Work at USC. In 2013, she co-founded the Research Cluster on Management, Organizations and Policy Transformation (MOPT), and served as its co-chair until 2016. In 2014, she was appointed as the inaugural department chair of Social Change and Innovation (SCI) in the USC School of Social Work. In 2001, Mor Barak was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation grant to lead the first international interdisciplinary conference on diversity and inclusion in the Foundation‚Äôs Bellagio Conference and Study Center in Italy. Two years later, she received a grant from the Borchard foundation to lead a second international conference with a focus on global inclusion in the Foundation‚Äôs Chateau de la Bretesche in France (2003). Mor Barak has been the Associate Editor of Human Service Organization: Management, Leadership & Governance since 2013.  Research and work = Diversity and inclusion in workplace  Mor Barak‚Äôs research on climate for diversity in the 1990s, was among the first to introduce the construct of inclusion based on scientific findings. Her 1998 article \\"Organizational and personal dimensions in diversity climate: ethnic and gender differences in employee diversity perceptions\\" examined the differences between the perceptions of women and racial/ethnic minority groups from the mainstream corporate culture with respect to diversity climate. Conducted by measuring employees‚Äô perceptions of issues and practices that are important to understanding and managing diversity, the results of the study suggested four dimensions of diversity climate‚Äîpersonal value for diversity, personal comfort with diversity, organizational fairness, and organizational inclusion. In their review of the diversity and inclusion research, Shore et al. noted that Mor Barak was a leader in the field because she was the first to provide a theoretical framework for inclusion as well as empirical testing of that framework. The authors note that \\"most of the research has lacked theoretical grounding ‚Ä¶ and empirical testing‚Ä¶\\", and credit Mor Barak‚Äôs research as being a \\"notable exception\\" in that she has developed a theoretical model of inclusion for women and members of minority groups. She posits that diversity and organizational climate contribute to perceptions of inclusion-exclusion, and mediate job satisfaction, organizational commitment, individual wellbeing, and task effectiveness. Furthermore, they note that \\"Following Mor Barak‚Äôs lead, other empirical studies have been conducted on inclusion practices.\\" Mor Barak‚Äôs research was among the first to make the distinction between diversity and inclusion and yielded two separate measures -- one for diversity climate and one for climate for inclusion that have been used in research and practice: The Inclusion-Exclusion Scale (MBIE) developed in 1998 and revised in 2005 into the MBIE Scale, and the Diversity Climate Scale developed in 2006. They were translated to several languages. Mor Barak wrote the book Managing Diversity: Toward a Globally Inclusive Workplace in 2005 (4th edition, 2017). In the first part of the book, global diversity trends, legislation, and public policies in different countries are analyzed. These analyses provide the foundation for the second part of the book which offers inclusive management practices in business, government, and human service organizations. The book won the Academy of Management‚Äôs George R. Terry Book Award for the most \\"outstanding contribution to management knowledge\\". It also won the Association of College and Research Libraries Choice Award and received positive reviews in academic journals, including a review in the Academy of Management Learning and Education Journal, noting that the book is \\"an excellent resource to develop, theorize, and work out the inclusive workplace in a very comprehensive, encompassing, and multidisciplinary way\\". In 2016, Mor Barak completed a meta-analysis study reviewing 20 years of research on diversity and inclusion in human service organizations.  Social work in workplace  A significant part of Mor Barak's research has focused on social work in the workplace. She wrote articles redefining social work in the workplace for the 21st century. She also co-edited, with David Bargal, a book titled Social Services in the Workplace: Repositioning Occupational Social Work in The New Millennium. Mor Barak's research has focused on social workers as workers with several longitudinal research studies in collaboration with a large public department of children and family services, focusing on retention, burnout, work-life balance and supervision for social workers. Her theory-based meta-analysis exploring the reasons for turnover among social workers published in 2001 in the journal Social Service Review was ranked #4 most cited article in social work in the first decade of the 21st century. Mor Barak was one of the original co-creators of the first Islandwood meetings on Science of Social Work in Doctoral Education in 2013, and of the second Islandwood roundtable in 2014.  The Science and Practice of Social Good  Mor Barak created an original model for social good. Her model, based on interviews with public leaders, business innovators and researchers, is based on three anchor themes: Environmental justice and sustainability; social inclusion; and peace, harmony and collaboration. The model proposes that social good requires global, multilevel thinking and a variety of perspectives, values, and disciplines. Promoting social good requires the engagement of collaborative and nontraditional systems of change. It also requires levering innovative technologies to enable the use of novel and unconventional approaches to designing and executing solutions for achieving social good. Her 2020 volume The Science and Practice of Social Good brings together scholars and practitioners from different disciplines who share their perspectives on social good and provide examples of innovative initiatives.

Working with the city crews, volunteers worked to repair and clean up any damaged items, trash or stores after the protests. Background The George Floyd protests are an ongoing series of protests and unrest which began in Minneapolis the United States on May 26, 2020.The protests are in response to the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died during an arrest after Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis Police Department officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as three other officers looked on.https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/15/george-floyd-killing- good-cops-must-stop-bad-cops-column/5342116002/ The unrest began as local protests in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota before quickly spreading across the entire nation and in over 60 countries internationally in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

En Attendant Nadeau, 3 novembre 2016.. In the next two decades, Didier Ben Loulou undertook a vast project on towns and cities, a collection of portraits under the format of a \\"photographic repertoire\\" of urban geographies. In the historical port of Jaffa and the Ajami Neighbourhood, he observed the comings and goings of populations, their exile and asylum. His focus moved to Jerusalem between the two Intifadas (1991-2008), cornerstone of his work, where he explored the meanders of a city with multiple borders, filled with violence and the sacred. A book, J√©rusalem: 1991-2006, was published in 2008. Didier Ben Loulou questioned the spiritual and the invisible again in a series of images on the Hebrew letters, the Aleph-Bet transcending the sacred and the profane, to establish a bond between the living and the dead (2012)Myriam Boutoulle, ¬´ La g√©ographie priv√©e de Didier Ben Loulou ¬ª, Connaissance des Arts, 7 f√©vrier 2014..

It was confirmed to have spread to Southeast Asia on 13 January 2020, when a 61-year-old woman from Wuhan tested positive in Thailand, making it the first country except China to report a case. The first death occurred on 2 February, involving a 44-year-old Chinese man in the Philippines, also the first outside China. By 24 March, all states in the region had announced at least one case. As of , Indonesia has the highest number of cases and deaths, ahead of the Philippines in both aspects. No deaths have been reported in Cambodia, East Timor, and Laos.  Background  On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.  Timeline  Southeast Asia was among the first regions to be affected by the pandemic. Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia reported the index cases in January and since then their cases were increasing. Indonesia, a country with 273 million population, reported its first cases in March which was relatively late compared to its neighbouring countries, but now being the worst-hit nation in the region. Several countries experienced a significant rise in cases following a Tabligh Jamaat event from 27 February to 1 March at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, where many people are believed to have been infected. Major outbreaks emerged in dormitories for migrant workers in Singapore where social distancing was unable to be practiced.  Confirmed cases = Brunei  280px Brunei confirmed its first case on 9 March 2020 in Tutong, involving a 53-year-old man who had returned from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 3 March. It has spread to all districts of Brunei, except in the exclave of Temburong.  Cambodia  On 27 January 2020, Cambodia announced its first case in Sihanoukville. It involved a 60-year-old Chinese man who had travel history to Wuhan with his family.  East Timor  East Timor confirmed its first COVID-19 case on 21 March 2020. It was an imported case and its origin is unknown.  Indonesia  480px Indonesia reported its first cases on 2 March 2020, after a dance instructor and her mother tested positive for the virus. Both were in contact with a Japanese national who later tested positive in Malaysia. By 9 April, it had spread to all 34 provinces in the country. Jakarta, East Java, and West Java are the worst-hit provinces.  Laos  Laos confirmed its first case on 24 March 2020, becoming the last country in Southeast Asia to report a case.  Malaysia  480px Malaysia announced its first cases on 25 January 2020. It started when eight Chinese nationals were quarantined at a hotel in Johor Bahru on 24 January after coming into contact with an infected person in neighbouring Singapore. Despite early reports of them testing negative for the virus, three of them were confirmed to be infected on 25 January and subsequently quarantined at the Sungai Buloh Hospital in Selangor.  Myanmar  The pandemic reached Myanmar on 23 March 2020. Its first two cases involved a 36-year-old man travelling back from the United States and a 26-year-old man returning from Great Britain. Both were Myanmarese nationals and had tested positive.  Philippines  280px On 30 January 2020, the Philippines confirmed its first case in Metro Manila. It involved a 38-year- old Chinese woman who was confined in San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. The second case was confirmed on 2 February, involving a 44-year-old Chinese man who died a day earlier, which was also the first confirmed death from the disease outside mainland China.  Singapore  Singapore reported its first case on 23 January 2020, involving a 66-year-old Chinese man who flew in from Guangzhou with his family.  Thailand  240px Thailand became the first country outside China to report a case. Its first case was on 13 January 2020, involving a 61-year-old Chinese woman who was a resident of Wuhan. She flew with her family to Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on 8 January where she was detected using a thermal surveillance and then hospitalised. A few days later she was tested positive for the virus.  Vietnam  240px On 23 January 2020, it was confirmed that the pandemic had spread to Vietnam, when a 66-year-old Chinese man traveling from epicenter Wuhan to Hanoi to visit his son tested positive.

Smith bought the palazzo in 1740. The palace was originally a Gothic Byzantine building, but when it became the seat of the English embassy and the residence of Smith, he altered the structure according to the taste of the time: in 1743, painter and engraver Antonio Visentini designed the new facade; the work lasted until 1751. The new facade only reached the present first noble floor. In 1784, the palace passed into the property of Count Giuseppe Mangilli, who added the above floors and invited Giannantonio Selva to decorate the interiors. Selva created a luxurious and unified series of rooms in neoclassical style, still perfectly preserved today. Architecture The neoclassical building consists of three floors with mezzanine and mezzanine in the attic. The ground floor has a water portal placed centrally and dominated by a tympanum. Each of the two noble floors has four rectangular windows arranged regularly and divided by pairs of Corinthian pilasters on the first floor, which also offers a central large opening flanked by Corinthian half-columns supporting a larger gable.

Gibbs‚Äô research merges the fields of sociomicrobiology and bacterial cell biology to explore how the bacterial pathogen Proteus mirabilis, a common gut bacterium which can become pathogenic and cause urinary tract infections, identifies self versus non-self. In 2013, Gibbs and her team were the first to sequence the genome of P. mirabilis BB2000, the model organism for studying self-recognition. In graduate school at Stanford University, Gibbs helped to pioneer the design of a novel tool that allowed for visualization of the movement of bacterial membrane proteins in real time. In 2020, Gibbs was recognized by Cell Press as one of the top 100 Inspiring Black Scientists in America.  Early life and education  Gibbs was born in Jamaica. At a young age, Gibbs‚Äô family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where she attended middle school and high school. In high school, Gibbs ran track and field, just as her parents had when they were in high school. In addition to her athletic endeavours, Gibbs also pursued research opportunities in high school. She completed a summer research internship at Villanova University and two summer internships at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease studying viruses. In 1996, Gibbs pursued her undergraduate degree at Harvard University with an interest in studying microorganisms. Gibbs majored in biochemical sciences and pursued undergraduate research with Roberto Kolter at Harvard Medical School studying biofilms on implants and medical devices. She became second author on a paper exploring the role of nutrient availability in the formation of biofilms. She found that the catabolite repression control protein, which regulates carbon metabolism, is essential for biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition to her research, Gibbs taught science to elementary and middle school students during her undergraduate degree. After graduating from Harvard in 2000, Gibbs attended Stanford University for her graduate studies in microbiology and immunology. Under the mentorship of Julie Theriot, Gibbs explored the movement of surface proteins within bacterial membranes and on bacterial surface walls. During her PhD, Gibbs collaborated with two other labs at Stanford to develop a novel tool to tag the surface proteins on bacteria while they were living to enable visualization of protein movement within in the membrane throughout the microbial life cycle. Her tool is now used today by many labs around the world. Her thesis work utilized this tool to explore the dynamic distribution of LamB, an integral outer membrane protein in E. coli, that is responsible for maltose uptake and attachment of bacteriophages. She found two populations of the LamB protein, one that has restricted mobility and one that has high mobility in the membrane. After completing her graduate work at Stanford in 2005, Gibbs pursued her postdoctoral work in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. She was mentored by E. Peter Greenberg, and began studying the biofilm forming bacteria, Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis forms biofilms on urinary catheters which leads to infections that are often resistant to many antibiotics. Gibbs began exploring the self recognition genes that she hypothesized led to the ability of P. mirabilis to form distinct boundaries between cells of different strains. The study of the ability of bacteria to determine self versus non-self is a very rudimentary form of the ability of immune cells in mammals to detect self versus non-self, and thus Gibbs‚Äô work will lend insight into questions that pertain to humans as well as bacteria. As such, Gibbs explored a set of mutant P. mirabilis in her postdoc that formed boundaries between itself and its parent strain, thus this mutation rendered the bacteria unable to effectively determine self versus non-self. She mapped the loci of these mutations to a six-gene locus that she called Ids for identification of self. She later found that the Ids genes are transcribed as an operon and she located the promoter region of the operon. When swarms of non-self bacteria approached a population of P. mirabilis, expression of the ids operon was increased.  Career and research  In 2010, Gibbs was recruited to Harvard University and was appointed Assistant Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. In 2015, Gibbs was promoted to Associate Professor. Gibbs has had a passion for teaching since her undergraduate years and thus teaches two classes at Harvard, ‚ÄúThe Microbes‚Äù and ‚ÄúSocial Behaviors and Genetics of Bacteria‚Äù. Gibbs is also the principal investigator of the Gibbs Lab where she continue to explore social behaviors in the bacterium P. mirabilis with a focus on how cells determine self versus non-self. Her lab uses genetic techniques to harness the simplicity of P. mirabilis to understand the biological substrates of cell-cell communication, competition, and cooperation. In addition, Gibbs is collaborating with interdisciplinary groups at Harvard to explore the mechanisms of pathogenesis of P. mirabilis, as it is harmless in the gut, but can spread of the kidney and form biofilms on urinary catheters causing infection and disease. Gibbs is also an editor for eLife for the subject area of Microbial and Infectious Disease.  Cellular self versus non-self recognition  In 2013, Gibbs and her colleagues at Harvard were the first to sequence the complete genome of Proteus mirabilis strain BB2000, which is the model system for biological dissection of self-recognition. Gibbs and her colleagues then began to explore the biological mechanisms of self-recognition in P. mirabilis. She found that IdsD and IdsE, two proteins expressed from genes in the Ids operon, seem to encode determinant of strain-specific identity for P. mirabilis and drive sociality within strains of the bacterium. Gibbs and her team later found that IdsD and IdsE proteins derive from different cells within the same strain to mediate communication between cells of the same strain and indicate kinship. With her expertise in studying P. mirabilis, Gibbs has also guided colleagues in her field by publishing methods on how to use this bacterium to analyze the mechanisms underlying swarm expansion, boundary formation, and territorial exclusion.

C. Patil, Doddanna, Dattatreya and Richard Louis in the lead roles with Sudharani in an extended cameo appearance. Directed by Ha Su Rajasekhar, the film produced under Sri Sai Jyothi Creations had background score by Sadhu Kokila. Rajasekhar also wrote the screenplay for the story by L. R. Ranganath Rao. Unlike the usual commercial films produced in India during the '80s and '90s, Curfew did not have any songs, humorous fillers or serious romantic subplots.  Plot  The film begins in Udayapura, Bengaluru the same constituency from which an honest politician Sujjan Rao contested for the M. L. A. post eventually becoming the people's favourite Chief Minister. He is secretly disdained by former Home Minister, Palaksha, and his sidekick Venkatesha\\"Venka\\". They secretly support an extortion gang after their leader, Dalapathy, got jailed in a murder case. After receiving enough complaints from the natives of Udayapura regarding the inefficiency of the police force in maintaining law and order, Sujjan transfers Pradeep to the area as the new Deputy Commissioner. Pradeep was earlier posted as the Circle Inspector in the regional police station until he was trapped in a custodial murder case by Palaksha and got a punishment transfer. The arrival of Pradeep becomes a permanent roadblock for Palaksha's malicious plans and hence decides to seek the help of Dalapathy who owes his jailtime to both Pradeep and Sujjan. Meanwhile, the people of Udayapura and Shantipura calls for a bandh after the government fails to take the right steps against alcohol production in the state and asks Sujjan's tutor and freedom fighter Narayan to lead them. Dalapathy who is hospitalised in a hospital in Mysuru orders his henchmen to manipulate two jobless youngsters, Subbu and Seenu, to help them turn the peaceful bandh into a violent one. Though they just trigger the events, the other goons terrorise the people by destroying shops and taking innocent lives. Even Narayan gets killed. Though Pradeep arrests the rowdies they manage to escape. Dalapathy who escapes to Bangalore allies with Palaksha and continues to terrorise the people forcing Pradeep to call for a 24-hour curfew in Udayapura and Shantipura. The next day when the curfew is relieved for 2 hours for the people to purchase the necessary groceries they are attacked by Dalapathy's goons forcing Pradeep to call for a more rigorous curfew in addition to which a shoot at sight order is issued. To make matters worse Dalapathy bombs the pipeline supplying water to the areas and pits the people dwelling in the slums against police. He also kills an innocent man and makes it look like the police did it. Subbu and Seenu, deeply regretting their actions try to help a sick baby when Subbu gets gunned down by the police. Pradeep, meanwhile, catches the goons from their secret hideout in Udayapura. Later with the help of a journalist, Srinivas, who secretly captured photos of the criminals during the riots Pradeep learns that Dalapathy has escaped from the Mysore prison and travels to Mysuru. There he comes to know from the doctor, Murthy, who treated Dalapathy about how the latter's henchman beat up the doctor's wife for refusing to admit him in the hospital eventually threatening him to help Dalapathy escape. Pradeep with the help of Murthy and Srinivas turns Dalapathy against Palaksha and Venka. After killing them he escapes with a sniper rifle so as to kill Sujjan who has organised a padhayatra. At the end Pradeep saves Sujjan and kills Dalapathy. Sujjan, afterwards, gives a speech on how the people should respect and support the police force. The people of Udayapura, once again, lead a happy life.  Cast  * Devaraj as DCP Pradeep * B. C.

Many of the group which became known as Tucayana Amazonas had been soldiers during the Surinamese Interior War who fought on the side of the National Army against the Jungle Commando. The group felt betrayed by the 1989 Treaty of Kourou, a ceasefire agreement between the Jungle Commando and the Surinamese army, which gave the Maroons more rights, but neglected indigenous rights. The Tucayana claimed to be supported by all tribes. On 31 August 1989, a group of Amerindians took possession of the ferry near Jenny and called themselves the Tucayana Amazonas. They initially caused confusion with non- natives because they thought that Tucayana was a tribe. The Tucayana went on to take villages of Apoera, Washabo, and Bigi Poika where they set up their headquarters. The Tucayana Amazonas were headed by Thomas Sabajo with his brother Hugo \\"Piko\\" Sabajo as second in command in Bernharddorp which was also liberated. Apparently they were fighting against the Army, however the seizure of the strategic villages, triggered no reaction. On 13 October the town of Moengo, a stronghold of the Jungle Commando, got attacked, and 20 soldiers were killed in the fighting. In-fighting occurred between the brothers, and on 31 January 1990, Thomas was disposed as leader. Thomas however switched sides to the Army which quickly moved in to regain control over the villages. The Human Rights Watch and the Organisation of American States claim that the Tucayana had always been a proxy army of the National Army. because the Army did not want to break the terms of the Treaty of Kourou. After the fall of the villages, Piko fled to Guyana. Eight of his supporters were killed near Matta. In early February 1990, the commanders and indigenous chiefs released a statement in support of Thomas. A week later, Piko was arrested by the police in Guyana, and returned to Suriname. Piko and three of his supporters were subsequently jailed in Fort Zeelandia. On 19 February 2020, the men were later taken to Apoera where they were killed. The Tucayana Amazonas continued as a political group, and supported the elections of 1991. On 8 August 1992, a peace treaty was signed between the National Army, the Jungle Commando and the Tucayana Amazonas. In 1992, the Vereniging van Inheemse Dorpshoofden in Suriname (Association of Indigenous Village Chiefs in Suriname) was founded to regain traditional control in the villages, and to act as a political pressure group. As of 2020, the bodies of the victims have not been discovered, and the incidents have not been investigated. The activist group Dwaze Moeders van Suriname claims 12 victims, however Amnesty International considers the number of victims unknown.

Life  Goddard was born in Barbados in 1905 and immigrated to New York City , where he initially worked as a ballet and ballroom dancer. In 1931, he began to study under an Ethiopian rabbi who introduced him to Kabbalah. He was not naturalized until around the time of World War II, when he served in the United States Army. In early 1950s, Goddard lectured at The Town Hall on religious topics. In 1954, he was reportedly planning a \\"metaphysical telefilm show\\", though it is unclear if the project came to fruition. As of his death in 1972 in West Hollywood, Goddard had been resident in Los Angeles for roughly 20 years. He is buried in Westbury Cemetery, Saint Michael, Barbados.  Views  Goddard believed that the Bible should be viewed as a parable of the human psyche as opposed to a record of historical events. Therefore, Goddard did not believe in an external God who answers prayers, but rather that \\"[y]ou are the creator\\". Jonathan L. Walton argues that Frederick Eikerenkoetter, in particular, adopted theories on people's ability to change their situation through \\"feeling\\" that are rooted in Goddard's ideas. Rhonda Byrne and Wayne Dyer have noted that Goddard shaped their views. Margaret Runyan Castaneda, ex-wife and later biographer of Carlos Castaneda, was interested in Goddard's work and introduced Carlos to Goddard's ideas. Mitch Horowitz argues that Goddard was influenced by writer and mystic William Blake and early self-help theorists √âmile Cou√© and Thomson Jay Hudson. Schulson argues that At Your Command (1939) \\"reads like a pocket guide for fascists\\". He continues by noting that \\"the basic idea\\" of the work is that \\"positive thinking can shape reality\\".  Biblical interpretations  The symbolic name of the Creator is known in the Hebrew Bible as Jehovah, or in the Tetragrammaton ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yodh He Waw He). Goddard believes that each letter of the Tetragrammaton represents a metaphysical process of creation. Similarly, Goddard thinks that Noah and his three sons (Shem, Ham and Japheth) are symbols representing the same thing as the Tetragrammaton of Jehovah. According to Goddard, the stories of Esau and Jacob, sons of Issac, are a metaphor of the method by which men manifest their desires.
