He served as Director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research and was a professor at the HEC Paris. From 2006 to 2012, he was a member of the Economic Analysis Council under the Prime Minister of France. Biography In 1969, Mongin enrolled in the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, where he studied literature and philosophy. He was also a student at Sciences Po, where he earned a degree in 1971. He defended his thesis under the supervision of Raymond Aron. It was the first French thesis on the Das Kapital manuscripts of Karl Marx. Following a study published by Cambridge University in 1978, Mongin began researching contemporary and mathematical macroeconomics. In 1980, he participated in collaborative efforts by Herbert A. Simon to conduct research on concepts of rationality in neoclassical economics. Beginning in the 1990s, Mongin participated in a movement in attempt to reform normative economics and lift limits on the global market. In doing so, he developed an improbability theorem commonly used today in economic literature. It was considered to be a generalized form of utilitarianism. Building off of ideals from John Harsanyi, he clarified his economic beliefs in response to recent criticisms of his mentor, Amartya Sen. Mongin's research program on normative economics was implemented at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain, where he was a visiting professor from 1991 to 1996. At the same time, he aimed to develop a form of logic for game theory. In its infancy in the 1990s, game theory would take off and is now widespread. After his time in Belgium, he worked in the THEMA laboratory at Cergy-Pontoise University in Paris, where he met normative economic theorists Marc Fleurbaey and Jean-Fran√ßois Laslier. From 1995 to 2002, he directed the seminar \\"Les Midis d'Economie et Philosophie\\". At the start of the 2000s, Mongin concluded much of his research and began applying his economic theories to politics and the judiciary. This led to his specialization in the judgment aggregation theory. Philippe Mongin died on 5 August 2020 at the age of 70.

Sited on the battlefield of Caporetto, it houses the remains of 7,014 Italians who fell during the battles of the Isonzo. Design and construction The work was initiated by the Italian state in 1936, during the period when Kobarid was in Italian territory. The Extraordinary Commissioner for the Honouring of the War Dead :it:Ugo Cei commissioned Costruzioni Marchioro di Vicenza to build a series of ossuaries and war memorials, including Kobarid as well as Redipuglia and Monte Grappa. Work was completed at Kobarid in September 1938. At the core of the site is a small chapel on the Gradiƒç hill dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and consecrated in 1696. The chapel contained frescoes by a local artist, Luna ≈†arf, but these were mostly lost during the adaptation of the site to the new memorial, and only the fresco depicting universal judgement remains. Beneath this the architect Giovanni Greppi built three octagonal modern structures rising below the baroque chapel and the sculptor Giannino Castiglioni carved the fourteen Stations of the Cross on the winding road that leads up to the shrine from the main square of the town. The remains of Italian soldiers who had fallen between :it:Monte Rombon and Tolmin were removed from the existing military cemeteries of the area, including Dre≈ænica, Dre≈æni≈°ke Ravne, Gabrje, Kamno, Smast, Bovec and Kobarid, and collected in the new shrine. Among the 7,014 remains are those of 1,748 unknown soldiers, collected in six tombs placed on the sides of the central stairways. The names of those who are known are set in serpentine marble panels. The memorialisation of Caporetto The memorialisation of Caporetto was problematic for Mussolini's government, as it was for Italy in general. The defeat was regarded as a stain on the national character, and an acceptable national interpretive framework was needed in order to account for it, preserving both the dignity of the commanders and the admirable qualities of the ordinary troops. Initially the simplest way of reconciling these requirements was often just to avoid the topic of Caporetto as much as possible. The 1934 film Gloria:Documentazione Cinematografica Della Guerra 1915-1918 by Roberto Omegna celebrated courage and national pride, but scarcely mentioned Caporetto at all. However a second narrative also developed, which regarded the defeat at Caporetto as a critical moment in the foundation of the new Italy. The Fascist party referred to Caporetto as the moment of its birth, and all aspects of commemorating the war were subsumed into a new fascist narrative. Mussolini disliked melancholy or mourning sentiments, so the grand war memorials he commissioned were intended to be assertive statements of the dignity of Italy's fighting men. They were also conceived of as sentinelle della patria (‚Äúwatchtowers of the nation‚Äù). At the charnel house, as at Redipuglia, the names of the dead appear under the heading ‚ÄòPresente‚Äô, as if they were still on duty. In building these memorials, Mussolini remobilised the Italian war dead and deployed them in a commemorative landscape of monumental fascist structures. The charnel house commemorates Caporetto as a national Calvary, bringing together the symbolism of the Catholic Passion with the monumental elements of fascist style. The pillars which mark the start of the winding road up to the summit bear, on one side, the cross, and in the other, the star of Italy. The road itself is a sort of pilgrimage route, and those venturing along it may stop to pray and contemplate each of Castiglioni's sculptures, which is provided with a bench for the purpose. Inauguration The charnel house was inaugurated by Benito Mussolini on 20 September 1938. Mussolini was undertaking a tour of the northeast; on the same day as the ceremony at Kobarid he had also inaugurated the Italian ossuary at Oslavia, laid the first stone in the building of a new Autonomous Fascist Institute in Gorizia, opened a new underground power station in Doblar and a new aqueduct in Volƒçe. Two days earlier, as part of the same tour, he had announced fascist Italy's first racial laws in Trieste and inaugurated the giant ossuary at Redipuglia. The Slovenian anti fascist group TIGR planned to assassinate Mussolini during the inauguration of the shrine and a young man from Bovec was ordered to blow him up. However the plot was discovered and the attempt was foiled. Today The charnel house is the only war memorial maintained today by the Italian state which does not stand on the soil of Italy. The remains of all other Italian war dead who fell on Slovenian soil were moved to the ossuaries of Redipuglia and :it:Oslavia in Italy. Every year a ceremony is held at Kobarid to honour the dead.

A stupa is a mound- like or hemispherical structure containing relics (such as ≈õarƒ´ra ‚Äì typically the remains of Buddhist monks or nuns) that is used as a place of meditation. Stupas in Nepal date back to the Licchavi period; Swayambhunath is one of the oldest known buildings in the country and was likely built in the 5th century CE. It was built in Swayambhu, Kathmandu, where the land was declared as sacred to Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha), by the 3rd Emperor of the Maurya Dynasty Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE. According to the legends, the stupa came out of a sacred lotus at the centre of Kathmandu when the city was a lake. Ashoka's daughter Charumati, who married a Nepali prince, built Charumati Stupa in the 4th century. Boudhanath is one of the holiest sites in Nepal, it was closed for 18 months after the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, which completely destroyed the top part of the stupa. After the Annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China, many refugees from Tibet started to settle in the area and convert it into a \\"Little Lhasa\\". Kaathe Swayambhu, a replica of the Swayambhunath that was built in 1650, is located near Thamel. In Lumbini, the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Mahamayadevi gave birth to the Buddha, there are several stupas including World Peace Pagoda, Myanmar Golden Temple, and Great Drigung Kagyud Lotus Stupa. The World Peace Pagoda was built by Japanese Buddhists for about US$1 million; near the stupa is the gravestone of a monk who was murdered by an anti-Buddhist group while the building was being built. The Ramagrama stupa contains the relics of the Buddha and it remains untouched in its original form. According to the legends, Ashoka came to the stupa with a plan to open it, however, when he got there a snake god ordered him \\"not to interfere with the site\\" so he started to worship the site.

Early life Mourgue d'Algue, at the time named C√©cilia Perslow, grew up playing golf at √ñrebro Golf Club, the 18-hole course situated outside √ñrebro in the province of N√§rke in the middle of Sweden. In her teenage years, she traveled between amateur tournaments in Sweden, often in a small car together with friend Liv Wollin, at the time the dominant female golfer in Sweden. Wollin and Perslow in 1966 came to meet in the final of the Swedish Match-play Championship when Perslow was the defending champion. Wollin won the match, despite it was played at Perslow's home course. Amateur career Representing Sweden, at 18 years of age, she was the youngest competitor at the 1964 Espirito Santo Trophy at St. Germain Golf Club, outside Paris in her future home country of France, of which she did not know at the time. After winning the 1965 Swedish Amateur Match-play Championship, she also represented Sweden twice at the European Ladies' Team Championship, 1965 and 1967. In April 1967, still a Swedish citizen only, she won the French Junior Open Match-play Championship, in the semi-final beating Vivien Sounders, England, 4 and 2, who ten years later came to win the Women's British Open, and in the final beating Shirley Ward, Wales, 2 and 1. After moving to France and becoming a French citizen, Mourgue d'Algue represented France at international amateur tournaments and was a member of the winning French team, with Delphine Bourson, Caroline Bourtayre, Sophie Louapre, Sandrine Mendiburu and Val√©rie Pamard, at the 1989 European Ladies' Team Championship in Pals, Spain. She represented France four times at the Espirito Santo Trophy. In 1986, 22 years after she represented Sweden in the same tournament, as well as in 1984, she served as a playing captain and led the French team to silver medals. In 1984, she also finished second in the individual tournament. In 1994, at 48 years of age, Mourgue d'Algue finished runner-up at the Womens Amateur Championship, at the time named the British Ladies Amateur, at Newport Golf Club, England, losing in the final against Emma Duggleby, England 3 and 1. The year after, her 20 years old daughter Kristel achieved the same feat, losing in the final at Royal Portrush Golf Club, Northen Ireland. After turning 50, Mourgue d'Algue was still competitive in regular amateur tournaments and won the 1996 French Amateur Championship, 31 years after her victory in the Swedish Championship. Before she finally won that late career victory, she had been runner-up at the French Amateur Championship four times, 1977, 1980, 1982 and 1985. In later life, Mourgue d'Algue won the individual European Senior Ladies' Championship six times. Personal life In late 1966, she came to France, to play golf at Golf de Saint-Nom-la-Bret√®che, west of Paris, for eight months. She practiced under instructing professional Henri Mourguillat, who also trained French stars of the time Ga√´tan Mourgue d'Algue and Catherine Lacoste. In September 1967, she married Ga√´tan Mourgue d'Algue, one of the best French golf players of his generation, who won the French Amateur Native Championship twice and the French Amateur Open Championship three times and also was a person with great influence on the development of the sport of golf in France. He came to create the magazine Golf Europ√©en and help to establish the Troph√©e Lanc√¥me professional tournament.Ga√´tan Mourgue d'Algue SE Golf Club Their daughter, Kristel Mourgue d'Algue, born 1973, represented France three times at the Espirito Santo Trophy and, like her mother, the Continent of Europe at the Vagliano Trophy.

Career  Agol is a professor and astrophysicist at the University of Washington in the Department of Astronomy. He obtained a B.A. in Physics and Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley in 1992 and a PhD in Physics from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1997. He was awarded a Chandra Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2000, which he took to Caltech. He arrived at the University of Washington in 2003 as an Assistant Professor, and was promoted to the rank of full Professor in 2014. He advised former graduate student Jason Steffen and former postdoc Sarah Ballard.  Research  In 2000, together with Fulvio Melia and Heino Falcke, he proposed the possibility of observing the event horizon of the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way (Sagittarius A *) with interconnected radio telescopes (VLBI at submillimeter wavelengths). This was implemented as the Event Horizon Telescope which detected the shadow of the black hole in the galaxy M87 in 2019. In 2003, he predicted the possibility of the discovery of gravitational lensing in binary stars with Kepler (for example, a white dwarf with a sun- like star), which was also observed with the telescope. In 2005, he was one of the first to show that exoplanet transits can vary over time due to accompanying planets. He coined the term transit timing variation to describe this. In 2011 he proposed that white dwarfs might support a habitable zone for planets which migrate inwards after the red giant phase, and that these could be found with transit surveys. In 2020 a transiting giant planet was found to orbit a white dwarf near this zone with the TESS spacecraft. He discovered the Earth-like planet Kepler-62f, which is 1.4 times the diameter of the Earth and is located in the Goldilock zone. He also was part of the team which discovered the seven-planet system, TRAPPIST-1, including three Earth-like planets residing in the Goldilock zone. He developed a fast Gaussian process technique based on the Rybicki Press algorithm which has been used to model stellar variability in data from the NASA TESS spacecraft.

Biography  Enric P√©rez i Farr√†s was born in Lleida, in 1884, the son of Enric P√©rez i Dalmau and Teresa Farr√†s i Vila. He was married to Elisabet Co√´mans. In 1930 he was the artillery commander of the Spanish Army, he opposed to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, due to the confrontation between the artillery corps and the dictator. He participated in clandestine meetings of officers against the monarchy of Alfonso XIII. In 1931, following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, the president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Francesc Maci√†, appointed him head of the Mossos d'Esquadra. He was a sympathizer of Catalan nationalism. During the insurrection of the Generalitat in Revolution of 1934, he seconded the proclamation of Llu√≠s Companys and participated in the defense of the Palace of the Generalitat of Catalonia against the troops of Domingo Batet. For this P√©rez i Farr√†s was tried in a court martial and sentenced to death along with other officers such as Federic Escofet i Alsina, but the sentence was commuted by the President of the Republic Alcal√° Zamora for perpetual imprisonment. The victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 Spanish general election caused him to be pardoned and released, being readmitted to the army. With the Generalitat restored, he regained his position at the head of the Mossos and was one of the officers who contributed to quelling the July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona, when he directed the attack on the headquarters of the Captaincy General of Catalunya and arrested Manuel Goded, leader of the military rebellion in Barcelona. Once the Spanish Civil War broke out, Farr√°s was appointed \\"military chief\\" of the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias and later assigned to the Aragon Front as military adviser to the Durruti Column, without ever meeting with Buenaventura Durruti. He returned to Barcelona and spent the rest of the war in bureaucratic positions, as military governor of Tarragona and, later, of Girona. At the end of the civil war he went into exile in Mexico . He held a high position in a bank run by Catalan exiles. He collaborated with articles on military strategy in the magazine Quaderns de l'exili and proposed to form a unit of Catalan soldiers together with the Allies during the Second World War. He died in Mexico in 1949.

She is a retired professor of the CCP Central Party School. She is an advocate of political liberalisation and has been critical to CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping. She was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party in August 2020 for criticising the CCP. She has resided in the United States of America since 2019. Career Cai Xia was born in October 1952 in Suzhou and was raised in Jiangsu in a family with close ties to the military, in which she later served herself before joining the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1982. Eventually she turned to work in academia, earning a doctorate in law at the Central Party School in 1988. Specializing in the fields of party ideology and party building of the government party (with \\"party\\" referring to the CCP), she published over 60 scholarly papers between 1989 and 2020. As of 2012, she was a professor at the party-building center of the Central Party School, retiring the same year after 15 years of service. According to an August 2020 article in The Guardian, Cai began doubting the party orthodoxy in the early 2000s, when she assisted President Jiang Zemin with the drafting of his Three Represents theory. By that time she was frequently present in Chinese news media, advocating for liberal views including the opening of the CCP to more businesspeople and professionals. For some years she continued to believe in the ability of the CCP to solve its problems through reform, but her hopes gradually evaporated after Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 and implemented measures that Cai saw as going in the wrong direction. In 2013, she wrote an essay defending Charles Xue (Xue Manzi) after Xue had been arrested on charges of soliciting a prostitute. In the piece, which widely circulated on the microblogging site Weibo, Cai opined that the offence had been a private matter of no consequence to the public, and called for a discussion of protection of individual rights. In 2016, she wrote an article in defence of Ren Zhiqiang, who had been put on probation after that latter's heavy criticism of statements by President Xi about the role of Chinese media. These and other essays were later removed by internet censors. In an August 2020 interview, after her move to the United States, Cai said that the incident that had erased all her remaining faith in the party was the Chinese authorities' handling of the death of environmentalist Lei Yang in police custody. In an essay dated 25 July 2020, published by Radio Free Asia, she denounced the treatment of Xu Zhangrun, who had been detained earlier that month, as \\"openly intimidating all in the Chinese scholarly community\\".  Expulsion from the Party  On 17 August 2020, Cai's membership in the CCP was rescinded and her retirement benefits cut. This was presumed to be in relation to audio recordings in which she called President Xi a \\"mafia boss\\" who ought to be replaced, and in which she described the CCP as a \\"political zombie\\". Cai, who was residing in the United States at the time of the expulsion, told the New York Times that she had contemplated resigning from the CCP since much earlier, and welcomed no longer being a CCP member, saying that it had allowed her to regain freedom. On 23 August 2020, in an interview with CNN, Cai Xia expressed support for the U.S. government's ban on Huawei and proposed that the U.S. government impose sanctions on CCP officials, while asking the international community to prevent the CCP from infiltrating international organizations.

It is the only European network focused exclusively on the elimination of violence against women and children, and it lobbies state governments and relevant bodies of the Council of Europe at the EU level to gain sustainability of women‚Äôs services. In keeping with the aims of the United Nations, WAVE highlights ending all forms of violence against women and children in both public and private life, following document such as the Vienna Declaration, the Declaration on Violence Against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action. The current executive director of Women Against Violence Europe is Stephanie Futter-Orel.  Background & History  The inspiration for WAVE began in 1993 at the World Conference on Human Rights, which was held in Vienna. The conference explicitly named violence against women as a violation of human rights, which was outlined in the resulting Vienna Declaration. The Declaration defined violence against women, and called for states to take concrete steps to prevent it. Following this, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in December 1993. In October 1994, women gathered at the Vienna NGO Forum to prepare for the 4th UN Conference on Women in Beijing, where the idea of creating a European network dedicated to eliminating violence against women appeared. At the Beijing Conference from September 4 until 15 1995, progress was made on forming the network and initiators ran a working group, with the Platform for Action being developed as a result. The WAVE founding group held its constituent session during the World Conference and, in October 1996, WAVE held its first networking session in Utrecht. The group was originally named the ‚ÄúInformation Centre Against Violence‚Äù before changing its title to ‚ÄúWomen Against Violence‚Äù and then ‚ÄúWomen Against Violence Europe‚Äù. The organization‚Äôs first meeting took place at the Intervention Centre Against Domestic Violence in Vienna in December 1996, and in 1997 WAVE held its first conference in Belgrade, Serbia. WAVE‚Äôs work has been supported by the European Commission since 1997. In 2014, WAVE became a legal entity in Austria.  Organization structure = WAVE Network Members  WAVE consists of various European women‚Äôs NGOs who seek to combat violence against women and children. There are currently over 150 members supported by WAVE who work at national level in 46 European countries. Members include network organizations, single organizations and individuals. Each country is represented by the delegate and co-delegate of their choice.  Board members  The WAVE board includes up to eight members serving for two years. Since January 2019, Pille Tsopp-Pagan and Marcella Pirrone have been serving as president and vice president accordingly.  Advisory Board members  The Advisory Board (AB) is meant to support the Board with strategic advice by bringing issues arising in their home countries and therefore the AB is meant to ensure there is representation from all regions and help the Office to work closely with members during the bi-annual meetings. The Advisory Board is composed of a representative of each country in which WAVE is present.  Office  The WAVE Office Team serves as a point of contact between the involved women‚Äôs organizations in Europe. Main functions include the collection and dissemination of data on women‚Äôs support services (WSS) and any applicable legal provisions, creation of prevention programs, campaigns and international activities. The Office is involved in advocacy work at the European and national level, producing publications and organizing relevant activities.The current executive director of Women Against Violence Europe is Stephanie Futter-Orel.  Principles  The network‚Äôs aims are to promote and strengthen the human rights of women and children, specifically by preventing violence against these groups, and to eliminate all forms of violence against women in order to attain gender equality. WAVE seeks to reach these goals by empowering other organizations fighting for women‚Äôs rights, especially those providing direct services and aid to women impacted by violence.https://wave- network.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WAVE_Statutes_EN2017.pdf  Main Activities  1\\\\. Advocacy 2\\\\. Capacity building of women specialist services (WSS) 3\\\\. Exchange of information 4\\\\. Research 5\\\\. Networking  Key programs/Initiatives = Step Up! Campaign  This is a European-wide WAVE campaign, which is meant to increase efforts to end violence against women, raise awareness of the issue, mobilize for the rights of women and children to live free from violence and protect female survivors of such violence. It recognizes the Istanbul Convention as the most powerful legal tool in Europe to promote its aims and considers knowledge and education key elements to its program‚Äôs success.  The WAVE Youth Ambassadors  The WAVE Youth Ambassadors support the Step Up! Campaign since October 2018 and are nominated every two years. All their actions revolve around raising awareness towards a young target about violence against woman and girls. The group usually consists of around 10 to 15 young people (age 18-27) from the participating campaigning countries.  Civil Society Strengthening Platform (CSSP)  CSSP aims to build women‚Äôs voices and agency at a regional level. It is meant to increase the capacity of women‚Äôs organizations‚Äô platforms and networks as a tool to support women‚Äôs civic engagement in CEDAW and Istanbul Convention monitoring and reporting. It is part of a 3-year program funded by the European Commission and UN Women called ‚ÄúImplementing Norms, Changing Minds‚Äù.  CYBERSAFE Project  It is an European project meant to prevent cyber violence towards women and girls. Part of the project has included developing a game which allows young people to understand the risks associated with cyber violence. WAVE is participating in the project with partners from 8 EU countries.  TISOVA  A European Erasmus+ program started in September 2017, it is meant to establish partnerships between senior centers and their involved partner country. It utilizes an interactive training program to educate key groups on violence enacted against the elderly.

To date, it has been implemented in six partner countries.  MARVOW  MARVOW Project is the European project, which consists of 6 partners, with the support of 9 associate partners, in 4 European countries. It will develop comprehensive multiagency cooperation model for working with elderly victims of abuse. MARVOW will also assist with implementation, intervention and work with perpetrators.  DIS.CO  This program was meant to provide educational and vocational training for counseling professionals working with women victims of violence and/or abuse from a distance. It was a two-year Erasmus+ program.  Funding  The WAVE Network is largely funded by the Operating Grant given by the European Union and other grants, including OAK Foundation, UN Women, Open Society Foundation, Federal Ministry, Labour, Social Affairs, Health and Consumer Protection, Federal Minister for women, families and youth, Frauen Stadt Wien MA57. WAVE also receives funding from an annual membership fee.  Publications  Every other year since 2008, WAVE has been publishing the so called Country Reports. The Country Reports inform about the situation of women‚Äôs specialist support services in Europe. As a guideline to measure progress and deficits the standards defined in the Istanbul Convention is being used. The extensive data collection gives insight into the accessibility and operation of national women‚Äôs helplines, women‚Äôs shelters, women‚Äôs centers and specialist services for survivors of sexualized violence in Europe. The country profiles give detailed information about the status of each country of the large majority of European states (46 states). Data is collected by an online questionnaire that fulfill minimum standards for data collection required by the Istanbul Convention. Data are collected directly from WAVE Country Delegates every two years. Furthermore, WAVE publishes audiovisuals, a bi-monthly newsletter, policy and thematic papers, research reports and training manuals. There is also the WAVE blog, WAVE fact sheets and WAVE statistics, all accessible through the main website. WAVE publishes a magazine called Fempower, whose articles appear on the WAVE blog. On April 2020 WAVE inaugurated a podcast series called ‚ÄúWhat the WAVE?‚Äù during the COVID-19 pandemic. The podcast is thought to be an alternative informative source from a feminist angle and features inspirational stories of feminist icons. The podcast is advertised on WAVE‚Äôs social media. WAVE spreads its information on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Agnes was also the daughter to James Syme (a Scottish surgeon).  Early life  Agnes was born in Edinburgh, Midlothian Scotland in 1834 to James Syme and his first wife Anne Willis; she was one of three only surviving children (nine of their children had died). Her mother died in 1840 after giving birth to their ninth child. Like her father , Agnes had a keen interest in science.  Work, life and marriage with Joseph Lister  James Lister and Agnes Lister (formally Syme) seated together Agnes and Joseph Lister met in Glasgow, whilst he was studying to be a surgeon working as her father's assistant. Lister converted to the Scottish Episcopal Church in order to marry Agnes as she was not raised as a Quaker. They married on the 23rd of April 1856 in Milbank Scotland. The couple began their honeymoon at Lister's childhood home in Upton Essex and then embarked on a three month tour of Europe. During this tour, it is thought to be the beginning of Agnes working as his assistant, writing his notes and findings in his case book whilst they traveled around Europe. The couple returned to Edinburgh in October 1856 and settled into their new home on number 11 Rutledge Street Not only would she write his finding, thoughts and ideas down but she was also his collaborator and partner in writing of many sources, between 1872-1877 such as: * Drawings on Fungi * Notes on academical lectures for his teachings in Glasgow and when addressing students Additionally during 1863-1894 they wrote common place books, the majority being in her handwriting. On subjects such as * Bacteria * Catgut * Antiseptic dressings Furthermore, Agnes Lister was also involved in a lot of Joseph Lister's experiments. They would both test different levels of chloroform (an early form of anesthesia) on each other in order to find the correct dosage for his patients. The couple were also interested in botany and would often collect different specimens of plants whilst travelling around Europe together. Botany was one of the few sciences deemed appropriate for women to study/partake in, in the 18th century. 53 herbarium sheets of plants belonging to Joseph Lister appear in both their hand writing. Although in good health, whilst holidaying in Rapallo Italy and botanizing. Agnes Lister contracted acute pneumonia. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died four days later after being on holiday for only one week. Leaving Baron Lister as the only surviving member of their union as they did not have any children.

Since 2016, she has served as Minister for Family, Women, Youth, Integration and Consumer Protection in the state government of Rhineland- Palatinate. Prior, she was a prominent youth leader in Germany during the 2000s. She was first elected to the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate in the 2011 state election, and re-elected in 2016. Personal life Spiegel has Italian ancestry; among others, her maternal grandmother is from Sicily. Spiegel grew up in Speyer and Ludwigshafen, and attended the Albert Schweitzer elementary school, passing her Abitur in 2000 at the Heinrich B√∂ll grammar school. She then studied politics, philosophy and psychology in Darmstadt, Mainz, Mannheim, and Salamanca until 2007. In spring 2007, she graduated as Master of Arts from the University of Mainz with a major in political science and minors in philosophy and psychology. She then worked as a language teacher at Berlitz in Mainz, Mannheim and Heidelberg from 2008 to 2010. Spiegel lives in Speyer with her husband, who is Scottish, and four children. Political career=Youth politics Spiegel was a member of the board of the Green Youth of Rhineland-Palatinate from 1999 to 2002, including two years as board spokeswoman. She then served on the federal board of the Green Youth until 2004. In 2005, Spiegel became the first German youth delegate to the United Nations. In autumn 2005 she represented young people in Germany at the United Nations General Assembly, where she also met the then-Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan. State politics In the 2006 Rhineland- Palatinate state election, Spiegel was the Greens candidate in the constituency of Ludwigshafen am Rhein II, and #7 on the party list. The party fell short of the 5% electoral threshold and failed to win any seats. In the 2011 state election, Spiegel was the Greens candidate in the constituency of Speyer. She won 17.1% of votes, placing third behind the CDU and SPD candidates. She was third on the party list and was comfortably elected as one of the 18 Greens deputies, becoming deputy leader of the party's parliamentary group in the new Landtag. She served as spokesperson for women, integration, migration, and refugee policy. From 2014 to 2016, Spiegel also served on the Speyer city council. In the 2016 state election, she was again the Greens candidate in Speyer, this time winning 10.4% of votes. She was again elected third on the party list. After the Greens entered a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party and Free Democratic Party, Spiegel became Minister for Family, Women, Youth, Integration and Consumer Protection in the second Dreyer cabinet. She resigned from the Landtag to join the cabinet and was succeeded by Pia Schellhammer. State minister As Minister for Family, Spiegel continued the work of her predecessor Irene Alt in advocating for marriage equality, campaigning for a vote in the Bundestag on the issue. In November 2016, she wrote a protest letter from the Bundesrat to Norbert Lammert, then President of the Bundestag. The initiative undertaken by Spiegel led to the introduction and passage of the Act introducing the right of marriage to persons of the same sex in June 2017. Spiegel became the first minister in Rhineland-Palatinate to take maternity leave, which she did in April 2018 to give birth to her fourth child. Spiegel brought the baby to a meeting of the Federal Council in October 2018. In November 2018 she represented the German federal government at the Women MPs Conference on the subject of \\"100 years of women's suffrage\\" in London. There she also met then- Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May. At the meeting, Spiegel urged her to prevent Brexit.

Nixon‚Äôs main research interests include using gait and ear as biometrics and using soft biometrics for identification. He has served the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) in several offices. Nixon has authored 4 books including Image Processing & Feature Extraction, Human Identification based on Gait and Introductory Digital Design. He has around 20,000 citations. Nixon became a BMVA Distinguished Fellow in 2015. He is a Fellow of the International Association of Pattern Recognition.  Education  Nixon graduated from University of Reading in BSc Cybernetics Science with Subsidiary Mathematics in 1979. He completed his doctoral studies in Applied Estimation Theory from the same university in 1983.  Career  Nixon joined University of Southampton in 1983 and became Professor of Electronics and Computer Science; he was awarded Personal Chair in 2001 and retired in 2019. Nixon has held several leadership and management positions over the course of his career. He was appointed as President of the IEEE Biometrics Council from 2017 to 2018. He was appointed as Chair of the International Association of Pattern Recognition (IAPR), while also serving as member of Nominating Committee and Advisory Committee. He has been serving as the vice-Chair IEEE PSPB since 2018. He is an advisory editor for Pattern Recognition Letters.  Research  Nixon‚Äôs research on biometrics and computer science has continued for over 20 years, focusing on using human gait as a biometric and the use of ears in biometrics. In his initial work with face recognition, his team applied new techniques for shape extraction and description and more recently formulated them for moving objects. This research is also applied to medical imagery and in remotely‚Äìsensed image analysis. Nixon‚Äôs research approaches operate on spatial images, video and in 3D. Nixon's later research was focused on mechanisms that seek to cross the semantic gap and to learn human descriptions from computer vision features and conversely to learn image features from human descriptions; also using soft biometrics where the use of human descriptions for biometrics purpose is pioneered. In the recent years, Nixon and his team have described how subjects can be recognized by human descriptions (attributes) of their body, face and their clothing. Nixon‚Äôs work of fusion of soft biometrics leads to the identification and search for subjects in video material and also has an impact on the eyewitness procedures. Nixon has also worked into developing a new approach to analyze acceleration in image sequences based on the fact that most approaches to analyzing velocity actually subsume many types of motion. By separating out acceleration, a new capability can be observed, e.g. rotational acceleration to find a walking subject‚Äôs feet, as well as new capability to detect violent actions since acceleration is innate to such acts. Nixon was featured in the IAPR newsletter and in ‚ÄòBiometric Technology Today‚Äô in 2016. His work received extensive media coverage in 2018 when it was applied in an egregious case in Australia to identify a subject who cased a shop and then murdered its owner. Nixon‚Äôs book Feature Extraction in Image Processing and Computer Vision published in 2002 was the first book concentrating solely on the topic. He was awarded the Notable Book Award by the Computing Reviews in 2012 for his work in the book. According to Elisa Smith from IAPR newsletter, the book contains ‚Äúa broad overview of the field presented at a level of depth aimed at those who are new to the field‚Äù. The book is praised for its citation of ‚Äúan overwhelming and impressive number of books, conference, and journal articles on a broad range of topics‚Äù.

She is said to be the basis for a story by Sir Walter Scott. Lady Stair's Close in Edinburgh is said to be named for her, but another source says it was named for her mother-in-law. Life Her birth date and place are unknown but she was the last child of seven born to Lady Margaret Montgomerie and James Campbell, second earl of Loudoun (d. 1684). Her parents owned land and she had a home education. In June 1697, she married James Primrose who already was a \\"Sir\\" and in time he would become a Viscount. Her new husband also had land and he was a member of parliament. They had four children. She found her husband cruel and she eventually deserted him and went to live with her mother after she said that she thought he intended to use a sword on her. He went aboard and while he was away she visited a fortune teller. During the session, she said she saw a vision of her brother interrupting a marriage where her husband was getting married. This was so strange that she wrote it down. This alleged premonition was proven when her brother returned from abroad and he confirmed that he had prevented her husband from committing bigamy. Dalrymple's premonition was said to be corroborated by her earlier written account that that she was able to present which described her visit to the fortune teller. This story is said to be the basis of a story by Sir Walter Scott, \\"My Aunt Margaret's Mirror\\" which was one of The Keepsake Stories. In 1703 her estranged husband became Viscount of Primrose and in 1706 she became a widow and according to another story she intended to stay that way. She was said to have refused to marry John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair, so he broke into her house so that neighbours could see him through her bedroom window. According to the story she was obliged to marry him to explain the strange man in her bedroom. Her problem's continued and according to reports her new husband was in the habit of being drunk and violent. One story says that one evening her husband hit her and her face bled. She slept that night without looking after the wound. Her husband was so shocked in the morning that he vowed to only take a drink in future if it was with his wife's approval. They lived at Castle Kennedy in Wigtownshire and at Newliston in Linlithgowshire. John died in 1747 and she lived on to 1759. Lady Stair's Close in Edinburgh is said to be named for her, but another source says that the close is named for Lady Stair's House which in turn was owned by the Dowager of the first Earl of Stair (her mother-in-law).

He was born in France, and probably died in Rome. He lived and worked in Rome from 1759 to 1772. Nothing is known about his origins, his early life, his master, or how he got from France to Rome. Interest for Argo was renewed in the late 20th century and early 21st century, when four albums by Ango were acquired and exhibited by the Copper Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. Julien's last mention of him was on January 16, 1773. According to French historian Pierre Rosenberg, Ango died in 1773. Life and career=Early life, move to Rome and career Most biographical information on Ango comes to us through his friend Jean-Antoine Julien, a French painter. In his autobiography, Julien established that Ango was already in Rome in November 1760. Ango's first patron was Jean-Claude Richard de Saint-Non, while his second and only other patron was Jacques Laure Le Tonnelier, le Bailli Breteuil (1723-1785). Ango's four albums in New York once belonged to the latter. Ango surviving oeuvre consists entirely of drawings. Four paintings were recorded, but they are now lost. Julien described Ango as a painter as well. Most of his surviving drawings are of notable paintings and decorations in Roman churches and palaces; however, some attest a knowledge of Naples. In fact, on March 18, 1761, Ango and Jean-Honor√© Fragonard were given permission to draw copies of the artwork in the gallery of Capodimonte, in Naples. Many of Ango's drawings are copies after Old Masters' paintings and sculptures, such as that of an untraced painting by Guercino, and Duquesnoy's Tomb of Ferdinand van den Eynde. In some instances, his copies are after some contemporary artists, and he also reworked counterproofs of drawings. Ango recorded in drawing the paintings in Bailli de Breteuil's collection in Rome, who, as mentioned, was his second and only other patron besides Richard, and an ambassador of the Order of Malta to the Holy See from 1758 to 1780. In fact, in 1770 Ango referred to himself as dessinateur de M. le Bailli de Breteuil. His best known opus, however, is the collection of drawings after which 27 etchings were engraved by Jean-Claude Richard for his Recueil de griffonnis, de vues, paysages, fragments antiques et sujets historiques. All of them are copies of paintings located in Rome. Later years, death and legacy Pierre Rosenberg described Angos's final years in Rome as half- paralyzed, probably from a stroke. In fact, in 1772, in a letter to the Flemish painter Andries Cornelis Lens, Julien, Ango's contemporary, referred to an attack of apoplexy that had left Ango half-paralyzed (the term apoplexy once referred to what today is called a stroke). Ango depended on the selling of his drawings as his only source of income. He was reduced to living on charity, begging in the streets. Interest for Ango and his oeuvre was renewed when four of his albums came into possession of the Copper Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. The albums comprise 151 drawings, all executed in red chalk, on an average size of 215 x 148 mm. In these albmus, when the drawings are after paintings, they almost never depict the full work, but rather study details. On the other hand, drawings after sculpture usually show the full form. These drawings are valuable in that they record the state of paintings and sculptures in Rome in the late 18th century. Further, they may depict Roman sculpture and paintings now lost; despite diligent search, only half of the subjects depicted in Ango's oeuvre have been identified. However, there is no known original composition by Argo, as all his extant drawings are after opera by other artists. Ango's personal drawing style has only recently been recognized. For a long period after the eighteenth century, his drawings were attributed to Hubert Robert, whose drawings Ango copied and whose counterproofs he drew over. Ango habitually signed his drawings H. Roberti (H for Hannibal, his nickname) and Roberti for Robert, his last name. His drawings were (and still are) confused with those of Robert, many of them being signed \\"Roberti.\\" Over the past few decades, drawings in the collections of various museums, such as Harvard's,harvardartmuseums.org have been reattributed. However, many of Robert's drawings, in particular those at the Louvre, remain contested.arts-graphiques.louvre.fr File:Jean-Robert Ango - after Duquesnoy - Tomb of Ferdinand van den Eynde.jpg File:Jean-Robert AngoTheatre d'eau.jpg File:Jean-Robert Ango - Drawings after Ornament and Architecture - Google Art Project.jpg File:Massacre des Innocents - JR Ango - Fogg Art Museum.jpg File:The Infant Moses before Pharaoh, after Giovanni Battista Ruggieri MET DP874781.jpg ReferencesSources  Category:French artists Category:French painters Category:French male painters Category:18th-century French painters ","title":"Jean-Robert Ango"},{"id":"65061877","text":"From 1959 to 1989, the city of Leipzig awarded the \\"Kunstpreis der Stadt Leipzig\\", which was given for outstanding merits in the artistic field to persons who promoted the reputation of the city beyond the region: architects, visual artists, composers, musicians, singers, actors and writers as well as literary and art critics.

Her work is held in collection at the National Gallery of Australia and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She has won awards in categories for bark painting and three-dimensional work at the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA). Her work is represented in the Kerry Stokes Larrakitj Collection, which was exhibited by the Art Gallery of Western Australia and also gained an exhibition place at the Sydney Biennale.  Background  Gumana was born in 1953 and lived in the Gangan homeland of the Blue Mud Bay region in Northeast Arnhem Land. She is an artist with Buku-Larr≈ãgay Mulka Centre in Yirrkala, an Indigenous community-controlled art centre of Northeast Arnhem Land. Her complex and fluid paintings frequently refer to the story of the all-powerful Rainbow Serpent or ‚Äòwititj‚Äô (olive python) as it travels through her mother's G√•lpu clan lands. She mainly represents the G√•lpu clan designs of ‚Äòdhatam‚Äô (water lily), ‚Äòdjari‚Äô (rainbow), ‚Äòdjayku‚Äô (file snake) and ‚Äòwititj‚Äô (olive python), applying the technique of ‚Äòmarwat‚Äô (cross-hatching) using a finely controlled hair brush. Intellectual property rights of clan designs are held by the clan, and only people with rights to certain designs are able to use them. Gumana is well-known for her production of larrakitj which the Yolngu people used as bone receptacles in traditional funerary rites. The larrakitj are made from stringy bark trees that have been hollowed out by termites. The trees are selected and harvested after the dry-season fires and are then smoothed and shaped for painting with ochres in a cultural process, with each larrakitj presenting clan-specific designs.  Career  From 2006, Gumana started creating larger and more complex work with the encouragement of her art centre. In 2007, her work was shown for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA) at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin. In 2008, her bark and hollow logs sold out at an exhibition with Niagara Galleries, Melbourne, and her ‚Äòdhatam‚Äô imagery was selected by the Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures for T-shirt and promotional material. By 2009, her larrakitj were part of the Kerry Stokes Larrakitj Collection, which exhibited that year at the Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth, and also won an exhibition place in the 17th Sydney Biennale at the Museum of Contemporary Art in 2010. In 2013, she won a NATSIAA award in the category for Bark Painting, followed by another win in 2019 of NATSIAA‚Äôs Wandjuk Marika Memorial 3D Award for three-dimensional work by an Indigenous artist. Gumana‚Äôs work is held in permanent collections at the National Gallery of Australia and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Her work is part of Kerry Stokes‚Äô Larrakitj Collection, and is also held in private art collections at Woodside Energy Ltd and the Estate of Kerry Packer.

All commercial banks in Syria were nationalised in 1966. The Central Bank gives priority to lending to the public sector, while the private sector often banks abroad, a process that is more expensive and therefore a poor solution to industrial financing needs. Many business people travel abroad to deposit or borrow funds. It is estimated that US$6 billion has been deposited by Syrians in Lebanese banks. Reforms in the finance sector commenced in the 2000s, including the introduction of private banks and granting of licences to foreign banks. However, Syria‚Äôs economy is still highly regulated. Foreign banks, for example, are required to be joint- ventures, and allowed up to 49% foreign ownership, and not hold a controlling stake.The World Factbook. Cia.gov. As of 2018, there were 14 private banks, including three Islamic banks. All these banks had a foreign strategic partner mainly from Lebanon, but also from Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain. Foreign banks are subject to sanctions imposed by various countries. There were no branches of foreign banks in Syria and no 100% owned private Syrian bank, although the laws allow both.THE BANKING SECTOR IN SYRIA IN 2018 The biggest bank by far in Syria is the government-owned Commercial Bank of Syria. History =Nationalisation of banking At independence, French- and British-owned banks dominated banking activity in Syria. The largest bank, the French-owned Banque de Syrie et du Liban (Bank of Syria and Lebanon), assumed central-bank functions and became the bank of currency issue, in addition to its commercial operations. In 1947 Syria joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar at 2.19148 Syrian pounds = 1 US dollar, a rate that was maintained until 1961. The Central Bank of Syria commence operations in 1956. It controls credit and commercial banks, controls the money supply, issues notes, and acts as fiscal agent for the government. Also in 1956, as a result of the Suez War, French and British banking interests in Syria were seized as enemy assets. In 1958, and after the union with Egypt, the state began to Arabize the commercial banking system and in 1961 implemented a policy of limited nationalization. In 1966, the government nationalised all remaining commercial banks in Syria, which were merged into a single consolidated Commercial Bank of Syria. The government created six specialised state-owned banks to promote economic development.Banking and Monetary Policy The six banks still operate today and are the Central Bank of Syria, Commercial Bank of Syria, Agricultural Co- Operative Bank, Industrial Bank, Popular Credit Bank, and Real Estate Bank. Each bank extends funds to, and takes deposits from a particular sector. Until the 2010s, the Commercial Bank was the only bank in Syria allowed to deal with foreign currency, and was allowed and able to finance foreign trade. The Industrial Bank also is directed more toward the public sector funding, although it is under-capitalized. Reforms since 2000 In the 2000s, Syria started reforms in the financial sector. In 2001, Syria legalized private banks and the sector, while still nascent, has been growing. The old Money and Credit Council and the Central Bank of Syria were reactivated, restoring their role as monetary policymakers and regulators. Foreign banks were given licenses in December 2002, under Law 28 March 2001 which allows the establishment of private and joint-venture banks. Foreigners are allowed up to 49% ownership of a bank, but may not hold a controlling stake. The Damascus Securities Exchange was opened in March 2009.\\"Syria launches first stock exchange\\". Google, AFP (10 March 2009). Syria took gradual steps to loosen controls over foreign exchange. In 2003, the government decriminalized private sector use of foreign currencies, and in 2005 it allowed licensed private banks to sell specific amounts of foreign currency to Syrian citizens under certain circumstances and to the private sector to finance imports. In October 2009, Syria further loosened restrictions on currency transfers by allowing Syrians travelling abroad to withdraw the equivalent of up to US$10,000 from their Syrian pound accounts. In practice, the decision allows local banks to open accounts of a maximum of US$10,000 that their clients can use for their international payment cards. The holders of these accounts can withdraw up to US$10,000 per month while travelling abroad. To attract investment and to ease access to credit, the government allowed investors in 2007 to receive loans and other credit instruments from foreign banks, and to repay the loans and any accrued interest through local banks using project proceeds. In February 2008, the government permitted investors to receive loans in foreign currencies from local private banks to finance capital investments. The law passed in 2006 permits the operation of private money exchange companies. However, there is still a black market for foreign currency. In January 2010, there were 13 private banks, including two Islamic banks. In 2018, there were 14 private commercial banks, of which three were Islamic banks. International sanctions  The Syrian Central Bank has been subject to U.S. sanctions since May 2004, under Section 311 of the Patriot Act, with the Bank being accused of money laundering. The sanctions shut Syria out of the global financial system. The U.S. sanctions increased the role of Lebanese and European banks because a ban on transactions between U.S. financial institutions and the Syrian Central Bank increased the demand for intermediary sources for US$ transfers. Because of Syrian government actions during the Syrian Civil War, that began in March 2011, Syria has been subject to various sanctions by the U.S., Canada, EU, Arab League and Turkey. U.S. sanctions imposed by the Caesar Act came into effect on 17 June 2020. To circumvent the sanctions, Syrians effect foreign transactions through banks in neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon, but making them vulnerable to economic disruptions in those countries. Since the start of the Civil War, and because of international sanctions, there has been a capital flight to nearby countries. Foreign exchange The government maintains two official exchange rates for the Syria currency, the Syrian pound (SYP) ‚Äî one rate on which the budget and the value of imports, customs, and other official transactions are based, and a second set by the Central Bank of Syria on a daily basis that covers all other financial transactions. An exchange rate of about 50 SYP to US$1 was usual in the early 2000s, subject to fluctuations. The pound's official exchange rate has fallen from 47 SYP = US$1 before the start of the Syrian Civil War in March 2011 to 700 in March 2020 and 1,250 in June 2020. The official rate was 515 SYP in July 2017, when the peg for the Syrian pound was changed to the IMF SDF (Special Drawing Rights),Syria ends pound's peg to U.S. dollar BLOOMBERG MARCH 27, 2017 though the rate tends to be quoted in relation to the US dollar. The official rate on 2 December 2019 was 434 SYP = US$1, and SYP 471.53 = US$1 on 1 September 2020. https://themoneyconverter.com/USD/SYP The black market is the only source of foreign currencies for Syrian nationals who want to travel abroad, as well as those attempting to circumvent sanctions by effecting foreign transactions through banks in neighbouring countries or want to hold cash outside the country. The currency has been devaluing significantly, especially since the start of the Syrian Civil War, and continued to plunge further. On 29 November 2019, following protests in Lebanese, the black market rate was 765 SYP = US$1, a decrease of 30% since the turmoil started in Lebanon a month earlier, as the protests led Lebanese banks to impose tight controls on hard currency withdrawals and transfers abroad, making it hard for Syrians to access funds held by them in those banks. The black-market rate fell to 950 SYP on 2 December 2019, another 25% decrease, while the official rate was 434 SYP = US$1. On 13 January 2020, the currency deteriorated further, as more than 1000 SYP was traded for US$1 in the black market, while the official rate continued to be 434 SYP. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Syria, the Syrian pound continued to fall against the U.S. dollar in the black market, where US$1 equaled more than 1600 SYP in May 2020. A month later, the Syrian pound passed 2000 against the dollar, and a few days later, it passed 3000 against the dollar. In June 2020, anti-government local authorities in Idlib Governorate adopted the Turkish lira in place of the plummeting Syrian pound.

Plot A magician dressed as a Renaissance- era lord makes a cone out of a sheet of paper, summons six live rabbits from it, and puts them in a large empty trunk. From the trunk he then takes two women. The trunk briefly fades away to reveal a third woman, then returns to its place. The magician himself then pops out of the trunk. Next he leads the two original women back into the trunk, stands it on its end, and opens it to reveal two male footmen. The magician and footmen stand on the trunk and become the two women, while the three men pop out of the trunk underneath them. All four of the magician's assistants pile into the trunk, which the magician attempts to carry. The trunk seems to flatten the magician, but he emerges from inside it unharmed, and all return for a curtain call. Production M√©li√®s himself is the magician in the film.

Her larger outdoor works are in bronze or iron while those displayed indoors are generally reliefs in wire mesh. Many of her works have been exhibited at the Malm√∂ Art Museum. Biography Born in Stockholm on 6 December 1939, Barbro Agneta Erhardsson was the daughter of Arvid Julius Erhardsson and his wife Birgit. She was raised on the island of Vind√∂ in Stockholm County. Encouraged by her parents, she developed her interest in art and attended the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design between 1960 and 1964 where she trained as a drawing teacher. While studying, she met and married the sculptor Holger B√§ckstr√∂m (1939‚Äì1997). On completion of their studies the couple moved to Lund where Barbro held her first solo exhibition at the Galleri Atheneum in 1965. Thanks to a series of commissions, she created bronze sculptures depicting fragments of human bodies for public outdoor display while her iron works were housed indoors in schools and hospitals. She later created a multitude of smaller works depicting body parts such as stomachs, backs, wings and hands, made from materials ranging from aluminium to plastic and metals. Barbro B√§ckstr√∂m died in Lund from cancer on 8 February 1990 and is buried in Norra Cemetery.

Career and Personal life She was born in 1956 in Uganda, studied medicine in Ireland then worked in New Zealand, Hong Kong and England before finally settling in Australia where she has worked in the field of vascular surgery . She has a professional interest in chronic leg ulcers. She has published multiple scientific papers . Gender equality advocacy She has written one book chapter \\"Women in Medicine: Sisters doing it for themselves\\" in Pathways to Gender Equality: The Role of Merit and Quotas . Her notoriety relates mainly to comments she made in 2015 at the launch of this book. The specific comment which caused the most controversy was \\"What I tell my trainees is that, if you are approached for sex, probably the safest thing to do in terms of your career is to comply with the request.\\" These comments were widely reported in the Australian media. The initial response included much outrage that a senior female surgeon would ever advise a female surgeon in training to accede to an unwanted sexual advance rather than report it . The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) immediately responded with insistence that the correct procedure was to report these incidents for appropriate investigation and that such incidents were rare. After the reports of outrage from some media commentators and initial denials by the RACS of a systemic problem, Dr McMullin responded with specific case histories of surgical trainees who had made complaints which were inappropriately handled. Many had led to the complainant being forced to end surgical training, with the alleged perpetrator going unpunished. Dr McMullin referenced multiple cases that she was aware of that were anonymously confirmed . One of the female surgeons Dr Caroline Tan was prepared to go on the record with her experience with many reporting off-the-record. Response of Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Whilst Dr McMullin's original comments were highly provocative and controversial, they have indirectly led to major changes to governance of surgical training in Australia . A draft report of the RACS found that instead of being rare, 50% of surgical trainees reported bullying (albeit that cultural discrimination was slightly more common than sexual harassment) . In 2016, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons formed an official Diversity and Inclusion plan . Fewer than 15% of active Fellows in surgery in Australia are female as of 2020. With active efforts now by the RACS to increase the percentage of female surgical trainees, it is likely that this proportion will increase. Some of this increase may be considered natural evolution, but some culture change occurs in sudden moments which shock. Historically Gabrielle McMullin has provided one of these moments in Australian surgery and hence has substantially advanced gender equality in this field.

It was made famous by its use in the 1987 film Assa, an official Soviet government film promoting glasnost and perestroika in which Kino's lead singer Viktor Tsoi had a starring role. The song has since become a favourite for political opposition movements in post-Soviet states. It has been used in Russia by opponents and supporters of President Vladimir Putin, by Ukrainian Euromaidan protesters and by opponents of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.  History  Kino pictured in 1988, with Tsoi second from the left Kino and their lead singer Viktor Tsoi had previously been part of the underground rock movement in Soviet Russia. In 1987, Tsoi starred in the official Soviet government film Assa. The film, which became a cult classic, promoted Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost and Perestroika political, social and economic reforms. In the film, Tsoi plays a rock musician who, when confronted by a zealous official reading out a list of rules he must abide by to make a live performance in a restaurant, ignores them and steps on stage to play \\"Khochu Peremen\\". The film became a symbol of the rapid changes made in Gorbachev's USSR and brought Kino a mass audience for the first time. Kino performed the song in June 1990 at in front of 62 000 people at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow during one of the band's first major gigs. Though it has since become an iconic song for political opposition and reform campaigns, Tsoi, who died in August 1990, said that the change which he described was personal change. The song has been described by The New European as having an \\"urgent drum-beat and sub-rockabilly riffs\\". Its lyrics (in Russian) include: \\"Our hearts need changes, our eyes need changes, into our laugh and our tears, and into our pulse and veins. Changes! We are waiting for change\\".  Impact  The song has been used during many Eastern European political campaigns and movements, despite Tsoi's original meaning. Its success is partly because the lyrics are vague enough to allow it to be applied to numerous causes. The song was played from speakers at barricade manned by civilians opposing the 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt by hard-line communists; it was also played at protests during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. It was sung in Moscow in 2011 by opponents of Putin, but also, separately, by his supporters. \\"Khochu Peremen\\" was sung at the 2011 Belarusian protests against President Alexander Lukashenko and at the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. The song has been used frequently during the 2020 Belarusian protests against Lukashenko, particularly at rallies for opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. On 6 August 2020 two sound engineers slipped the track into the line-up for a pro-government concert. Government officials pulled the power to the speakers mid-song and the engineers were arrested and imprisoned. Such is the influence of the song that Gorbachev later recalled being inspired by it when he assembled his new pro-reform politburo after coming to power following the death of Konstantin Chernenko in 1985. This cannot have occurred as Kino's first public performance of the song came in Summer 1986.

During the Spanish Civil War he commanded a militia column and later, during World War II he played an active role in the French Resistance.  Biography  He was born in Moneva on February 21, 1903, into a peasant family. He moved to Zaragoza and later to Barcelona, where he worked in construction. There he joined the National Confederation of Labor (CNT), and also learned to read and write. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera he went into exile in France, from where he returned after the amnesty that followed the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, in April 1931. In February 1936 he was part of the CNT Regional Committee of Aragon, and together with Florentino Galv√°n, he was in charge of organizing the farmers of Valderrobres. The Spanish Coup of July 1936 surprised him in Zaragoza, where he was secretary of propaganda of the Regional Committee. The following day he managed to flee from the capital to Tortosa, where he formed the Carod-Ferrer Column. In September they joined the South Ebro Column of Antonio Ortiz Ram√≠rez. He participated in the liberation of the towns of Alca√±iz, Caspe, Calanda, Alcorisa and Moneva, where he saved the priest Enrique Guallar, a childhood friend, from execution. At this time he collaborated with \\"Nuevo Arag√≥n\\", a body of the Regional Defense Council of Aragon. In 1937 he became political commissar of the 118th Mixed Brigade ‚Äî the old Carod-Ferrer column after its militarization ‚Äì and, later, of the 25th Division. The end of the civil war found him in the port of Alicante. He was arrested and interned in the Albatera concentration camp, from which he escaped in May 1939 with two other companions ‚Äì among them Victoriano Cast√°n Guill√©n, former commander of the 118th Mixed Brigade. He managed to move to France, where he was interned until the end of 1940. There he joined Francisco Ponz√°n's group, collaborating with the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation of France. In January 1941 he returned to Spain, where he acted as liaison between Manuel Amil Barci√°'s National Committee of the CNT and the General Secretary of the CNT Celedonio P√©rez Bernardo. On August 7, 1941 he was arrested in Barcelona when he was on a liaison mission between Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona, perhaps betrayed by the infiltrator Eliseo Melis D√≠az, whom he suspected of being a traitor. He was tried and sentenced to death in court martial in Madrid on October 11, 1949, but the declaration in his favor of Enrique Guallar (who had been exiled to √âpila by the fascist authorities) had his sentence commuted to 25 years in prison. He was imprisoned in the prisons of Figueres, being released in 1960. He settled in Barcelona, where he was arrested again in October 1961 and 1962. In 1965 he participated in the cincopuntismo movement. In February 1976 he participated in the Sants Congress, by which the CNT was reconstituted.

There are large sections devoted to the state's medical history, human rights, military history, education, industry and trade, travel, politics, religion, arts, and various other subjects. Notable documents in the archive include important documentation concerning eye-witness accounts of the Partition riots and the police reports on Gandhi's political meetings. The rare collection is held at the National Library of Scotland (NLS) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Only one other collection of similar size and content can be found in the UK, the India Office Records, which are held at the British Library in London. The India Papers are complemented further by more the substantial collections in India and in the United States.  History and acquisition  The India Papers consist of documents and other miscellaneous materials spanning from around 1858 to 1947. The collection comprises publications of the central imperial government and of various Indian states, many of which came under British rule. The National Library of Scotland acquired parts of the India Papers in different ways, though most materials were deposited under a scheme administered by the India Office. Some materials was published in the UK on the Indian government's behalf and so has been acquired under the terms of the Copyright Act, while all other papers were either donated or purchased. There are also composite volumes which were assembled by George Smith and Joseph Owen as well as some books that were acquired as part of the Minto Papers - a collection of papers related to the Elliot family whose 1st Earl, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, was Governor-General of India (1807 - 1813) and whose 4th Earl, of the same name, was Viceroy (1905 - 1910).  The Medical History of British India collection  The Medical History of British India collection exposes government practices, law and the operation of colonial power in British India in a medical context, with extensive information on colonial medicine accompanied by drawings, maps, graphs, illustrations and photographs. Most of the archive has been digitised by the NLS and so thousands of documents relating to disease, veterinary medicine, public health, and medical research are now available online to the general public. This digitised archive is divided up into six smaller series: Disease, Institutions, Drugs, Veterinary medicine, Mental health, and Vaccination.  Disease  The disease section of the collection is made up of 51 reports related to disease within India while it was under British rule. These reports are dated from 1868 to 1920. Included here are extensive reports on cholera, the bubonic plague, yellow fever, leprosy, and malaria.Scientific memoirs of the medical officers of the army of India  Institutions  There are 106 volumes in this series which has been further divided into three sections: Reports from medical colleges, schools, and research institutions; Army health reports and medical documents; and Lock hospitals. = Reports from medical colleges, schools and research institutions = There are 13 titles in the first section, including reports on vaccine production, disease outbreaks and public health, some with extensive tables and diagrams which demonstrate patient admission figures and mortality rates. These reports include documents from a wide range of institutions such as asylums, prisons, and police hospitals. = Army health reports and medical documents = The Army health reports make up 12 of the titles in this section, each describing the health and sanitary conditions of the army in India at the time. Lists of the health details of military personnel from Britain, Europe and India details are all kept here. Also included within this section are three volumes of army regulations, as well as 73 separate documents belonging to the Scientific Memoirs series, a medical journal by Indian medical staff. = Lock hospitals = Men treading ganja in Ahmednagar, 1893 This section is made up of five reports describing the treatment and control of venereal disease applied to soldiers and prostitutes from 1873 to 1891. There are tables in the reports which list instances of different venereal diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhoea, in patients. Of particular note in these reports are the comments made by staff appraising the lock hospital system, as well as various statements exposing imperial attitudes towards women and sex workers. In the context of the period, the government needed to maintain the health of British soldiers as effectively as possible, while also ensuring their basic needs were met. To meet these needs, they provided Indian women as prostitutes, most of whom were forced into it by poverty. to be as healthy as possible, while also ensuring men as healthy. They were seen as a commodity for the army, as valuable as blankets or food, and as such they were regularly checked for disease.  Drugs  The Drugs collection is made up of nine volumes, dating from 1867 to 1903. It contains reports detailing research on hemp and opium usage in British India, of particular note is the 1893 Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report, as well as information on the cultivation of cinchona trees and reports from the Nilgiris plantation. Research on chloroform anaesthesia can also be found here, as can details about its clinical trials and debates on the safety of the drug. left = Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report = The Hemp Drugs Commission was formed in 1893 following a question posed in the House of Commons regarding hemp production and its use in Bengal, India. The job of the commission was to conduct a thorough investigation into the use of hemp drugs and its effects on physical, mental and moral wellbeing, and is a compilation of the answers to 70 questions asked in 30 cities across India to over 2,000 missionaries, hemp cultivators, traders, medical staff, and military personnel. This report shows the relationship between cannabis users and the government, its questions being indicative of the governments consideration of prohibition and also of its consequences (ie. loss of tax income). A hemp drug shop in Kandesh, 1894, displaying bhang, ganja and majum The commission report had controversial findings. Many of those interviewed voiced that cannabis, indigenous to South Asia and deeply rooted in Indian culture and religion, was used for thousands of years prior for the host of nutritional and medicinal benefits that it provided. This, alongside experiments which showed that cannabis benefitted manual labourers on poor diets, meant that the commission eventually decided to control and restrict cannabis with adequate taxation, ensuring cultivators had to obtain licences and also making sure there was a limit on sales and legal possession. The NLS is in possession of the only copy which contains photographs: 16 sepia-toned pictures of the plant, cannabis users, and cannabis traders.  Veterinary medicine  This section contains 146 volumes dated from 1864 to 1959. It is split into three series: Veterinary diseases, Colleges and laboratories, and Civil Veterinary Departments. The reports consist of extensive medical research relating to trypanosomiasis and rinderpest, and on a more general scale reports showing how veterinary medicine combatted and controlled disease, maintained livestock, and helped to alleviate famine. Of particular note are books about elephant health and disease, as well as much information on husbandry and management of working elephants.  Mental health  The Mental health collection consists of reports which describe the lunatic asylums and mental hospitals in British India from 1867 to 1948. These reports are significant because they reveal institutional conditions, accounts of violence and disease, and also how people (both native and European) were treated. As well as this, the reports allow for analysis of asylum populations. There are tables, diagrams, and charts within these volumes, each showing changes in the classification of different mental illnesses throughout the period.  Vaccination  The Vaccination section of the archive is made up of 66 volumes dating from 1856 to 1933. The reports here reveal how vaccination against smallpox was implemented in British India. They reveal the shift from variolation, improved vaccination techniques, and the logistics of lymph supply, as well information on funding and staffing of hospitals and medical practices. They also explore how the local population viewed and resisted western vaccination.

The Artillery School, dissolved as an independent body on 30 September 2010, could trace its origins back to 1888, through numerous reorganization phases.  History  Training establishments related to artillery date back to the XVIII Century, when King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia established the Royal School of Artillery and Fortification. In 1821, it was merged with the existing Royal Military Academy and assumed the name of Application School of Artillery and Engineering.  Central School of Artillery Shooting: 1888-1915  The traditions of the School of Artillery draw their origins from the \\"Central School of Artillery Shooting\\" (Scuola Centrale di Tiro di Artiglieria), established on 1 July 1888 (Royal Decree No. 131 of 24 June 1888) in Nettuno. The School was established in order to give adequate impetus to the professional education of cadres and to give artillery training a unitary direction, supported by application standards corresponding to the performance of weapons. In 1894, at the Bracciano shooting range, the first training course on firing with fortress and siege artillery was held for Fortress Artillery Officers. Following the 1910 Spingardi Reform, on 9 August 1910, the Shool split, giving rise to two distinct Schools, the Central School of Field Artillery (including mountain artillery and horse artillery) which remained in Nettuno, and the Central Fortress Artillery School, which was established in Rome with a shooting range in Bracciano. During the First World War the two schools lost their didactic function. In Bracciano a Training Group was established for the preparation of personnel for the specialist units. In Nettuno a special \\"Experimental Section\\" was established at the Central School of Artillery with experimental and testing tasks in order to rapidly upgrade and modernize the artilleries. On the other hand, personnel training took place in the depots located behind the front. Among them, should be remembered that of Spilimbergo, which assumed the name of Shooting School.  Interwar period  In 1920, the two schools merged into the Central Artillery School in Bracciano, in the reorganization process which concentrated the combat schools in that area. In 1925 the Artillery Central School was transferred in Civitavecchia, directly under the Army General Staff. In 1921, the Experimental Section in Nettuno, which had been considerably strengthened during the conflict, became autonomous, first establishing itself in the Directorate of Artillery Experiences and, subsequently, in 1927, in the Artillery Experience Centre. Month-long courses were held mainly for Officers who were preparing to take up the posts of group or regimental commander. The courses were organized according to a tripartite scheme: * a first period, common, necessary to give a panoramic and general vision of the use of the units of the various branches according to the dictates of the current doctrine; * a second period, at the respective branch school, in which Officers deepened the study of the characteristics and technique of the weapon they belong to; * a third period, again in common, which ensured, through practical exercises and maneuvers with cadres, the acquisition of operational concepts concerning joint cooperation. The School did not have its own Units. For the exercises it had the regiments of the Division \\"Torino\\", also based in Civitavecchia, and permanently received in aggregation from other bodies the Groups or Batteries of the non-divisional artillery specialties. In 1927 the Artillery Shooting School, aimed to troops and enlisted personnel, was reestablished and reactivated in Nettuno. The Artillery Shooting School was directly under the Inspector of Artillery.  Second World War  During the Second World War the activity of the Shooting School of Neptune had a notable increase, above all to retrain the ranks of reservists called to arms who had to constitute or complete the Artillery units. In 1944 the Central School of Artillery was hit by the allied landing which destroyed the Artillery Experience Center. At the end of the war, the Experience Center remained in Nettuno and was strengthened, also incorporating the Infantry Experience Center of Santa Severa as the 5th Experience Section.  After Second World War: 1946-1990  After the Second World War, the reconstruction was not long in coming. On 27 January 1945, the 152nd Artillery Regiment \\"Piceno\\" moved to Bracciano assuming the following organic constitution: * Command; * School and Artillery Complements Group; * School and Engineer Complements Battalion; * Mixed complements battalion. On 10 April 1945, the 152nd Artillery Regiment \\"Piceno\\" was renamed \\"Artillery Training Regiment\\". On 15 January 1946 the Artillery Training Regiment was renamed Artillery School. Definitively returned to Bracciano, the School was unified into a single institute and placed under the Military Central Schools Command. In 1946 the School of Mechanics of Artillery Workers of Civitavecchia passed under the control of the School of Artillery of Bracciano, of which it became a detachment. Chief of Army Staff Luigi Efisio Marras in 1947 strengthened the Officers Schools: the Schools of Arms Cooperation (Scuola Cooperazione Varie Armi, S.CO.V.A.), grouping the Schools in Civitavecchia, was established in the same year. On 25 October, the Artillery School was granted the task of keeping the War Flag of the Arm of Artillery. In 1948, with the establishment of the 1st Battery of reserve officers cadets, the Artillery School also assumed the nature of a training institute for reserve cadres, while it lost the Anti-aircraft detachments of Bracciano, Sabaudia and Civitavecchia. In 1949 the XI Field Artillery Group was moved to the then-V Territorial Military Command in Padua. In 1951, the Artillery School gave birth to a new specialty with the establishment of a Artillery Light Aviation Unit, which was later renamed Army Light Aviation Unit; in 1958 the Army Light Aviation Unit was transferred to Viterbo, thus giving rise to the Army Aviation. In 1954, the Reserve Officers and Sub-officers School was established in Foligno, with the exception of the self-propelled speciality and the Artillery specialists who kept their headquarters in Bracciano, both under the VIII Territorial Military Command of Rome. In 1956 the artillery training sector was reorganized. The command of all the Artillery Schools was entrusted to a General, who was supported by: * a Colonel, Deputy Commander; * a Colonel, Course Director * a Colonel, commander of the Reserve Officers and Sub-officers School in Foligno. The Deputy Commander oversaw the entire logistical and administrative organization of the School and also performed the functions of Corps Commander in relation to the demonstration Units. The Colonel, Course Director, on the other hand, presided over the didactic organization, making use of the activities of some \\"units\\". In 1956, a \\"Technical Application Course\\" was launched for the training of Artillery Officers. In 1964, the School was again reorganized. The Commanding General, in turn dependent on the Inspector of the Arm of Artillery, had under its dependencies a Chief of Staff as coordinator of the activity, both disciplinary and logistic, of the whole school complex. The actual training part was carried out within four \\"Courses Units\\": * The first Courses Unit provided for the organization and development of the courses the Captains to be promoted. * The second Courses Unit provided for the development of courses for reserve officers snd Subofficers and for student team leaders of the missile and self-propelled specialties. * The third Courses Unit included all the operational units of the School as well as the Light Aircraft Section and some batteries for non-divisional specialties. In addition to the personnel training, it also provided units and means for the training for those attending the Courses, for carrying out demonstration, cooperation and experience exercises; moreover, it organized the Technical- Application Course and refresher courses for the personnel of all ranks recalled from leave. * The fourth Courses Unit, located in Civitavecchia, also included a demonstration specialist Battery and took care of the training at all levels of the personnel assigned to the specialist unit.  1975 Army reform  Coat of arms of the 1st Self-Propelled Field Artillery Group \\"Cacciatori delle Alpi\\". In January 1976 the Army established two Artillery Groups, operational and demonstrative pawns of the School: the 1st Self- Propelled Field Artillery Group \\"Cacciatori delle Alpi\\", formed from the 8th Army Corps Self-propelled Field Artillery Group, and the 18th Field Artillery Group \\"Gran Sasso\\" formed from the 1st Group of the 13th Artillery Regiment. On 2 May 1976 the 1st Group inherited the War Flag, the Red Tie and the Garibaldi traditions of the 1st Artillery Regiment. These two Artillery Groups were joined by the an A.U.C. Group, which took care of the training and training of the Reserve Officer Cadets and the Subfofficers of the self- propelled specialities, the Specialists Group and a Support Unit. In June 1981, with the dissolution of the School of Artillery Officers and Subfofficers in Foligno which took care of the training of the students of mechanical towing specialities, the 18th Group was suppressed and transformed into the Mechanical Towing A.U.C. Group, while the 1st Artillery Group lost the \\"Self-propelled\\" designation and became the demonstrative group of the School. All activities were thus concentrated in Bracciano. On 15 June 1986, the War Flag drape was replaced.  After the Cold War  Subsequent reorganizations led to the dissolution of the Specialists Group and of the Support Unit. The latter one was later reconstituted once the two A.U.C. Groups were merged into a single training institution. From 1 October 1997 to September 2009, the School Commander carried out the command activity on the Training and Experimentation Centre for the Anti-Aircraft Artillery of Sabaudia. The Commander also assumed the position of Deputy Inspector of the Arm of Artillery on the same date. On 12 November 1999, the 1st Artillery Group \\"Cacciatori delle Alpi\\" was disestablished and its flag returned to the Shrine of the Flags at the Altare della Patria in Rome. The Artillery School was reorganized into a Training Group and a Support Group. On 1 February 2006 a new organization was introduced. The General Staff was reorganised and the Training Regiment was established on 1 March 2006; at the same time, the Logistics Support Group and the Training Group were dissolved. The establishment of the Training Regiment was decided in order to optimize the performance of the institutional tasks of the School of Artillery and to develop the training activity. On 30 September 2010 the School was disestablished and merged into the present-day Artillery Command.  Artillery Command  The Artillery Command was established on 1 October 2010 in Bracciano on the basis of the Artillery School. The Artillery Command was the result of the merger of the Inspectorate of the Arm of Artillery, of the Artillery Brigade and of the Artillery School.

Elayi authored numerous archaeology and history works, and literary novels. She is well known to the French public through her novels and for her calls for reform and activism against the CNRS research policy bias. In 2007 Elayi was decorated Knight of the Legion of Honor by the French state.  Early life and education  Josette Elayi n√©e Escaich was born on 29 March 1943 in Les Bordes-sur-Lez, a small former commune in the Couserans (now Ari√®ge department) in France's Pyrenees mountains. She studied in the nearby town of Saint-Girons. At the Saint-Girons high school, Elayi had an affinity for science and literature but a skiing accident caused her to fall behind in science. Elayi recounts that \\"the literary course was much more rewarding than the sciences at the time\\". Elayi's parents wanted her to become a teacher, but after her baccalaureate, she went to Toulouse to study classical literature. Elayi is a holder of a Doctorat √®s Lettres, the highest doctoral degree in France, and multiple other degrees in oriental languages from Lyon and Nancy universities.  Work, research and academia  Elayi taught literature in Emilie de Rodat school in Toulouse between 1966 and 1968 before moving on to Notre-Dame school in Lyon where she taught for the next four years. In 1973, Elayi obtained a teaching position in the Lebanese University's faculty of letters in Beirut. Elayi's interest for the history of the Phoenicians was stirred during her short stay in Beirut. When the Lebanese civil war broke out in 1975, Elayi moved to Baghdad where she taught French literature at the Al-Mustansiriya University until 1978. Elayi settled in Paris in 1980, she taught in the Lyc√©e Charlemagne before joining the CNRS as a researcher in ancient history in 1982. Elayi is versed in fifteen modern and extinct languages. Elayi developed a multidisciplinary historiography method that combines epigraphy, numismatics, archaeology, economics and sociology; she applied this methodology in her works on the history of the Phoenicians. She writes regularly in journals and has received two prizes from the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and a prize from the French Numismatic Society ().  Phoenician and Near-Eastern history studies  In 1982, when she was recruited by the CNRS as a senior researcher, Elayi found that her field of research, the history of ancient Phoenicia, was not included in university curricula; it was confined to the Orientalism department which existed until 1991. Phoenician studies were then consigned to the department of Antiquity studies. The CNRS allowed Elayi full-time research and freedom to choose her subjects without teaching-hours constraints. In 1988 her relationship with the CNRS took a negative turn; faced with the lack of support of the committee, Elayi started her own research group, the Association for the research on Syria-Palestine in the Persian Period (ASPEP). ASPEP was embraced and supported by an international network of researchers and obtained public and private funding. Elayi also launched and directs a specialized international journal the Transeuphrat√®ne, and wrote a number of historical monographs about Phoenicia and the Ancient Near East. Elayi has also organized more than thirty international and regional meetings. Her scientific program is aimed to develop the little-explored field of Phoenician history using multidisciplinary tools. Her celebratedTr√©sors de monnaies ph√©niciennes et circulation mon√©taire (Ve-IVe si√®cles avant J.-C.) [Treasures of Phoenician coins and monetary circulation (5th-4th centuries B.C.)] showcases 75 Phoenician coin treasure troves among which 20 that were unpublished. The work highlights aspects of the economic and political history of Phoenician and ancient Near-Eastern cities in the 4th and 5th centuries BC; it delves into and adds new chronological data to the political and economic context of the first bronze coins production, circulation, control and production workshops. This research was followed up by her 2016 Phoenician Coinages, a body of knowledge completely dedicated to mainland Phoenicia numismatics under the Persian hegemony.Mainland Phoenicia is the area located around coastal modern Lebanon and parts of the Syrian littoral. Mainland cities included Sidon, Tyre, Byblos, and Arwad among others. The book summarizes 59 monographs and journal articles written following over 30 years of research by Elayi, her spouse Alain-G√©rard, and other contributing scholars; noting that Elayi and her spouse developed an original method for the metrological study of coins including distinguishing monetary standards or legal weight, from a manufactured standard.  Literary work  Elayi has written a number of novels that draw inspiration from her real life experiences and contemporary issues. In 2009, she published her first novel [The survivor] based on her experience of the civil war in Beirut. Two years later, Elayi wrote her second novel [Secrets of granite]; the book is inspired by her native Ari√®ge region. [The shadow of Saddam] came out in 2015; the geopolitical thriller portrays Saddam Hussein before his seizure of power. Her 2017 [Why I became a terrorist] came two years after the Paris terrorist attacks, it follows a Spanish student's descent into extremism. Elayi's 2018 novel [Arwad, a drifting Syrian island] draws parallels between the fall of the insular Phoenician city of Arwad and war-time Syria. In 2019 Elayi published Ange Garelli where the Corsican protagonist is haunted by the discovery of a secret linking him to Napoleon Bonaparte.  Personal life  Elayi is married to Alain-G√©rard Elayi, a Lebanese nuclear scientist; they have two children together.  Personal views and activism  Elayi who had had a rocky relationship with the CNRS launched an attack against what she described as the CNRS of corporatism, ambiguity, and bias under the guise of scientific democracy when evaluating French research. She accused the CNRS of making errors of judgment in the recruitment and promotion of researchers and scientific teams, leading to the deterioration of the quality of French research. This crisis was particularly marked after the 2002 and 2003 CNRS budget cuts causing worsening researcher working conditions and the decline of their financial resources. Elayi committed to system reform. She took on media outlets and issued two books where she elaborated her views on CNRS research dysfunctions and proposed a better distribution of credits based on a correct assessment of the competence of researchers. Elayi was consulted by successive research ministers in an effort to create the Agency for the Evaluation of Research and Higher education which saw the light in 2007. Elayi is a vocal proponent of saving classical languages which were threatened by prospected curriculum reforms spearheaded by then-Minister of National education and research Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. The reforms proposed to replace Latin and Greek by an \\"initiation to ancient languages\\" course within the French courses, and by an integration of these two languages within the French language courses. Elayi criticized the lack of a timetable, a program, funding or continuity and expressed indignation that teaching of classical languages would be left to non-specialized teachers and to the discretion of headmasters. Despite nation-wide polemic the bill was passed in August 2016.  Awards and distinctions  In 1995 the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres awarded Elayi with the Gregor Mendel prize for her work on coin economy and circulation in Phoenicia and the Ancient Near-East in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Six years later, the academy awarded Elayi and Hussein Sayegh with the Adolphe No√´l des Vergers prize for their research on the Phoenician port quarter of Beirut. In 2001 she received the Babut Prize from the French Numismatic Society for her research on ancient coins. In 2007 Elayi was decorated Knight of the Legion of Honor by then Minister of superior education Fran√ßois Goulard for her work on Phoenician history.

The first occurred as Philippine Army personnel were assisting in carrying out COVID-19 humanitarian efforts. The second, a suicide bombing, was carried out near the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral. Background For over three decades, the Abu Sayyaf has been launching terrorist attacks in support of making the province of Sulu independent from the Philippines, as part of the Moro conflict. Sulu is primarily Muslim, whereas the Philippines as a whole is primarily Christian. In 2004, the Abu Sayyaf launched the worst terrorist attack in Filipino history, bombing a ferry which killed 116 people. In 2016, they pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. They are known for using improvised explosive devices and for kidnapping foreigners for ransom, especially within Sulu province. In August 2020, some days prior to the bombing, the Philippine government arrested a number of militants belonging to the Abu Sayyaf organization. Security forces on Sulu were on high alert due to fears of retribution. Attacks On August 24, 2020, at 11:54 am, a motorcycle bomb placed next to a military truck detonated outside the Paradise Food Plaza in downtown Jolo, Sulu. The explosion killed six soldiers, six civilians and a police officer, as well as injuring 69 others. The police and military responded to the scene. An hour later, at 12:57 pm, a female suicide bomber approached the cordoned-off area and attempted to enter. Upon being stopped by a soldier, she detonated the bomb she carried, killing herself and the soldier who stopped her, while wounding six police officers. The second blast occurred approximately away from the first blast, in front of a branch of the Development Bank of the Philippines. In total, seven soldiers, one police officer, and six civilians were killed; and 21 soldiers, six police officers, and 48 civilians were wounded. The site of the bombing was close to the site of the 2019 Jolo Cathedral bombings. Aftermath The following day, the Islamic State ‚Äì East Asia Province (also known as Abu Sayyaf) claimed responsibility for the attack. The government believes that Abu Sayyaf bombmaker Mundi Sawadjaan created the bombs and armed the attackers. The entire municipality of Sulu was placed on lockdown following the blasts. On August 29, 2020, in Patikul, soldiers searching for the perpetrators of the bombings were attacked by fellow Abu Sayyaf militants. The gunfight resulted in the death of a Filipino soldier and the wounding of seven others; two Abu Sayyaf militants also died in the fight.Scout ranger, 2 ASG bandits killed in Patikul encounter June shootings On June 29, nearly two months before the bombings, four Army intelligence personnel, by-then investigating the possible presence of two female suicide bombers in Sulu province, were killed by Jolo police officers in a shooting incident, with policemen attempted to plant evidence to cover-up the incident. As the bombing happened in the midst of the investigation of the shooting, the military stated the incident have disrupted the intelligence operations that might have averted the bombings, and raised a possible motive that the police officers are connected with the suicide bombers. Reactions Immediately after the attacks, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque condemned the bombings saying \\"authorities are now conducting an investigation, which includes identifying individuals or groups behind these dastardly attacks.\\" Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles condemned the attacks in \\"the strongest possible terms\\" and said that terrorism has \\"no place in a civilized world\\". He also stated that he will bring justice to those behind the \\"inhuman attack\\". According to Dr. Rommel C. Banlaoi, a counter-terrorism expert and the Chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, the 2020 Jolo bombings were strong indications that suicide terrorism had become the new face of terror in the Philippines. Even prior to the 2020 Jolo bombings, Dr. Banlaoi has already explained, \\"The rise of suicide terrorism in the Philippines arises from the contagious effect of the ideology of violent extremism propagated by ISIS foreign terrorist fighters in the country. ISIS foreign terrorist fighters capitalize on local grievances, historical animosities, and feeling of injustices to propagate violent extremism in the Philippines, particularly in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao. Violent extremism is the ideology that justifies acts of terrorism in the Philippines.\\" See also * Civil conflict in the Philippines * International military intervention against ISIL * June‚ÄìJuly 2016 Sulu and Basilan clashes * List of Islamist terrorist attacks * List of terrorist incidents in 2020 * List of terrorist incidents linked to ISIL * List of wars and battles involving ISIL * Terrorism in the Philippines * War on terror References Category:21st-century mass murder in the Philippines Category:2020 murders in the Philippines Category:Abu Sayyaf attacks Category:August 2020 crimes in Asia Category:ISIL terrorist incidents in the Philippines Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2020 Category:Massacres in the Philippines Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 2020 Category:Terrorist incidents in the Philippines in the 2020s Category:History of Sulu Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in 2020 Category:Building bombings in the Philippines Category:Mass murder in 2020 Category:Suicide bombings in 2020 Category:Attacks on churches in Asia ","title":"2020 Jolo bombings"},{"id":"65062692","text":"The following lists events during 1992 in British Hong Kong.

Recruited in Deptford, South London, the units served with the 'Pals battalions' of the 39th Division on the Western Front for two years. They saw action at the Somme, Ypres, and the German Spring Offensive, including the Battle of the Avre, described as 'one of the finest artillery stories of the whole war'. The units then operated as an independent artillery formation during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive. Background On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army, and the newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised on 10 December 1914, many of the units were being organised as 'Pals battalions' under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country.See, for example, Middlebrook, Somme, pp. 9‚Äì11; Inglis, pp. 13‚Äì6. The 39th Division was one of the last K5 divisions to be formed, being authorised on 27 April 1915.Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I. Most of the division's infantry units were Pals battalions raised from London and South Coast of England, with a few from other parts of the UK, and all the Royal Artillery (RA) units were raised in Deptford, South East London.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 91‚Äì100. Recruitment The Metropolitan Borough of Deptford set up a recruiting committee in December 1914, and the Mayor, Councillor William Wayland, announced at a council meeting on 18 May 1915 that he had been approached by Kitchener with a proposal for recruiting an infantry battalion or artillery brigade, which the council endorsed. Next day the official War Office (WO) authorisation was issued to the Mayor and Borough of Deptford to raise a brigade of the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), to be numbered CLXXIV (174th). A recruiting office was set up in Deptford Town Hall and the local response was extremely good: 200 men had enlisted by 27 May. By August the borough had raised the whole artillery for an infantry division, including three more RFA brigades (CLXXIX (179th Bde), CLXXXIV (184th), and CLXXVII Howitzer (186th (H) Bde)), the 137th Heavy Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and the Divisional Ammunition Column (DAC), with a total of 2500 men recruited from Deptford, Lee Green, Brockley, New Cross and neighbouring Greenwich.Frederick, pp. 552‚Äì3.Frederick, pp. 699‚Äì701.WO Instructions September 1915, Appendix VII.Wiebekin, pp. 1‚Äì7.Wiebkin, Appendix A.Farndale, p. 133.Recruiting at Lewisham in the First World War.Wayland at Lewisham in the First World War.

Training Major E.R. Phillips was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel to take command of CLXXIV Bde and set up headquarters (HQ) at the disused works of the former Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackheath Road. The other units were organised in Deptford and Lee Green. There was a great shortage of equipment, but the mayor and corporation managed to obtain uniforms for CLXXIV Bde within two weeks of the town meeting. They also obtained over 2000 horses before 39th DA left the borough, with those of 137th Hvy Bty being stabled in the London County Council Tramways yard. Early training was carried out with dummy guns and ammunition waggons on Blackheath before the first two guns (18-pounders) arrived in August. Deptford held a farewell parade for 39th DA on Blackheath on 24 September 1915 and the units marched to Aldershot where 39th Division was assembling. It joined the division on 1 October when the Divisional Artillery HQ was formed under Brigadier-General C. Goulburn as Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA). The units continued training as guns and equipment arrived. In November they moved to Milford Camp near Godalming in Surrey, with much trouble on the march caused by inexperienced drivers and horse teams. The full establishment of 18-pdr guns and 4.5-inch howitzers was received and towards the end of January 1916 the brigades moved in turn to Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain for target practice before being pronounced fit for service. On 2 March 39th DA (except 137th Hvy Bty) began entraining at Milford on for Southampton where CLXXIV‚ÄìCLXXXVI Bdes and the DAC embarked for France on successive days, 4‚Äì8 March.Wiebekin, pp. 4, 7‚Äì10.

After disembarking at Le Havre the units moved by train and road to the concentration area at Blaringhem. Almost immediately the brigades were sent up to the line to be attached to experienced units for instruction: CLXXIV and CLXXIX on 9 March and CLXXXVI (H) on 12 March, all to Estaires with 8th Divisional Artillery; CLXXXIV on 12 March to Steenwerck to join 34th Divisional Artillery. The brigades attached to 8th DA returned to their waggon lines on 23 March while CLXXXIV returned on 24 March. Next day they moved to the St Venant area, where they completed their equipment. The brigades went up for a second period of instruction 2‚Äì3 April to 14 April, three with 33rd (Camberwell) Divisional Artillery in the La Bass√©e area often used to train new arrivals, and CLXXXIV with 38th (Welsh) DA. 39th Divisional Artillery was then deemed ready to take over its own section of the line, and it relieved 38th (W) DA in the Festubert‚ÄìGivenchy area between 14 and 16 April.Wiebekin, pp. 10‚Äì2. Macartney-Filgate, pp. 13‚Äì5. Reorganisation The field artillery of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was undergoing reorganisation in the light of experience so far in the war. On 21 March the division was ordered to form a brigade of three medium trench mortar batteries (TMBs) under a Divisional Trench Mortar Officer (DTMO). In 39th Division the men were provided by the RFA gun brigades and DAC; X/39, Y/39 and Z/39 Medium TMBs were each equipped with four 2-inch medium mortars.Farndale, Annex G. On 20 May the BACs were absorbed by the DAC and on the same day the field brigades were reorganised as three batteries of 18-pdrs and one of 4.5-inch howitzers: * CLXXIV Bde: B Bty became A/CLXXXVI, D Bty became B Bty, and A (H)/CLXXXVI joined as D (H) Bty * CLXXIX Bde: C Bty became C/CLXXXVI, D Bty became C Bty, and B (H)/CLXXXVI joined as D (H) Bty * CLXXXIV Bde: B Bty became B/CLXXXVI, D Bty became B Bty, and C (H)/CLXXXVI joined as D (H) Bty * CLXXXVI Bde: joined by B/CLXXIV, B/CLXXXIV and C/CLXXIX, and retained D (H) Bty.

From April to June the guns concentrated on registering the enemy's front line positions, machine guns posts and observation posts (OPs), shooting at enemy working parties, and firing in support of trench raids. On 29 June the guns began a preliminary bombardment and wire-cutting for an operation against a German position known as the Boar's Head. The small Battle of the Boar's Head on 30 June was a diversion from the 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme) that was due to begin next day. It was 39th Division's first attack, carried out by 116th Brigade comprising the three 'Southdowns' battalions of the Royal Sussex Regiment ('Lowther's Lambs'). The wirecutting was reported as very effective, and 39th DA began the final bombardment just before 03.00, the infantry going 'over the top' shortly afterwards. The guns then lengthened their range and put down an intense barrage. The divisional artillery fired over 20,000 rounds during the bombardment, but although the front line trench was reported to be full of German casualties when the British infantry entered, the second line was strongly held and the Southdowns were driven out of their gains with heavy casualties by the end of the day.Miles, 1916, Vol II, p. 544.Wiebekin, p. 13.'the Day Sussex Died' at First World War East Sussex.'Lowther's Lambs' at First World War East Sussex. During June 39th DA HQ moved to B√©thune and some of the batteries were moved around for special shoots, but in early August they were pulled out for rest before being sent south to join the Somme Offensive. A heavy TMB (V/39) equipped with 9.45-inch mortars was formed on 27 August, the personnel coming from Third Army School of Mortars. 39th Division went into the line between Beaumont-Hamel and the River Ancre on 28 August. On 3 September it made an attack to assist a larger attack on the other side of the river: 39th DA fired from 05.00 to 12.00, effectively cutting the wire and attracting considerable enemy counter-battery (CB) fire, though suffering few casualties. The division's infantry took the German front trench but most were unable to push on, being held up by machine gun fire from St Pierre Divion on the flank, and were withdrawn by the end of the day.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 279‚Äì82.Wiebekin, p. 14. Aerial photograph of Thiepval under bombardment. From 23 September 39th DA cooperated in the attack on Thiepval Ridge, firing from its flanking position on the Ancre against the river crossings and into the German rear. The assault on 26 September was partially successful, but the Germans retained possession of the Schwaben Redoubt. A follow-up attack on 28 September, again supported by 39th DA, captured part of this position, and attack and counter-attack fought over the ground until 30 September, the Germans suffering serious casualties from the British artillery. Meanwhile, the TMBs had been engaging targets in their immediate front, suffering their own casualties from return fire.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 393‚Äì4, 399‚Äì407, 417‚Äì22.Wiebekin, pp. 15‚Äì6. At the beginning of October the batteries were repositioned south of the river for the Battle of the Ancre Heights. The TMBs were strongly reinforced for a special wire-cutting operation in front of Beaumont-Hamel on 9‚Äì10 October, firing over 3000 rounds; 24 out of 48 mortars were put out of action by retaliatory fire, but casualties to the men were not heavy. The Capture of Schwaben Redoubt was completed by 39th Division on 14 October. This was a difficult operation for the artillery, most of the targets being invisible from the OPs and the weather preventing much air observation. Two enemy counter-attacks next day and another on 21 October were broken up by barrages from 39th DA in response to the infantry's SOS signals. The complete Capture of Stuff Redoubt was achieved in half an hour on 21 October: the wire had been systematically cut by a methodical bombardment, and 39th Division advanced behind an 'excellent' Creeping barrage. Observation was better here, and enemy troops massing for counter-attack were heavily shelled.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 448, 454, 460, 463. Further attacks on the Somme front were delayed by bad weather and the difficulty in bringing up ammunition ‚Äì pack horses had to be used in place of waggons ‚Äì but the final Battle of the Ancre was launched on 13 November. Artillery support was now massed and sophisticated creeping barrages employed. 39th Division carried out a carefully prepared attack on St Pierre Divion at 06.15. Fog in the river valley caused problems to the attackers, but also meant that some of the defenders were caught by surprise. Cut off by the barrage, they were in no condition to offer much resistance, and the village was reported secured at 08.32.Farndale, pp. 154‚Äì6.Inglis, p. 149.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 481‚Äì5.Wiebekin, pp. 16‚Äì7. Further reorganisation 39th Divisional Artillery was withdrawn on the night of 19 November and marched north to the Ypres Salient. The horses were so exhausted that they could not pull the ammunition waggons, which had to be unloaded. After two days' march the tired men and horses required two days' rest, and it was not until 28 November that they reached the back areas behind Ypres for rest and refitting. The BEF's field artillery was now being reorganised into six-gun batteries: in each of 39th DA's brigades C Bty was broken up between A and B Bty, then CLXXXIV Bde was broken up on 30 November, its batteries joining the other brigades (A Bty as C/CLXXIV, B Bty as C/CLXXXVI and D (H) Bty as C (H)/CLXXIX). The surplus officers and men joined the DAC.Wiebekin, pp. 17‚Äì9. On 9 December CLXXIX Bde relieved a Belgian army unit in the line, and the other two brigades and the TMBs moved into the line north of Ypres shorty afterwards. The duties included shooting at enemy strongpoints and reprisals for enemy shellfire, while the men worked to improve the gun positions and waggon lines.Wiebekin, p. 19. A Medium Trench Mortar Battery in action with 6-inch Newton mortars 1918. There was a further reorganisation of 39th DA between 18 and 30 January 1917 when CLXXIX Bde was broken up: C (H) Bty was split to make up the other brigades' D (H) Btys to six howitzers each. A/CLXXIX Battery joined CCLXXVII Brigade, RFA, a Lancashire Territorial Force unit operating as an Army Field Artillery (AFA) brigade; it saw extensive service on the Western Front, supporting a wide variety of formations at Ypres, Cambrai and the battles of 1918 (see below). Similarly, B/CLXXIX Bty joined CXIX AFA Bde. D (H) Battery was split between the howitzer batteries of these two AFA brigades. CLXXIX Brigade HQ was absorbed into 39th DAC, which reformed into two gun ammunition sections and one divisional small arms ammunition section. This gave 39th DA virtually its final organisation:Farndale, p. 198; Annexes D & M. * CLXXIV Bde: A, B, C Btys (each 6 x 18-pdr), D (H) Bty (6 x 4.5-inch) * CLXXXVI Bde: A, B, C Btys (each 6 x 18-pdr), D (H) Bty (6 x 4.5-inch) * 39th TM Bde: ** X/39, Y/39, Z/39 Medium TMBs (re-equipped with Newton 6-inch mortars in July 1917Wiebekin, p. 21.) ** V/39 Heavy TMB (9.45-inch mortars) Third Battle of Ypres On 20 February 39th DA was relieved and went into reserve until 1 March, when it took over the Zillebeke sector. There was little activity apart from artillery cooperation for trench raids while the DAC waggons were employed bring up material for the forthcoming Third Ypres Offensive. Between 10 April and 5 May the brigades, TMBs and DAC were rotated into reserve and training near the coast. The rest of May was employed in building battery positions for the coming offensive. In the first week of June 39th DA took part in two demonstration bombardments in cooperation with the Battle of Messines. From their OPs on the higher ground the Germans could see the preparations for the offensive, and carried out their own CB bombardments against the massed British guns, especially around Zillebeke. Late in June C/CLXXXVI Bty was heavily shelled and had to leave its position after two gun pits were set on fire and ammunition blown up. On 28 June CLXXXVI Bde's HQ was also driven out by heavy howitzer shells, and all the other batteries and DAC received 'more than the usual amount of attention from the enemy', losing many men and horses. CLXXXVI brigade HQ suffered another six-hour bombardment on 3 July, and the whole brigades was withdrawn. It was back in the line on 21 July as 39th Division prepared to take part in the new offensive.Wiebekin, pp. 20‚Äì1.Farndale, pp. 196‚Äì201. 18-pounder being hauled out of mud at Zillebeke, 1917. The offensive opened with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July. Two thirds of the field guns fired a creeping barrage, the other third and the 4.5-inch howitzers provided the protective standing barrage to allow the assaulting troops to reorganise at each objective. The trench mortars fired Thermite flares and oil bombs at Zero hour (03.00) to help the infantry keep direction in the dark. The attacking brigades of 39th Division took the village of St Julien and the strongpoints in their front. By 08.00 they had advanced about to achieve their objectives and were consolidating a position along the flooded Steenbeek to provide a defensive flank for the attackers. Several field batteries moved up to the old British line to give closer support, while the reserve brigade pushed beyond the Steenbeek. But it began to rain, and soon it was almost impossible for the exhausted gunners to get their guns forward through the devastation and mud, and further progress was halted that evening. Flanking fire and fierce German counter-attacks pushed the leading battalions back to the line of the Steenbeek. Here the Germans, wading through mud, were halted by the SOS barrage fired by the field artillery. Elsewhere the battle had been a disappointment to the British, and 39th Division was left holding onto the Steenbeek in mud and under constant shellfire until it was relieved on 5 August. The field batteries continued in action under terrible conditions, suffering from CB fire, while the DAC was bombed and shelled at night, and casualties were high. The next attack, the Battle of Langemarck, was launched on 16 August, with even less success than before.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 150-1, 159, 168, 171‚Äì4, 177, 185, 189‚Äì204.Farndale, pp. 201‚Äì4, Map 26.Lee, pp. 215‚Äì9.Wolff, pp. 159‚Äì63, 167‚Äì9. 39th Divisional Artillery was finally relieved on 23 August.Wiebekin, p. 22. 39th Divisional Artillery returned to the front on 1 September and was involved in all the fighting that month, even if the division's infantry were not. Although there were minor operations, the next offensive phase (the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge) was delayed by the weather and the need to build up ammunition. This time the weight of artillery was doubled and the frontage of attack narrowed. There were significant casualties among the massed field batteries from CB fire in the days preceding the attack, but practice barrages were fired, and numerous trench raids were supported by the guns. Field gun barrages were fired at night to isolate German gun positions and prevent them resupplying. Once again 39th Division's role was to form a defensive flank, this time in the southern sector around Shrewsbury Forest. The attack started at 05.40 on 20 September. The creeping barrage consisted of five belts, the rearmost ('A', nearest the attacking infantry) being fired by half the 18-pdrs, of which one-third of the batteries were 'superimposed' so that they could be redirected to fire at targets of opportunity without leaving a gap in the barrage. The 'B' barrage line ahead was provided by the 4.5s and the rest of the 18-pdrs. It was impressed on the infantry that they were to follow the barrage closely, and despite the muddy conditions the attack was a great success. The gunners were then able to break up German counter-attacks, despite their own exhaustion.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 205‚Äì8, Map 28.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 238‚Äì40, 268‚Äì70, 276.Lee, pp. 219‚Äì20.Wolff, pp. 187‚Äì94. The artillery began moving forward on the afternoon of 20 September to prepare for the next phase, the Battle of Polygon Wood on 26 September. The barrages planned were similar to those at the Menin Road, and practice barrages swept across the German positions every day. 39th Division's infantry sidestepped to relieve 41st Division and make a subsidiary attack to capture the 'Tower Hamlets' spur. However, it failed in this attempt, held up by a strongpoint known as 'The Quadrilateral'. The division's infantry were rested after this attack, but 39th DA remained in the line, supporting other formations during the Battles of Broodseinde (4 October) and Poelcappelle (9 October).Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 281‚Äì2, 287‚Äì8.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 208‚Äì89, Map 29.Lee, p. 220.Wolff, p. 199. 39th Divisional Artillery was withdrawn for rest in mid-October, missing the desperate Second Battle of Passchendaele in which the division's infantry played a minor part. While it was out of the line Brig-Gen Gilson, the CRA who had commanded 39th DA since it landed in France, was promoted to be CRA for X Corps. He was replaced by Brig-Gen G.A.S. Cape. 39th Divisional Artillery returned to the front between 4 and 18 November, and again from 22 November, participating in harassing fire against the enemy. Although the gun detachments had some cover from the weather and enemy fire in captured pillboxes, the battery positions were in mud-filled shell craters and guns could scarcely be moved, and the waggon lines were under periodic shelling.Becke, Pt 4, p. 193.Wiebekin, pp. 22‚Äì3. Winter 1917‚Äì18 During the winter of 1917‚Äì18 the commanders of both field gun brigades were replaced, with Lt-Col Lord Alfred Browne, younger son of the Marquess of Sligo, taking command of CLXXXVI Bde. During December this brigade provided No 2 Group of field artillery for 33rd (Camberwell) DA in the line. Meanwhile, the DAC and TMBs were engaged in salvaging ammunition and derelict guns from the battlefields.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 138‚Äì9. On 7 February 1918, Z/39 was split between X and Y Medium TMBs to bring them up to six 6-inch mortars each, and V/39 Heavy TMB was transferred to Corps. 39th Divisional Artillery had been relieved for rest on 22 December. When it returned to the forward area in January there had been heavy falls of snow, and the units could only move slowly along the roads into position. The guns were 'in action' for 8 January, and came under heavy German bombardment on 11 January: although casualties were low, several guns were damaged. The batteries were withdrawn again on 23 January and moved by rail to the southern part of the BEF's front, occupying the line in the Bray-sur-Somme area, while the brigades went by turns for training. The sector was relatively quiet, but Brig-Gen Cape was killed on 18 March while conducting a Staff ride as acting divisional commander, and Lt-Col E.W.S. Brooke of CLXXIV Bde took temporary command of 39th DA.Wiebekin, pp. 23‚Äì4. German Spring Offensive 18-pounder battery moving up during the Spring Offensive The opening bombardment of the German Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918 found 39th Division in reserve.Wiebekin, pp. 25‚Äì9. The units and formations in Fifth Army's Forward Zone were overwhelmed in the first hours and the reserves were sent up before the end of the day: 39th Division went to assist the hard- pressed 16th (Irish) Division, with 39th DA racing up to help.Blaxland, pp. 47‚Äì9.Edmonds, 1918, Vol I, p. 214.Farndale, p. 264. Next day the Germans continued to advance and at 08.15 16th (Irish) Division was ordered to retire, covered by the guns of 39th DA. At 09.00 CLXXIV Bde was also ordered to withdraw, but with the exception of D (H) Bty they were unable to get limbers up to the gun positions, and therefore remained in action until the infantry had withdrawn past them, firing at whatever targets they could see. Eventually, with the enemy working round both flanks and harassed with machine gun fire, the detachments withdrew, taking their breech blocks and sights, having to abandon 16 18-pdrs. Having withdrawn, D Bty brought its howitzers back into action and continued to fire on the advancing enemy troops. Two remaining 18-pdrs of C Bty had been in the workshops, and these were brought into action in a fresh position alongside guns and howitzers of another brigade. Meanwhile, CLXXXVI Bde's limbers had been closer, and the brigade was able to withdraw, having remained in action until the enemy infantry were within .Edmonds, 1918, Vol I, pp. 292‚Äì3. 39th and 16th Divisions fought on throughout 23 March as they retired towards the River Somme, the field brigades withdrawing to new positions from time to time as they covered the infantry, inflicting serious casualties on the Germans. One gun of C/CLXXXVI was destroyed by a shell, but five stray guns of another brigade attached themselves, and men from CLXXIV Bde helped to man the guns of a heavy battery supporting 39th Division. CCLXXXII Army Field Artillery Bde distinguished itself in support of 39th Division on 23 March, firing on the advancing Germans until the last moment before pulling out. 39th Division and the guns then crossed the Somme before the bridges were blown up.Blaxland, p. 64.Farndale, p. 268. For the next two days the British fought to defend the Somme Crossings. The 'batteries took full advantage of the many opportunities offered in engaging the advancing enemy with observed fire, and one section of A/186 did particularly good work over open sights'. The batteries fired an average of 3000 rounds each on 24 March, and continued firing during the night. The Germans were less visible on 25 March, but all possible crossing places were kept under constant fire overnight. However, the line of the Somme had been turned by the Germans and the retreat was resumed, with covering fire from the field guns. Some reorganisation was achieved: Brig-Gen W.G. Thompson took over as CRA, and the heavy battery returned to its group. The Germans made a major effort on 27 March (the Battle of Rosi√®res). 39th Divisional Artillery had XLVI Bde of 14th (Light) Division and a battery of CCLXXXII AFA Bde also under command, but could only assemble 53 guns. The artillery engaged the attackers with observed and barrage fire, but the right flank having been pushed back, CLXXXVI Bde had to retire again, after inflicting considerable losses to the enemy over open sights. Several successful local counter-attacks were made during the afternoon with artillery support. Next day 39th DA gave supporting fire to 'Carey's Force' ‚Äì the remnants of several shattered units and engineer companies collected by Brig-Gen G.G.S. Carey. At 21.00 both field brigades reported that the infantry were withdrawing through their battery lines, but they continued to inflict punishment on the attackers before withdrawing themselves. On 29 March Maj-Gen E. Feetham, commanding 39th Division was killed, and Brig-Gen Thompson took temporary command while Lt-Col Brooke resumed command of 39th DA.Farndale, p. 274.Blaxland, p. 89. 18-pounder battery in action in the open during the Spring Offensive. There was now a lull in the fighting. The badly depleted infantry of 39th Division were relieved and sent north to the Ypres area, but 39th DA remained in the line as an independent formation comprising both field brigades, the two TM batteries, the DAC, No 1 Horse Transport Company of the Divisional Train (284 Company, Army Service Corps) and an ammunition section of 39th Division Motor Transport Company (495 Company, ASC). These formed a sub-group under 16th (Irish) DA, along with CCLXXVII AFA Bde (including the former A/CLXXIX (Deptford) Bty), all supporting 14th (Light) Division. The Germans began a new phase of their offensive on 4 April (the Battle of the Avre), starting with a violent bombardment in the early hours. The initial bombardment fell behind the artillery, but the Germans shortened the range as the attack started and they began shelling the battery positions with high explosive (HE) and gas. Casualties were heavy and the signallers were constantly engaged in trying to repair broken telephone lines, but visual signalling was used once the mist cleared. The Germans broke through the front line, but the CRA of 14th (L) Division ordered the guns to stand firm and stop the waves of German infantry with artillery fire alone. Apart from B/CLXXXVI, which was driven behind the crest by the intensity of fire, the batteries were pushed forward boldly to the crests and remained in position until nightfall, bringing attacks to a standstill with their shrapnel fire. A forward section of C/CLXXIV Bty was overrun, but the two guns were recovered after dark. During this action 39th DA lost three officers, 70 other ranks and 110 horses.Blaxland, p.104.Farndale, pp. 276-8.Young, Annex Q. > This attack must and can be stopped by artillery fire. If any battery can no > longer effectively stop the enemy from its present position, it will at once > move fighting to a position on the crest, to engage the enemy over open > sights.

Harding-Newman, CRA 14th (Light) Division > Some say that the action of this day by the guns was one of the finest > artillery stories of the whole War ‚Äì Gen Sir MartinFarndale, RA historian 39th Divisional Artillery withdrew to new positions during the night, but the Germans did not resume their attack next day. Instead, both brigades moved forwards on 6 April to support an attack the following day by 9th Australian Brigade (the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux), in which the gunners caused considerable casualties and captured 150 prisoners. After the brief respite at Villers-Bretonneux, 39th DA came under renewed heavy bombardment on 8, 9 and 11 April, breaking up German attacks with observed fire. When the units were brought out of the line at dusk on 13 April ‚Äì claiming to be among the last who had fought on 21 March to be relieved ‚Äì they had lost 330 men of all ranks and 250 horses. During the retreat the DAC had dumped shells at likely points where the guns would need them (100,000 rounds between 21 March and 1 April alone), and its small arms ammunition (SAA) section had supplied any nearby infantry unit that needed replenishment. Summer 1918 39th Divisional Artillery moved to the Amiens area for refitting; it did not rejoin 39th Division, whose depleted infantry had formed a single composite brigade that was fighting in the Battle of the Lys further north. These infantry units were later reduced to training cadres for the US Army formations arriving in France and took no further part in the fighting. However, 39th DA remained active on the Western Front for the rest of the war, operating under the command of other formations. The batteries went back into the line on 1 May, and the TMBs carried out special demonstrations with mobile 6-inch mortars. On 15 May the two remaining TMBs were disbanded, apart from a special detachment with the mobile mortars, and the men were distributed to the two gun brigades and Third Army Reinforcement Camp. With no linked infantry to supply, the SAA section of the DAC was also disbanded. During June 39th DA rotated between spells in the line, exchanging harassing fire with the enemy opposite, and periods in reserve. On 3 July the units were transferred by rail to reserve positions behind Ypres, subsequently taking their turn in the line under various formations of Second Army. Hundred Days' Offensive Gunners wearing Small box respirators firing an 18-pounder, August 1918. On 22 August 39th DA began moving south by rail to join First Army in the Arras area and on 25 August it was placed under Canadian Corps for the Battle of the Scarpe. The guns were pre-positioned on 24/25 August, then the detachments moved up late on 25 August. The following day's assault was made at 03.00 behind an 'excellent' creeping barrage of 18-pdrs with the 4.5inch howitzers firing in front. The attack was successful, and the guns moved up in close support on 26 and 27 August. On 27 August Lt-Col Lord Alfred Browne commanding CLXXXVI Bde was killed in action. The Canadians advanced behind another creeping barrage on 28 August, and the guns continued to follow in support on 29 and 30 August, breaking up several counter-attacks. The forward movement continued in early September (the Battle of the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Switch Line), with most batteries providing a section ready to take on any fleeting target that presented itself.Blaxland, pp. 209‚Äì14.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 305‚Äì7, 327‚Äì9, 337‚Äì8, 364‚Äì5, 396‚Äì402.Wiebekin, pp. 30‚Äì1.Browne at CWGC record. After breaching the 'D‚ÄìQ Line', Canadian Corps advanced against weak opposition towards the Canal du Nord. This defensive position required a full-scale attack, which was carried out on 27 September. Both brigades of 39th DA supported the attack, the creeping barrage consisting of 50 per cent shrapnel, 40 per cent HE and 10 percent smoke shell; as well as screening the attackers the smoke blew towards the enemy and restricted his observation. The batteries advanced as the infantry progressed through their objectives and the Canadian engineers bridged the canal. The advance continued on 28 September with the field guns providing creeping barrages at short notice as required. On 1 October two brigades of 1st Canadian Division attacked a group of villages under a barrage fired by six field brigades including the two of 39th DA, but the enemy held the Abancourt Ridge beyond and the villages could not be secured.Blaxland, p.229.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 415‚Äì7.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 19‚Äì26, 54‚Äì5, 121-3, 153. On 9 October 39th DA bombarded the area around Cambrai as Canadian Corps made a demonstration in support of Third Army's attack (the Second Battle of Cambrai) and then advanced to the Sens√©e Canal against little opposition. First Army continued the pursuit towards the River Selle, where there was a pause on 19 October to prepare a set-piece attack.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 199, 210, 224‚Äì6, 254‚Äì5, 331‚Äì3. During the Battle of the Selle 39th DA was among the mass of guns supporting 51st (Highland) Division in its attack over the Ecaillon river towards the Schelde Canal. Zero hour was 06.10, and even though some of the infantry lost the barrage the attack went well: by 10.30 the engineers had two bridges over the Ecaillon for the field artillery to cross.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 381‚Äì3.Farndale, pp. 313‚Äì4. The brigades were withdrawn into reserve on 25 October, but on 30 October they moved into action again and next day fired in support of the Canadians' assault at Valenciennes. Supplies had to come up a single bad road, but sufficient ammunition was brought up and the attack on 1 November succeeded despite some stout resistance (the guns were forbidden to shell the town itself, in which French civilians were sheltering). The Canadians liberated Valenciennes on 3 November.Blaxland, p.254. Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 458‚Äì9.Farndale, p. 317. On 4 November 39th DA was transferred to VIII Corps and went into First Army Reserve, where it remained until the Armistice with Germany entered force on 11 November. Demobilisation began in 1919 and 39th DA and its constituent units were disbanded.

It was taken over by the military authorities on 17 January 1916. By the time 39th Division embarked for France, the policy was to remove heavy batteries from infantry divisions and concentrate them into heavy artillery groups (HAGs).Farndale, Annex E, pp. 355‚Äì8. 137th Heavy Bty, equipped with four 60-pounder guns, went out to the Western Front in April 1916, joined I ANZAC Corps Heavy Artillery on 27 April but transferred to III Corps HA the next day. It was assigned to 22nd HAG with Fourth Army on 3 May, then to 34th HAG with Second Army on 9 June, and therefore missed the Battle of the Somme. However, because Second Army held the Ypres Salient, low-level trench warfare was constant.'Allocation of Heavy Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/2.'Headquarters Heavy Artillery Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1. Vimy Ridge 137th (Deptford) Hvy Bty was made up to six guns on 9 November 1916 when it was joined by a section from 173rd Heavy Bty, formed at Woolwich on 8 May 1916, which had just landed in France. The battery was sent to 21st HAG with Fourth Army on 17 March 1917, but transferred to 15th HAG with First Army four days later. This HAG was assigned to I Corps and situated behind Aix-Noulette as a counter-battery (CB) group for the Battle of Vimy Ridge. First Army's commander, Gen Henry Horne, was himself a gunner and took a personal interest in the artillery preparation. The dedicated CB groups were provided with observation aircraft (the BE 2's of No 2 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps with I Corps), flash-spotters and sound- rangers, as well as their own Forward Observation Officers (FOOs). After the battle it was established that 86 per cent of the 212 active German batteries had been accurately located, despite bad weather and the new period of German air superiority (known to the RFC as Bloody April). The CB batteries began their systematic fire programmes on 20 March, 20 days before the attack (Z minus 20), beginning with destructive fire aimed at isolated German batteries, leaving the 'nests' of grouped batteries to be neutralised later by HE and gas shelling. From Z minus 10 the CB groups switched to more vigorous destruction of all known enemy batteries, telephone exchanges and observation posts. The huge weight of artillery, including 'some of the most accurate counter-battery fire of the war', together with the dash of the attacking troops ensured the success of the attack when it was launched on 9 April.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8.Falls, 1917, Vol I, pp. 306‚Äì7, 311‚Äì6.Farndale, pp. 158, 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Jones, Vol III, Appendix XII. After the initial success at Vimy, the Arras Offensive broke down into costly trench warfare. First Army was engaged in several actions though April and May 1917. 137th (Deptford) Hvy Bty transferred to 67th HAG on 14 May, but returned to 15th on 4 July as First Army improved its positions around Oppy Wood and Souchez. Later, while much of the BEF was engaged in the Third Ypres Offensive, I Corps and Canadian Corps fought the Battle of Hill 70 north of Lens. For this operation 15th HAG supported the Canadians with CB fire beginning in mid-July, although the attack was postponed until 15 August, by which time only 63 of the 102 identified German batteries were still active. The assault was successful, but several counter-attacks had to be beaten back, and fighting went on until 25 August.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 112‚Äì4, 219‚Äì30. Passchendaele The Canadian Corps was due to be moved north to join Second Army in the Ypres offensive and on 6 October the battery was transferred to 2nd Canadian HAG. The Corps went into the line between 14 and 21 October for the Second Battle of Passchendaele.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82‚Äì7.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, p. 338. Second Army's autumn attacks at the Menin Road, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde (see above) had been highly successful because of the weight of artillery brought to bear on German positions. But as the offensive continued into the winter the tables were turned: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and were subjected to CB fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.Farndale, pp. 211‚Äì13.Wolff, pp. 249‚Äì56. The Canadians attacked on 26 October with ground conditions that became increasingly bad as rain fell; they made no more than , the other attacking troops even less.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 349‚Äì51.Wolff, pp. 257‚Äì8. The battery transferred to 42nd HAG with the neighbouring Fifth Army on 30 October for the second phase of the battle, but little more was achieved before the fighting ended on 10 November.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 117‚Äì8. On 19 December 137th Hvy Bty battery was ordered to 51st HAG, which it joined on 15 December, remaining with it for the rest of the war. This HAG was with Fourth Amy (which was taking over the Ypres sector from Second Army HQ). Spring Offensive 60-pounders deployed in the open during the German Spring Offensive. The HAG became permanent RGA brigades on 1 February 1918, with 51st being designated a 'Mixed' brigade consisting of two batteries of 60-pdrs (137th (Deptford) and 138th (Hampstead)) and four heavy howitzer batteries of various calibres. 51st Brigade moved back to Fifth Army in March.Farndale, Annex M. 137th Hvy Bty was supporting III Corps when the German Spring Offensive fell on it on 21 March. Here the British line was at its thinnest and the fog at its thickest. The battery's FOO, Lt L.P.G. Bremner, remained in his OP near Urvillers, just south of St Quentin, despite his telephone line being cut by enemy shellfire. After the British Forward Zone had been overrun, the German barrage began to advance again about 10.30. Bremner watched small balloons flying above the mist, marking the positions of the advancing German infantry, until they got within of his OP, when he destroyed his papers and made his way back. Meanwhile 138th Hvy Bty also lost communication with its OP in Fort Vendeuil and fired its 60 pdrs blind until the mist cleared about midday, when it could engage the captured strongpoint.Edmonds, 1918, Vol II, p. 388.Farndale, pp. 262‚Äì3.Middlebrook, Kaiser's Battle, pp. 224‚Äì5.Murland, pp. 46‚Äì7. A number of RGA units were either caught in the fighting or forced to abandon their guns as the Germans advanced rapidly. Others struggled to get their guns back during the 'Great Retreat'Farndale, Western Front, pp. 264‚Äì79. Fourth Army HQ took over all of Fifth Army's formations and units on 2 April, and the first phase of the German offensive was halted on 4 April. Further attacks came on other parts of the front, but none broke through completely. 51st Bde formally came under Fourth Army again on 1 May and stayed with it until the end of the war.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 102‚Äì5. Hundred Days Fourth Army launched the Allied Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August with the Battle of Amiens. The battered divisions of III Corps only had modest objectives, but despite excellent artillery support and CB fire they still made little progress, so on 10 August part of its front including 51st Bde was transferred to Australian Corps.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 74‚Äì83, 121. During August and September Fourth Army continued advancing, with a series of successful attacks at Albert, Bapaume, √âpehy, and the St Quentin Canal, all with massive artillery support. By mid-October the front had reverted to a war of movement, with a great deal of forest fighting in which the 60-pdrs were used to 'search' roads, tracks and clearings in the woods.Farndale, pp. 301‚Äì11, 318. For the Battle of the Selle on 23 October, 51st Bde and its batteries were part of the huge artillery support for IX Corps. However, bad weather had prevented much air observation in the days leading up to the battle, and few of the enemy gun batteries had been located, so CB fire was hindered. Nevertheless, the attacking divisions had made good progress by the end of the day. Once the Selle and the Sambre had been crossed and the BEF began pursuing the enemy, the heavy artillery played a smaller part, its guns and ammunition generally left behind until roads and bridges could be repaired.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 354‚Äì7.Farndale, pp. 311‚Äì3. Postwar, 137th (Deptford) Heavy Bty was due to become B Bty in a consolidated 62nd Bde RGA, but this order was rescinded after the Treaty of Versailles and the battery was disbanded. Memorials A parish Roll of Honour on oak boards was installed in St Luke's Church, Deptford, in October 1917, when it was unveiled by Mayor William Wayland.IWM WMR ref 73090. A large wooden memorial board was placed in Deptford Town Hall in March 1921; the first panel was in memory of the men from Deptford who died in World War I, the second panel read: 'This panel commemorates the raising of the 174th, 179th, 184th, and 186th Brigades of the Royal Field Artillery, the 137th Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and the 39th Divisional Ammunition Column, a total of 4700 men, by the Mayor, Sir William Wayland, for service in the Great War'.IWM WMR ref 86892.

On the other hand, the Eldey Volcanic System, which is for the most part submarine, is today mostly seen as independent from Reykjanes Volcanic System.See eg. Icelandic Met Office. Official Website. It is part of Reykjanes Ridge. Lighthouse Reykjanesviti In 1878, the first Icelandic lighthouse was erected near Valahn√∫kur. It had become necessary as the most used shipping lane next to Iceland passed by this point and the sea can be dangerous here. The 14 km broad strait between the peninsula and the island of Eldey is often used by ships and at the same time heavy currents accompany the tides in both directions so that the area had a bad reputationBjarnhei√∞ur Hallsd√≥ttir, T√≥mas Gu√∞mundsson: Fer√∞ahandb√≥k Fj√∂lskyldunnar.

The film stars M√©li√®s as the comic foil of two rogues who break into his house and evade his attempts to capture them. Plot Two vagrants break through a window into an opulently furnished house. They hide in a closet just as the owner of the house, a bearded gentleman, enters. The owner, astonished by the mess the vagrants have made, berates his housemaid. A glazier comes in to fix the window. As the glazier works, the vagrants escape into the bathroom. Hearing a noise, they jump into the empty bathtub and hide under the tub's wooden cover. The noise is the owner, coming in to take a bath; he lights a match to the hot water heater, and gets a jet of hot water pouring into the tub. The vagrants, taken by surprise, start to jump involuntarily, and the owner realizes they are there. He tries to contain them by sitting on the cover, but they wrangle free, and the owner lands in the bathwater. The owner jumps out of the bathtub and runs in pursuit of the escaping vagrants, who again escape to the closet. The owner crashes into the glazier with a shatter of glass, fires off a rifle that hits his housemaid, and finally ends up in the closet, which topples over. Production and themes M√©li√®s plays the owner of the house. Unlike his more famous fantasy films, Rogues' Tricks is purely a broad comedy; beyond some basic pyrotechnics, the only special effects are two substitution splices used for editing purposes. The film is a rare example of M√©li√®s playing a character who is not in control of a situation, and who ends up foiled; another such example is his film The Eclipse, or the Courtship of the Sun and Moon, made later the same year. A M√©li√®s guide published by the Centre national de la cin√©matographie comments on this phenomenon: \\"When he plays the role of the Devil, he wins. When he represents Authority (here the owner, in The Eclipse the professor) he loses.\\" Release The film was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 909‚Äì911 in its catalogues. It was sold as Rogues' Tricks in the United States, and as The Burglar's Bath in the United Kingdom; Rogues' Tricks is the title used on the title card in a surviving print of the film.

While serving at the Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow in 1846, White touched a sergeant with a metal bar during an argument while drunk. A court- martial sentenced him to 150 lashes with a cat of nine tails. The flogging was carried out on 15 June with White tied to a ladder in front of the regiment. White was afterwards admitted to hospital where he initially progressed well but eventually deteriorated and died on 11 July. Am army autopsy recorded that White's death was by natural causes, resulting from an inflammation of the pleura and cardiac covering, and his body was sent for a church burial. The vicar, however, had learnt of the flogging and alerted the Middlesex coroner Thomas Wakley. Wakley, an opponent of flogging, ordered an inquest and arranged for two further autopsies to be performed. The last of these, carried out by Erasmus Wilson, reported that White's death was a direct result from the flogging. The inquest jury, on 4 August, returned the verdict that White's case was a result of the flogging and called for its use to be discontinued The case resulted in publicity for the cause of abolition, though some medical professionals disputed the inquest findings. Within days the commander-in- chief of the British Army, the Duke of Wellington, ordered that flogging sentences were not exceed fifty lashes. The prime minister Lord John Russell noted in the House of Commons that he supported the eventual abolition of the punishment. Despite this flogging remained available to the army until 1881 when corporal punishment was abolished as part of the Childers Reforms.  Background  A private of the 7th Hussars 1842 Flagellation, referred to as flogging in the British military, was a form of corporal punishment inflicted by means of whipping the back of the prisoner. Flogging was authorised in the British Army by the Mutiny Act 1689 and by the 18th century was in common use, with sentences of up to 1,000 lashes not being unusual. In higher sentences the punishment was carried out in stages with the victim being given periods of rest in between to allow the skin to heal. Deaths from floggings were not unknown, though were more common in foreign postings, such as to British India, than on home service. When deaths occurred the cause was usually attributed to fever or disease rather than from the punishment.  Incident and punishment  A naval flogging with a ladder and cat of nine tails Frederick John White was a soldier in the 7th (The Queen's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars) (commonly known as the 7th Hussars), born in January 1819 and originating from Nottingham. He had previously been punished for infractions by means of punishment drills and, prior to his 1846 sentence, had only spent one period in hospital, after being kicked by a horse. When he was with the regiment at the Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow in 1846 White had, whilst drunk, argued with his sergeant and touched him on this chest with a metal bar. He was placed under arrest and brought before a district court- martial 4‚Äì5 days later. The court sentenced him to 150 lashes with a cat of nine tails, made from nine knotted leather thongs, the maximum number of lashes the court was permitted to sentence. This was probably the first time White had been flogged. In the 7th Hussars corporal punishment was administered by the regimental farriers, men experienced in this role on campaign, who were instructed to strike as hard as they could or risk punishment themselves. One private, with experience in other regiments, recounted that the 7th Hussars flogged more harshly than other units where trumpeters, who were often boys, administered the punishment. Colonel Whyte The flogging was carried out on 15 June 1846, in front of 200‚Äì300 men of the regiment which was formed in a 3-sided square in the riding school. After being read the decision of the court-martial White was stripped to the waist and tied by his arms and legs with cord to a ladder which was nailed to the wall at the open side of the square. At around 9 am the regiment's commander, Lieutenant-Colonel John Hames Whyte, gave the order to commence the punishment. The regimental adjutant Lieutenant Ireland then gave the order to Farrier-Major Critton. Critton made the first strokes with the cat, alternating with Farrier Evans after each 25 or 50 lashes (the sources vary) to rest their arms. Sergeant Patman counted out the strokes, which were made at the rate of one every twelve seconds. White's shoulders began bleeding after the first 20 strokes but he did not cry out in pain at any time during the punishment. The cat was swapped for a fresh one after 100 lashes at which point White asked the farriers to strike \\"lower, lower\\" upon which they adjusted their aim. This request may have been so that the lash fell upon skin already damaged by flogging, and so numbed to the pain, rather than the skin on the back of his neck. Colonel Whyte and the regimental surgeon Dr James Law Warren were present throughout. Warren did not intervene to check on White at any point during the punishment. At one point White asked for a drink of water, which was given. At least one corporal and one private fainted while witnessing the punishment, though one witness at the coroner's court recounted that six men fainted. By the end of the punishment White had suffered significant blood loss, which soaked his trousers; this occurred despite regulations stating that flogging was not intended to break the skin. His shirt, doused in water, was placed over his back and he was covered with his overcoat and taken to the barracks hospital. Whyte announced to the regiment that he was sorry such a \\"brutish exhibition\\" as White's offence should be committed in the regiment and he was determined to stop such conduct.  Treatment and death  White whistled on his entry into the hospital, where the blood was sponged from his still-bleeding back by an orderly and another patient. White was not seen by a doctor for another 90 minutes when Warren, accompanied by Whyte, visited. Neither officer spoke with White or examined his back. Warren returned at 10pm to examine White's back which was wounded in an area around in height and in width between his shoulder blades. White's pulse was not taken on the first day. White's back was washed with lukewarm water and treated with a cetaceous ointment and basic lead acetate. Warren placed him on a restricted diet of of potatoes and of bread per day until 9 July when he was placed on a \\"half diet\\" of of bread, of meat, of soup and of tea. White could not eat his full allowance after 5 July, eating, for example, just one potato on 6 July. During his time in hospital White complained that he had not been in a fit state to be flogged owing to an existing chest complaint. The skin on White's back healed quickly though from early July his condition deteriorated. White complained of pain in his right side and by 6 July was bed-ridden. On 9 July White's back and chest, which had broken out in boils, was treated with a mustard plaster. On 11 July White lost sensation in his extremities and had difficulty passing urine. His back was inflamed and his skin was cold and moist. First Class Staff Surgeon John Hall was called to attend White on the order of Sir James McGrigor. He attended but found it was too late to intervene and White died in his presence at 8.30pm.  Autopsies  Thomas Wakley Warren carried out an autopsy on White assisted by Hall and Dr Francis Reid. He concluded that death was caused by inflammation of the pleura and cardiac covering, which he recorded on the death certificate. Hall sent a separate report on the death to the Army Medical Department, noting that White's back was well healed. White's body was sent for burial and the vicar was told he had died of a liver complaint. However the reverend became suspicious when he heard that White had been flogged and reported the death to the Middlesex coroner Thomas Wakley. Wakley was a reformer, founder of The Lancet medical journal, and opponent of flogging. Erasmus Wilson in later life Wakley reviewed White's case, considered that the army's autopsy had been too cursory and ordered an inquest be held. He sent for surgeon and sanitary reformer Dr. Horatio Grosvenor Day to carry out a second autopsy. When Day reported Wakley claimed that a misunderstanding had meant that White's spine had not been examined. This allowed him to order a third autopsy which was carried out by renowned dermatologist Erasmus Wilson. Such an in depth investigation was highly unusual at this time for the death of a mere army private. Wilson reported that the inflammation caused by the flogging penetrated the full depth of the skin. He found the spinal area had a \\"pulpy softening of the muscles\\", which he ascribed to the contraction of the muscles during the flogging. This softening may, however, have arisen as a result of bacterial infection of the blood, which was not yet known to science. Wilson found that White's internal organs were inflamed, he described this as a direct result of the flogging and a contributory factor to White's death. He thought that the skin, which was well healed, disguised the internal issues. Wilson also reported White had suffered \\"shock\\" to his nervous system, inflammation of the left lung and boils on his back. Day dissented with Wilson's findings on the grounds that he did not consider that the pleura could be affected by the muscles.  Inquest  Wakley's inquest first met on 15 July from 8pm in the parlour of the George IV Inn on Hounslow Heath. Thirteen jurors were sworn in and the inquest attended by officers of the regiment and members of the public. The jury visited the barracks to view White's body whereupon Wakley discovered that part of the skin from White's back, measuring some , was missing having been removed during Warren's autopsy. Wakley discovered that the army had made no effort to contact White's next of kin and ajourned the inquest at 10pm to allow time for family members to be found, for Day's autopsy to be carried out and for Reid and Hall to be called to testify. The inquest met again on 20 July at the same Inn at 9.30am. A large number of the public attended, including five magistrates. A solicitor, Mr G Clark, attended to represent the 7th Hussars. Clark insisted that the regiment's adjutant, Ireland, be present throughout the inquest as he was his instructing party. The jury protested that Ireland might intimidate the soldiers called to testify but Wakley permitted him to remain. White's brother had been located and attended as his next of kin. After finding the issue with Day's autopsy not having investigated White's spine Wakley adjourned the second day at 3.45pm. The inquest reconvened from 9.30am on 27 July, after Wilson had completed his autopsy. In the course of questioning by Wakley, Warren stated that he had seen White on the day of the punishment and found him fit to receive it. He denied making a statement, reported by a witness in the hospital, that White had died from the effects of the flogging. He stated that he found adhesions on White's heart during his autopsy and that apart from inflammation of the heart and blood vessels White was healthy. Day and Reid stated that the hot weather of the Summer of 1846 may have contributed to White's death. The jury reported back on the fourth and final day of the inquest, 4 August, that they considered White's death to have been caused by the flogging. The question of culpability was legally difficult as wounding at the time was defined as breaking of the skin and White's skin was healed by the time of his death. In their findings the jury called for the public to send petitions to parliament to seek the abolition of flogging.  Impact  The Duke of Wellington in 1844 The outcome of the inquest led to arguments in the medical press over the cause of death. An unsigned article in the London Medical Gazette disputed the jury's findings and claimed that White had died because he was an alcoholic, though the author also thought that fifty lashes would have been a sufficient punishment. George Ballingall, Professor of military surgery at the University of Edinburgh, wrote in the Monthly Journal of Medical Science disputing Wakley and Wilson's impartiality and the quality of the evidence provided by Wilson. Wilson wrote a series of papers in the Lancet in which he claimed that much of the medical profession did not appreciate that the skin was an important organ capable of affecting the rest of the body. The case led to the foundation of the Flogging Abolition Society, chaired by Wakley, who first met in 1846. A ballad named The Flogging Excitement at Hounslow, that argued the cause for abolition, was popular around the time of the inquest. Its last lines were: Tied up hands and feet to a ladder, While the sound of the cat reached afar, Oh, Britain thy deeds make me shudder, Remember poor White, the Hussar Shortly after the inquest reported the commander-in-chief of the British Army, the Duke of Wellington, ordered that the maximum number of lashes be reduced to fifty. On 7 August the prime minister, Lord John Russell, was questioned in parliament over the continued use of flogging in the army. He stated that Wellington had ordered that all soldiers sentenced to be flogged be examined by medical professionals to check they were fit to be so punished and that the weather conditions at the time be taken account of. Russell stated that he looked forward to the time when flogging could be abolished in the army but that he and Wellington considered it necessary for the immediate future. He stated that his government had constructed numerous prisons for use by the army as an alternative to corporal punishment and that the proportion of men flogged each year had fallen from 1:108 in 1838 to 1:189 in 1845. He noted that the introduction of good conduct payments, pay rises in recognition of long service, the awarding of commissions to those in the ranks and the establishment of libraries, savings banks and gardens had promoted good discipline in the army. The use of flogging in the army was restricted in 1859 so that, in peacetime, only those men considered of \\"bad character\\" could be flogged; the sentence remained freely available to court-martials held in wartime. The 1868 Cardwell Reforms further restricted the peacetime use to cases of mutiny and \\"aggravated insubordination and disgraceful conduct\\". It remained available in times of war for these two offences plus desertion, drunkenness while on duty or line of march, misbehaviour and neglect of duty. Flogging sentences were restricted to 25 lashes in 1879, by which time the punishment was little used. The use of all corporal punishment in the army was abolished as part of the 1881 Childers Reforms.

It roughly corresponded in area to the present Haut-Katanga Province. Belgian Congo The original four provinces of the Belgian Congo had considerable autonomy, but in 1933 they were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. Katanga became Elisabethville Province. The number of districts in the colony was reduced to 15. Elisabethville Province was divided into Lualaba District in the west, and Tanganika and Haut-Katanga in the east. By 1954 the number of districts in Katanga had been expanded to include the districts of Elisabethville, Tanganika, a smaller Lualaba, Haut-Lomami and Luapula-Moero. Luapula-Moero District had replaced the smaller Haut-Katanga District, expanded by the addition of territory taken from the east of Lualaba District. A 1955‚Äì1957 map shows Luapula-Moero District bordering Tanganika District to the north, British territories to the east and south, Lualaba District to the west and Haut-Lomami District to the northwest. It covered an area of out of for Katanga as a whole. Post-independence On 11 July 1960, a few days after the Congo Republic had gained independence, the province of Katanga seceded as an independent state. In November 1961 the northern portion was reconquered by the national government and made the province of Nord-Katanga. On 21 January 1963 the remainder of Katanga was reconquered and divided into the provinces of Lualaba and Katanga Oriental. Nord-Katanga, Lualaba and Katanga Oriental were merged back into the province of Katanga on 28 December 1966. In 2015 Haut-Katanga was formed from the Haut-Katanga district and the independently administered cities of Likasi and Lubumbashi. Lubumbashi retained its status as a provincial capital.

The area was first occupied during the end of the Neolithic (4th millennium BCE) and throughout the Chalcolithic, being abandoned somewhere between the end of the 4th and the beginning of the 3rd millennium BCE. The Castro was first dug and reported in 1878 by Carlos Ribeiro, who presented his results to the Lisbon Academy of Sciences in what may be considered the first monograph dedicated to a pre-historical Portuguese settlement. The last interventions date to 2003. The site is classified as a public interest monument (Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico) since 1963.  History  The area experienced four main occupation phases:  First phase (upper Neolithic)  During the first phase (upper Neolithic) more specifically between the end of 4th millennium BCE and beginning of the 3rd millennium BCE, circular houses were built without any extra defensive constructions. Since the beginning of its occupation, the inhabitants of the Castro are thought to have been strongly sedentary. Of all the ungulate remains found, swine (used for meat) were the most frequent, followed by bovine (meat, milk and as draft animals) and caprine species (meat, milk, and wool), with sheep being particularly frequent in this latter group. Given the frequency of each type of animal and each animals' meat yield, researchers think the main contributors of protein for the Neolithic inhabitants of Leceia were bovine, with hare and deer as a vestigial part of their diet.  Second phase (lower Chalcolithic)  During the second phase (lower Chalcolithic), thee lines of walls made of blocks of local limestone were rapidly built, covering a total of 11,000 squared meters. This construction was done between 2900 and 2800 BCE, after a short abandonment of the area between the first and second phases, which probably did not exceed a few dozens of years. These walls had three entrances, protected by towards. During this phase, the caprine species become predominant due to a greater focus on secondary (i.e., non-meat) products such as wool and milk. The caprine species were then followed by swine and bovine species in terms of frequency. The main source of protein, in this phase, switches from bovine to swine species. The Equus genus is present in this phase, but in a reduced frequency and undomesticated. Hare and deer remain as a vestigial part of the population's diet. There are also multiple ceramic findings from this phase, belonging to a specific style typical of the Estremadurean lower Chalcolithic.  Third phase (middle Chalcolithic)  In a third phase the defensive structures are reinforced and the entrances are made narrower. During this period, the caprine species remain predominant and increase in frequency, being accompanied by the emergence of cheese molds and the increase in weaving-related ceramics. The conclusions regarding the remaining species are similar to the previous phase. A significant shift is observed in the ceramics, with the Estremadurean lower Chalcolithic style become vestigial and being replaced by the Estremadurean middle Chalcolithic style. It is also in this phase that the use of copper metallurgy becomes widespread and researchers consider this to be the height of the Castro's economic activity.  Fourth phase (upper Chalcolithic)  In the fourth phase the defensive structures are again reinforced and new, ellipsoidal houses are built, increasing the density of the constructions within the walls. Bell beakers have been found in two of these ellipsoidal houses.  Decline  At the end of the Chalcolithic (around 4th and the beginning of the 3rd millennium BCE), the Castro is abandoned. Some structures are dismantled or destroyed, but some construction is still done in this phase, with houses being built onto the defensive walls.  Findings  There were many archeological findings in the Castro, for example: * Tools such as axes, millstones, adzes, loom weights, copper fish hooks. * Objects made of bone, such as beads and pins. * Ceramics, namely bell beakers with acacia leaf decorations. * Metal works, such as copper ingots and a copper axe. Many of the findings are displayed in the Museu Nacional de Arqueologia and the Geological Museum of the Laborat√≥rio Nacional de Energia e Geologia.

He is most notable for winning the 1910 Melbourne Cup and becoming the first Northern-Hemisphere bred horse to do so. Background Comedy King was owned by Sol Green, one of Australia's biggest bookmakers and one of the country's richest men. On a trip to England in 1906 Green bought some racehorses and among them was the broodmare Tragedy Queen, which was in foal to the 1896 English Derby winner and legendary racehorse Persimmon. After the foal was weaned it was exported to Australia where it was to race for Green under the name Comedy King. Racing career Comedy King won eight races in his career, with his most famous victory being the 1910 Melbourne Cup. Starting at the odds of 10/1 he won by a margin of a 1/2 neck carrying 7st 11lb (49.5kg) and collected first prize money of ¬£6,178. Stud career Comedy King retired from racing in 1912 and commenced stud duties at owner Sol Green's Shipley Stud near Warrnambool, Victoria. When the stud was dispersed in 1918, Comedy King was secured by pastoralist Norman Falkiner for 7,300 guineas. Comedy King had great success as a sire, producing the 1919 Melbourne Cup winner Artilleryman and the 1922 Cup winner, King Ingoda. He was also crowned Australian Champion stallion in 1920 and 1923. Comedy King died in December 1929 and was buried at Falkiner's Noorilim Stud. A few months after his death, Comedy King's remains were exhumed and his bones sent to be displayed at the newly formed Australian Institute of Anatomy. However, it's unknown if Comedy King's skeleton was ever assembled, and as recently as 2013 an attempt was made to match up boxes of equine bones at the institute to see if the horse could be ‚Äúput back together‚Äù.

She had a moderately successful career in the latter half of the 19th century. She was known for her pure voice and acting skill.  Personal life  Limbach was born to artistic parents in D√ºsseldorf in 1834. Her father was the actor and director Friedrich Heinrich Limbach (1801-1887), and her mother was the actress and singer Mathilde Auguste Hildebrandt (1801-1885). In 1868 a portrait was made of her by the German artist Conrad Freybergde In 1876 she married Heinrich Wilhelm Viktor Gustav von Carnap, a Prussian police chief, in St George's German Lutheran Church in the Whitechapel district of London. After marrying, Limbach lived in Berlin until her death in 1909. 318x318px  Career  Limbach began her career as a child, travelling with the support of her parents. After her basic education, she received singing lessons in Braunschweig from court conductor Franz Abt at the expense of the Staatstheater Braunschweig and thereafter held a long-term commitment there performing in many operas. In 1858 she had her first foreign engagement in Breslau, now usually known as Wroc≈Çaw. From 1859 to 1862 she was a member of the ensemble at the Hoftheater Darmstadt, but often toured as a guest performer, for example at the Friedrich-Wilhelmst√§dtisches Theater and the Kroll Opera House in Berlin. In 1862 she moved to the Quai Theater in Vienna. From 1863 to 1865 she had an engagement in Berlin. After this, she was absent from the stage for many years. She retired permanently upon her marriage in 1876. Roles Limbach's repertoire was rather broad, and she was considered a versatile performer. Her roles included many that are still part of the repertoire in the 21st century: * Zerline in Fra Diavolo by Daniel Auber * Clotilde in Norma by Vincenzo Bellini * Urbain in Les Huguenots composed by Giacomo Meyerbeer * Nancy in Martha by Friedrich von Flotow * Leonore in Alessandro Stradella by Flotow * Marie in Zar und Zimmermann by Albert Lortzing * Zerlina in Don Giovanni by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart * Eurydice in Orpheus in the Underworld by Jacques Offenbach * Helen of Troy in La belle H√©l√®ne by Offenbach * Gemmy in William Tell by Gioachino Rossini * Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss II * √Ñnnchen in Der Freisch√ºtz by Carl Maria von Weber Her measured interpretation of both Eurydice and the eponymous role in La belle H√©l√®ne is said to have contributed to the fact that Offenbach's operettas were finally accepted and therefore appeared more frequently on the discerning German stage.

Its legal form is that of a Company under civil law based in Munich. Its function is to centrally assert the copyright compensation claims of the collecting societies involved in the reproduction of audio works and audiovisual works for private and other personal use and then to distribute the proceeds to the collecting societies. In 2017, the total distribution was around 575 million euros. New private copying levies agreed to by German trade association Bitkom and ZP√ú in December 2015 likely caused Apple to slightly raise the price of its iPhone and iPad prices in Germany on 1 January, 2016. In 2018 the GVL benefited from back payments and adjustments in the private copying sector in the previous years ZP√ú with the GVL paying out a total of ‚Ç¨287 million ($326 million) to producers and artists in 2018, using a new system for distributions.  Background  The Copyright Act (UrhG) provides for legal licenses for certain acts of use. This means that, under certain circumstances, the use of a work is permissible without the permission of the rights holder, but the legislature in return grants the rights holder a right to remuneration. One of the most important legal remuneration claims results from the so-called freedom of private copying: According to ¬ß 53 UrhG, works can be reproduced (i.e. copied, scanned, recorded, etc.) for private and other personal use. The remuneration for private copying is not charged directly to the copier; this would also be practically impossible. Instead, the author has a claim for remuneration against all manufacturers and importers of devices and storage media that are suitable for making such reproductions (Section 54 (1) UrhG). The claim cannot be exercised directly by the individual rights holder themselves, but exclusively by collecting societies (Section 54h (1) UrhG).  Copyright Collection Society definition  The ZP√ú was not itself a Copyright Collection Society within the meaning of Section 2 of the Collecting Societies Act (VGG). While this resulted in an extensive exemption from the special regulations for collecting societies at the time of the Copyright Administration Act, the ZP√ú has been largely subject to this as a so-called dependent collecting organization since the Collecting Societies Act came into force in 2016 and in this role is subject to official supervision by the German Patent and Trademark Office.

For example, in the pig farming, the hog/corn ratio is the number of bushels of corn equal in value to 100 pounds of live hogs. Put another way, it is the price of hogs, per hundredweight, divided by the price of corn per bushel. Since corn is a major input cost to hog producers, the higher the price of hogs relative to corn, the more profit there is in feeding hogs. In dairy farming, the milk-feed price ratio is a measure of the value of 16% protein ration to one pound of whole milk.

Her other travels included early 20th century visits to Timbuktu, Mali, and she witnessed the 1937 volcano at Rabaul, New Guinea. In 1939 she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society. Life and landmark Arabian travel Catherine Hamersley was born in Manhattan, the daughter of J. Hooker Hamersley, a well-known mogul of the Gilded Age, and Margaret Willing Chisholm. With the death of her father, in 1901, and her mother, in 1904, the orphaned Catherine and her brother, Louis Gordon Hamersley (1892-1942) were raised by their nanny, Sarah Lowrie, who was also a trained nurse. Catherine married Samuel Neilson Hinckley in October 1914, and their son Samuel Neilson Hinckley Jr. was born in September 1915. In 1922, Catherine divorced Hinckley to marry Henry Coleman Drayton (1883-1942), a grandson of William Backhouse Astor Jr., and in 1929 she divorced Drayton and married Charles Whitney Carpenter (1881-1954). It was with Carpenter that Catherine Hamersley became well-known as a world traveler, and their January 1939 travel to Syria, Iraq, and Central Arabia became a landmark trip: the first American woman in Riyadh. Until Catherine‚Äôs visit to Riyadh the only recorded visits of ‚Äúforeign‚Äù women who had visited the al Saud capital of Riyadh were: * Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, of the United Kingdom, in February 1938, by invitation from then Crown Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia, who had met her in 1936 at Ascot * Geraldine Rendel, along with her husband, a British diplomat interested in seeing the Eastern Arabian oil fields from her Kuwaiti base, in 1937 * Violet Dickson, who accompanied her husband, a retired British Political Agent in Kuwait, also in 1937 The visits of these women, and by Catherine Hamersley were possible due to the consolidation of the Arabian regions by King Abdulaziz al Saud (‚Äúibn Saud‚Äù) in 1932, and they were landmark trips to the heart of the Wahabi Islamic sect, an event which had been a goal, never achieved, by the intrepid British explorer and diplomat Gertrude Bell. During her Riyadh visit Catherine captured photographic images including those of the King, the Crown Prince, and royal advisor Yusuf Yasin of Syria. Catherine herself was photographed in Riyadh wearing a traditional Najdi woman‚Äôs garb. Later, following the trip, both Catherine and her husband Carpenter gave an interview to Lowell Thomas, on his ‚ÄúOrder of Adventurers‚Äù Radio program. In 1939 the United States had no diplomatic representation in Saudi Arabia; any American in the Kingdom was likely working in the Eastern Coastal area of Dhahran, the center of emerging Saudi oil production beginning in 1938. Both the West Arabian coastal city of Jeddah, and the Eastern Coast area were visited by western women. But the al Saud capital of Riyadh and the central Arabian Najd region were off-limits to western women except by special permission from the royal court. Remarkably, Catherine commented upon her return from her visit that she had not only stayed in the King‚Äôs new palace, but had been included in a falcon-hunting trip with King Abdulaziz; some of her photographs show the camp and the falcons used for hunting. The inclusion of a western woman on a royal hunting trip has not been recorded until her visit. While she is often remembered as an East Coast American society heiress and hostess, her status as the first American woman to visit Riyadh makes her unique among American society hostesses, and her photographs of the trip, in the Litchfield, Connecticut Historical Society collection, are a remarkable and rare record of pre-WWII Saudi Arabia history.

History The previous building on the site was the \\"Market House\\": it was arcaded on the ground floor and had an assembly room on the first floor and was completed in 1634. It was used as a munitions store during the English Civil War until it exploded on 25 February 1643. It was restored in 1661 but, by the mid 18th century, it was \\"in a dangerous and ruinous state\\". The current building, which was designed by Robert Newman in the Palladian style, was completed in 1767. It was officially opened by the actor, David Garrick, in 1769. The design for the Sheep Street elevation involved three bays which were originally arcaded on the ground floor; on the first floor there were two windows with a statue of William Shakespeare by John Cheere in a niche between the windows. On the Chapel Street elevation the design involved five bays in a similar style but with the words \\"God Save the King\\" painted below the first floor window sills; above the first floor was a large pediment containing the borough's coat of arms. The principal rooms were the courtroom, with a rich coffered ceiling, on the ground floor and the ballroom, with Tuscan order pilasters and fine Rococo detailing, on the first floor. Council meetings continued to be held in the Guildhall until 1843 when they were transferred to the town hall. The building was altered in 1863, when the arcading was blocked up with windows, and a rear extension was added with a window and a porch facing onto Sheep Street. The courtroom continued to host petty sessions until 1878 when the room was converted into a council chamber. The ballroom was badly damaged in a fire in December 1946 but was subsequently restored. The council chamber continued to be the meeting place of the borough council but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Stratford-on-Avon District Council was formed in 1974. It remains, however, the meeting place of the local town council. Works of art held by the town hall include a painting by Nathaniel Dance-Holland depicting David Garrick performing as King Richard III in Shakespeares's play, Richard III, and a painting by William Hamilton depicting Sarah Siddons performing as Euphrasia in Arthur Murphy's play, The Grecian Daughter.

She began acting in church socials, and at the age of 17, joined a repertory theatre company, and later moved to the vaudeville circuit. She married fellow vaudeville performer Grant Simpson in 1907. She attributed her trademark \\"sawblade\\" voice to an instance of stage fright when performing at the Alhambra Theatre in 1910, causing her to lose her voice and rasp through the performance, to the approval of the audience. Between 1920 and 1937, McConnell performed in a number of Broadway shows at the Winter Garden Theatre. In 1936, she appeared in two feature films: the musical Stage Struck, and comedy Lady Luck. Toward the end of her career she performed on the popular comedy radio show It Pays to Be Ignorant, which aired from 1942 to 1951. A parody of the quiz show format, the show featured McConnell and two other regular panelists giving amusing incorrect answers to general knowledge questions.

The Showtime mini-series premiered on July 5, 2020. Into Greg Kelley's senior year in Leander, Texas, he was arrested, convicted, and jailed for sexual assault of a four-year-old boy, and later for a second child, who both attended day care in the home where Kelley was living. Kelley was sentenced to 25 years in prison with no possibility for parole. In support of Kelley, a supporting groundswell emerged that called into question the small-town police force, their investigation, the prosecution's tactics, and ultimately the validity of the conviction in one of the most controversial cases the county had ever seen.  Related  \\"This does not feel like freedom at all,\\" said Kelley who was convicted of child sexual assault in 2014 to be exonerated in 2019 though it is exceedingly rare for the state's highest criminal court to overturn a conviction. Gaebri Anderson remained loyal to Greg Kelley. Pat Kondelis is also the director of Disgraced, a 2017 Emmy Award winning Showtime documentary about the 2003 murder of Baylor University basketball player Patrick Dennehy and the attempted, related cover-up of NCAA violations rampant in the Baylor basketball program by Coach Dave Bliss.

Neither warok nor gemblak identified as homosexual. The role of the gemblak is closely tied to the Reog performance. Since heterosexual relations with women were regarded as sapping the strength of the warok (who leads the dance and functions as master of ceremony, as well as being a \\"power broker\\"), he was allowed to have a young boy, usually between 8 and 16, to serve him sexually and play a part in the performance. The gemblak sometimes dresses in female clothing, and is fed and paid for his companionship and work. He often hails from a poor rural family and also does domestic chores for the warok--this, and the social prestige of serving the warok, benefit his family as well. Margaret J. Kartomi, a scholar of Indonesian dance and music, states that the gemblak is a transvestite and thus \\"symbolizes the unity of the cosmos\\". According to J. B. M.

She was the mission‚Äôs first Cherokee convert to Christianity and the first Native American woman to see many of her writings extensively published in her lifetime. Early life Catharine as a child Catharine Brown was born around 1800 to John Brown, in Cherokee known as Yau-nu-gung-yah-ski, and Sarah Webber Brown, in Cherokee Tsa-luh, about 25 miles south east of the Tennessee River at a place known to the Cherokee as Tsu-sau-ya-sah; at that time, it was part of Cherokee Indian territory, but now forms part of the Wills-valley in the State of Alabama between the Raccoon and Lookout mountains. Her parents were prosperous, her father being one of the \\"headmen\\" for the Creek-Path Cherokee community, but had no understanding of the English language despite being considered among the most intellectual class of Cherokee within their nation. Brainerd Mission School Brainerd Cemetery, Chattanooga, Tennessee In the autumn of 1816, Rev. Cyrus Kingsbury, a missionary, appeared before the general Council of the Cherokees and requested permission to build schools for them. The request was well received and Kingsbury established the first Board among the Cherokees before moving on to the Choctaw Nation. The Board convened and selected the place for the first school known as Chick-a-mau-gah. The school was later named Brainerd, in memory of David Brainerd, a renowned missionary to the American Indians at that time. The following spring, Moody Hall and Loring S. Williams arrived at the school, with their wives, as assistant missionaries and soon after the school was opened. The news spread throughout the Cherokee Nation quickly and reached Catharine living about 100 miles away. Catharine was seventeen at the time and had learned to speak English while living at the home of a Cherokee friend. She asked her parents to send her to the missionary school and they granted her request. On July 9, 1817, Catharine became a student at Brainerd Mission School. Considered both beautiful and docile, Catharine made rapid progress. In the first three months she learnt to read and write in English. This had exceeded the progress of anyone known at the time in this or any other country. Catharine became passionate about all that she learned and then around January 1818 she converted to Christianity and was baptized by the missionaries of the Board.

It was created in 1816 by the Boston-based American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions For Catharine the community of women at the mission was most likely a comfort to her, as shown in her letters while she was away from them in later years. In some ways, it resembled communities of Cherokee women in the society where she grew up. Cherokee women lived very separate lives from the men. They grew their crops together and performed their rituals apart from men. They had their children alone or with the help of other women. They even followed the Cherokee principle of secluding themselves from men during their menstrual period. They controlled everything surrounding the household while men spent very little time around. For the women at Brainerd, life was very much like that of the typical middle-class white women of the Northeast at that time. They were expected to be pious, chaste and submissive. They often sought each other‚Äôs company to reassure and affirm those values. The women distanced themselves from Cherokee women who did not necessarily share their views and developed very close ties to one another. Along with the female students they accomplished all the tasks of running the mission together. In addition to this they cared for each other, attended births and shared in responsibilities of child-care. Catharine lamented and mourned the loss of this sense of sisterhood while she was away from Brainerd. Teaching at Creek-Path Creek Path Mission, Marshall County, Alabama The few years Catharine spent at Brainerd were very tumultuous within Cherokee society. The ever encroaching American settlers and increased pressure on the Cherokee to become ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù took its toll on the nation. Some pushed back against this change and kept to the ‚Äúold ways‚Äù. Still others embraced the change and took steps towards ‚Äúcivilization.‚Äù Catharine‚Äôs family was one of those and for her the mission and school was a hope for the future of Cherokee society. During a time when the very fabric of Cherokee community was being shredded, the missions offered a sense of community. They incorporated women, although as subordinates, while the new Cherokee political position excluded women, a far contrast to the past when women held important roles within the town councils and communities. In February 1820, a request from Catharine‚Äôs father to start a mission for boys at Creek Path was heard and provisions to open the school were made. The Creek Path Mission was established in March 1820 by Rev. Daniel S. Butrick and John Arch, a young Cherokee man known as A-tsi. Soon after, a request was made for a girls‚Äô school as well. Catharine was chosen to teach there, in part because she had grown up in Creek Path. She reluctantly accepted the charge with mixed emotions about leaving the friends she had met at Brainerd but also felt a strong sense of importance for the work ahead of her. Brother's illness and her own subsequent death In 1821, Catharine‚Äôs brother, John, contracted tuberculosis and began showing symptoms of the deadly disease. Though she felt a strong tug at rejoining her friends and returning to her work, her Cherokee duty compelled upon her the need to help care for her brother. At the time, the Cherokee believed physical illness was the result of a spiritual ailment that could only be cured by performing sacred rituals. While this was rejected by many Christian missionaries, no alternative was introduced and many Christian Cherokees themselves practiced traditional medicine to treat illnesses. It was then no surprise when Catharine joined John‚Äôs wife on a journey to a sulphur spring in Alabama. To the Cherokee, water had a certain healing property of its own and was manifested in many ways within the culture. One such practice was called ‚Äúgoing to water‚Äù where they bathed daily in running water to purify themselves. It made perfect sense to seek healing for John‚Äôs ailments by going to the spring. However, the journey was long and John‚Äôs health continued to deteriorate so they decided to stop at another spring and made camp. He drank the water and bathed in it but to no avail. Six months later John passed. Catharine being taken by canoe After her brother died, Catharine returned home to care for her parents who, by this time, were in their sixties and living in John‚Äôs home. She visited the missions at Creek Path and Brainerd but had resigned herself to her duty of caring for her aging parents. In a letter to her other brother, David, she expressed a hope to possibly emigrate west and viewed the opportunity to spread her values with a sense of excitement and enthusiasm. However, Catharine had already began to show signs of the same illness that claimed her brother. She sought the help of Dr. Alexander Campbell, a white physician who lived near Limestone, Alabama, but as her condition grew worse her parents became desperate. Much to the dismay of the missionaries at Brainerd her parents entrusted her care to traditional healers. Their prescriptions reportedly helped little and after she had a severe hemorrhage in her lungs they sent for the missionaries. A week later, Dr. Campbell arrived but her condition was very grave. He had Catharine transported to his home so she would be under constant care. Her mother and sister joined her on the journey by litter, canoe and carriage. On the morning of July 18, 1823, Catharine Brown died at Dr. Campbell‚Äôs home. He was said to remark upon her death, ‚ÄúThus fell asleep this lovely saint, in the arms of her Savior\\". Impact and legacy A sketch of the wooden monument erected by the bereaved family of Catharine Brown upon her death at 23 years old in 1823. After her death, the missionaries at Brainerd commissioned Rufus Anderson to compile a biographical article for Catharine to be included in their magazine, the Missionary Herald. However, so much material was uncovered that the American Board had a book length work published called Memoir of Catharine Brown, A Christian Indian of the Cherokee Nation. While the work exalted the efforts of missionaries to spread the virtues of Christianity to the American Indian, it also suggested that the same work had erased almost all of Catharine‚Äôs Cherokee identity. In the following years, Catharine‚Äôs writings were used in political debates about removing the Cherokees and other tribes to Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. She was once viewed by literary critics as a victim of early Christian missionaries who, by conversion, became a tragedy because of the loss of her identity. However, as time passed she began to be viewed as a woman representing the lasting revitalization, survival, adaptability and leadership of the Cherokee culture as a whole. Later collections of her letters and diary cemented Catharine‚Äôs place in early nineteenth-century culture and have had an enduring effect on American perceptions of Native Americans.

The entries, based on a mix of existing and brand-new research, were mainly selected with an emphasis on societal significance rather than personal fame. The selection includes female pioneers and women who fought for gender equality as well as those of historical significance. Finnish women are also included for the pre-1809 era. The project leaders are Lisbeth Larsson and Maria Sj√∂berg. The articles have been translated into English by Alexia Grosjean.

During the struggle between Henry, Duke of Carinthia and the Habsburg rulers of Austria and Styria, he sided with the latter. By accepting the Habsburgs as his liege lords, he was instrumental in transferring the lordship over the Savinja region from the Meinhardiner-dominated Carniola to Habsburg Styria.Milko Kos, Srednjeve≈°ka zgodovina Slovencev (Ljubljana: Slovenska matica, 1985), p. 260 His second marriage with the noblewoman Catherine of Heunburg would enable their son to claim the Heunburg inheritance in Carinthia and in the Savinja Valley, including the strategically important Celje Castle. This union of the Sanneck (≈Ωovnek) and Heunburg (Vovbre) noble houses would give birth to the House of Celje. Life Earlier historians believed there were two Ulrichs of Sanneck in the second half of the 13th century, Ulrich I and Ulrich II.Rolanda Fugger Germadnik et al., Razstava Grofje Celjski (Celje: Pokrajinski muzej Celje, 1999), p. 13 Since at least the 1960s, however, the consensus has shifted, and it is now believed there was one single nobleman with that name.Janko Oro≈æen Janko, Zgodovina Celja in okolice, 1. Del. (Celje, 1971), p. 126. It is now considered that Ulrich was a younger son of Conrad I of Sanneck, a free noble in the March of Savinja, a strategically important border region fragmented among many small estates and contested by larger dynasties, such as the Babenbergs, the Spanheims and the P≈ôemyslids. In 1278, Ulrich fought in the Battle of Marchfeld on the side of king Rudolf I against Ottokar II, king of Bohemia and the recently deposed duke of Austria and Styria.Milko Kos, Srednjeve≈°ka zgodovina Slovencev (Ljubljana: Slovenska matica, 1985), p. 260 After defeating Ottokar, the Habsburgs and the House of Gorizia-Tyrol divided the spoils among themselves, with Austria and Styria going to the former, and Carinthia and Carniola to the latter; the Savinja Valley became a buffer zone between the two domains. The Lords of Sanneck sought to increase their power by balancing between the two houses.Milko Kos, Zgodovina Slovencev od naselitve do reformacije (Ljubljana: Jugoslovanska knjigarna, 1933), p. 162-65. After the death of his older brothers Conrad II around 1262 and Luitpold around 1286, Ulrich remained the sole heir of the Sanneck estates centered around ≈Ωovnek Castle in the Upper Savinja Valley.Vlado Habijan, Mejniki slovenske zgodovine (Ljubljana: Dru≈°tvo 2000, 1997), p. 66. Following the death of his younger brother Gebhard III around 1292, Ulrich remained the sole Lord of Sanneck. After the death of his first wife, Anne of Sternberg, he married Catherine of Heunburg, the firstborn daughter of Ulrich II Count of Heunburg and Agnes of Baden, the titular heiress of the House of Babenberg through her mother Gertrude of Austria. In 1308, Ulrich took the side of Albert of Habsburg and his sons Rudolph and Frederick in their feud against Henry of Gorizia-Tyrol over the inheritance of the Bohemian throne. By handing over his lands to the Habsburgs and receiving them back from them as a fief, Ulrich became a Habsburg vassal, significantly weakening Henry's position in the strategically important region between Styria and Carniola.Kos, Srednjeve≈°ka zgodovina Slovencev, p. 261 In the peace treaty of 1308, confirmed in 1311, the Savinja Valley was finally incorporated into Habsburg Styria.Milko Kos, Zgodovina Slovencev od naselitve do reformacije p. 164. Ulrich died around 1316. His son Frederick would successfully claim his mother's inheritance in southeastern Carinthia and in Savinja, including the Celje Castle, thus doubling his possessions and paving the way for the rise of the House of Celje.

During the First World War, prisoners of war, like Roure and De Gaulle, were held there.  Life  Remy Roure fought in World War One, and was taken prisoner and escaped several times. During his captivity at the fort of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, he met two other prisoners in 1917: Charles de Gaulle and Mikhail Tukhachevsky, future Soviet marshal executed in the Great Purge in 1937. During World War II, he joined the Resistance very early on. With General Cochet and Fran√ßois de Menthon he founded the Libert√© movement, of which he became a member of the management committee. Member of Combat resistance movement, he is in favor of a reapprochement between this movement and General de Gaulle. Roure was also a member of an Allied pilot recovery network, Bordeaux-Loupiac, while continuing to write in Le Temps, an activity which served as his cover. On October 11, 1943, while he was transporting American pilots to Rennes, he was arrested by the Gestapo, following a denunciation. He tried to escape but was seriously wounded by gunshot during his attempt while his ally Jean-Claude Camors, alias Raoul, was shot dead. Almost dying - he severed his femoral artery - he received treatment and survived. Four days later he was interned in Fresnes Prison, where he was beaten and tortured. On April 27, 1944, he was deported to Germany, to Auschwitz at first, and then to Buchenwald where he arrived on May 14, 1944. Eventually he was released by allied forces on April 11, 1945.

He spent nearly 40 years as publisher and co-owner of The Keene Sentinel in Keene, New Hampshire. In 1984, Ewing, along with Thomas Winship, an editor at The Boston Globe, and George Krimsky, an Associated Press correspondent and editor, helped to establish the International Center for Journalists, a non-profit that works with journalists from all over the world. One notable trainee, who spent some of his time in training at the newspaper in 1987, was Hamid Karzai, who went on to become the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan. In 1981, Ewing was selected to be a nominating judge for Pulitzer Prizes in journalism. Ewing also inducted into the Newspaper Hall of Fame by the New England Newspaper & Press Association, recognized for his outstanding professionalism and accomplishments.  Education  James Dennis Ewing was born on January 14, 1917, in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents were Oscar R. Ewing and Helen (Dennis) Ewing. He attended preparatory school at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut and graduated from Princeton University in 1938. Ewing went on to attend Harvard Law School for one year. He received honorary degrees from Keene State College, Franklin Pierce College and the University of New Hampshire.  Background and career  After graduating from Princeton in 1938, Ewing attended Harvard Law for a year, before leaving to teach Latin and Greek at the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut. In 1942, after two years of teaching, he left to work for the National War Labor Board in Washington, D.C., during World War II. He met and married his wife, Ruth Dewing, in September 1943. Ewing had previously been denied enlistment into the Navy due to his eyesight, but was accepted on his second attempt and assigned to labor relations in Detroit. There, he and his wife met Russell H. Peters, a journalist who had worked with the Omaha Daily Bee and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Together, they formed a partnership and in 1946 they purchased the Bangor Daily Commercial (also known as the Bangor Evening Commercial), a newspaper in Maine. The Ewings became sole owners of the Bangor Commercial after Peters sold his interest to them in 1952. However, in January 1954 the operation was shuttered due to financial losses; publication of the Bangor Sunday Commercial lasted from 1953 to 1954. Shortly afterwards, the Ewings met Walter Paine, and in October of 1954, they purchased the Keene Evening Sentinel from the family of John Prentiss, who had recently died. In 1956 the Ewings and Paine purchased the Valley News in Lebanon, New Hampshire, and five years later they purchased the Argus-Champion in New London, New Hampshire. In 1961, Ewing received Honorable Mention in the Svellon Brown Awards, the award recognizes an individual for producing journalism of distinction from the New England Newspaper and Press Association.https://sentinelsource.com/app/resources/sentinel_history.pdf Newspapers, by Grace Prentiss The award recognizes an individual for producing journalism of distinction.

Muskie and earlier, in the 1952 primary, the Bangor Commercial was the only area newspaper to voice opposition to Ralph Owen Brewster. In a 1999 interview, Ewing was asked to describe his political philosophy; the conversation was in the context of the Bangor Commercial and his opposition to Brewster. Ewing responded that he considered himself as an independent but on the liberal side and added that the more forward, or liberal thinking came from the Republicans at that time, not from the Democratic Party. He went on to describe how his newspaper went after Brewster \\"hammer and tongs\\" in opposition to him, and a lot of what they had printed was picked up and reprinted by the opposing campaign. Brewster, himself, cited Ewing as a significant contributor to his defeat. In an interview, Kay Cutler, a good friend of the Ewings, referred to the defeat as the Bangor Daily Commercial's \\"shining hour\\". Time magazine described the Commercial as \\"an independent, liberal voice in the conservative woods of Maine journalism.\\" During his time with the Sentinel, he successfully pushed for improvements to the New Hampshire welfare department, public housing, and revisions to Keene's city charter, including freedom of information laws. Ewing believed that a newspaper had an obligation to inform its readers and help them make responsible decisions. He maintained a larger newsroom that was outside of industry standards and insisted on printing a large share of international articles, in adherence to his belief that the readers should be exposed to other parts of a \\"shrinking world\\".

Early life and education Deatrick was born to parents Alma Gertrude (Tanis) Deatrick and John Deatrick in Ohio. She attended the University of Cincinnati College of Nursing for her undergraduate degree while serving as president of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. As a PhD student, Deatrick led a series of studies which examined the experiences of families whose children were being cared at the hospital. Career Upon receiving her PhD, Deatrick became an assistant professor and director of the graduate program at Northwestern University's Center for Nursing. She eventually left that position in 1989 to accept a temporary lecturer role at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). After one year in this position, Deatrick was promoted to assistant professor and later associate professor. In 1990, Deatrick and Kathleen Knafl co-published Family management style: Concept analysis and development, which revealed how families confronted challenges while staying in the hospital and the ways health care professional sometimes support or hinder their efforts. In recognition of her contributions, she received the Christian and Mary Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching at the University of Pennsylvania in 1995 and the Excellence in Nursing Research Award for the Society of Pediatric Nurses in 1997. By 1999, Deatrick was an associate professor, chair of the Division of Nursing of Children, graduate program director in the Pediatric Acute/Chronic Care Nurse Practitioner Program, and co-director of the International Center for Research on Women, Children and Families.

He took photographs of Royal Family members and politicians.  Biography  Adams' was born in 1842 in Hampshire. He died on the 13 June 1934 aged 93, leaving six children. Walton Adams's son Marcus Adams (1875‚Äì1959) also became a photographer, including time spent photographing the Royal Family.  Early career  The earliest references to Walton Adams's involvement in photography show him to be working in the Southampton studio of Samuel J. Wiseman (1825-1872) as an apprentice in 1861. There he met William Stilliard. In 1869 Adams and Stilliard were in partnership at 9 Bernard Street, Southampton. 'Cartes de Visite' described their business variously as the 'South of England Photographic Institution', 'Artists and Photographers' and 'Artists in Photography'. The business claimed the patronage of Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales and Princess of Wales and the Belgian Royal family. In 1882 Adams was in partnership with Robert Scanlan though this business arrangement was dissolved in 1883. Between 1886 and his retirement in 1922, Adams ran his business from a Studio at 27 and 29 Blagrave Street, Reading, a business card for this address is held by the Reading Museum. Photography historian S. K. May on the Southampton Victorian Photographers website speculates that Adams possibly worked with Richard Leach Maddox, the inventor of lightweight gelatin dry plates. Dr. Maddox was a medical practitioner and his interest in the possibilities of photography to aid medical practice brought him into contact with a small network of photographers in Southampton, one of which was Adams. There is a reference to Adams as the co-inventor of this process in the National Portrait Gallery's photographic archives.  Legacy  An unpublished autobiographical account mentions that he photographed \\"about sixty thousand sitters\\" during his career and he singles out those whom he considered to be the most illustrious: Queen Victoria and General Charles George Gordon. Thirteen Images attributed to Adams appear in photographic collections of the National Portrait Gallery, Examples of the work undertaken by his son Marcus and grandson Gilbert Adams also appear in the National Portrait Gallery's collections, underscoring Walton's influence. Walton's work is also to seen in the photographic collection held at the Conway Library, Courtauld Institute of Art. This collection is currently in the process of being digitised as part of a wider project 'Courtauld Connects'.

History  In March 1937, the 116th Mixed Brigade was created in Cieza, although it had a short existence. On April 28, 1937, the 116th Mixed Brigade was reformed on the Aragon front as a unit of the 25th Division of the 12th Army Corps. It was made up of anarchist militiamen of the CNT-FAI from the former 1st Regiment of the South Ebro Column, whose militarization resulted in the 25th Division. In June 1937 the brigade participated in the Huesca Offensive, succeeding in occupying some enemy positions ‚Äîalthough the general offensive failed. At the end of August 1937, in the face of the Zaragoza Offensive, it became part of the ‚ÄúD‚Äù Group commanded by Juan Modesto. On August 24, the unit was located in the area of Quinto to participate in the siege of Codo. In the assault on this town, the 116th MB fought alongside the 32nd Mixed Brigade in a confrontation with Carlist troops. A few days later, on August 28, it took the position of La Novia del Viento, a key point for the Battle of Belchite. In December 1937, the 116th MB was sent south along with the rest of the division to participate in a new Battle of Teruel. By December 18, it was fighting in the Old Cemetery and in the Hermitage of Santa B√°rbara. The next day it advanced until it was one kilometer from Teruel's urban area. On December 21 it finally managed to occupy the Old Cemetery, although nationalist resistance would continue for two more days in the positions of the Hermitage of Santa B√°rbara and ¬´El Mansueto ¬ª. On January 1, 1938, together with the rest of the 25th Division, he managed to reestablish the republican lines after a nationalist counteroffensive. On March 10, after the beginning of the Aragon Offensive, he had to move hastily to the Alcorisa sector and later to Andorra, a town that would fall to the nationalist units. Later it fought on the Levante front. By April 28, the brigade was located in the area of Ejulve-Villarluengo, although later (May 12) it had to move back towards Alboc√°cer. By July 21, it was on the XYZ Line. The 116th MB remained inactive on the Levant front until the end of the war, in March 1939.

Biography  Daniel Anthony Overbeek was born to Daniel Overbeek (1727‚Äì1770) and Theodora Petronella Immens. Relatives on his father's side had long been employees of the Dutch East India Company, with the brother of his grandfather Nicolaas Overbeek, who was also called Daniel Overbeek, even serving as governor of Dutch Ceylon. Like his father, Daniel Anthony Overbeek made a career in Dutch Bengal, until in 1795 the Dutch possessions were ceded to the British by instruction of Dutch stadtholder William V, who wanted to prevent revolutionary France from taking possession of the Dutch holdings in Asia. Under the terms of the Anglo- Dutch Treaty of 1814, Dutch Bengal was to be restored to Dutch rule, and a commission under the leadership of was installed by the Dutch East Indies government on 28 June 1817 to effect the transfer of the Dutch possessions on the Indian subcontinent. Van Braam arrived in Chinsurah on 28 August 1817 and met with the British colonial administrator Gordon Forbes, who officially handed over the Dutch possessions on 15 September 1817. Van Braam installed Overbeek as resident of Dutch Bengal. In 1822, Overbeek laid the foundation stone for the spire of the Armenian Church of St. John the Baptist in Chinsurah. In 1823, Overbeek became a corresponding member of the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, to which he donated a silver Vishnu from Birma. In 1824, the Dutch conceded to relinquishing all their possessions on the Indian subcontinent in return for control over Bencoolen. This meant that the Dutch possessions in Bengal were to become British again. Overbeek was in Batavia when the transfer was supposed to take place, leading acting resident B. C. D. Bouman to effect the transfer of sovereignty on 7 May 1825. Daniel Anthony Overbeek returned to Chinsurah after the transfer of sovereignty and lived there until his death on 25 September 1840. He is buried in the Dutch cemetery of Chinsurah.  Personal life  Daniel Anthony Overbeek married Sarah Leonora Jacoba Eilbrecht, with whom he had three daughters and one son.

In 1946, he was accused and convicted of war crimes, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity; he was sentenced to death by the People's Court (sentence reconfirmed in the appeals of 2006 and 2008) and was executed on June 1, 1946 by shooting.  Biography = Professional and political career until 1940  Gheorghe was the eldest son of an aromanian shepherd from Pindus, Ovanez Alexean, a refugee in Wallachia to escape the forced islamization undertaken by the Turks in the second half of the 19th century. Ovanez arrived with herds of sheep in Moldavia in the Panciu area, where he settled after a short time. In 1915 he began his law studies at University of Bucharest. After Romania entered the war, in December 1916, he enlisted voluntarily in the Romanian army. In 1918 he left the army and resumed his studies at the University of Bucharest. After graduation he was for a year professor of philosophy and history at a high school in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea, then he attended doctoral courses at University of Bucharest and obtained the title of doctor in legal sciences (1925). From 1927 he held the position of associate professor of public law at the Chernivtsi University, where he worked until 1938. He began his administrative career with his appointment as a governor (Romanian: \\"rezident regal\\", literally meaning \\"royal resident\\") of »öinutul Suceava (with the capital at Chernivtsi) on August 29, 1938. On December 1, 1938, the decree-law no. 169/1938 for the ‚Äúcitizenship review‚Äù, was issued by the government, with the aim of revoking the citizenship of Jewish citizens. Alexianu applied this decree-law abusively, with personal additions. Among other things, he ordered Jewish citizens, deprived of their Romanian citizenship, to register and also \\"suggested\\" that they should sell their properties and businesses within 14 days. On January 31, 1939, he was removed from the position of royal resident of »öinutul Suceava due to the inability to solve the social and political problems of Bukovina and was replaced by Gheorghe Flondor. Alexianu was then appointed as a royal resident of »öinutul Bucegi (with the capital at Bucharest). He held this position until September 1940.  Transnistria Governorate  On August 19 1941, Alexianu was appointed by Ion Antonescu as governor of Transnistria. In this position, Alexianu was an \\"ex officio\\" member of the Council of Ministers. On June 19, 1941, he attended the meeting of the Antonescu Government when it was decided to declare war on the Soviet Union. Following a bomb attack launched on the evening of October 22, 1941 by Soviet partisans against the Romanian Army located in Odessa, Alexianu, as a government representative, ordered and supervised the retaliation and massacre of November 1941: Romanian soldiers participating in the deportation of Jewish families (German photograph, July 1941) As governor of Transnistria, Alexianu organized ghettos and concentration camps to place the deported Romanian and Ukrainian Jews and 25,000 Gypsies. He ordered endless marches in which Jews and Romas (including women, elders and even children) were forced to walk through the huge frozen steps, leaving behind rows of corpses; He enforced compulsory work for every \\"undesirable\\".Ordinance no. 26/1941 on the establishment of compulsory labor for all inhabitants Odessa between 16-60 years old, under their internal sanction in the camp By Ordinance no. 35 of January 2, 1942 Alexianu ordered the deportation of all Jews from Odessa to the Berezivka region, where they were massacred. According to the historian Raul Hilberg, Antonescu's orders required German interventions: \\"There were situations in which the Germans would intervene to restrict and slowdown the Romanian measures. At that time, the Romanians were moving too fast for the German bureaucracy.\\" .Hilberg, Raul, The Destruction of the European Jews, p. 759 Gendarmerie Report - Deportation of Gypsees in Transnistria About half of the 25,000 Roma deported to Transnistria were killed.Du»õu A., Retegan M., RƒÉzboi »ôi societate, vol. 1, RAO, 2000 Alexianu administratively divided the occupied territories of Transnistria into counties, demanded the sending of a Romanian Orthodox Mission to this territory and re-established churches that have been previously transformed into grain depots or cattle stables by the soviet authorities. On December 7, 1941, on Alexianu's initiative, a University in Odessa was reorganized and reopened in place of the old University that had been evacuated to the east during the war by the Soviet authorities. Although in Transnistria the majority population was Ukrainian, during Alexianu's administration, priority was given to Romanian schools. There were then 57 high schools (26 Romanian, 13 Ukrainian, 18 Russian), of which 34 practical high schools (5 Romanian, 13 Ukrainian, 16 Russian) and 23 theoretical- practical high schools (21 Romanian and two Russian). On January 26, 1944, Gheorghe Alexianu was replaced as governor of Transnistria by General Gheorghe Potopeanu. On February 5, 1944, the new University of Odessa awarded Alexianu the title of \\"doctor honoris causa\\", \\"as a gratitude of the support given to higher education in Odessa during his administration.\\" On this occasion, the University of Odessa assumed municipal positions and granted Alexianu a municipal title: \\"In the behalf of the University of Odessa, we, the Faculty Council, unanimously declare you Honorary Citizen of Odessa\\".Alexianu prime»ôte titlul de doctor honoris causa la Odessa √Æn 1944  1946 trial  Alexianu was arrested in August 1944 and sent to Moscow alongside Ion Antonescu and Mihai Antonescu.

Family  She was the first-born of the children of the morganatic marriage formed by Duke Alexander of W√ºrttemberg and Countess Claudine von Hohenstein (born Countess Claudine Rh√©dey). This marriage had a morganatic character, so that neither the wife nor the children of the same would be considered members of the Royal House of Wurtemberg. After her would come a brother and a sister: * Francis, later Duke of Teck (1837-1900), married to Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge. * Countess Amalia of Hohenstein (1838-1893), married to Count Paul von H√ºgel. Her father was an officer in the army of the Austrian Empire and his mother belonged to the Hungarian nobility. For this reason the marriage was established in Vienna. His mother was awarded the title of Countess of Hohenstein Ferdinand I of Austria on May 16, 1835, fourteen days after their wedding. This title was the one used by both she and her siblings at first, after their birth.  Biography  Her childhood and early youth were spent in Vienna with his parents and siblings. Her mother died in 1841, as a result of an accident in which she was run over by horses. Her sister Amelia's marriage to Baron (later Count) Paul von H√ºgel and their transfer to Reinthal Castle near Graz, led her to take up residence in a Swiss-style chalet a short distance from her sister. On 1 December 1863, her cousin King William I of W√ºrttemberg granted Claudine and her brother Francis the title and rank of princes (f√ºrst) of Teck, with the style of Serene Highness. Claudine had a great fondness for gardening and farming. In her residence she had a farm. Her life was spent with her sister's family (her husband and their only child, Paul Julius (1872-1912) known as Bubi.

The most intense period in the Danish witchcraft persecutions was the 1620s. History=Background Sorcery was first criminalized in Denmark in the county laws of Scania and Zealand from 1170, which followed the contemporary principle that magic was prohibited only in combination with murder, which was a common principle in other contemporary laws against sorcery in the Middle Ages.Ankarloo, Bengt & Henningsen, Gustav (ed.), Skrifter. Bd 13, H√§xornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier. Stockholm: Nerenius & Sant√©rus, 1987 Whether anyone was executed in Denmark for sorcery during the Middle Ages is unknown due to lacking documentation. In the 16th century, the first known executions for witchcraft are documented in Denmark. The law had not changed, but the attitude toward witchcraft had become more strict as had the praxis of the law. In 1530, two women, \\"the wives of Lars Kylling and J√∏rgen Olsen\\", were executed by burning for sorcery on Bornholm and thus the first documented executions for sorcery in present-day Denmark. However, the island of Bornholm was not Danish at that time, and the first witchcraft executions in Denmark proper were, therefore, Karen Grottes and Bodil Lauritzen in 1540. In 1543, a large witch trial in Malm√∂, centered around Gyde Spandemager, attracted attention. Legal situation In the K√∂benhavnske recess from 1547 it was stated that a testimony from a criminal was not a legal ground for a death sentence, and that torture was prohibited prior to a guilty verdict. The Kalundborgske recess from 1576 forbade the enforcement of any execution issued by a local court until confirmed by the high court. The 1576 law had a moderating effect on the witchcraft persecutions in Denmark up until 1617. The Witchcraft Act of 1617 sorted sorcery crimes in two categories: those using magic without associating with the Devil should be exiled, while those who consorted with the Devil and who had made a pact with him should be executed by burning regardless if they had performed magic or not. The witchcraft act of 1617 was in effect until 1686. The witch trial in Copenhagen in 1589 against Anna Koldings and her accused accomplices was connected to the first famous witch trial in Scotland, the North Berwick witch trials of 1590. Jylland, 1609‚Äì1687 The Danish witch trials are not well documented. Witch some exceptions, such as the famous Copenhagen witch trial (1589) and the K√∏ge Huskors (1608‚Äì1615), only the documentation of the region of Jylland from the period from 1609 to 1687 are preserved well enough to enable a proper investigation. Documentation of the witch trials in other parts of Denmark are preserved only partially or not at all. Between 1609 and 1687, 494 witchcraft executions were conducted on Jylland. The majority of them, 297, took place during the years of 1617‚Äì1625, which was a period of intense witch hunts in Denmark. After the witch panic of the 1620s, the cases became fewer, likely because the prime victims during the great witch hunt had been marginalized people considered odd and reputed to be involved in sorcery, and that this category had been killed and fewer people of this kind was left to direct sorcery accusations toward. Between 1656 and 1687, only one person was executed for sorcery on Jylland, and in 1686, four people were executed as the last people executed for this crime in this region of Denmark. 80 percent of all executed were women. The most famous case of the region was the case of Maren Spliid in 1641, who belonged to the most known victims of the Danish witch hunt. The public on Jylland was not interested in the Satan's sabbath or Devil's pacts, which were the main focus of the investigators, but generally directed their accusations toward people they accused of having harmed them or their animals or property by the help of magic. According to the Witchcraft Act, a death sentence could only be issued for the crime of Devil's Pact, and such a confession could only be attained by use of torture, which was forbidden prior to a guilty verdict. However, in practice, the judges adjusted to the common view and sentenced people to death on the grounds of sorcery alone. Most of those accused were poor women who had a long reputation of dealing with magic and who were accused by their neighbors. The end In 1686, the local courts were banned from performing executions without confirmation from the national high court. Anne Palles, who was executed in Copenhagen in 1693, has been referred to as the last person executed for sorcery in Denmark. Anne Palles was the last woman to be legally executed for sorcery in Denmark, but her case was not the last Danish witch trial. The last large witch trial in Denmark was the Thisted witch trial of 1698, in which several women were sentenced to death accused of having caused fits by sorcery. After the fits were proved to be false, however, the condemned were freed. After that, the Danish authorities were reluctant to accept any more charges of witchcraft. When the local court of Schelenburg condemned two women to be burned at the stake for witchcraft in 1708, the sentence was revoked by the high court. Anne Palles has been called the last \\"witch\\" to be executed in Denmark. She was also likely the last woman to be executed for sorcery in Denmark: however, the very last person to be legally executed for sorcery in Denmark was in fact a man, the grenadier Johan PistoriusTyge Krogh, Louise Nyholm Kallestrup, and Claus Bundg√•rd Christensen, Cultural Histories of Crime in Denmark, 1500 to 2000 There were death sentences for witchcraft in Denmark long after this. In 1733 a student, and in 1752 a farmer, were sentenced to life imprisonment with forced labor for Satanic pact, and as late as in 1803, two craftsmen received death sentences for the same crime, although none of the sentences where actually carried out. People were also lynched for witchcraft in Denmark long after the formal persecution stopped: the best known cases being that of Dorte Jensdatter, who was apprehended by villagers who tied her up in her own home and burned it down after having accused her of causing death by magic, and the last lynching for witchcraft, in which Anna Klemens was lynched after having being pointed out for sorcery by a cunning woman in Brigsted at Horsens in 1800.

The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.  Timeline  Gagauzia is an autonomous province of Moldova, a country whose first case was registered on 7 March 2020. During the first few months, dozens of suspected cases were examined, but all of them tested negative. Svetlana Duleva, head of the Health and Social Protection Department of Gagauzia, said that the fact that many Gagauz people that returned home from abroad were not isolating themselves from others for at least two weeks was concerning. She also said that there were many workers and students coming back from Transnistria, which had 7 cases at the moment. Mihail Sirkeli, a Gagauz activist, said that people were only imitating the behavior of the autonomous authorities, which kept organizing meetings with many persons while asking people to stay at home. Gagauzia's first case was registered on the night of 1 April 2020. The infected man was a truck driver who likely became infected while traveling from Russia to Turkey. He had already contacted many of his relatives, putting them all at risk. The man was sent to Chi»ôinƒÉu to be hospitalized. Doctors of Gagauzia complained about the aggressive attitude of many truck drivers, who usually do not respect safety measures. An increase in cases of domestic violence was reported in Gagauzia. Campaigners said they do not have the means and resources to combat the problem due to the coronavirus lockdown.

Stapleton has also performed on recordings with Lydia Lunch, Mark Lanegan, Cypress Grove and Crippled Black Phoenix.  Background  Stapleton was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. After dropping out of high school she studied audio engineering, became a club DJ, and worked as a radio host and voiceover artist. She has also acted on various Australian television drama series and ABC Australia productions In 2005 Stapleton moved to Melbourne and it was here that she began performing as a solo artist in 2007. This evolved into a full band line up, with whom she recorded two critically acclaimed EP's.. Relocating to the UK in 2015, Stapleton was initially based in London, where she recruited a new band featuring Gavin Jay on bass and Ian White on drums. During this time Stapleton also toured across the UK and Europe solo and supported artists such as Mark Lanegan, Mick Harvey and Jim Jones and The Righteous Mind. Reviewing her support slot for Mick Harvey in Glasgow Louder Than War wrote: \\"It‚Äôs rare that a new artist comes along who genuinely defies easy description, but this is certainly the case with Stapleton. Her songs seem to inhabit the dark, intense corners of the soul in a manner not dissimilar to Nick Drake or even Elliott Smith, yet Stapleton‚Äôs guitar-playing is at once raw and tender, at times evoking the elemental spirit of Link Wray or ‚ÄòSister‚Äô era Sonic Youth... a bright new star in the ascendant.\\" In 2019 Stapleton settled in Brighton after spending time there writing her debut album and with a family connection to the area, her grandmother having been born in The Lanes in the 1920's.  Releases  45 Revelations Per Minute - EP (2009) Stapleton recorded her first EP \\"45 Revelations Per Minute\\" in Melbourne, Australia. The EP includes performances by several notable guest musicians. Charlie Owen (The Divinyls, Beasts Of Bourbon) plays slide guitar on \\"Cut Away\\" and rhodes piano on ‚ÄòAsking', Johnny Nolan (The Powder Monkeys, Bored) plays lead guitar on \\"6ft Away\\", and bassist Shane Walsh (Tex, Don & Charlie) and drummer Ian Kitney (Temperance Union) play across the EP. Obladi Diablo - EP (2012) Stapleton‚Äôs second EP was released in 2012, with a vinyl release in 2013 on French label Beast Records. The title roughly translates as ‚Äòpop music is evil‚Äô and was described as \\"an antidote to the insidious disease that is flaccid pop\\" and having \\"a Dirty Three and Nick Cave-like gritty Aussie folk quality to it\\". The EP was produced by Stapleton and recorded and mixed by engineer Jez Giddings at Melbourne‚Äôs Hothouse Studios with drummer Craig Williamson and bassist Leif van den Dungen. The second track on the EP ‚ÄòSong Of The Artesian Water‚Äô is an adaptation of a poem by Australian bush poet Banjo Paterson. We Are The Plague - LP (2020) Stapleton's debut full- length album was released on July 31st, 2020 via Negative Prophet Records, in conjunction with Cargo Records. Album sessions began in January 2019 in Oxforshire, England at Ox4 Studio with Gavin Jay (Jim Jones Revue / Jim Jones and The Righteous Mind), and Jim Macaulay (The Stranglers) recording bass and drums. Stapleton later added vocals and guitar at her home studio, with Gareth Skinner recording cello parts remotely in Melbourne, Australia. Stapleton produced the album and it was mixed by Dan Cox at Urchin Studios in London. Themes of the album deal with environmental degradation, climate change, and societal collapse. Stapleton asks \\"Why have we been so quick to take drastic action on coronavirus yet drag our feet when it comes to dealing with climate change which could bring down not only us but the entire global ecosystem? Will we go back to destroying our planet, poisoning our resources, and hammering the nails in our collective coffin? Or is this the wake-up call we need to re-calibrate and work together for a better future?\\" The album was critically well received, earning 9 out of 10 from Vive Le Rock Magazine who called it \\"exquisitely executed‚Ä¶ will stack up plaudits by the dozen\\". and Louder Than War who placed it on their mid-year list \\"22 Albums of 2020 So Far\\" Classic Rock praised its \\"beguiling gothic blues landscapes\\" whilst MOJO approved of the \\"fiery rock poetry, nerve-shredding blues and dark magnetism\\". Reviewing the album, Louder Than War lauded a \\"dazzling debut\\" that blends \\"the spirit of Patti Smith and PJ Harvey with the soul of Nick Cave and Mark Lanegan\\". They also noted Stapleton‚Äôs guitar playing, describing it as \\"a blizzard of distortion, notes bending and sustaining and disintegrating, somewhere between the harmonics of Duke Garwood and the brutal fuzz of Thurston Moore\\" Album tracks have since received airplay on BBC 6 in the UK, Double J in Australia, RTL2 in France, and Radio Eins and Deutschland Kultur in Germany.  Other Projects  In 2013, Cypress Grove saw Stapleton perform at London‚Äôs 12 Bar Club and invited her to participate in volume 3 of The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project, titled \\"Axels & Sockets\\" (2014, Glitterhouse Records) . The project celebrates the life and music of Jeffrey Lee Pierce, the late front man of The Gun Club and includes contributions from artists such as Nick Cave, Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, Primal Scream and Thurston Moore. Stapleton provides additional vocals to the track \\"Constant Limbo (Constant Rain)\\" featuring Mark Lanegan, Bertrand Cantat, Cypress Grove and Crippled Black Phoenix, and \\"When I Get My Cadillac\\" which is performed by Cypress Grove. She will also be involved in an as yet untitled fourth and final album in the series. Stapleton performs backing vocals on two albums by Lydia Lunch & Cypress Grove, a split release with Spiritual Front called \\"Twin Horses\\" in 2015 and \\"Under The Covers\\" which was released in 2017. On this album Lunch & Grove cover songs by artists not usually associated with the no- wave icon.

The piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and was premiered with Gustavo Dudamel, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Zubin Mehta to celebrate the orchestra's centennial on October 24, 2019.  Background and composition  The Los Angeles Philharmonic has performed under its last three principal conductors ‚Äì Zubin Mehta, Esa-Pekka Salonen, and Gustavo Dudamel ‚Äì for nearly three-fifths of its history. For its Centennial Birthday Celebration Concert & Gala, the organization commissioned Dan√≠el Bjarnason to compose a piece in which all three conductors would perform with the orchestra simultaneously. (Mehta claims that a piece for three conductors was his idea.) Dan√≠el said that From Space I Saw Earth is his third work to be inspired by the Apollo 11 moon landing and the Space Race, and that the title is also in reference to the overview effect. He has described the piece as \\"one piece of music which is running on parallel timelines that are constantly diverting, coming together and diverting again\\". The orchestra is divided into three groups, with one conductor leading each. For the most part, each group is intended to work independently; each of the conductors (along with their respective groups) performs at a slightly different tempo, and an element of indeterminacy is built into the piece. However, the conductors do sometimes realign with one another at fermatas in the music, after which one conductor cues the others to proceed. Because of this, the three groups are positioned in a triangle (two toward the back of the stage, and one at the front), so that the conductors can see one another. For the premiere, Dudamel's group, which was at the front of the stage, consisted of the orchestra's string section with one percussionist; Mehta and Salonen's groups, at the back of the stage, were each made up of a mix of woodwinds, brass, and percussion. At the end of the piece, musicians walk down the aisles playing crotales. At the premiere, this role was given to Youth Orchestra Los Angeles teachers and students.  Performance and recording  From Space I Saw Earth was premiered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic with Dudamel, Salonen, and Mehta at their Centennial Concert on October 24, 2019. On May 8, 2020, this concert was broadcast on an episode of PBS' series Great Performances. A live recording of the concert was also released on DVD by Naxos.

The book is a supplement book to the 5th edition Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook.  Contents  The book, narrated by the archmage Tasha, adds a variety of options for both players and Dungeon Masters: * 22 new character subclasses that previously appeared in the Unearthed Arcana public playtest, along with select reprints from previous books * Character options, including \\"new class features and new feats\\" and optional character origin customization with \\"rules for modifying a character‚Äôs racial traits\\" * Group patrons, a \\"'de-Eberroned' version of the Group Patron mechanic that originally appeared in Eberron: Rising From the Last War that allows for adventuring parties to begin a campaign with a shared origin story\\" * Spells, artifacts, and magic tattoos * Expanded rules options, which will include rules \\"for sidekicks, supernatural environments, natural hazards, and parleying with monsters, and [...] guidance on running a session zero\\" * Puzzles  Publication history  Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron of Everything is scheduled to be published on November 17, 2020 and will feature cover art by Magali Villeneuve. An alternate cover will be available only in local game stores with art by Wylie Beckert. ComicBook.com reported that the book would feature \\"in-character commentary from Tasha\\", as well as several new spells and magic items iconic of the character. In August 2020, it was widely reported that the book would include \\"a new way to create characters that‚Äôs fully customizable and in line with the game‚Äôs push for diversity and representation\\". Jeremy Crawford said that the options would \\"better reflect the story you have in mind for the characters\\". Much of the information in Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron of Everything was developed through the public ‚ÄúUnearthed Arcana‚Äù playtest ‚Äì of the playtest subclasses, Crawford said \\"almost every single one made it into the game\\". The book will also include a \\"de-Eberroned\\" version of the artificer class and its subclasses, and reprint several subclasses that were previously published in other supplements for specific campaign settings: the Order Domain Cleric and Circle of Spores Druid from Guildmasters‚Äô Guide to Ravnica, College of Eloquence Bard and Oath of Glory Paladin from Mythic Odysseys of Theros, and the Bladesinging Wizard from Sword Coast Adventurer‚Äôs Guide.  Reception  In August 2020, Corey Plante, for Inverse, wrote: \\"All things considered,Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron of Everything already feels like a must-buy as the most important D&D; book of 2020 that players will be reference for many years to come\\". Scott Baird, for Screen Rant, wrote: \\"The current edition of Dungeons & Dragons has seen a slower release of new titles, but the quality of their content is of a much higher grade than the older versions of the game. The fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons has slowly been expanding over the past six years, but Tasha's Cauldron of Everything might offer some of the biggest additions to the game since it was first launched\\". Jeffrey Parkin, for Polygon, wrote: \\"The most important and intriguing announcement about Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron is a new and extensive set of rules for character creation. Back in June, Wizards of the Coast announced that it was working on addressing the concept of race in D&D.; Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron offers an alternate set of character creation rules that will do just that. With these rules, your character‚Äôs race will no longer be tied to inherent stat boosts and abilities. While the character creation rules are still available in 2014‚Äôs Player‚Äôs Handbook for anyone who wants to use them, Tasha‚Äôs will decouple race and origin from their 5th edition mechanics\\". Jon Ryan, for IGN, wrote: \\"The most noteworthy item is probably the new 'lineage' options, which allow players to adjust the features and ability modifiers traditionally associated with a character's race or species. [...] This notion of divesting a character's stats from their species has long been a topic of discussion among the D&D; fanbase, and whether via discussions in forums or on social media, or feedback on previous Unearthed Arcana, it seems that much of the content in TCoE is a direct result of that type of player feedback\\". James Whitbrook, for Io9, wrote: \\"players are given the framework to throw all those mandated traits and benefits out the window and build their own benefits, regardless of the race they want to choose for their character. [...] It‚Äôs not just the first steps of character creation that Cauldron of Everything blows wide open‚Äîthe book supports more ways to customize the growth and development of your characters than anything 5th Edition has seen before. [...] This broadening of the abilities and ideals in character creation‚Äîthat have, so far, explicitly linked to racial stereotypes‚Äîis the first step in Wizards of the Coasts‚Äô recently revealed plans to address issues of race and inclusivity within Dungeons & Dragons\\". Whitbrook highlighted that \\"for Crawford, it‚Äôs not just about addressing previously longheld bias and privileges in races of the game‚Äîsuch as the negative stereotypes against Orcs and the aforementioned Drow, dark-skinned fantasy races that have been interpreted as the game‚Äôs take on minority characters in the past‚Äîbut also giving players the freedom to pick whatever race they want while creating a character that doesn‚Äôt feel like a specific exemplar of that race\\".

For the next two centuries it was the center of Kldekari Saeristavo. Unable to cope with the growing political power of the Liparitids, the Georgian royal government seized Kldekari Fortress several times. Berdzenishvili N. Issues of Georgian History vol. I Historical Geography. Georgian Academy of Sciences. Acad. Iv. Javakhishvili Institute of History. Tbilisi. 1964 Zakaria P., Old Towns and Castles of Georgia, Tbilisi, 1973.  History  Kldekari Fortress. View from Kldekari to Algeti Valley. Kldekari Natural Door The eristaves of Kldekar then become so strong that they even oppose the kings. The fighter for the unification of Georgia Bagrat III, who was patronized by David III Kuropalates, did not obey the eristavi of Kldekar Rati I. Bagrat did not want to go against a strong father. When David allowed Bagrat to act as he preferred, he launched an army but fighting Rati I in the Kldekari Fortress was not an easy task. The king chose to act by direct means of coming. He first moved from Trialeti to western Georgia, and when winter came, he suddenly stood on top of Rati with his whole army. Rati was not ready to meet, so he chose to surrender without a fight. He came out of the prison, took his son Liparit with him, and begged the king. The king captured the castle, while Rati went to Argveti, which was also his estate. View of Kldekari Fortress from above The battle between the king and the eristaves of Kldekar intensified especially in the late 1020s. He, with a transitional advantage, lasted for several decades. The owner of Kldekar Fortress, Eristavi Liparit Baghvashi IV was follower of Bagrat IV of Georgia until they ended up in feud ultimately decided in Battle of Sasireti. When in 1028 the Byzantine emperor Constantine VIII, in order to conquer Georgia, sent Commander Parakimanos to Georgia with large army threatening the fortress of Kldekar, Liparit IV of Kldekari fiercely resisted the enemy and forced Parakimanos to retreat. In the following years, a rift broke out between Liparit IV of Kldekari and Bagrat IV of Georgia. In the late 1050s, after decisive victory in Battle of Sasireti Liparit IV became the ruler of almost all of Eastern Georgia and supervised the upbringing of the prince, and crowned the minor George II of Georgia in Ruisi cathedral as King of Georgia. View of Kldekari from afar The domination of Liparit was disliked by other nobles. They intended to get rid of him. Sula Kalmakheli with the help of others captured Liparit and succeeded his son Ivan and the king. The overjoyed king greatly rewarded the rebellious slave invaders. Sula Lipari took away such strong forts as he was. Artanuji, Uplistsikhe, Birtvisi and Kvelistsikhe, but even the king's army could not take Kldekar. Only after the king promised the peasants that he would release Liparit and his son Ivan safely would the castle surrender. The king imprisoned his army, forced Liparit to become a monk, and left Ivan ruler of Argveti. In the following years Ivan recaptured Kldekar Castle. But it does not apparent under what conditions this return took place. In the 70s of the same century, the newly enthroned George II of Georgia was overthrown by noble officials, including Ivan Liparit's son Ts. The king subdued the rebels, but rewarded them instead of punishing them; In particular, he asked Ivan Samshvilde. Ivan could not be treated well and after that he ousted the king several times again. David the Builder reigned in the late 80's. According to his historian, \\"outside the prisons\\" the man was nowhere to be found and the buildings were destroyed. Many princes did not obey the king. Only Kldekar and its surrounding area, which occupied Liparit, were loyal to David this time. But this allegiance did not last long: 1094 In the year David captured Liparit and expelled him from Greece after two years in prison. Kldekari Saeristavo even canceled. Clearly, even the castle of Kldekar once lost its old strength. According to the same historian, at the beginning of the XII century Trialeti and Kldekari were occupied by the daughter of Chkondideli, someone named Tevdore. A very unpleasant fact was witnessed in the castle of Kldekar 1177: as it is known, George III rebelled against his nephew Demna of Georgia, who was supported by many nobles. The main stronghold among them was the Orbelians. If in the early days Libra leaned on the side of the conspirators, soon the situation changed - the king defeated them. The rebels were severely punished, and Demna herself was shot in the rock. In the following centuries, the Kldekari eristavi played a lesser role in the political life of Georgia, which is why their name is rarely found in the pages of chronicles. So, for example, when David Ulu, who returned to Georgia in the middle of the 13th century, learned that Torghva Pankeli had left him as the ruler of Kakheti, he called him several times. The frightened Torghva did not appear before the king. Then he swore an oath to Khornabujel and brought him. Tabakhmela, the torghva brought to the king's house, was betrayed by the guest Jikur, caught, sent to a cliff, and thrown from a rock there. In the late feudal era, the Kldekar Saeristavo no longer existed. That is why Kldekar itself is seldom if ever mentioned in historical sources.

Initially built to serve the Jewish community of East Paris, it specializes in Geriatrics, Physical therapy and Rehabilitation as well as several different aspects of Dentistry, notably Periodontology and Dental implants.  History  In the middle of the 19th century, James de Rothschild founded a hospital at 76 rue de Picpus which included a Hospice for the elderly. The hospital opened on May 25, 1852 and was initially opened to treat and welcome Jewish patients. On the initiative of Baron Edmond de Rothschild, the hospital received supplementary funds to build a new building on Rue Picpus. The building was completely reconstructed by architect Lucien Bechmann (1880-1968) between 1912 and 1914. The new Rothschild Hosptical, situated on Rue Santerre opened its doors in 1914, a few meters from the former hospital, which was turned into a home for the elderly. Declared a military auxiliary hospital during the First world war, it received wounded from the front and civilian victims regardless of their religious background. On June 15, 1918, the hospital was hit during a raid by German air forces. At the end of the war, the hospital returned to its role as a hospital for Jewish patients. During the German occupation of France in World War II, it was placed under the control of Nazi occupying forces and used as a detention center. The hospital was called a \\"mousetrap\\": Jewish women who gave birth at the hospital would be required to register and surrender their children to the Gestapo immediately after birth.A resistance network was organized with the help of medical personnel in the hospital. Many children were declared stillborn to prevent the Nazis of being aware of their existence.  Rothschild as a Public Hospital On January 1, 1954, after forty years of private management, the Rothschild family donated the hospital to the Paris public hospital system for the symbolic cost of one Franc. Since then, the hospital building been modfied a number of time, with older sections being replaced with more modern buildings. Between 2009 and 2011 new buildings were added that are accessible from the main entrance at Rue Santerre. Their specialty also shifted to Gerontology and Rehabilitation From its website, the hospital describes itself as: In 2013, an unused wing of the hospital served as the filming location for the film Hippocrate by Thomas Lilti.

History  The brigade was created on April 28, 1937 from the old Carod-Ferrer Column, made up of anarchist militiamen, and was integrated into the 25th Division. The first head of the unit was the militia major Victoriano Cast√°n Guill√©n, while Saturnino Carod Ler√≠n of the CNT was appointed as political commissioner. In June 1937 it took part in the Huesca Offensive, which ended in failure. A few months later it took part in the Battle of Belchite, participating in the capture of the town. On October 6, it withdrew from Belchite to the rear, settling in Caspe. During this period, the unit was reorganized. In December 1937 the 118th MB was sent to the Teruel Front, taking part in the capture of the city; it fought in the Old Cemetery and in the Hermitage of Santa B√°rbara, reaching the vicinity of the urban area. The old cemetery was occupied by the brigade on December 21, and two days later it took the Hermitage of Santa B√°rbara and the position of \\"El Mansueto.\\" On January 1, 1938, it managed to stop an enemy counteroffensive that threatened to break the republican siege on Teruel, although it suffered a high number of casualties. It still had the strength to go to reestablish the front threatened by the national troops who were trying to lift the siege, although the brigade came out of the fight very broken. In February 1938, it fought in the Battle of Alfambra as a reserve for the 217th Mixed Brigade, although both units withdrew. On March 3, 1938, it became part of the Levante Army reserve. After the beginning of the Aragon Offensive, it was sent to the Alca√±iz sector, although she withdrew in the face of enemy superiority. Around March 17, he was in Alcorisa, where it established its headquarters. Later it intervened in the Levante Offensive, slowly retreating through the Maestrazgo area until reaching the XYZ Line around July 21, 1938. The brigade remained on the Levante front until the end of the war, without intervening in relevant operations.

She created the blog Girl Gone Geek (2010-2016), which was devoted to \\"nerd culture\\" topics like cosplay, video games, and anime. Rowser founded Black Josei Press as a publishing platform for Black and Brown women comic writers, and published her first comic book, Wash Day, under the press in 2018.  Early life and education  Rowser's mother was in the Air Force, which required their family move around frequently. Rowser was born in England, and lived for short periods in several locales including the Netherlands, Germany, Hawaii, California, and New York. Her father was a teacher. She is Afro-Latina, and of Black, Dominican, and Puerto Rican descent. She received her bachelor's degree in communication from New York Institute of Technology, after which she moved to Boca Raton to be near her mother in 2016.  Career  Rowser created the blog Girl Gone Geek in 2010 to discuss her passions like video games, Star Wars, and Doctor Who, because she had few real life friends who were interested in them. She developed an international meetup group called Geek Girl Brunch with her friends Rachel and Yissel to create a space for women and non-binary people to connect about nerd culture. She also developed Straight Outta Gotham, a Tumblr that examines the intersection of hip hop and geek culture. She runs the site with Jemar Souza. Rowser created the publishing platform Black Josei Press to publish comics and merchandise by Black and Brown women creatives. She was inspired by josei manga to create the platform because she admires the scope of comics represented within this subtype of manga. In 2018 Rowser published her debut comic book, Wash Day, under Black Josei Press, the first from the company. The book was illustrated by Robyn Smith and follows a 26-year-old Kimana's Sunday morning hair washing routine. To fundraise for the book, Rowser created a Kickstarter campaign with a $5,000 goal that eventually exceeded $16,000 in donations by closing. That year she also published Wobbledy 3000, illustrated by Sabii Borno, a sci-fi comic about an extraterrestrial named Latoya who finds twerking difficult. In 2020, Rowser co-edited Sun and Sand, an anthology of ten comics by South Florida-based artists with Neil Brideau, who approached her to help develop the project to be released on Free Comic Book Day (May 2). She wrote a comic included in the collection, As Above, So Below.  Personal life  Rowser resides in Miami.

The genre work depicts the artist's sister Mitche eating oysters on her own at a well-appointed table replete with flowers, plates, wine and table linen. Although painted in an impressionist style Ensor himself disassociated himself from the French movement. Whilst in agreement with them that light and colour were more important than line, for him light in particular had an almost spiritual value. However the painting was refused by the Antwerp Salon of 1882, possibly because of the sexual overtones suggested by a single young woman eating oysters, then considered an aphrodisiac. In this respect the painting can be compared with Jan Steen's salacious The Oyster Eater of 1680. When also rejected by the alternative exhibitors l'Essor the following year, Ensor and his associates were provoked into establishing their own group, Les XX, to hold their own exhibitions of avant-garde works.

In 1938 the design was given an above-transom tiller and renamed the Fishers Island Sound Bull's Eye. It was also built at the Quincy Adams Yacht Yard, in Quincy, Massachusetts. In 1947 the rights were purchased by Cape Cod Shipbuilding and a new fiberglass version, called the Cape Cod Bull's Eye, was created by the original designer's son, Sidney Herreshoff. This model includes a cuddy cabin and a modern marconi rig with aluminum spars. While the deck and rigging has changed over the production run of more than 100 years, the hull design has remained the same. By 1994, 2,000 wooden boats had been built, plus 800 from fiberglass. The design remains in production. Design The Bull's Eye is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of wood and later of fiberglass, with teak wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig, a spooned raked stem , a raked transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel. Buoyancy tanks are installed in the bow and under the cockpit floor for safety. In post 1947 models a cuddy cabin is provided for stowage, in addition to the lazarette, which is accessed via a teak hatch. For sailing the design is equipped with a self-tending jib, or a genoa and may use a spinnaker. The boat has an factory option of a trailer that may be used for ground transportation. Operational history The design is supported by an active class club, the Bullseye Class Association and is raced in Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, as well as on the waters of Long Island Sound. In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood described the boat as, \\"a New England classic, designed stiff and heavy for the short, choppy seas of Buzzards Bay.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Herreshoff 12¬Ω ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Keelboats Category:1910s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Trailer sailers ","title":"Herreshoff Bull's Eye"},{"id":"65065623","text":"390px Self-Portrait is a c.1669 oil on canvas painting by Ferdinand Bol, now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam Catalogue entry - Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.

Early years Schulz entered non- commissioned officers' school in Potsdam in 1912. Wounded several times in World War I, he was promoted to Leutnant in the spring of 1918 because of bravery and outstanding performance. After the end of the war Schulz joined the Freikorps. He took part in the fighting in the Baltic States in a battalion commanded by Bruno Ernst Buchrucker. He became Buchrucker's adjutant in the Reichswehr and was promoted to Oberleutnant. Because of their support for the Kapp Putsch in March 1920, Schulz and Buchrucker both were discharged from the army. Black Reichswehr Schulz was reinstated by the Ministry of the Reichswehr under private contract as part of the so-called Black Reichswehr. This was a paramilitary organization in the Weimar Republic that was used to provide additional manpower reserves for the Reichswehr, in violation of the Versailles Treaty. Schulz was commissioned to set up a work detachment in K√ºstrin. At the end of 1922, Schulz moved to the Wehrkreis (Military District) III in Berlin, where he set up other work groups for the Black Reichswehr. During the K√ºstrin Putsch on 1 October 1923, Schulz was arrested but ultimately not charged. Schulz was next involved with the management of the \\"Feme Organization\\" in Prussia. In this capacity he planned and organized the murder of left-wing politicians and other alleged \\"enemies of the Reich\\" by members of the Black Reichswehr. Because of his involvement in these Feme murders, Schulz was given the nickname \\"Feme-Schulz\\". In March 1925 Schulz was arrested for inciting several murders. Brought to trial, he was sentenced to death on March 26, 1927. Just before his scheduled execution, Schulz's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by President Paul von Hindenburg in February 1928. To large parts of the German right wing he was considered a martyr. While in jail, Schulz was in contact with numerous right wing politicians, including Gregor Strasser of the Nazi Party. In May 1928, the 12 newly elected Nazi members of the Reichstag called for his release. A political amnesty was granted in October 1930 and Schulz obtained his freedom. He joined the Nazi Party on 24 October 1930 and was assigned to Strasser‚Äôs Organisationsabteilung (Organization Department) at Party headquarters in Munich. Nazi Party career Though not a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA), Schulz was temporarily appointed Acting SA Leader-East in April 1931. He was given the task of reorganizing the Berlin SA in the wake of the Stennes Revolt. Schulz brought the mutinous Berlin SA again under control of the party leadership and left the post at the end of May. Returning to Strasser‚Äôs organization, he was made head of the department (Arbeitsdienstpflichtamt) charged with setting up the Party‚Äôs prototype labor service system in October 1931. Schulz very soon established a warm personal friendship and solid working relationship with Strasser. With his numerous contacts in the army, civil service and industry, he often served as Strasser‚Äôs intermediary to influential people outside the Party, including General Kurt von Schleicher and Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning. In April 1932, Schulz was elected as a member of the Prussian Landtag. In the summer of 1932 Strasser initiated a series of organizational reforms to consolidate and centralize the Party structure by imposing an additional layer of supervision on the Gauleiters. Strasser sought to improve organizational control of the Party ahead of the upcoming election to the German Reichstag. On 15 June 1932 Schulz was appointed to the new position of Reichsinspekteur I, with oversight responsibility for five new Landesinspekteurs, each overseeing between one and five Gaue. Robert Ley was appointed Reichsinspekteur II, responsible for another five Landesinspekteurs. Thus, Schulz, in a relatively brief time, reached the highest levels in the Party hierarchy. However, his tenure proved to be short-lived. On 8 December 1932, Strasser resigned as Reichsorganisationsleiter in a major policy dispute with Hitler over the future direction of the Party. In seeking to eradicate Strasser‚Äôs legacy, Hitler decreed a thorough revocation of the recent administrative reforms. The positions of Landesinspekteur and Reichsinspekteur were abolished. Hitler temporarily assumed the duties of Reichsorganisationsleiter, with Ley as Chief of Staff. Schulz, closely associated with Strasser, followed him into retirement.  Night of the Long Knives and later life On 30 June 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives, Strasser was killed along with dozens of Hitler‚Äôs opponents. Schulz was arrested and taken to Gestapo headquarters. Then he was driven into the Grunewald Forest outside Potsdam near the village of Seddiner See where he was shot in the back. Schulz, seriously injured, fell to the ground and feigned death. When the assassins turned away to fetch a tarpaulin to remove of the body, Schulz fled into the forest and managed to escape. For the next few days he stayed with a friend who, acting as an intermediary, obtained a guarantee of protection from Hitler in exchange for Schulz leaving Germany. Schulz left for Switzerland on July 20, 1934 and lived there as a businessman. He later moved to Athens in 1935, and in 1940 to Budapest. After the war, Schulz returned to West Germany. He was active as an businessman and ultimately managed a construction machinery plant in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse. In 1963 he died in Laichingen.

Its neighbors include Mount Olympus, to the west, and Mount Mathias to the northwest. Aries is wedged between the Hoh Glacier and the Humes Glacier, and immediately northeast of Blizzard Pass. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into headwaters of the Queets and Hoh Rivers. This mountain was named by glaciologists Richard Hubley and Edward LaChapelle in 1955, in preparation for the International Geophysical Year. It is named for Aries in keeping with the Greek and Roman mythology naming theme surrounding Mount Olympus. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Aries is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

In the end, they decide upon a silent stranger who came to the village the day before. The old man agrees to lead them but remains entirely impassive, and they come to believe that he is so silent because he is pensive and extremely wise, and everybody finds in his silence and demeanour some proof of his excellent wisdom. Two hundred families set off the next day, and immediately encounter difficulties. The leader leads them directly into the fence, and then stops dead in his track and starts hitting it with his cane, without saying a word. Despite the children pointing out the door in the fence nearby, men follow the leader blindly, and break the fence down so that they could continue the journey on the leader's path. Similar obstacles follow, but they push on. Days pass, some children and old people die on the road, and all are exhausted and wounded but still hopeful that this difficult road will lead them into a better land. One day they reach a large ravine, and the leader walks straight on and falls in. Some people run away, but the majority follows the leader into the abyss. Survivors keep following the leader, who survives the fall intact, but the party slowly diminishes until just three other men remain alive after falling into a second ravine. Only then do they confront the leader, who is again unharmed, and find out that he had been born blind. The story ends in ominous cawing of the ravens above.‚ÄúRadoje Domanoviƒá‚Äù Project, Full text of ‚ÄúThe Leader‚Äù (English) Historical background The story was published in the opposition-leaning literary magazine ‚ÄúZvezda‚Äù (Star), whose chief editor was Janko Veselinoviƒá.Vuƒçenov, Dimitrije: Radoje Domanoviƒá: ≈Ωivot, doba i geneza dela (Rad, Belgrade 1959), p. 328‚Äì344 When he first became involved in politics, Radoje Domanoviƒá joined the People's Radical Party. The Party's program was initially inspired by French Radicalism and ideas of Svetozar Markoviƒá, and Nikola Pa≈°iƒá was elected as the president of the central committee at the Party's first conference. In September 1883, the Timok Rebellion broke out in eastern Serbia when King Milan Obrenoviƒá declared that peasants‚Äô arms should be confiscated by the army. He charged the Radicals that with their article in ‚ÄúSamouprava‚Äù, they had encouraged the peasants to refuse to give up their weapons. The rebellion was set down in ten days. Most of the party leadership was captured in the aftermath, apart from Pa≈°iƒá, who escaped to the Bulgaria and a few others. The r√©gime sentenced many of these Radicals to death, including the remainder of the leadership in absentia. However, after some time, amnesty was given to certain Radicals, including Pa≈°iƒá, who agreed to enter Obrenoviƒá's government in 1887. ƒêuro Kne≈æeviƒá, a member of the People's Radical Party attempted to assassinate ex-king Milan in 1899. Due to his political affiliation, many Party's leaders, again including Pa≈°iƒá, who was still at the Party's helm, were imprisoned. At the request of the court, Pa≈°iƒá agreed to publicly accuse his own party of anti-dynastical activities, and denounce other party members as traitors. Despite all this, he still remained the leader of the Radical Party until his death in 1926, and held a number of important political posts, including becoming prime minister of Serbia for five terms, and of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for two terms. The story, written in 1901, is intended primarily to satirize Pa≈°iƒá's infamous path to success, and the masses‚Äô relationship with him. The same way the leader in the story is silent and does not impose himself, Pa≈°iƒá was skilfull in remaining taciturn, he could always be seen on Party meetings, but hardly ever heard. The leader is oblivious of his own inadequacy, and agrees to lead the people knowing he is blind, and he is indifferent to the pain that his followers were submitted to, just as Pa≈°iƒá had avoided prosecution during Party's time of suffering. Radoje also gave the leader some of Pa≈°iƒá's physical characteristics, including his trademark long beard. Legacy Of all Domanoviƒá's satirical stories, ‚ÄúThe Leader‚Äù is the most homogenous allegorical story he has written, as it is not pieced together of different short anecdotes like some other of his famous stories (such as ‚ÄúStradija‚Äù or ‚ÄúDead Sea‚Äù). Although written with a particular person and sequence of events in mind, it has successfully abstracted and captured the universal themes of authority, leadership, herd mentality etc. making it one of Domanoviƒá's most successful and most reprinted stories. ‚ÄúThe Leader‚Äù is also the most translated Domanoviƒá's story. Until August 2020, it has been translated into 31 languages, 13 between the first publication in 1901 and 2019, and 18 more since 2019, for the ‚ÄúRadoje Domanovic‚Äù Project.‚ÄúRadoje Domanoviƒá‚Äù Project, List of Foreign Language Translations (Serbian) ReferencesExternal links * Full text of ‚ÄúThe Leader‚Äù in English Category:Satirical works Category:Serbian literature Category:1901 short stories Category:Fantasy short stories Category:Works by Serbian writers Category:Serbian fiction ","title":"The Leader (story)"},{"id":"65065759","text":"Guillaume Bosca (born 21 June 2000) is a French footballer who plays as a forward for Dunkerque.

It was initiated in 2004 but temporarily closed down after two years due to insufficient resources. It reopened and was formally established in 2009 with structural reforms and added an agenda of promoting an improved lifestyle for the local community in Kachuai.  Background  About 33 families, 200 residents at large, who live in the area of Kachuai are descendants of the workers of a deserted tea plantation. Some are born under the lower caste of Hindu religion and are commonly known as ‚ÄòDher‚Äô. The community is marginalized and are deprived of the common facilities like electricity and clean water. They face a difficult time earning a living, so the children of these families show little interest in education as they tend to other chores to support the families. In 2004, two young people named Rafiqul Islam and Wasim Uddin took up the initiative to help the isolated villagers by offering them an institutionalized education, and Swapnanagar started its journey with 6 pupils. However, the school was forced to shut down in 2006 because of the lack of funding but it reopened in 2009 as other community workers supported the project.  Campus  Swapnanagar Bidyaniketan is located near the hills of Kachuai, which is 45 km south of Chittagong. Patiya is a sub-district in Chittagong division of Bangladesh and Kachuai is a small village in the area which was also called ‚ÄúDherpara‚Äù or the ‚ÄúPatiya Cha Bagan‚Äù (Patiya Tea Garden). After the establishment of the school, the village gradually took the name Swapnanagar after the school. The school is built on a one-shed house made upon the space of the demolished tea factory. The students receive a participatory education through observing, searching through and playing with nature. They are provided with book storage space which is supposed to grow to be the school's library.  Academics  Swapnagar Bidyaniketon offered only primary education which is until the completion of Grade 5 or the PSC Examination in Bangladesh until recently. The school has initiated high school education too and currently has 115 primary level students, 35 high school goers with 10 academic staff. This made the school follow the policy of 'Active Learning' that focuses on instilling theoretical knowledge and life skills through practical applications, like clay molding, gardening, keeping tidy and cultural activities. Sawpnanagar is also motivating students to do classes by giving them an egg before the class, enticing which with education, they call it the ‚ÄúEggucation‚Äù. The school introduces students to social and cultural activities formally and plays an influential role in the community environment protection and development. This led to the school receiving an engagement from about 90% of the community and being the titular institution of the village.

His plays and films have received worldwide acclamation for his pursuit of the preservation of Yoruba culture and heritage. He also serves as a traveling lecturer in several institutions including at the department of African language and literature at the Obafemi Awolowo University and Black Studies at the San Francisco State University and at the Wajumbe Cultural Institution in California. Early life Elebuibon was born in 1947 in Osogbo to Ak√≠nr√¨nd√© √Äk√†nd√© ·∫∏l·∫πÃÅb√∫√¨b·ªçn (c. 1885 ‚Äì 1957) an Ifa priest and hunter, and ·π¢√≠juw·ªçy√° Abeje ·∫∏l·∫πÃÅb√∫√¨b·ªçn (n√©e Aw√≥n√≠y√¨). Elebuibon comes from a long line of hunters, priests, herbalists, and warriors. His father was claimed to be a descendant of the legendary warrior Olutimehin, one of the founders of the city of Osogbo. His mother was born into a family of priests who worshipped Oya and Ifa. The title \\"Araba\\" is given to the chief Ifa priest of Osogbo, and this title was held by his maternal grandfather, K·∫πÃÄh√¨nd√© Ad√©y·∫πmi Aw√≥n√≠y√¨, the longest serving Araba of Osogbo. His maternal grandmother was Oyawenu Awoniyi. The names of Elebuibon and his parents are clear in describing the origins and traditions of the family. Elebuibon's mother's name, Sijuwoya means \\"Open your eyes to see/worship Oya,\\" showing her parents worshipped Oya. \\"Elebuibon\\" originates from a nickname of his father's meaning \\"Owner of many guns,\\" showing that he was a hunter. Elebuibon's mother's maiden name Awoniyi means \\"The Oracle is valuable,\\" the oracle referring to the Ifa. Elebuibon's father was a polygamist who had 6 wives, and Elebuibon's mother was the youngest wife. His father had many children, but at the time many of them had died in infancy. This phenomenon is known in the Yoruba culture as abiku. Elebuibon's father and Elebuibon's maternal grandfather (Awoniyi) were close Ifa contemporaries and it was revealed that to solve this problem, Elebuibon's father would have to marry a female child of the Araba chieftancy family. This girl was Elebuibon's mother. However, when he married Sijuwoya, she still had the Abiku problem, and had 2 children who died in infancy. To figure out a problem with this, he consulted the Ifa and it was determined that she would have to use water and give offerings to the goddess Osun (in the river Osun). Soon later, she had her only surviving child, Elebuibon. The circumstances of his birth can be seen in the names Elebuibon was given. His first name Ifayemi means Ifa befits me and his other name Osundagbonu refers to the goddess Osun, who they believed gave them Elebuibon. Career Elebuibon began training as an Ifa priest by his father in 1951 when he was 4 years old. He continued this rigorous training in the tranditinal arts until his father died when he was only 10 in 1957. He was then put under the guidance of Chief Faniyi Ajani (the Agbongbon-Awo of Osogbo), another well trained Ifa priest who most likely was a contemporary of Elebuibon's father and grandfather. After training for another 10 years, he became an official Babalawo in 1967. He did not attend formal schooling but self-educated himself. He then became an actor for Duro Ladipo's famous plays including ·ªåba k√≤ so. He then became associated with the National Black Theatre, in which he currently serves a cultural advisor.

Her research considers printed electronic materials and their application in wearable devices.  Early life and education  Arias was born in Palo Alto, California. She studied physics at the Federal University of Paran√° in Brazil, where she earned her master's degree in 1997. Arias moved to the United Kingdom as a graduate student, where she worked in the research group of Richard Friend. Her doctoral research involved investigations into phase-separation within conjugated polymer thin films. Friend and Arias filed several patents on printed electronic devices and materials.  Research and career  Arias worked as a postdoc in the Optoelectronics group at the University of Cambridge, where she helped with the formation of the spin-off company Plastic Logic. At Plastic Logic Arias was responsible for the semiconductor group. Arias left Plastic Logic in 2003, and joined the research team at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). At PARC, Arias was responsible for flexible and printed electronics. She worked on the fabrication of wearable sensors, including devices capable of preventing brain injuries in the battlefield. These devices worked by wirelessly monitoring of pressure and acoustic levels. In 2011 Arias joined the University of California, Berkeley as a Professor of Flexible and Printed Electronics, where she serves as Faculty Director of the Berkeley Wireless Research Center. At Berkeley, she started to develop sensing systems that look track a patient's vital signs, and provide instant feedback to healthcare professionals. As part of these efforts, she created a wearable system for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning of babies. Conventional MRI systems make use of hard, bulky metal radio frequency coils to receive the MRI signals. The coils are heavier than the babies being scanned, which means that babies must be anaesthetised to obtain clear images. In an attempt to mitigate this, Arias created a flexible, lightweight radiofrequency coil that could be embedded within a swaddle blanket. The flexible MRI receivers entered clinical trials in 2016. Arias worked with Cambridge Display Technology to develop lightweight skin-like pulse oximeters. The oximeters make use of carbon-based (organic) semiconductors, which allow for the fabrication of low- cost electronic devices on flexible substrates. The sensor makes use of an array of red and near-infrared OLEDs and photodetectors to detect blood-oxygen levels. Beyond the measurement of blood oxygen, Arias has developed a multi- sensor platform capable of photoplethysmography and biomarker detection from human sweat. These sensing platforms allow insight into the physiological state of the human body. The sweat sensors developed by Arias comprise of lactate, sodium and ammonium sensors. Arias has also investigated materials and devices that can harvest and store energy.

The church is dedicated to the missionary St. Willibrord, often called the apostle of the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). Though the nave dates from the 13th to 15th centuries, the central tower was destroyed several times, most recently in World War II. The current tower's modern appearance dates from the 1950s. The church contains the painting The Good Samaritan by Jan Baptist Maes (1794-1856) from Ghent. The scenes of the Way of the Cross were painted by Jan Jozef Deloose (1769-1849) from Sint-Niklaas. The frames are by the Ghent sculptor P. Pauwels. thumb Exterior The first small Romanesque church building was erected around 1200 at the foot of a mote. In the first half of the 15th century it was replaced by a church in Gothic style, more precisely in Brabantine Gothic. The striking crossing tower was also built during that period. From 1462 the church was rebuilt to its current form under the supervision of the master builder Everaert Spoorwater. When a fire broke out during the works, the tower and the nave were completely reduced to ashes, as well as the newly built choir. Due to the death of Spoorwater, the works were only restarted on 3 May 1481, this time under the supervision of the Antwerp artchitect Herman de Waeghemazeker. He engaged Matthijs II Keldermans (from 1482 to 1484) for the construction of the main door. The construction of the church was completed by his great-nephew Laurens II Keldermans (ca.1534) and it was completed in 1535. The main entrance to the Basilica is located in the west facade on the Steenstraat side. At the top of this facade in a niche is a statue of Saint Willibrord with a gilded church tower in his hands. Unlike the choir church, the nave is not equipped with flying buttresses and buttresses. The bases for the flying buttresses are built of masonry. During the restoration of the 1930s, vaults were built under the original wooden ceiling in the nave. The lateral pressure that these exert on the masonry is absorbed by means of tension rods. Ledestone is a fairly soft limestone type that is easy to work, but has the disadvantage that it is highly susceptible to erosion. The spire is made of prestressed concrete from 1957. The bells are surrounded by tuning forks and at the top angels are turned towards the crucifix. Interior St. Willibrordus is built in the shape of a Latin cross. The building parts are grouped around the tower that is centrally located in the church typical of Flemish ecclesiastical architecture. The choir church has a choir aisle on the east end of the basilica from which eight rectangular side chapels and three polygonal radial chapels extend. These chapels were originally built for the craft guilds who worked in Hulst. To the left and right of the main altar are the conopeum (red-yellow parasol or umbrelino), the tintinnabulum (the bell), the insignia of a basilica. In the years 1841-1842 the interior of the Catholic choir section was completely painted. These paintings were removed in the early 1930s, among other things to create more uniformity within the church. The gold paint on the cabbage leaves of the capitals was found to be impossible to remove without risk of damage. The first chapel on the north side of the choir is used as a baptistery. The baptismal font is made of stone: the copper lid is decorated with a picture of John the Baptist. At the third chapel a door and an open pointed arch can be seen at the top. The door gives access to the former library in which the books belonging to the church were kept. In the period that St. Willibrordus was a simultaneous church for Catholics and Protestants from 1806 to 1929, the library served as a sacristy. In the middle radial chapel at the far east of the church is kept a medallion of Mary, which originally was in one of the bells. After the tower fire of 1876, this medallion was found in the melted chimes. World War II During the Second World War, the tower served as a military lookout for German troops stationed in the Netherlands. On the bell in the tower, soldiers inscribed '1940', 'Gott strafe England' and a swastika. Elsewhere in the attic of the church, German text with swastika were scrawled on walls. With the intention of disabling the German lookout post, during their advance through the east of Zeeuws- Vlaanderen the first regiment of the Polish Panzer Division shelled the church tower. About seventy shells hit their target and most of the tower burned on September 18, 1944. Hulst was liberated the following day. Basilica Coat of Arms of the church, displaying the ombrellino (umbrella) and tintinnabulum (bells) of a Basilica and the motto meaning \\"Happily in the name of God\\"The church was built as a Roman Catholic church, but became a Dutch Reformed Church during the Eighty Years' War at the hands of Frederik Hendrik. This remained so until the time of Napoleon, when it was turned into a simultaneous church: the choir was given to the Catholics and the nave remained available to the Protestants. A wall was built in between. The church has been completely Catholic again since 1929 when they bought the building from the Protestants who now have their own church on the Houtmarkt. As a result of this, Pope Pius XI elevated the church to a basilica on November 24, 1935. Spire The spire has been replaced several times. The first spire was destroyed in 1668 by lightning. In 1724 a new spire was installed in the classicist style. It was destroyed by fire in 1876. A new tower was then placed after a design by Pierre Cuypers, because the tower was a viewpoint over the Western Scheldt. It was destroyed in 1944 by Polish liberators. In 1957 Jan Brouwer won a competition for a new design of the spire, and Brouwer's design, entitled De Prediker (The Ecclesiastes), was built. The tower is crowned by a statue of Christ surrounded by angels and tuning forks around the bells. Parts of Cuypers' design, as well as the 14th-century tower, are still visible. The spire consists of eight freestanding outer columns and eight slightly shorter inner columns. The outer columns are about 14 meters high. A bundle of twelve steel wires runs from top to bottom. The inner columns are interconnected with bronze bridge bars from which the bells of the carillon are hung. Sculptor Willem Reijers made the concrete angel statues approximately eight meters high which crowns the tower together with a bronze cross. Carillon In 1670 Pieter Hemony, who was a bell-founder in Amsterdam at the time, supplied a chimes for the tower, which was to be destroyed by fire in 1876. Space had been reserved for a carillon in Pierre Cuypers' tower, but it never happened to install a new carillon in this tower. After the Second World War, a new carillon was purchased which was cast in 1958 by Petit & Fritsen. It consists of 36 bells with the size: A1 (470 kg) -b1-chromatic-a4 Connected to the keyboard as C2-d2-chrom.-c5. Organ The organ from the Basilica of Saint Willibrord was built in the years 1610-1612 by the French- Flemish organ builder Loys Isor√©. Isor√© worked in Antwerp at the time. He built a single manual instrument with 13 voices and a 'short octave' for the main church. In 1685 the Flemish Frederik Noblo carried out extensive repairs to the wind supply, pipework and mechanics. In the course of the eighteenth century, repairs were carried out by the Antwerp organ builder Moreau. Painter Johan Baltisberger renovated the paintings on the organ shutters. A plan to expand the organ with a rugwerk was not implemented.Organ in the west of the Basilica In 1764, Louis Delhaye from Antwerp was commissioned to make new wind chests and to place most of the old pipes on them, supplemented with the new registers Prestant 8 'and Sesquialter. There also had to be a third in the Cornet. A radical change awaited from 1929. Then the organ's pipes, mechanics and bellows were merged with a smaller, similar organ used in the choir church. On a wind chest from Cavaill√©-Coll (bought in 1874) above the sacristy, the two organs were brought together to form an electropneumatic instrument. Under the leadership of adviser Hans van der Harst, the organ was restored and reconstructed in 1970/71 by the company Flentrop (Zaandam). She expanded the organ with a breastwork and free pedal. The Cavaill√©-Coll wind chest was removed and moved to Haarlem. Of the 14 original registers, 11 could be wholly or partially preserved. In the breastwork (Positief) old Flemish pipes could be used in the Doublette 2 '. The result of this restoration and new construction is an organ of a completely southern character. In 1989 the organ was overhauled again with a cleaning and re-intonation. The Regaal 16 'was converted into an 8-foot register. This latest restoration has contributed to the organ being further expanded and the authenticity of the sound to come into its own even better. In 2012 Flentrop Orgelbouw started implementing a five-year maintenance plan. Repair work, re-intonation and cleaning of greenhouses and pipework were on the program. Today the organ is an artistic showpiece of the French-Flemish organ building style in the Netherlands. Restoration The basilica was restored between 1996 and 1999. The planning for this started in 1987. Six and a half tons of natural stone was impregnated with concrete and old Balegem sandstone replaced by natural stone from the Czech Republic (trachyte). Over 3000 m¬≤ of new slates were placed on the roof, new pinnacles and all stained-glass windows were renewed. In total, the restorers used more than 10,000 kg of lead.

The rare two-way player, Noguchi was particularly unusual in that he excelled in the specialized positions of both pitcher and catcher. A four-time All-Star and a two-time Best Nine Award-winner, Noguchi was the eldest of four brothers who played professional baseball in Japan.  Biography  Born in Nagoya, Aichi, Noguchi attended Chukyo Shogyo High School and Meiji University.  Senators/Taiy≈ç/Nishitetsu  Noguchi began his professional career in 1936 with the Japanese Baseball League (JBL), as an 18-year-old with the Tokyo Senators.Garland, Gary. \\"Akira Noguchi,\\" BR Bullpen.

(The 1936 and 1937 JBL seasons were split into spring and fall half-seasons.) His 1937 totals led the league in games pitched and innings; he started nearly 70% of his team's games, and his 34 wins represented 68% of the Senators combined victories for the year. Noguchi wore uniform number 18 for the Senators, starting a trend where ace pitchers wore that number. Other notable Japanese pitchers who have worn number 18 since Akira Noguchi (even carrying the tradition over to Major League Baseball) include Tsuneo Horiuchi, Masumi Kuwata, Yu Darvish, Daisuke Matsuzaka, and Tsuyoshi Wada.Mike. What‚Äôs In A Number?,\\" River Ave Blues (February 21, 2012). After excelling as a pitcher in 1936‚Äì1937, Noguchi left professional baseball for four seasons, during which his younger brother Jir≈ç Noguchi took his place as the team's star pitcher. (Two other Noguchi brothers briefly played in the JBL: Noboru [b. 1922, d. 1945] with the Hanshin Baseball Club,\\"Noboro Noguchi,\\" BR Bullpen.

Akira returned to the team in 1942‚Äì1943, joining Jir≈ç. After his hiatus from baseball, Akira mostly left pitching behind, concentrating on hitting, initially as a first baseman and then in later years as a catcher. Altogether, Noguchi played four seasons with the Senators franchise, which, due to various pressures and changing ownership went through a number of name changes during his tenure: Tokyo Senators (1936‚Äì1937), Taiy≈ç (1942), and finally Nishitetsu (1943).  Hankyu  Noguchi moved to the Hankyu Baseball Club in 1944, returning to the team (which soon became known as the Hankyu Braves) after World War II. There he was joined by Jir≈ç, where the two brothers were teammates for three more seasons (making it five in all). As a member of the Braves in 1947, Akira became the first person in Japanese pro baseball to hit an inside-the-park grand slam.  Dragons  Leaving the Braves after the 1948 season, Akira joined the Chunichi Dragons, the franchise where he would have his greatest success, as a catcher. He played for the Dragons from 1949 to 1955, making four All-Star teams and being named to the Best Nine at catcher twice. His best year was 1950, when he hit .271 with a career-best 18 home runs and 73 RBI. Immediately after his playing career ended, Noguchi was hired by Dragons as the team's manager. He guided the team to winning records in 1955 and 1956, and then retired from baseball.  Death  Noguchi died on October 5, 1996, at age 79.

Her first husband was William David Stein; they married in 1903 in Melbourne, and he died at sea in 1904, the same year their son, William David Kingsland Stein was born. Her second husband was fellow performer Daun H. Seaton; they married and divorced in 1908. Her third husband was Percival H. Chrystie, a steel executive and banker in New Jersey; they married in 1913 and he died by suicide in 1932. In 1934 Kingsland was on a cruise in the Mediterranean when she was robbed by \\"bandits\\" near Jerusalem. Her son died in 1951, and she died in 1955, aged 73 years, in San Francisco.

The beach runs from Beach 9th Street in Far Rockaway to Beach 149th Street in Neponsit, a distance of . The boardwalk, a concrete deck, runs from Beach 9th Street to Beach 126th Street in Rockaway Park, at the edge of Belle Harbor. There are also numerous recreational facilities within the park, parallel to the beach and boardwalk. The beach became a popular resort area in the late 19th century, and several unconnected sections of the boardwalk were constructed by the end of the century. The first section of city-owned boardwalk between Beach 109th and 126th Street was completed in 1923, and the city announced plans for a massive boardwalk two years later, stretching across most of the Rockaway peninsula's southern shore. The city government completed the sections between Beach 19th and 109th Streets in three phases between 1928 and 1930. The concrete boardwalk from Beach 9th Street to Beach 19th Street was completed in 1963. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the boardwalk in 2012, it was rebuilt in several phases through 2017. The park has been maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation since 1938. It is policed by the New York City Parks Enforcement Patrol. Description View of the beach north of the boardwalk The Rockaway Beach and Boardwalk, operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), run parallel on the Rockaway peninsula from Beach 9th Street in the east, within Far Rockaway, to Beach 126th Street in the west, within Rockaway Park. The beach and boardwalk are parallel to Beach Front Road from Beach 59th to Beach 73rd Street, and are parallel to Shore Front Parkway from Beach 73rd to Beach 108th Street. The beach continues west to Beach 149th Street in Neponsit, where it connects with the beach at Jacob Riis Park. The boardwalk is long while the beaches cover an area of over . The New York Times stated in 1971 that the Rockaway Boardwalk was the second-longest in North America, after the Atlantic City Boardwalk. The beach and boardwalk run adjacent to a variety of neighborhoods, including public housing on the Beach 50- and 60-numbered streets in Edgemere and Arverne, and high-rise developments on the Beach 100-numbered streets in Rockaway Beach. Some sections of the boardwalk, such as the sections in Edgemere and Arverne, are next to mostly uncrowded beaches. Other sections, such as the segment in Rockaway Beach, include recreational facilities and bathroom facilities and tend to be crowded. The bus runs close by for almost the entire route of the beach. The western part of the beach is also served by the bus, while the central part is also served by the buses. The Rockaway Beach and Boardwalk is also largely within walking distance to several stations on the New York City Subway's IND Rockaway Line. The central section of the park is served by the between the and stations, while the eastern section is served by the between the and stations.  Boardwalk  The planks were originally made of several different woods such as \\"Angelique, teak, pine, ipe, Cumaru and greenheart\\". However, most of the wooden boardwalk was destroyed during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The wooden boardwalk was ultimately entirely replaced with concrete. When originally planned, the boardwalk was to extend almost from Beach 9th to Beach 169th Streets, connecting with the boardwalk in Jacob Riis Park. The boardwalk was intended to be wide and an average of above the beach. More than 12,000 yellow-pine deep foundations were to be used for the boardwalk, and more than of yellow pine planks were to be used for the bulkheads. As built, the boardwalk was supported by about 1,306 concrete \\"bents\\", supported by three or four wooden piles and spaced at intervals of about . The present boardwalk, made largely of concrete, is supported on piles spaced apart and driven up to underground. A pair of piles support a concrete foundation or \\"bent\\". The concrete slabs of the boardwalk surface are secured to their foundations. A sand-retaining wall under the boardwalk is designed to prevent sand from drifting away from the beach. Most of the boardwalk is wide, and largely follows the path of the original boardwalk, with minor modifications to straighten out its route. \\"Bump-outs\\", which add between of width to the boardwalk, are installed at areas where there are stairs and ramps, as well as at areas with amenities such as benches. The present modular benches reused wood from the old boardwalk.  Beach  Beachfront in the Rockaway Beach neighborhood The beach was built with an average width of , using of sand. Parts of the beach in Arverne and Edgemere were filled to a width of up to due to strong currents in that area. To protect beach erosion, jetties were constructed at , extending from the boardwalk to the ocean. From 1977 to 2004, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) undertook a beach nourishment project between Beach 19th and 149th Streets, replenishing a wide strip of the beach. Ecologically, the beach contains maritime beach and maritime dunes communities, with vegetation present along the length of the beach. Rockaway Beach is the only one of New York City's beaches that sees significant surf, and all of the beach are patrolled. In 2005, The New York Times reported that of 1,000 lifeguards hired for the city's beaches, 500 of them worked on Rockaway Beach. The beaches are generally most utilized from Memorial Day in May to Labor Day in September. The city's only legal surfing beaches are also along Rockaway Beach, between Beach 67th and 69th Streets and between Beach 87th and 92nd Streets. On the section between Beach 126th and 149th Streets, which does not have frontage on the boardwalk, the beach is accessed by stairs or ADA-accessible ramps at the ends of these streets. Along that section, baffle walls are installed to prevent sand migration. The segment between Beach 9th and 20th Streets has five areas where paths extend south of the boardwalk and cross the beach's dunes to the shoreline.  Park facilities  There are several recreational facilities along the beach and boardwalk, including basketball and handball courts, a roller-hockey rink, skateparks, and playgrounds. In addition, there are food concessions at Beach 17th, 86th, 97th, and 106th Streets. \\"Comfort stations\\", or restrooms, also exist at Beach 9th, 17th, 32nd, 60th, 86th, 97th, 106th, and 115th Streets. The section of the park within Far Rockaway contains three sets of recreational facilities. O'Donohue Park, near Beach 9th Street at the eastern end of the Rockaway Beach and Boardwalk, contains a playground, ten handball courts, three basketball courts, and restrooms, as well as the Far Rockaway Skate Park. Near Beach 17th Street is another playground, as well as a baseball field. The next recreational facilities are between Beach 27th and 32nd Streets, which contain the Beach 30th Street Playground and a football field. In Arverne, there is a playground and handball facilities at Beach 59th Street. Another playground, as well as one basketball and eight handball courts, are on the boardwalk's south side from Beach 74th to 77th Street. Within Hammels, there are eight handball and two basketball courts west of Beach 81st Street, and two playgrounds at Beach 84th Street. In the neighborhood of Rockaway Beach is the Rockaway Beach Skate Park at Beach 91st Street. There is an ice hockey rink at Beach 109th Street. A gray-and- aquamarine stucco sculpture called \\"Whaleamena\\", formerly of the Central Park Children's Zoo, is situated at the Beach 95th Street entrance to the park. A seal sculpture, also from Central Park, is also located on the boardwalk. On Shore Front Drive, there are a series of decorative bus shelters designed for the 1939 New York World's Fair. The shelters contain aquatic-themed murals designed by Esther A. Grillo and installed in 1997. At Beach 116th Street, there is also a memorial to the victims of American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed into the Rockaway peninsula in 2001 and killed 265 people. The memorial, designed by Dominican artist Freddy Rodr√≠guez and Situ Studio, was completed in 2006. It consists of a wall, inscribed with the victims' names, with windows and a doorway looking toward the nearby Atlantic Ocean and angled toward the Dominican Republic, the origin country of many crash victims. Atop the memorial is a quotation, in both Spanish and English, from Dominican poet Pedro Mir, reading \\"\\" (which translates to \\"Afterwards I want nothing more than peace.\\") History The Rockaway peninsula became a popular area for seaside hotels starting in the 1830s, with the first resort being founded at Far Rockaway in 1835. Many resorts were situated on Rockaway Beach along the southern side of the peninsula. The peninsula's popularity grew in the 1880s with the construction of the Long Island Rail Road's Rockaway Beach Branch to Long Island City and Flatbush Terminal (now Atlantic Terminal), which facilitated population growth. Predecessors Rockaway Boardwalk, 1903 Several unconnected sections of boardwalk were built along the beach in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mostly clustered around resorts. These included a stretch in Arverne to the east, a stretch in Rockaway Park to the west, and shorter sections in Hammels and Hollands (now Rockaway Park) in the center. The peninsula became part of the City of Greater New York in the late 1890s. Amusement parks also opened along the beach, such as Rockaways' Playland in the first decade of the 20th century. The initial boardwalk in Arverne was built in 1886, above the beach. A new boardwalk, stretching about , was built to the south in 1900‚Äì1901. Family houses, a hotel, and an 800-seat theater were built around the Arverne boardwalk, although it was often damaged by hurricanes and high tides. Each property owner on the boardwalk was to be charged $1 for each bedroom in their property, although several owners and tenants initially refused to pay the tax. A separate boardwalk was built in the communities of Hollands and Seaside in 1893. That boardwalk had been built after the resorts in these communities were wrecked in a 1892 fire. The boardwalk contained several theaters, hotels, and roller coasters. Yet another boardwalk, located at Rockaway Park, was also overlooked by resorts.  Expanded beach and boardwalk  Planning and first section = By the 1910s, the Arverne Boardwalk Committee and the Arverne Hotel Owners' Association were advocating for the construction of a boardwalk from Beach 58th or 59th Street to Beach 109th Street. The Edgemere Taxpayers' Association supported building a boardwalk both westward to Beach 109th Street and eastward to Beach 24th Street. Residents of Rockaway Park wanted a boardwalk as well, connecting Jacob Riis Park at Beach 148th Street to Edgemere. Several groups collaborated to acquire land on the waterfront, and by 1923, the civic groups had acquired almost all waterfront land in Arverne between Beach 59th and 75th Streets. The city planned an \\"experimental boardwalk\\" between these streets, following the model of the Riegelmann Boardwalk at Coney Island. Queens borough engineers considered three options: a boardwalk without a road, as well as one with a wide parkway and a narrow parkway. The city government also sent engineers around the world to look at other boardwalks' designs, as it intended to build the world's longest boardwalk along the Rockaway shore. The city government had started constructing a concrete boardwalk on city- owned land in Rockaway Park, between Beach 109th and 126th Streets, by 1922. The boardwalk in Rockaway Park, which opened in May 1923, was wide and long, and cost $133,000. It was placed under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks. The residents of Neponsit and Belle Harbor, between Beach 126th and 149th Streets, also sought a boardwalk. However, the city did not own the shoreline in these two neighborhoods, precluding the city from adding a boardwalk in these neighborhoods unless the residents were willing to pay taxes for a boardwalk extension to their communities. By early 1923, the city had passed resolutions to acquire title to the shore between Beach 59th and 75th Streets in Arverne, and between Beach 126th and 149th Streets in Neponsit and Belle Harbor. It was also in the process of acquiring title between Beach 25th and 59th Streets in Edgemere and Far Rockaway, and between Beach 75th and 109th Streets in Hammels, Hollands, and Seaside. The New York City Board of Estimate appropriated $8 million for a beach improvement project on the Rockaway peninsula in June 1925. The Queens borough president's office started soliciting bids to build \\"bulkheads, groynes, jetties and breakwaters\\" and to add sand to the southern shore of the Rockaway peninsula between Beach 59th and 109th Streets. The Gahagen Realty Company submitted a low bid and received a $1.26 million contract for the work. The boardwalk was slated to be completed within three years, in anticipation of an increase in Rockaway-bound traffic created by the completion of Cross Bay Boulevard. The expanded beach would be city property once the project was completed. Actual work on the boardwalk would occur after the shore-improvement projects were finished. However, work was delayed for a year because of a lack of money. By June 1926, the city had approved $1 million for the project and was speeding up plans to construct the section of boardwalk between Beach 59th and 109th Streets. = Connections between sections = The western end of Rockaway Beach, (pictured near Neponsit Beach Hospital) does not have a boardwalk. The Board of Estimate appropriated $500,000 for the first connecting section of the boardwalk between Beach 91st and 109th Streets in mid-1927. That August, contractor Muccini & Decker reported that between 30 and 40 buildings in the boardwalk's path would have to be condemned and demolished. The contractor subsequently stated that work would progress even as the buildings were to be razed. The existing boardwalk at Hollands and Seaside, between Beach 90th and 100th Street, would be removed and replaced. Work began in September 1927, although the first pile was driven that November. By then, some $4 million had already been spent for shore protection and beach widening. The first section was dedicated in June 1928, although the portion east of Beach 102nd Street was opened to the public first, while the section west of that street opened in July 1928, except for a small gap at Beach 109th Street. With the opening of this boardwalk section, real estate demand along the shore increased in 1928, while existing resort owners started planning amusement attractions. More than $1.5 million was invested in constructing hotels, apartment buildings, and bathing pavilions. Funding for the third section of the boardwalk, between Beach 56th and 21st Streets, was requested in September 1928, just as work on the second section of the boardwalk between Beach 75th and 56th Streets was to commence. The second section was to cost $467,000. Queens borough president George U. Harvey formally opened the boardwalk's second section in June 1929. Work on the third section began in late 1929, although the ceremonial first pile was not driven until January 1930. The third section was built by D. M. W. Construction at a cost of $610,000. The contractor reported in April 1930 that it was ahead of schedule, and would likely have the third section open by the end of the following month. Delays in securing the wooden decking for the boardwalk pushed the opening back by several months. There were also delays caused by the need to remove rock in the boardwalk's path. The third section was finally opened in September 1930, four months after the contractors had initially projected. At the time, the Queens borough president's office operated the portion of the boardwalk east of Beach 105th Street, while NYC Parks operated the section to the west. A temporary ramp connected to Beach 19th Street. While construction was ongoing, there were disputes over the compensation that the city was scheduled to pay property owners. In September 1930, New York City Comptroller Charles W. Berry objected to the $12.5 million proposed compensation, saying that the land was assessed as being worth only one tenth as much. The city suspended compensation payments for the property that November. Ultimately, the compensation payments were lowered to $9.2 million, as decided by the New York Supreme Court in June 1931. The fourth section of the boardwalk, east of Beach 21st Street, was delayed because tidal conditions would prevent the city from building a boardwalk east of Beach 14th Street without having to acquire significant space inland. City authorities considered ending the boardwalk at Beach 14th Street instead, but property owners in Far Rockaway refused, stating that they were entitled to benefit from the boardwalk since they had paid taxes for the boardwalk. Harvey also wished to delay the construction of the fourth section because of the then- ongoing litigation over the property compensation. Finally, the section of beach between Beach 16th and 20th Streets was the privately owned Roche's Beach; the owners opposed the construction of the boardwalk and successfully lobbied to stop it. The westernmost section was not built either, because the president of the real estate board covering Rockaway Park, Neponsit, and Belle Harbor did not wish to start construction until the Far Rockaway section was built.  Modifications  1930s through 1950s = The extended boardwalk experienced several major fires after its completion, including during 1931 and 1937. In 1938, the responsibility of maintaining the boardwalk, and the beach between Beach 9th and 149th Streets, was transferred to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks). This jurisdiction extended to the beach at Jacob Riis Park, which was operated by NYC Parks until 1974. Parks commissioner Robert Moses had previously criticized the condition of the Coney Island, Rockaway, and South Beach boardwalks, saying, \\"These beaches and boardwalks were never properly planned, and cannot under present conditions be properly maintained and operated.\\" To improve the condition of the Rockaway Beach and Boardwalk, Moses cleared a strip of land north of the boardwalk for Shore Front Parkway, which opened in 1939. Moses demolished more than 700 buildings in the parkway's path and destroyed what he described as \\"catch-penny enterprises\\" along the boardwalk, replacing them with recreational fields. The beach was also extended toward the sea. By 1941, jukeboxes were banned from the boardwalk, as was bicycling during the summer. Four municipal parking lots at Beach 32nd, 52nd, 64th, and 69th Streets were opened within the park in 1948. During that time, the boardwalk between Beach 73rd and 85th Streets, and east of Beach 33rd Street, was reconstructed for $200,000. Moses announced the construction of another three parking lots in the park in 1950, at Beach 55th‚Äì59th, 62nd‚Äì63rd, and 67th‚Äì68th Streets, as well as landscaping along the boardwalk. These seven parking lots were intended to serve as children's play areas outside of the summer season, and Moses rejected attempts to install parking meters in these parking lots. During the mid-20th century, Rockaway Beach was seen as one of the best surfing places in the New York metropolitan area. In the 1950s, the beach employed a lifeguard force of 258, among the world's largest. The beach suffered from considerable erosion, despite the presence of 115 jetties along the beach. The erosion had caused of beach to wash away between 1947 and 1955. The New York State Department of Public Works commenced a multi-year project in 1955 to combat this erosion, including adding forty groins and transferring of fill onto the beach to create a barrier. By 1959, Moses had extended the beach eastward to Beach 9th Street, and commenced work for O'Donohue Park alongside the new stretch of beach, which opened in 1961. Part of the boardwalk in Arverne was burned down in 1960 and was subsequently rebuilt. As part of the construction of O'Donohue Park, a section of concrete boardwalk from Beach 9th to 19th Street was built in the early 1960s. This section was constructed with a budget of $1.373 million. = 1970s through 2000s = The wooden boardwalk, seen in 2008 Repairs costing $115,000 were made to the boardwalk in the late 1960s or early 1970s. However, by 1971, NYC Parks was considering replacing the wooden planks with plastic or concrete due to the high maintenance cost of the wooden planks, which were deteriorating. The central Rockaways were in decline at the time, and fewer concessions were operating on the boardwalk every year. Further, because of erosion of the beach, water would go under the boardwalk at high tide, and some stairs from the boardwalk led to steep drop-offs where the beach formerly was. Thirteen blocks of the beach had eroded away by 1973, forcing the closure of parts of the beach in the Edgemere and Rockaway Beach neighborhoods, and the boardwalk had become dilapidated. To remedy this issue, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) started preparing a hurricane-protection and water- purification project for the Rockaways. A plank replacement project, commenced in 1975, was stopped later that year due to the city's 1975 fiscal crisis. Work on the plank replacement restarted in 1977 as part of a $19 million investment in parks citywide. During the late 20th century, the boardwalk also became known for crimes such as wild dog attacks. A large segment in Edgemere and Arverne abutted vacant lots, which were still extant during the 2010s. The last of the amusements that once occupied the boardwalk, Rockaways' Playland, closed in 1987. However, the New York Daily News reported in 1980 that Rockaway Beach was cleaner than Coney Island's beach, in part because of large cleaning crews and because of the park's proximity to the Edgemere Landfill. The Far Rockaway section of the boardwalk was renamed in honor of local resident Helen Leonescu in 1983. USACE refilled the beach every two years between 1980 and 1988. The beach further eroded following the December 1992 nor'easter, although the boardwalk remained relatively intact. Because of this erosion, the section of the park between Beach 26th and 36th Streets was closed to the public for at least three years. USACE subsequently refilled the beach between 1995 and 2004. The boardwalk was renovated during the 1990s with the construction of new play structures between Beach 82nd and 86th Streets, repairs to the boardwalk, installation of spray showers and drinking fountains, and restoration of the bus shelters beside the boardwalk. That boardwalk section reopened in 1999 for the first time in 25 years. Workers also rebuilt the section between Beach 109th and 116th Streets in 1999 at a cost of $600,000. The first surfing beaches in the city opened along Rockaway Beach, at Beach 90th Street in 2005 and at Beach 67th Street in 2007. There was little commerce along the park's path by the first decade of the 21st century, and its route was characterized mainly by residential buildings and open space. =21st century reconstruction= Demolished boardwalk after Hurricane Sandy A feasibility study of storm protections along the beach was ordered in 2003, but there was not enough money to conduct such a study. The boardwalk was damaged in August 2011 during Hurricane Irene. As a result, NYC Parks conducted a $3.8 million rebuilding project for the summer 2012 season. On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the Rockaway Boardwalk. The most impacted parts of the boardwalk were between Beach 80th and 106th Streets, where some planks were tossed into nearby houses. In the aftermath of the hurricane, several entities disagreed over how the wood should be reused. Michael Bloomberg, the New York City mayor at the time, announced in December 2012 that the boardwalk would be rebuilt in concrete rather than wood. Four of the concrete sections that had been rebuilt before the hurricane had suffered relatively little damage compared to the wooden sections, which were almost completely destroyed. The wooden boardwalk between Beach 9th and 60th Streets, a stretch, was also relatively undamaged, except for a four-block gap between Beach 35th and 39th Streets. The beach was also depleted, although many Rockaways residents had stated that, for several years before Hurricane Sandy, the beach had been eroding slowly. Sand from the beach had landed on people's yards and on nearby streets, while personal property had been tossed onto the shore. Despite the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, the city promised to open all its public beaches by Memorial Day in May 2013, including Rockaway Beach, where temporary beach access points were set up. The city restored some of the sand and added snow fence to prevent the sand from blowing back out. New modular comfort stations and lifeguard booths were also installed along the length of the park starting in 2013. By that September, the city estimated that a reconstruction of the beach and boardwalk would cost $200 million. The rebuilding, overseen by CH2M Hill, would entail the replacement of the entire boardwalk as well as the addition of of railings. The boardwalk project, to cost $274 million, was divided into five phases from west to east, the first of which was to begin in early 2014. The section between Beach 35th and 39th Streets was initially rebuilt in wood to match the undamaged portions on either side, but ultimately, the entire boardwalk was to be permanently rebuilt in concrete. Many sections of the boardwalk would be raised to an elevation above 100-year flood levels, requiring the reconstruction of the relatively undamaged sections as well. Skanska was hired as the major contractor for the boardwalk project. Construction was funded by a $480 million grant that the Federal Emergency Management Agency distributed to New York City's government in 2015. The start of work on the boardwalk's reconstruction was delayed because of several factors. The 2013 United States federal government shutdown delayed the allocation of funding, and plans also had to be revised to accommodate new flood-proofing features. The corroded foundations also had to be replaced, and construction had to take place outside of the mating season of the piping plover, an endangered species that nested on the beach between April and September. In February 2014, a contractor started adding of sand as an anti-erosion measure, enough to raise the beach by . Simultaneously, a controversy arose around the comfort stations; though some of the modules had not been installed yet, several modules were visibly rusting. The first rebuilt section between Beach 86th and 97th Streets opened in May 2015. The entire length of the boardwalk reopened in July 2016. The rebuilding of the boardwalk was finished in May 2017, with the completion of the final section between Beach 19th and 39th Streets. The next year, the reconstruction received the American Planning Association's National Planning Achievement Award for Urban Design. Some of the sand from the beach had already eroded by 2017, and the USACE had secured $400 million for further beach improvements, part of a $4 billion project to flood-proof the Rockaways. The city conducted a study in November 2017, finding that despite the erosion, the beach was wider than at almost any other time in the previous century. Despite this, the beach between Beach 91st and 102nd Streets was temporarily closed at the start of the summer season in May 2018, with reopening not expected for several years. A small portion between Beach 96th and 98th Streets was reopened the next month. The Rockaway Beach Skate Park along the boardwalk, which was severely damaged in Hurricane Sandy, reopened in August 2020 after several years of delays surrounding the skate park's reconstruction.  Cultural impact  The park was the inspiration for the Ramones' 1977 song \\"Rockaway Beach\\". The song, on their 1977 album Rocket to Russia, became the American punk rock group's highest-charting single, peaking at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. Written in the surf rock style of the Beach Boys and other similar bands, the song was composed by the group's bassist, Dee Dee Ramone, who liked to spend time on the beach. In June 2013, the song was used in a radio ad campaign sponsored by Queens Economic Development Corporation to promote recovery from Hurricane Sandy by drawing New Yorkers back to Rockaway Beach.

Bullock was born in California in 1905 and attended Harvard University, graduating in 1927 with a degree in Architecture. His first major restoration project was helping to restore Colonial Williamsburg beginning in 1929, specifically the Benjamin Waller House which had been owned by a prominent lawyer and ancestor of President John Tyler. By the 1930s, the house was in need of substantive restoration. He became the director of architectural research there from 1953 to 1961. Other restoration projects he worked on include the Waverly House in Howard County, Maryland, the Rogers Tavern in Perryville, Maryland, the William Paca House and Garden in Annapolis, Maryland, and a 17th-century Quaker meeting house in Newport, Rhode Island in order to better preserve the regional differentiation. He also taught architecture at the University of Maryland. In 1961, he moved to Baltimore, Maryland and six years later was appointed chief of property rehabilitation for the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Agency. He restored a Bolton Hill townhouse 1432 John St. and made it his home. In 1966, Bullock wrote The Restoration Manual, which is still in print and is considered to be a cornerstone in the field of architectural restoration.

He later joined the Universidad de Puerto Rico's choir and in 1959, he sang as a soloist at the Festival Casals, having met maestro Pablo Casals previously. A few years later, Cosme joined a touring group of the Metropolitan Opera House also composed by Justino Diaz and Pablo Elvira; this group toured Puerto Rico and Cosme was able to sing operas. In 1972, Cosme, along with singers Tito Lara, Vilma Colon, Carmen Caldas, Floria Blanco, and Luis Beltran Rojas, formed a band named \\"Allegro 72\\". In this musical group, he was later joined by Lunna, Cosme's future show co-host Dagmar, Alice Gracia and Lunna's future husband, Cuco Pena. With this group, Cosme sang at New York City's Carnegie Hall. During the late 1980s, Cosme re-took his music career, playing guitar on some of his stepdaughter, opera and Christian music singer Yolanda Vadiz's presentations. News reporter Cosme periodically left his music career when he was offered a job as a news reporter on WIPR-TV, channel 6, Puerto Rico's government's television station. He covered the Dominican Civil War, the Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba and happenings at the Panama Canal, among others. Acting Beginning in 1961, Cosme sang and acted in Broadway productions such as Oklahoma!, Carousel, and Guys and Dolls.

In 1984, he moved to WAPA-TV's rival channel, Telemundo Puerto Rico, lured by an offer to host a game show named Super Sabados, which was broadcast across Puerto Rico and to the Dominican Republic and the United States. In 1985, Telemundo Puerto Rico revived Cosme's old cooking show from WAPA-TV, renaming it \\"A Freir y a Comer\\". This version of the show lasted many years on the air. Writings Cosme also wrote several books about cooking, including 1983's \\"Friendo y Comiendo\\" (loosely translated to \\"Frying and Eating\\" but in Puerto Rican Spanish the title translates better to \\"Cooking and Eating\\"), a 2000 re-edition of \\"Friendo y Comiendo\\",https://openlibrary.org/books/OL2657097M/Friendo_y_comiendo, 2011's \\"Cocina Facil Para Ninos\\" (\\"Easy Cooking for Children\\") and 2015's \\"Riendo y Comiendo\\" (\\"Laughing and Eating\\") which is a book with recipes for diabetic diets.

The collective publishes news and analysis, producing investigative work on neo-Nazi and white supremacist networks as well as reports on social struggles.  Contents  It's Going Down publishes both news and opinion. The website launched in 2015 and organizes a wide variety of content, ranging from interviews to best practices manuals for anarchist organizations to doxxing of operators behind fake antifa social media accounts. The website reported that it was averaging 20‚Äì30 thousand visitors a day as of mid-2017, with over 2 million total site views in August 2017. This indicates a significant increase from 2015, at which point it received an average of 300 daily page views. The website experienced a major spike in readership following Donald Trump's presidential election in 2016. It's Going Down has tracked the links between individuals such as Joey Gibson with white supremacist organizations and activists, reported on the monitoring of an anti-child separation group by the FBI, explored the role of anti-activist informants in the United States and exposed alt-right trolls operating fake antifa social media accounts. Their work has been referenced in outlets such as Bellingcat, BuzzFeed News and The Intercept. It has at times been the first to break coverage on events on the far-right. At other times, other times it has been the only media source outside right-wing media to cover events.  History  In August 2020, Facebook expanded its \\"Dangerous Individuals and Organisations policy\\", removing It's Going Down alongside over 800 QAnon, far-right militia, anti- racist and anti-capitalist groups. It's Going Down and Crimethinc., another left-wing and anarchist publishing platform that dates back to the 1990s, released a joint statement against the bans. This announcement followed a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on \\"stopping anarchist violence\\" led by Ted Cruz which mentioned It's Going Down among other media collectives. Fox News has included coverage on It's Going Down, often critically. In June 2017, Jesse Watters interviewed an individual who claimed to be the leader of \\"Antifa\\". The segment started with Watters reading from \\"An Open Letter To Liberals & Progressives From The Black Bloc\\", an editorial on the site. Kevin, the interviewee, claimed to have written the article. The interviewee later made clear that the appearance had been a prank and that he had no association with either It's Going Down or any black bloc group. It's Going Down denied that the article had been written by Kevin prior to his admission and the website reported that it received dozens of death threats following the coverage on Watters' World. Donald Trump may have watched the show and Eric Trump shared a clip from it. The website reported similar death threats after Tucker Carlson interviewed Ian Miles Cheong about antifa.

History  Dodd was born in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, to Ebenezer Daniel Dodd (c. 1827‚Äì1889) and his wife Johanna Dodd, n√©e Moloney, later of Castlemaine, Victoria. He was educated at St Stephen's Church School in Richmond, and apprenticed to the organ builder George Fincham of Bridge Road, Mitcham. In 1881 Fincham sent Hobday and Dodd to South Australia to open a branch of the business in Adelaide, setting up in Twin Street. :Arthur Hobday (1851‚Äì1912) was a son of Justin Harold \\"Harry\\" Hobday, organist and choir master at Christ Church, Geelong until 1870 when he left for Trinity Church, Geelong. Hobday was apprenticed to Fincham, then acted as client manager, organising plans and specifications, contracts, final inspection, tuning and voicing, then chasing up payments. Hobday and Dodd complemented each other, with Dodd taking responsibility for construction and finish, for which Hobday had no talent. Their first commission was a new organ for the Norwood Baptist Church, taking their old one (ex-Christ Church, North Adelaide) as part-payment; its component parts were later used to upgrade or refurbish other instruments. They won a gold medal at the Adelaide Jubilee Exhibition in 1887. :In 1888 Hobday came into some money, purchased a half share of Fincham's business, and returned to Melbourne, leaving Dodd as Adelaide manager. The partnership of Fincham and Hobday was dissolved in September 1896 amid recriminations; Hobday settled in Wellington, New Zealand, where he ran a successful organbuilding business and died on 9 October 1912. In the early 1890s Australia was hit by a financial recession, and organ-building became unprofitable. Fincham & Hobday began laying off workers and taking any kind of work, even unprofitably, in order to retain their skilled staff. In this climate Dodd was able in 1894 to purchase the Adelaide business for ¬£1000. J E Dodd's Gawler Place premises c. 1906 Dodd was able to convince South Australian churches of the benefits to be gained from dealing with a local manufacturer, and within a few years he had secured some substantial orders, notably Clayton Congregational Church in Norwood (1897), the Methodist Church in Kent Town (1898), and the Elder Hall on North Terrace (1901). His instruments were praised for their \\"high order of workmanship, light touch, and the ease with which they may be played\\" though they may have been less powerful than others. In 1903 he opened a branch in Perth, managed by his eldest son Ebenezer, who won the contract for renovation and upgrading of the St George's Cathedral, Perth organ. In 1905 he had a new showroom and factory built on Acre 271, west side of Gawler Place, between Flinders and Wakefield streets. The upper floor was devoted to refurbishment of pianos, which shortly became a growth industry as a result of Federal import duties being applied to musical instruments. Arthur Bishop (1868‚Äì1948) was appointed to manage this section.The photograph SLSA PRG 631/2/1291 appears to be of a single storey building; a dilemma not yet resolved. In 1918 he opened a branch in Melbourne managed by his younger son Eustace. Around 1935 the Gunn brothers, Bill Binding and Joseph Starling, frustrated by Dodd's autocratic ways and reluctance to adopt the latest technology, left the company and founded Gunstar Organ Works with premises at Plympton. With the advent of World War II, and many workers joining the 2nd AIF, the two companies amalgamated as J. E. Dodd & Sons Gunstar Organ Works. Dodd retired around 1948. In 1966 the company was still operating, as J. E. Dodd & Sons, at 2 Winifred Avenue, Plympton. In 1979 the company was taken over by George Stephens.

Along with her husband, Jacques Tr√©fou√´l, she is best known for her research on sulfamides, a novel class of antibiotic drugs.  Education and personal life  Between 1913 and 1919, Tr√©fou√´l studied chemistry at the Facult√© des Sciences, in Paris. She met her husband Jacques when they were assigned as lab partners after both failing to sign up to a practical course on time. Jacques and Th√©r√®se married in 1921. They were known for the strength of their partnership and collaboration. Even after their retirement from scientific research, the Tr√©fou√´ls continued to collaborate on various projects: Jacques was fascinated by metalwork and woodwork, and would construct furniture which Th√©r√®se upholstered.  Research and career  In the early 1920s, Th√©r√®se and her husband worked at the Pasteur Institute, in the laboratory of Ernest Fourneau ‚Äî known as the father of medicinal chemistry. By studying derivatives of arsenic, they created drugs that could be used against syphilis (Stovarsol), African trypanosomiasis (Orsanine, moranyl), and malaria (Rodoquine). Stovarsol and Orsanine are both isomers of acetylaminohydroxyphenylarsonic acid. This was the first demonstration that isomers of the same molecule could have such different and specific properties. The Tr√©fou√´ls received several awards for this work, including the Prix Parkin from the Institut de France (1927), the Prix Louis (1932) and the Prix Paultre (1932) from the Acad√©mie de M√©decine. They are best known for their 1935 co-discovery, together with the pharmacologist Daniel Bovet and the bacteriologist Frederico Nitti, of sulfanilamide, a novel antibiotic. In 1938, Jacques started his own laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. In 1940, Jacques was appointed as director of the institute, at which point Tr√©fou√´l took over the management of the laboratory. After the Second World War, the Tr√©fou√´ls continued their research into sulfamides. In 1954, they established the use of diaminodiphenyl sulfone for the treatment of leprosy and tuberculosis. Th√©r√®se officially became the head of the laboratory in 1955, while Jacques served as the director of the Institute for a total of 24 years. The Tr√©fou√´ls were nominated for a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950. In 1955, they were nominated for the Prix du Conseil National de l'Ordre des Pharmaciens, for their lifetime achievements in medicinal chemistry. Th√©r√®se retired in 1963, and died in 1978, a year after her husband.  Legacy  The Jacques and Th√©r√®se Tr√©fou√´l Square in Paris (15e Arr.) The Jacques and Th√©r√®se Tr√©fou√´l Square in Paris was named after Tr√©fou√´l and her husband.

The majority of member physicians include specialists of obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, and adolescent medicine. The organization sponsors the Society of Family Planning Research Fund that provides grants for research in abortion and contraception. This funding source was established in 2011. The Society of Family Planning supports the Fellowship in Complex Family Planning, previously known as the Fellowship in Family Planning. The fellowship is certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG), member of the American Board of Medical Specialties, as a subspecialty of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  Background  The Society of Family Planning was created in 2005 by 18 founding members and 33 charter members, initially focusing on grant support for rigorous family planning research. Membership has expanded to almost 800 members as of 2017. As of 2020, the scope of the organization includes education based on clinical guidelines, research and grants, and advocacy through clinical guidelines and research. The organization holds an annual meeting called the North American Forum on Family Planning (the Forum). There are three categories of membership: Fellow, Junior Fellow, and Affiliate Fellow. In order to apply for membership, a potential applicant must be referred by a current member. Members connect to the Society and collaborate with each other through Society of Family Planning Connect. Contraception published by Elsevier is the official SFP medical journal. As of 2019, the journal has an Impact Factor of 2.819.  Governance and Committees  The Society of Family Planning is managed by staff members including an Executive Director and an elected Board of Directors. The organization is also made up of Committees, Subcommittees and Working Groups including the Executive, Governance, and Finance Committees; Complex Family Planning Council; Annual Meeting, Clinical Affairs and Research Affairs Subcommittees; Abortion Clinical Research Network Working Group; and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group.  Research and Grants  The Society of Family Planning was originally created to provide grant support for family planning research. While the Society's scope has expanded, it has continued to provide significant research support, funding over $2.6 million dollars in grants in 2019. After an analysis of the impact of a decade of grantmaking,Bruce, L 2012. \\"Filling a Funding Gap: An Impact Evaluation of the Society of Family Planning,\\" MPH Thesis, Drexel University, Philadelphia. the Society of Family Planning Research Fund transitioned to funding targeted grant opportunities, published in the spring and awarded in the fall. SFP also supports the Abortion Clinical Research Network, a multi-site research network including independent clinics, Planned Parenthood affiliates, academic practices, patients, and researchers.  Fellowship in Complex Family Planning  The Fellowship in Complex Family Planning (CFP) is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education as a two-year fellowship after completing specialty training in obstetrics and gynecology. The fellowship focuses on further clinical training and research on complex abortion and contraception. SFP's Complex Family Planning Council partners with ABOG to provide programmatic oversight of the fellowship. Many academic institutions offer this fellowship training including Columbia University; Johns Hopkins University; University of California, Davis; University of Michigan; University of Southern California; and Yale University.  Legislative Advocacy  Together with other medical and reproductive health organizations, the Society of Family Planning filed amicus briefs in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby, later Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, to support increased access to the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg highlighted the importance of contraception to women in whom pregnancy may pose life-threatening risk and non-contraceptive benefits including cancer prevention and treatment of menstrual disorders and pelvic pain. The American Civil Liberties Union filed Chelius v. Wright on behalf of Dr. Graham Chelius, the Society of Family Planning, and other organizations against the restricted access to medical abortion. The Society of Family Planning joined other medical organizations in the amicus brief ACOG v. US Food and Drug Administration against the in-person dispensing requirement of mifepristone in medical abortion.  Collaborations  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society of Family Planning jointly developed clinical guidance on medical abortion up to 70 days‚Äô gestation. SFP endorsed ACOG's Practice Guideline on second- trimester abortion. After a workshop entitled \\"Reproductive Services for Women at High Risk for Maternal Mortality\\", ACOG, SFP, Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Fellowship in Family Planning, now known as the Fellowship in Complex Family Planning, issued an executive summary and consensus statement regarding assessment, counseling, and training on reproductive health services for women at high risk for maternal morbidity and mortality.

Similar to the case of Witch trials in Latvia and Estonia, the witch trials were introduced by a foreign elite power in an area with weak Christianity, in order to ensure religious conformity. Iceland was uncommon for Europe in that magic as such was viewed favorably on the island, and the majority of those executed were men, which it had in common with only the Witch trials in Finland. History=Icelandic view on magic In Iceland, magic and supernatural powers played an important role in popular folk belief. It was divided into two categories. The first category was galdur, good (\\"White\\") or bad \\"Black\\") spells performed by galdra-masters by the help of galdrastafir (wands), magic books, runes or vocally. The second category was fj√∂lkungi which referred to wisdom or knowledge of the unknown, which was necessary to manage and use the galdur correctly, although one could exist without the other.Ankarloo, Bengt & Henningsen, Gustav (ed.), Skrifter. Bd 13, H√§xornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier. Stockholm: Nerenius & Sant√©rus, 1987 This view on magic was a part of the old Norse culture and it survived on Iceland more undisturbed after Christianization than in the other Nordic countries. The first cases Witchcraft persecution begun after the reformation in Iceland, after a decree in 1564 which ordered all bailiffs to report all forms of heresy to the authorities, in order to establish religious conformity during the religious reformation. In the 16th century, however, witch trials in Iceland were conducted in accordance with the old definition of sorcery. In this definition, sorcery had nothing to do with the Devil: it divided magic in black magic and white magic and regarded black magic as punishable only if it injured another person and even then it did not result in the death penalty. A typical Icelandic witchcraft case in the 16th-century was that of a priest in 1554, who was sentenced to the loss of his office and exile as punishment for having used black magic or evil galdur from magic books in an attempt to entice a girl to sexual intercourse. In 1589 it was observed that the population of Iceland, where Christianity was weak, simply did not believe in the Christian Devil, and that consequently, Satan played a very small role in their imagination. Danish influenced witch hunt The international Christian demonology and the Christian interpretation of magic as witchcraft connected to Satan, and the Christian definition of a magician as a witch who was able to master sorcery after a Pact with the Devil, was introduced to Iceland by the clergy (who were often Danes or educated in Denmark) in the 17th-century. Belief in the Devil and the Christian definition of witchcraft spread after the publication of the first witchcraft books by Gudmundur Einarsson in 1627, and Pall Bj√∂rnsson's Characther Bestiae in 1630, and in 1630 Denmark introduced the Danish Witchcraft Act of 1617 on Iceland. One of the first high pofile cases was that of J√≥n R√∂gnvaldsson. Between 1604 and 1720, there were 120 witch trials on Iceland, which resulted in 22 (confirmed) executions between 1625 and 1685. The most intense period of persecution took place in 1667‚Äì1685. Male dominance The Icelandic witch trials were uncommon in Europe because almost all were directed toward men: of the 22 executed for sorcery in Iceland, 20 were men and only two women, one of whom (Galdra-Manga) unconfirmed, and only Thuridur Olafsdottir confirmed to have been executed. The reason for this was the fact that the magic openly performed in the Icelandic society had come to be associated with men. Prior to Christianity, women had performed magic, but during the Catholic Middle Ages, this changed as almost only men were accepted in the convents and Latin schools on Iceland and their literacy gave them better opportunities to attain fj√∂lkungi ('learing'). These male magicians were respectfully referred to as kunattumadur ('wise man' or cunning man) and many of them were heroes to the population, such as the famous J√≥n l√¶r√∞i Gu√∞mundsson (1574-1658), who allegedly managed to turn away the attacks from Barbary slave ships from the coasts by the use of galdur and who managed to survive a number of witch trials in the 1630s. The end All witchcraft executions stopped in Iceland after 1686, when a new law was passed by Denmark which stated that all death sentences for sorcery were henceforth to be confirmed by the high court in Copenhagen before they could be performed, and Copenhagen refused to confirm any more such verdicts.

He works as a reporter and a columnist for the national newspaper The Globe and Mail. As of 2020, he runs the news organization's office in Montreal. He is the recipient of the 1993 Michener Award for meritorious public service journalism. Biography A Franco-Ontarian, Picard was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and grew up in North Bay. He attended the √âcole secondaire catholique Algonquin, a French-language catholic high school. Picard attended the University of Ottawa and completed a B.Adm in 1986, but Picard credits his extra-curricular activities with having a greater influence on his career. Compelled by a friend to write a music column for the Fulcrum, a student newspaper, he ended up managing the Arts section, before being chosen as Editor-in-chief in 1983. His work at the Fulcrum gave him a taste of the impact journalism can have on the community and, ultimately, on public policy. Later, he got a degree in journalism from Carleton University, but credits his years at the student newspaper as his most valuable formative experience. During his time at the Fulcrum, he met the woman he would later marry, Michelle Lalonde. Their wedding took place on the University of Ottawa campus. They have two children and live in Montreal since 1989, where Lalonde writes for The Gazette. Career in journalism Picard briefly worked for the Canadian University Press, a news service that provided content for student newspapers. The Globe and Mail hired him in 1987 for its business section. When major news outlets started covering the AIDS epidemic, the Globe transferred him to the general news section and assigned that story to him, since he had already written about AIDS for the Globe as a Summer intern. Picard's stories often explored the human side of the issue and went beyond the stereotype of the AIDS victims. He joined other journalists covering health issues differently, enabling a conversation between health professionals, patients and the public. Health care officially became Picard's beat at the Globe and Mail in 1990. His stories on contaminated blood scandals, with an emphasis on the victims' compensation, contributed to the establishment of a commission of inquiry and ultimately, to regulation changes. He received the Michener Award in 1993, the same year the commission began its work. His first book, The Gift of Death: Confronting Canada‚Äôs Tainted Blood Tragedy, was published in 1995 and became a best-seller. Throughout his career, Picard developed an interest for prevention and social determinants of health. His goal as a journalist and a communicator is to bring about concrete changes: \\"I see myself as an activist, certainly, but I advocate for better health care policies, not on behalf of a group or a specific person. I try to explain the issues fairly and in the end, to come out on the side of what is just\\". He was one of the first journalists to report on SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and continued to follow it as the pandemic developed. He was recruited by the Trudeau Foundation to participate in a committee formed to engage and educate the public on the implications of the pandemic. As a columnist, Picard prefers to present the facts. He often devotes more space to presenting various points of view than to his own opinion, noted his colleague Paul Taylor: \\"He‚Äôs evidence-based, and unless you know what the evidence says, it‚Äôs hard to know what he‚Äôll say.\\" He consults with experts to check his facts and meets them at academic conferences. In 2012, Philippe Couillard introduced him by saying that \\"Andr√©, in my view, is the most thoughtful and certainly often courageous public writer we have on the health care sector in our country\\".

She doubled for many leading actresses of the 1930s and 1940s, but is best known for having doubled for Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. During the filming of the skywriting scene, a pipe attached to the Witch's broomstick exploded, landing Danko in the hospital with a serious leg wound. Her career was cut short by a non-stunt accident in the late 1950s when she was struck by a car while waiting for a bus. She resided in a Hollywood bungalow for 50 years with her widowed mother. Early life She was born Bertha Danko in Newark, New Jersey, on September 19, 1903. Her father, John Danko, was a native of Germany while her mother, Mary Danko, was a native of Hungary. She had an older brother and sister. Danko was very athletic; in school she played right forward and also competed in high jump, winning several medals. Career Danko moved to Hollywood with her family in 1927. The Dankos had relatives living in Los Angeles and her father was convinced by their description of the city to sell their home and other real estate he owned in Elizabeth and move across the country. Danko intended to stay in California for a year earning money to pay for tuition at a chiropractic school back in New Jersey. But her first week in the city, she was approached in a store by a woman who asked her to accompany her to an outdoor film shoot that evening. At the shoot, one of the actors came over to the two and asked if they worked in film; the woman replied that they did. The man told Danko she would make \\"a good college type\\" for their next film and asked for her phone number. A few weeks later, Danko received a call to report for work on a film playing a member of a girls' basketball team. Someone on that film suggested she apply for more work at Hal Roach Studios, and her career as a stunt double began. Among the actresses she doubled for were Jean Arthur, Binnie Barnes, Joan Crawford, Irene Dunne, Madge Evans, Jean Harlow, Patsy Kelly, Elissa Landi, Myrna Loy, Maureen O'Sullivan, Marie Prevost, Thelma Todd, Marie Windsor, and Blanche Yurka. Danko referred to her stunts as \\"bump work\\", and received the standard studio fee of $11 per day as a stand-in and $35 per day as a stunt double. In 1938, she was one of 25 stunt performers selected as \\"good risks\\" by Lloyds of London, allowing her to purchase annual coverage against accidental death and dismemberment‚Äîa policy which also lowered insurance expenditures for the studios. Her best-known job was doubling for Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. For the Wicked Witch's fiery entrance into Munchkinland, a catapult had been rigged up under the sound stage and the opening through which the Witch would spring out was covered by a thin aluminum cover painted the same color as the yellow brick road. While Danko waited in the pit, the choreographer was instructing the actors playing the Munchkins how to avoid the circular piece of metal, and fell through the opening onto Danko's shoulders. She was treated by a chiropractor at the studio's expense. Danko sustained a more serious injury while enacting the Witch's skywriting scene, where she flies on her broomstick spelling out \\"Surrender, Dorothy!\\". Hamilton had refused to do the scene after suffering serious burns from descending into the opening in the stage floor amid fire and smoke. The production crew rigged up a broomstick suspended from wires, with a steel saddle for Danko to sit on. Underneath the saddle lay a pipe that would emit smoke when she pushed a button. At first Danko's cape was pinned down to hide the pipe, but the director wanted the cape to blow in the wind, so the pipe was concealed under Danko's body. Danko noticed that the crew coated the pipe with asbestos. On the first two takes, the pipe emitted smoke perfectly, but on the third take, the pipe exploded. Danko was blown off the broomstick and sustained a -deep gash around the circumference of her leg, landing her in the hospital for eleven days. According to Scarfone and Stillman, damage to her internal organs from the explosion required a hysterectomy. Her total earnings from her work on the film came to $790, plus $35 for the broomstick stunt. In interviews, Danko said she plied her career as a Hollywood stuntwoman in order to support herself and her mother. She described falls as her specialty, saying: > I have fallen into ditches, lakes, pools, through trap doors, from piano > tops, over chairs and tables, down laundry chutes and stairs. I have fallen > over backwards from a height of into of water and into a pool fully clothed > though I can barely swim. I've been yanked around on wires, had pies and > knives thrown at me, have lain amid flames of gasoline‚Äîall for the sake of > Art and a pay check. But I still like it and it enables me to support my > mother and myself. Like other stuntwomen, Danko risked life and limb in her work. But her most serious injury came from a mountain lion off-screen while she was doubling for Patsy Kelly in a Hal Roach comedy. While she was getting used to being around the animal, it suddenly swiped at her brightly-colored moccasin. Later she visited the trainer with the animal on the set and he encouraged her to show the animal her foot again, and move a little closer. The lion grabbed her leg and chomped down on it thirteen times. Danko received thirteen stitches and permanent scarring. Danko's career was cut short by a real-life accident when she was struck by a car that jumped the curb while she stood at a bus stop. Later life Danko and her widowed mother lived in a bungalow at 6526 La Mirada Drive in Hollywood for half a century. Danko died on February 3, 1979.

Born in Keighley, he ran a series of attractions and showgrounds aimed at popular appeal during the Victorian era, though each of his ventures ended in financial failure. He began by taking over the ailing Leeds Zoological and Botanical Gardens and later founded Leeds Royal Park, which still has a legacy in the layout and street naming of the Hyde Park residential area. He eventually moved to London and then Hull. Unable to make his parks and gardens profitable, dogged by debt and creditors, as well as other problems such as disobeying music licensing rules, all of Clapham's properties were foreclosed, sold and redeveloped for housing. Despite this, he remained popular, and served two terms on Leeds Town Council. Clapham was described by the Thoresby Society's Eveleigh Bradford as \\"a distinctive lively figure, tall and red-haired, sporting tight check trousers; he was a popular character about town\\". However, he remains relatively unknown in local history, despite his role in the development of north west Leeds; later landowners disliking his being a failed businessman, his eponymous street in Hyde Park was renamed Brudenell Road. Leeds Royal Gardens Thomas Clapham was an investor in the public subscription to found Leeds Zoological and Botanical Gardens in 1837. Due to its original society failing to make it a profitable venture, the Gardens faced closure by 1848. At the age of 30, Clapham was a young entrepreneur with fresh ideas for making the park a success, and offered to take over the running from its new owner, Henry Cowper Marshall, and was granted a lease. They were then reopened with added attractions such as military bands, firework displays and flower shows. The basis of Clapham's strategy was to change the emphasis of the site from education to entertainment and show, and to take advantage of the new Leeds & Thirsk Railway, which opened in 1849 and brought passengers from Harrogate and Ripon to Leeds, passing right by the Gardens. He renamed it Leeds Royal Gardens and persuaded the railway company to open a station of this name at the southern entrance of the park in Burley. Additionally, Clapham took measures including reducing admission prices to 2d (), allowing people to hire it for private occasions, and moving back Sunday opening to 1 o'clock. Despite Clapham's efforts, the reopened park still refused to become profitable and was forced to close for good in 1858, with the land, equipment and animals all auctioned off. Leeds Royal Park The Royal Park showing the main entrance, conservatory and fountains, from a drawing in 1873 Following the failure of the Royal Gardens, Clapham moved on to a new venture approximately half a mile away in the area which is now the densely populated Hyde Park, but in the mid-19th century was still undeveloped fields adjacent to Woodhouse Moor. In 1858, he purchased facing the west of the Moor, including the Victoria Cricket Ground, which had staged most of the area's important matches since 1837 and was to be the focal point of his new recreational pleasure ground. Known initially as Leeds New Gardens, the pleasure ground Clapham created on the site featured a more downmarket focus than the Royal Gardens, with cricket, a gymnasium and what was described as \\"the largest dancing platform in the world\\". Other attractions included clay pigeon shooting, Punch and Judy shows, hot air balloon rides, and gardens with shrubs, lawns and a conservatory. The Leeds New Gardens was renamed to the Royal Park in September 1858 in honour of Queen Victoria's visit to Leeds that month to officially open the Town Hall. During the 1860s, the park hosted the Leeds Flower Show on an annual basis, and held sensational paid events, such as on 27 July 1861, when Charles Blondin, who was famous for having crossed the Niagara Gorge, walked a tightrope carrying a man on his back. By 1866, Clapham owned of land adjoining Woodhouse Moor and he constructed himself a house next to the park gate, and a new road, named Clapham Road, following the line of an old footpath. Only some on the site of the original cricket ground were part of the Royal Park; the other land was described as additional recreational areas. Throughout Clapham's time heading the management of the park, he was dogged by repeated revocations or refused applications for a music and events licence, followed by his repeated running of events regardless; he was regularly convicted by magistrates and given the penalty of a fine. Brudenell Road, which runs through Hyde Park, was originally named Clapham Road. However, Clapham overreached himself financially ‚Äì relying on a complicated system of mortgages on which he found difficulty in paying the interest; he expanded his holdings to such an extent that he owed ¬£15,000 () to various people on the understanding that the money could not be called in before 1872 ‚Äì and was forced to make regular land sales after 1866, as the interest alone on his mortgages reached ¬£1,000 per year (). He sold off plots for building until 1870, but not the Royal Park itself, although he did attempt to sell it to the city council as a parkland extension to Woodhouse Moor. From 1870, Clapham and his Royal Park began to be overwhelmed by debt, despite land sales and income from admissions. His attempt to set up a limited company to limit personal losses failed because of the weight of debts Clapham was attempting to shoulder. The park was rapidly losing money, and a meeting of his creditors in July 1871 resolved to order the liquidation of Clapham's estate. This foreclosure resulted in the sale at auction of Clapham's remaining land holdings to various buyers that September. The Royal Park itself was finally sold in February 1874 for ¬£16,500. The lots were described at the time as: \\"They are situated about one mile from the centre of Leeds in the best locality, and the land unbuilt on is admirably adapted for the sites of residences of a superior class. A very extensive and beautiful view can be obtained from nearly every part of the estate.\\" After the sale, the site was renamed the Leeds Horticultural Gardens and continued to be used as pleasure gardens until 1885, after which it was sold for housing like the rest of the surrounding plots. The terraced streets that replaced it continue to carry the Royal Park name, though the name of Clapham Road was changed at this point to Brudenell Road, apparently not wishing to commemorate a failed businessman. Local politics In March 1851, Thomas Clapham was the chairman of a public meeting in the Court House, Leeds, which sent recommendations to the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, held later in the year. They suggested firstly that the working classes should be admitted to the Exhibition for the first four days in every week \\"so that they may derive every possible benefit\\", and secondly, the reduction of fares charged by railway companies from Leeds to London from 15s 4d to 12 shillings, enabling a greater number to reach the Exhibition. From 1865, Clapham served two three-year terms as a Leeds Town Councillor, in common with many of the other influential local businessmen of the time, as a Conservative for the North ward. It was reported during the 1865 municipal election campaign that \\"the district resounded with the noise of vehicles placarded with Mr Clapham's name, and hints of his claims to the support of the working classes.\\" He recorded a majority of 88 (641‚Äì553) over his opponent, John Brown Heeles. Clapham's popularity endured to the next election of 1868, when he beat John Bailiffe (236) and Heeles (60) with 661 votes, a 425 majority. As part of his re-election strategy, he \\"engaged all the dwelling-houses in some streets as his committee rooms\\". While on the council in 1870, Clapham unsuccessfully stood for a position on the fifteen-member Leeds School Board, coming 27th in the list of candidates. At a council meeting in August 1871, two months before the next election, Clapham resigned his office of councillor for the North ward. Later life Once the Royal Park had been put up for sale in 1871, Clapham remained as its manager for a time (a period in which he got into more legal trouble for allowing betting on games of knurr and spell on the property), and then moved to London; he became the general manager of the Royal Surrey Gardens, but was bankrupted due to debts there too, and in 1877 this site was also sold for building development. After this, he worked as an estate agent, and ultimately retired to Hull with his young third wife, where he died in 1895, aged 78.

It was established by Thomas Clapham, an entrepreneur and local politician, but like the rest of his ventures it was unprofitable, and was closed and sold in 1874 due to the level of debt built up on its mortgages, after which it was known as the Leeds Horticultural Gardens. The new management company also had problems with debt and it was sold off in plots for housing development from 1885. The site now forms part of the dense residential area of Hyde Park, leaving a legacy in the layout and street naming. The only surviving building connected with the Royal Park is the old entrance lodge, converted into a group of houses facing Woodhouse Moor. Troubles for the Royal Park were more than financial. Under Clapham's management, repeated violations of local licensing laws for music and events put pressure on funds and reputation. However, it was a popular place for recreation, with cricket, a gymnasium and other attractions including the annual Leeds Flower Show and sensational paid events. Founding Thomas Clapham, a Yorkshire investor who had taken over the running of the Leeds Zoological and Botanical Gardens as the Royal Gardens (now the site of Cardigan Road) in 1848, was forced to close it in 1858 due to consistent under-funding, and moved on to a new venture approximately half a mile away in the area which is now the densely-populated Hyde Park, but in the mid-19th century was still undeveloped fields adjacent to Woodhouse Moor. In 1858, he purchased facing the west of the Moor, including the Victoria Cricket Ground, which had staged most of the area's important matches since 1837 and was to be the focal point of his new recreational pleasure ground. Known initially as Leeds New Gardens, the pleasure ground Clapham created on the site featured a more downmarket focus than the Royal Gardens, with cricket, a gymnasium and what was described as \\"the largest dancing platform in the world\\". Other attractions included clay pigeon shooting, Punch and Judy shows, hot air balloon rides, and gardens with shrubs, lawns and a conservatory. Operation Advertisement in the Leeds Mercury for a special gala at the Royal Park, May 1869 The Leeds New Gardens was renamed to the Royal Park in September 1858 in honour of Queen Victoria's visit to Leeds that month to officially open the Town Hall. During the 1860s, the park hosted the Leeds Flower Show on an annual basis, and held sensational paid events, such on 27 July 1861, when Charles Blondin, who was famous for having crossed the Niagara Gorge, walked a tightrope carrying a man on his back. By 1866, Clapham owned of land adjoining Woodhouse Moor and he constructed himself a house next to the park gate, and a new road, named Clapham Road, following the line of an old footpath. Only some on the site of the original cricket ground were part of the Royal Park; the other land was described as additional recreational areas. In 1868, a list of elements comprising the Royal Park contained three residences, an entrance hall, a restaurant, picture gallery, refreshment room, music pavilion, menagerie, fountain, cricket ground, volunteer parade ground and recreation ground. Throughout Clapham's time heading the management of the park, he was dogged by repeated revocations or refused applications for a music and events licence, followed by his repeated running of events regardless; he was regularly convicted by magistrates and given the penalty of a fine. Demise However, Clapham overreached himself financially ‚Äì relying on a complicated system of mortgages on which he found difficulty in paying the interest; Clapham expanded his holdings to such an extent that he owed ¬£15,000 () to various people on the understanding that the money could not be called in before 1872 ‚Äì and was forced to make regular land sales after 1866, as the interest alone on his mortgages reached ¬£1,000 per year (). He sold off plots for building until 1870, but not the Royal Park itself, although he did attempt to sell it to the city council as a parkland extension to Woodhouse Moor. Despite his suggestion that also taking land from the Earl of Cardigan may help achieve straight boundaries, the offer was rejected. From 1870, Clapham and his Royal Park began to be overwhelmed by debt, despite land sales and income from admissions. His attempt to set up a limited company to limit personal losses, intended to be called the Leeds Royal Park Estates Building and Investment Company Ltd, failed because of the weight of debts Clapham was attempting to shoulder. The park was rapidly losing money, and a meeting of his creditors in July 1871 resolved to order the liquidation of Clapham's estate. This foreclosure resulted in the sale at auction of Clapham's remaining land holdings to various buyers that September. Once the Royal Park had been put up for sale in 1871, Clapham remained as its manager for a time, a period in which he got into more legal trouble for allowing betting on games of knurr and spell on the property. The Royal Park itself, which was not offered as a going concern, was finally sold in February 1874 for ¬£16,500, after sale attempts in 1872 and 1873. The lots were described at the time as: \\"They are situated about one mile from the centre of Leeds in the best locality, and the land unbuilt on is admirably adapted for the sites of residences of a superior class. A very extensive and beautiful view can be obtained from nearly every part of the estate.\\" After the Royal Park The park, consisting of of Clapham's land between Queens Road and Hyde Park Road, was purchased jointly by a group of his mortgagees ‚Äì William Ingham, an upholsterer, Thomas Hattersley, a spindle maker, and Richard Robinson, a linen merchant, all of Leeds. After a year, Hattersley bought the other two out for ¬£3,333 in 1875. In the same year, he sold off the top 10 acres to the newly established Leeds Horticultural Gardens Company for ¬£13,000 to continue in use as a park, and commissioned the Leeds architect Thomas Ambler to lay out the lower half of the estate for housing. The plan showed a network of streets to receive small terraces mainly parallel to Queens Road, which had not yet been sewered or paved, and a number of plots to receive a better class of houses facing Brudenell Road ‚Äì the original name of Clapham Road was dropped about this time as the Victorians appeared not to like streets named after businessmen who were failures. The Leeds Horticultural Gardens Company renamed the remaining top half of the Royal Park to the Horticultural Gardens and attempted to keep the ground open and attract new visitors. Its directors included Joseph Conyers, a tanner, Richard Buckton, a manufacturer, Titus Bennett Stead, a druggist, and John Eddison, a well-known land surveyor. The company's purchase was financed by a mortgage from John Rawlinson Ford, a Leeds solicitor. The company built some new facilities as part of its efforts to attract higher numbers of visitors, such as a cruciform-shaped ice rink designed by James Neill (1875) and an orchestra stand by Charles Fowler (1879). By this time, a stone boundary wall, with entrance gates and an entrance lodge in Hyde Park Road surrounded the 10 acres of horticultural gardens. In October 1884, the directors of the company put the gardens up for sale by auction. The plans detailing the sale showed an extensive and varied range of attractions: a ballroom, concert hall, refreshment rooms, brewery, vinery, conservatory, lawn, cricket ground, gymnasium, bowling green and skating rink, as well as the main entrance including the manager's house and boardroom. 223‚Äì229 Hyde Park Road, the original Royal Park entrance lodge By late 1885, like Clapham before it, the Horticultural Gardens Company was finding it could not meet the debts associated with running and owning the park, and Ford, the financier, agreed to purchase the land and the fixtures, among which were 28 statues and busts. The land was purchased by extinguishment of the mortgage. Ford followed Hattersley in drawing up plans for terraced houses, following a similar pattern to the lower 10 acres already being developed. In 1886, a new wall breaking the gardens into two halves was erected, signalling their end. From then, as plans were approved, plots were rapidly sold and the plants of the gardens soon uprooted to be replaced by bricks and mortar, unlike the section developed by Hattersley, which had prolonged building times. Ford himself never acted as a housing developer, simply using his position to help potential purchasers, through his business contacts, to get mortgages and meet prospective investors. He also loaned to builders and speculative developers. Only a conversion of the old entrance lodge into two houses and a restaurant was done in his own name; this was done in 1888 by the architect Thomas Winn, involving the filling-in of the central archway, which contained turnstiles and pay boxes, and converting the first- floor ballroom into the restaurant. In a similar way to the Zoological Gardens, the existence of the Leeds Royal Park created an obstacle to building development in the sense that building took place around it and later it formed a specific estate in its own right. By the time it was finally sold for building purposes it was surrounded on three sides by newly built terraced houses. The only surviving building connected with either the Royal Park or the Horticultural Gardens is the old entrance lodge, now converted again into a group of houses and shops; the outline of the original entrance archway can still be seen on the side facing Woodhouse Moor. The Hyde Park streets of Royal Park Road, Terrace, Avenue, View, and Mount recall the name, as do the Royal Park public house (c.1920s) and the now-demolished Royal Park School adjacent to the site.

Van Puyvelde, a sports teacher by training, then took care of Sint-Niklaas, where he coordinated the youth ranks. In the early 1990s, Van Puyvelde moved to KSC Lokeren as an assistant coach. The club had just been relegated to the Second Division when he was promoted to head coach. Van Puyvelde was eventually succeeded by James Storme during the 1994/95 season. After Lokeren he ended up at Eendracht Aalst. Van Puyvelde became a technical director and brought players such as Peter van der Heyden to Eendracht. During the 1997/98 season, coached Urbain Haesaert was sacked, and van Puyvelde succeeded him for a short period. In 2000 Ren√© Verheyen, coach of Club Brugge, became an auxiliary trainer again. Norwegian Trond Sollied became the new head coach. He brought van Puyvelde to Brugge as his second assistant. Van der Heyden also made the switch to Club Brugge in 2000. Sollied's passage turned out to be a golden affair. Van Puyvelde and the Sollied's relationship got along well and Club Brugge's results were also good. In 2002, Club Brugge won the Belgian Cup and a season later the team played champions. In that order, Club Brugge also won the most important prizes in the next two seasons. In 2005, Sollied announced via a video message that he was leaving. Together with van Puyvelde he traveled to Olympiakos Piraeus in Greece. Sollied and van Puyvelde propelled Olympiakos to the league title and Cup of Greece. There were no results in the UEFA Champions League. Sollied and van Puyvelde were dismissed during the second season. In the summer of 2007 he returned to KAA Gent together with van Puyvelde and second assistant ƒåedomir Janevski. At the end of the season, Gent reached the final of the Belgian Cup, but were defeated. Sollied resigned and went to Heerenveen. Van Puyvelde followed him again, and Heerenveen went through a changeable course, but reached the final of the KNVB cup. In the final Heerenveen defeated opponent FC Twente after penalties. A few months later, Sollied's contract was terminated. Van Puyvelde also had to look for a new club. At the beginning of 2010, Van Puyvelde returned to KSC Lokeren, where he became the assistant of coach Emilio Ferrera. However, after the end of the season, Ferrera was replaced by Peter Maes. Van Puyvelde himself then went to work as head coach of FC Brussels. After his resignation at FC Brussels at the end of January 2011, he succeeded Gunther Hofmans as technical director at Beerschot AC. In 2013, van Puyvelde was appointed as a sports advisor at the Jupiler Pro League to lead the consultations between the professional football clubs in Belgium on a sports and technical level.

He was Senior Masseur at the Melbourne Hospital from 1900 to 1907, and helped found the Australian Physiotherapy Association in 1905. During his life and career in Australia, Hall was a fierce advocate for the British Indian community, and fought against racially motivated immigration restrictions. Hall fell ill and retired from actively practicing medicine in 1908, before dying of his illness in 1909.  Early life and education  Fredierick Teepoo Hall was born in Mysore, India in 1858. His mother was Indian while his father was an Englishman. He was trained in medicine at Bangalore College and entered the Subordinate Medical service in 1876, before serving in the Third Anglo-Burmese War.  Career = Arrival in Australia, career beginnings  Around 1888, Hall emigrated to Melbourne, Australia in 1888. When he arrived in Melbourne he began practicing massage in his office at Collins Street. He was assisted in establishing himself as a physician by Sir Thomas Naghten Fitzgerald. As a politically savvy and well educated man, Hall quickly grew in prestige as a practitioner and had several clients from Melbourne's high society. Some of his patients included John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun, Supreme Court Judge Hartley Williams and several journalists from The Age. From 1890 onwards, Hall published testimonials from his clients in local newspapers, which grew his clientele. Despite living in Australia at a time when Asian immigrants were looked down upon by Australian society, he became a highly regarded teacher of white physicians. He trained his assistants as part of a two-year apprenticeship, and helped to establish a high standard of medical professionalism in the Australian massage industry. From 1900 to 1907, Hall was the senior Masseur and massage demonstrator at Melbourne Hospital. He also held a position at the Austin Hospital, Melbourne.  Anglo-Indian advocacy and stance on immigration  Hall was very active in the Indian Australian community, and advocated for Indians' right to emigrate to and work in Australia. Hall co-founded the Australian chapter of the British Indian Association, and served as vice president of the chapter. However, since Hall had better English skills than Bux, he handled more practical aspects of leading the organization. After the institution of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, which prevented non-Europeans from entering Australia, Hall petitioned the government to loosen restrictions on travel, arguing that it would be harmful to Australia's ability to trade with countries like India. Throughout his career, he continued to battle legislation which attempted to restrict non-white immigration to Australia.  Australasian Massage Association  Hall convened and presided over a meeting of scholars in 1905 to address the need for an organization which could regulate and protect the profession of massage. Hall's proposal gained traction in Australia and he convened another meeting in December of that year to form the Australasian Massage Association (AMA) with the purpose of establishing massage as a professional field. Hall was the honorary secretary of the organization, while Sir Thomas Anderson Stuart was the association's first president. The AMA later became known as the Australian Physiotherapy Association, and began publishing the Journal of Physiotherapy in 1954.  Final years and death  Hall fell ill in 1908, and stepped back from practicing medicine. In September, some of his friends arranged a theatrical performance at the King's Theatre in Melbourne for his benefit. The performance was supposed to take place on October 13. On May 14, 1909 it was announced in the papers that Hall had died at the age of 50 years old.

Historical era = Rise  During the colonial period of the United States, the early forms of government established across the Eastern Coast differed by region. In the North, Puritan-led communities set-up democratic systems rooted in local participation. In the South, particularly the Colony of Virginia, more oligarchical forms of governance resembling the systems used in the Kingdom of England were established by the ruling groups. The royal governors appointed county officials, particularly justices of the peace. As in England, the justices were responsible for managing local affairs including setting taxation rates, regulating businesses, and maintaining roads. Other colonies in the South adopted a similar pattern of administration. Most of the appointees were members of the landed gentry and had life-long tenures. Over time they developed significant independence from the governors, and began asserting their right to fill local vacancies. Governors assented to these demands by generally appointing the justices' nominees for vacancies and their choices for sheriffs and other officials. The justices, by virtue of their control over county administration, assumed considerable influence over colonial legislative elections. Despite some occasional protests from poorer citizens, the county courts became a medium by which wealthy planters exercised control over politics in the South. Public agitation towards courthouse cliques contributed to the outbreak of the War of the Regulation in North Carolina.  19th century Democratic reforms  The court system in the South remained relatively unchanged until the early 1800s. In that time the number of court officials had burgeoned so that some counties had as many 90 justices at once. Meanwhile, the incumbent officers were increasingly criticized by the public for alleged inefficiency, incompetence, and corruption. Professional lawyers spearheaded demands for reform by attacking the planter-justices' lack of legal education. The proliferation of Jacksonian democracy as a political philosophy also challenged the position of the appointed court officers. State legislatures created new statutes and wrote new constitutions which dispensed of the justices and empowered themselves or the citizens of a given county to elect judges for fixed terms. By 1861 most citizens in the South could elect their sheriffs, coroners, constables, and other county officials. Planters still held many local offices but were forced to reckon with the demands of common voters.  Post- Reconstruction consolidation  In the Reconstruction era that followed the American Civil War in the South, the systems of choosing local officials was further democratized. However, by the 1870s the planter class, well-embedded in the Democratic Party, began a campaign to \\"redeem\\" the South from the control of Radical Republicans, which had disrupted the previous social order and elevated the political prominence of black freedmen, \\"carpetbaggers\\", and \\"scalawags\\". Allying themselves with emerging industrialists, the planters moved to quickly curtail any further disruption. In Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina the Democrats successfully stripped the ability of citizens to choose their local governments and made such choices the purview of either the state legislature or governor. Violence and electoral fraud, aided by county- level politicians, helped secure Democratic control of the \\"Solid South\\" elsewhere. Courthouse cliques also became entrenched in Kentucky county politics. Madison County Courthouse in Marshall, North Carolina. Madison County was home to the Ponder machine, a courthouse clique run by a sheriff and his brother. It was the most well-known machine in North Carolina during its existence from the 1950s until the 1980s. Under Democratic dominance in the South, most county-level offices were filled by Democratic candidates who were selected at local conventions, often nominating a single candidate for a post who would go on to win formal election. Almost all candidates were white men. Courthouses served as convenient forums for politics, since they allowed politicians‚Äîand ambitious attorneys in particular‚Äîto meet with important local figures and gave them chances to speak to groups of locals. Courthouses were also often located near networks of communication which allowed politicians to establish contact with other public figures across a state. The cliques were never formal organizations, but were instead groups of men who had social prominence, business connections, and long residency in public office that managed affairs through personal relationships. The leaders of courthouse cliques who exerted the most influence varied across different states. In Alabama, probate judges were generally the most powerful county figures, while in Virginia circuit court judges were the most privileged. In Louisiana and Mississippi the control of county politics often rested with sheriffs, who monitored gambling and bootlegging in their jurisdictions. Some county political leaders in the South from both the Democratic Party and Republican Party practiced vote buying to ensure the election of their preferred candidates. The Democratic dominance of the South provoked the ire of Republicans and independents, who frequently complained of courthouse cliques wielding control of public affairs. The perception of county political machine control also upset poor white farmers and contributed to the growth of the Populist movement in the 1890s and its demands for reform. Others became apathetic towards politics, feeling that their votes made little difference in the outcome of elections and government decisions. While the South was under Democratic Party dominance throughout the first half of the 20th century, the power and influence of courthouse cliques varied across the region. They generally wielded more control in lowland areas historically the site of plantations than in the more economically egalitarian Piedmont and mountainous areas. By the 1930s and 1940s courthouse machines in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia generally aligned themselves with a dominant faction within their respective state Democratic Party organizations. In other states, particularly Georgia, the cliques would form ad hoc alliances to shape the outcome of state elections. Courthouse cliques maintained a high degree of influence over Southern politics through the 1950s.  Decline  In response to the Great Depression in the 1930s, the United States federal government initiated a series of programs known as the New Deal, greatly contributing to the growth of federal and state bureaucracies and thereby challenging the courthouse cliques' positions as centers of political power. In the post-World War II era the South underwent significant social change. Returning war veterans made efforts to eject local political machines, which they viewed as obstacles to economic growth. In the \\"Battle of Athens\\" of 1946, armed veterans in McMinn County, Tennessee engaged in a shootout with sheriff's deputies in the employ of the local courthouse ring, forcing them to surrender ballot boxes and ousting the local government. Across the South urbanization, industrialization, and immigration from the North increased. Educational opportunities increased and improvements in mass communication were made. These changes cultivated the growth of a cosmopolitan culture in the South and boosted the strength of the Republican Party. The promulgation of the one man, one vote doctrine by the United States Supreme Court and subsequent reapportionment shifted political power away from rural counties and towards urban areas. Meanwhile, civil rights legislation enabled millions of black people in the South to vote. Faced with these political disruptions, courthouse cliques quickly declined throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the following years increased numbers of women and blacks were able to attain county offices. The Democratic Party also moved away from its reliance on courthouse cliques and began building a more top-down, institutionalized party structure with a professional, permanent staff.  Legacy  Journalistic expos√©s, scholarly works, movies, fictional writings have emphasized the historical importance of courthouse cliques in Southern politics and led to the creation of a stereotype portraying county governments in the South as dominated by corrupt politicians who use undemocratic methods to protect their power and their wealthy allies. While no longer forming extensive political networks or wielding wide influence, county office-holders still retain a significant amount of responsibility for law enforcement and the delivery of public services in their jurisdictions.

Bd 13, H√§xornas Europa 1400-1700 : historiska och antropologiska studier, Nerenius & Sant√©rus, Stockholm, 1987 In an area recently affected by a religious war, the Spanish Inquisition encouraged witch trials as a method to esnure religious conformity. In this, it was similar to the Witch trials in Latvia and Estonia. History=Background and legality Een warachtige beschrijvinge van 64 tooveressen) After the Dutch War of Independence the Habsburg Netherlands was divided, and the Northern Netherlands became a Protestant republic while the Southern Netherlands remained under Catholic Spain as the Spanish Netherlands. The long religious civil war, where Protestant sympathies had been considered equal to betrayal to Spain, caused great tension in the Spanish Netherlands, were the Spanish Inquisition wanted to ensure religious conformity under the influence of the Tridentine Counter-Reformation. The Spanish Inquisition encouraged the population to spy and inform on their neighbors to ensure that anyone not conforming to the Church doctrine could be routed out, with a portion of the confiscated property of every execution as benefit for an informer. Witchcraft persecutions had taken place in the Habsburg Netherlands already during the 15th-century, particularly in Flanders, and the belief in witches was strong in the area. The Princely Witchcraft Decrees of 1592 and 1606 made prosecutions for witchcraft legally easy for the local secular courts to perform. The combination of a strong belief in witchcraft among the population, laws which enabled witch trials and a will among the authorities to encourage the citizens to spy and report each other resulted in a frenzy of extreme witchcraft persecutions until the 1630s, which was managed by the secular courts with a \\"terrifying repression\\". The witch trials :See also Werewolf witch trials The local population of the Spanish Netherlands were well informed about the then modern demonology, and there was a widespread concern and fear for witches, which were believed to gather in secret Satanic sabbaths in the forests. Witch trials were often instigated in the initiative of the public, who presented the authorities with petitions urging them to act and issue investigations against the witches, and the citizens were often active and cooperative to report, testify and sometimes even finance the investigations. Personal conflicts often resulted in a sorcery charge, and the authorities often demonstrated a sympathetic attitude toward lynchings of suspected witches. The witch trials in the Spanish Netherlands put great importance in forcing the accused of naming accomplices, which resulted in an epidemic migrations of witch trials from village to village over entire counties and could cause a witch trial to grow very large. The perhaps largest of the Witch trials in the Spanish Netherlands, of which there are preserved documentation, was the Roermond witch trial in 1613. The end The Witch trials in the Spanish Netherlands gradually became fewer after the 1630s. In 1684, Martha van Wetteren became the last person to be executed for sorcery in Flanders, and after 1692 no more witch trials were held.Rik Opsommer und Jos Monballyu, Hexenverfolgungen Flandern, Grafschaft See also * Witch trials in the early modern period  References  Category:Early Modern law Category:Early Modern politics Category:Legal history of Belgium Category:Political history of Belgium Category:Social history of Belgium Category:Trials in Belgium Category:Witch trials Category:Witchcraft Category:16th century in the Habsburg Netherlands Category:17th century in the Habsburg Netherlands Category:Spanish Netherlands ","title":"Witch trials in the Spanish Netherlands"},{"id":"65067533","text":"Edward Gordon \\"Ned\\" Randolph, Jr. (February 1, 1942 ‚Äì October 4, 2016), was a Louisiana politician who served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1972 to 1976, in the Louisiana State Senate from 1976 to 1984, and as mayor of Alexandria, Louisiana from 1986 to 2006.

In addition to street protests, marches, and demonstrations, the shooting also led to the 2020 American athlete boycotts. The demonstrations were marked by daily peaceful protesting followed by confrontations with law enforcement and rioting at night. A state of emergency was declared on August 23, and the National Guard was activated the following day. Further confrontations arose when armed militia members, whom Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth described as \\"like a group of vigilantes\\", arrived with the expressed intent of protecting businesses in the city. On August 25, two protesters were fatally shot and a third was injured by Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois. Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other charges; his attorneys have said his actions were in self-defense. Background Jacob Blake is an African-American man who was shot four times in the back during an arrest by police officer Rusten Sheskey. The incident occurred in Kenosha on August 23, 2020, as police officers were attempting to arrest Blake. Blake was unsuccessfully tasered. He was shot after he opened the door to his SUV and reached into the vehicle. He is expected to survive, but is paralyzed from the waist down. He was initially handcuffed to the hospital bed and deputies were posted in his room, but the handcuffs and deputies were later removed and a warrant for his arrest was vacated after Blake paid a bond. Events in Kenosha=Protests and riotsDay 1: August 23= A state of emergency was declared in the county starting at 10:15 p.m., and garbage trucks were used to block 56th Street. Starting at 11:05 p.m., police began using tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds, which lasted throughout the night. Near midnight, the crowd lit a small fire in front of a ground-floor window of the Kenosha County Courthouse and at least three garbage trucks and a trolley car were lit on fire. By 2:30 a.m., a truck in a used car dealership along Sheridan Road was lit on fire. The fire spread to most of the 100 other cars on the lot, damaging an entrance sign for the nearby Bradford Community Church (it did not spread to the church building itself). Businesses in the western portion of downtown were torched and looted in the later hours before dawn. Along with many downtown businesses, buildings surrounding Civic Center Park, including the post office, Reuther High School, the Kenosha County Administration Building, and the Dinosaur Discovery Museum all sustained damage to their front windows and entrance foyers. Police scanners stated that a Lenco BearCat armored personnel carrier was damaged by protesters, and a video posted by a local newspaper appeared to show an officer being knocked out with a brick. =Day 2: August 24= Peaceful demonstrations were held during the day. Ruins of the Community Corrections Division building that burned down on August 24, 2020 Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers activated the Wisconsin National Guard to protect firefighters and critical infrastructure in Kenosha. The ACLU of Wisconsin strongly opposed the move. The county announced a curfew that went into effect 8:00 p.m. on August 24. Metra suspended commuter rail service north of Waukegan station. The Kenosha County exits for Interstate 41/94 were closed. Protesters broke a door off its hinges in an effort to forcefully enter the Public Safety Building before being turned back by pepper spray. Teargas was deployed for a second night starting around 8:30 p.m. in an attempt to disperse unlawful crowds gathered near the courthouse, as protesters launched fireworks at police. Another garbage truck was lit on fire, a car dealership was looted and a furniture store torched, while armed gunmen appeared to be guarding a downtown gas station. Several streetlights were pulled down and by 1:00 a.m. several businesses downtown were on fire. Ruins of the Danish Brotherhood building. Arsonists targeted a Wisconsin Department of Corrections community parole facility and the city's Danish Brotherhood Lodge.

The Kenosha Guard hosted a gathering for militia members to choose locations in the city to protect. Sheriff Beth stated that the presence of militia members created confusion and complicated the situation. Facebook removed the group and page on August 26. =Day 3: August 25= The Kenosha County Board sent a letter to Governor Evers requesting the deployment of an additional 2,000 national guardsmen. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth asserted that most of the damage was from individuals with no intent to protest and who were not from Kenosha County. Governor Evers declared a state of emergency for the region, sending in 250 troops from the Wisconsin National Guard to the city. Law enforcement erected a tall fence to protect the courthouse. Protesters attempted to breach the fence line throughout the night but failed. Significant numbers of armed civilians were also on the streets. Police said that such groups had not been invited and were not helpful. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth described them as \\"a militia... like a vigilante group.\\" However, cellphone footage showed police thanking armed civilians and giving them bottles of water. Sheriff Beth characterized the officers as \\"very wrong to say that\\" to the militia members. At around 11:45 pm, a 17-year-old Illinois resident shot and killed two protesters and injured a third.

He participated in a roundtable, but did not meet with Blake or his family. In a letter to Trump, Governor Evers had asked him to reconsider his visit over concerns that his presence would hinder efforts to \\"overcome division\\". Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian and the city's NAACP branch president had expressed similar reservations, with Antaramian saying the trip was \\"ill advised\\" and the NAACP branch president stating it would \\"only inflame tensions\\". However, Trump insisted he was going to make the trip. Former governor Scott Walker, U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, and seven Kenosha County board members had encouraged the visit. During his visit, he met with store owners whose property was damaged during the protests with at least one owner refusing to be a part of the event. Trump engaged in a round table discussion on community safety at Mary D. Bradford High School with protesters and supporters lining the streets during his visit. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden visited Kenosha on September 3. The Biden campaign said he had received \\"overwhelming requests\\" from local officials for the Kenosha visit, although it was against the suggestion of the local NAACP president and also Kenosha County Executive Jim Kreuser. During this first campaign visit to Wisconsin, Biden met with Jacob Blake's family and held a community meeting. Damage assessments A car dealership that was burned during riots on August 24 City property valued at $2 million was destroyed by rioters, including garbage trucks, street lights and traffic signals. Kenosha's mayor requested $30 million in aid from the State to cover the extensive damage. Damage to private property could be as high as $50 million, according to estimates from the Kenosha Area Business Alliance. This includes the 100-year- old Danish Brotherhood Lodge which was burned down, among 100 buildings damaged. On October 2, 2020, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released photos and videos of suspected arsonists, offering up to $5,000 reward for each person identified.  Fatal shooting of protesters  On August 25, a civilian armed with an AR-15 style rifle shot three protesters, one of whom was armed with a handgun, during two confrontations. Kenosha resident Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Silver Lake resident Anthony Huber, 26, were killed; while West Allis resident Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, was injured. Prosecution and defense teams acknowledge that the shooter was Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois. Background In reaction to the George Floyd protests, former Kenosha alderman Kevin Mathewson had announced the formation of a militia group he called the Kenosha Guard. On August 25, he put out a call on Facebook for \\"patriots willing to take up arms and defend\\" Kenosha, which got a heavy online response. Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian and County Sheriff David Beth expressed disapproval of armed civilians patrolling the streets, while police officers were seen in a video giving them water and heard saying \\"We appreciate you guys, we really do.\\" Sheriff Beth later said that ahead of Tuesday night's protests, a group of armed individuals had asked him to deputize them to patrol the city of Kenosha, which he refused. He said he did not know if Rittenhouse had been part of the group, but said the possibility of such an incident was why he had refused the request. Rittenhouse has been described as having participated in local police cadet programs and expressing support on social media for the Blue Lives Matter movement and law enforcement. In the hours leading up to the shooting, Rittenhouse appeared in multiple videos by protesters and bystanders, including in two interviews: One by a livestreamer at a car dealership where he and at the same time a number of other armed men had stationed themselves, the other by a Daily Caller reporter. Some of the men were affiliated with the Kenosha Guard, but it denied any affiliation with Rittenhouse and its leader said he never met or communicated with him. Rittenhouse was seen talking with police officers, as well as offering medical aid to protesters. According to his attorneys, after he had heard about a local business owner who wanted help defending his car dealership, he and a friend \\"armed themselves with rifles\\" and went to that business. At some point, he left the dealership and was prevented by police from returning. Shooting The location at 60th and Sheridan where shooting victim Anthony Huber died The moments of shooting were recorded in cellphone footage from multiple angles. Around 11:45 pm, video footage showed Rittenhouse being pursued across a parking lot. As Joshua Ziminski fired a shot from a handgun nearby, Rosenbaum chased after Rittenhouse, throwing something in his direction, identified in some reports as a plastic bag or hospital bag. According to Kenosha County prosecutors, Rosenbaum tried to take Rittenhouse's rifle from him. Rittenhouse then fired four shots, hitting Rosenbaum in the groin, back, and left hand. The bullets fractured Rosenbaum's pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver. Rosenbaum had additional minor wounds to his left thigh and forehead. Rittenhouse remained near Rosenbaum and made a phone call as a Daily Caller news reporter began administering first aid to Rosenbaum. Rittenhouse was heard saying into his cell phone, \\"I just killed somebody.\\" He then fled. In another video, Rittenhouse was filmed as he continued to be chased down the street by several other protesters before tripping. According to the criminal complaint, at that point, protesters are heard yelling \\"Beat him up!\\", \\"Get him! Get that dude!\\", and \\"Get his ass\\". After he fell, one of the men who had been chasing Rittenhouse began to kick and attempt to disarm him, with Rittenhouse firing two shots, missing this man. Another protester, Anthony Huber, next struck Rittenhouse with a skateboard. According to court records and video footage, Huber struck Rittenhouse's shoulder or head/neck area with his skateboard, and tried to grab the rifle. Rittenhouse shot Huber once in the chest, perforating his heart and right lung. Gaige Grosskreutz also approached Rittenhouse; when Huber was shot, Grosskreutz stopped and put his hands up. When Grosskreutz moved again towards Rittenhouse, Rittenhouse shot Grosskreutz in the arm. According to court records, Grosskreutz appeared to be holding a gun. Grosskreutz has acknowledged that he was carrying a gun. Gunshots from other sources can be heard around the same time of Rittenhouse firing his shots from the ground. Rittenhouse subsequently walked towards police with his hands up and the semi-automatic rifle strapped across his chest; they allowed him to leave or appeared not to acknowledge Rittenhouse, though several witnesses and other protesters shouted for him to be arrested. When asked at a press conference why Rittenhouse was not stopped, Kenosha Sheriff David Beth said, \\"In situations that are high-stress, you have such incredible tunnel vision\\" and implied officers may not have realized he had been involved in the shooting. Likewise, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis claimed that \\"there was nothing to suggest this individual was involved in any criminal behavior\\" due to the fact that someone walking towards the police with their hands up was \\"no longer abnormal\\" in the wake of the protests. Investigation and legal process On August 26, Rittenhouse turned himself in on charges of first-degree intentional homicide in his home state of Illinois. He was labeled a \\"fugitive from justice\\" in the criminal complaint, which alleged that he \\"fled the state of Wisconsin with intent to avoid prosecution for that offense.\\" He was assigned a public defender and initially scheduled to appear at an extradition hearing on August 28. On that day, a judge granted a request to delay the hearing until September 25 so that Rittenhouse could obtain his own counsel. The hearing was then delayed to October 9, followed by October 30. Under Wisconsin state law, he will be charged as an adult. While awaiting extradition, Rittenhouse is being held in a juvenile facility in Illinois. The complaint against Rittenhouse lists six charges: first degree reckless homicide against Joseph Rosenbaum, first degree recklessly endangering safety against Richard McGinnis (a reporter who interviewed Rittenhouse before the shooting), first degree intentional homicide against Anthony Huber, attempted first degree intentional homicide against Gaige Grosskreutz, first degree recklessly endangering safety against an unknown male victim, and possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18 (the only misdemeanor charge, the others are felonies). Each felony charge comes with a \\"use of a dangerous weapon\\" modifier, which invokes a Wisconsin law that prescribes an addition of no more than five years of imprisonment for each of the charges if found guilty. According to the prosecutors, the gun was \\"later recovered by law enforcement and identified as a Smith & Wesson AR-15 style .223 rifle\\". Attorney L. Lin Wood and the law firm Pierce Bainbridge are representing Rittenhouse. On August 29, 2020, the legal team for Rittenhouse released a statement asserting that Rittenhouse acted in self defense and was wrongly arrested. On September 22, Rittenhouse's defense team released an 11-minute narrated video of the night, consisting of quick cuts between various angles. The video contends that several shots were fired before and after the shooting of Rosenbaum, and that Rosenbaum may have started chasing Rittenhouse because he mistook him for a man with whom he had a dispute earlier. On October 14, prosecutors announced that Rittenhouse would not face gun charges in Illinois after an Antioch police investigation determined the rifle he used \\"was purchased, stored and used in Wisconsin\\" and not possessed within Illinois. Responses Bradford High School on September 1, 2020 Public sentiment regarding the shootings was polarized. Some news outlets initially covered the shooting as a terrorist attack, and Facebook labelled the incident as a \\"mass murder\\" and banned all expressions of support for Rittenhouse. However, other commentators defended his actions. Fox News host Tucker Carlson blamed authorities for failing to stop looting and arson, and added, \\"How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?\\" His comments were met with backlash on social media. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter and retired baseball player Aubrey Huff also praised Rittenhouse. Meanwhile, other coverage has been critical of Rittenhouse's actions and used terms such as \\"vigilante\\" and \\"terrorist\\" to describe him. Commentators were critical of the fact that Rittenhouse was not immediately arrested despite witnesses shouting that he was the shooter. Domestic and international media reported that Rittenhouse is a Trump supporter and had attended a Trump rally. President Trump \\"liked\\" a tweet that included \\"Kyle Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump.\\" In public comments, Trump declined to condemn the shootings and showed some support for the contention that Rittenhouse was legitimately acting in self-defense. Analysis by ADL shows that while Rittenhouse has not been linked to any formal extremist group, a number of extremists have lionized him. At a September 26 rally in Portland, Oregon, members of the Proud Boys wore shirts that read, \\"Kyle Did Nothing Wrong.\\" In addition, the hashtag #kylewasright has been adopted by some white supremacist groups. On August 26, 2020, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called for the resignations of Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and of Kenosha Sheriff David Beth. The ACLU statement claimed that Sheriff Beth's deputies fraternized with \\"white supremacist counter-protesters\\" during the day of the shooting and did not arrest the shooter. The statement attacked Miskinis for blaming the victims in the shooting, when he said that the violence was the result of the ‚Äúpersons‚Äù involved violating curfew. The Kenosha mayor stated that he would not ask the sheriff or police chief to resign. As of September 29, 2020, the Christian crowdfunding website \\"GiveSendGo\\" had raised over $520,000 to help pay Rittenhouse's legal fees. On October 1, 2020, NBC News obtained a Department of Homeland Security internal document directing federal law enforcement officials to make \\"sympathetic\\" statements regarding Rittenhouse. Events elsewhere=Athletic strikes In protest of Blake's shooting, multiple professional athletes refused to play their respective sports contests that week. It started on August 26 when the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) refused to take the court for a playoff game. Members of other teams in the NBA, Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and Major League Soccer (MLS) all decided not to play their games on August 26, 2020. The strikes extended into August 27 and 28 when players from the National Hockey League (NHL) refused to play their playoff games. In response to these events, nine National Football League (NFL) teams cancelled their scheduled practices on August 27, 2020. Other locales During the Kenosha unrest, there were similar protests and riots in Madison, Wisconsin, Atlanta, Georgia, Minneapolis, Minnesota,Walsh, Paul (August 25, 2020). \\"11 protesting Kenosha police shooting arrested after jail damaged in Minneapolis\\" .

Tanning is the process of treating animal skins and hides for display and preservation. Because tanning is a behind-the-scenes operation of taxidermy, tanners are seldom known outside the industry. Work Clark‚Äôs work is on view in museums all over the world; his most famous work is \\"Henry,\\" the African Bush elephant which has been displayed in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. since 1959. He also tanned the skin of the famous racehorse Phar Lap,Interviews with John Janelli, former president of the National Taxidermists Association and prot√©g√© of Sinclair Clark. which has been on permanent display in the Museums Victoria in Melbourne, Australia since January 1933. Some years after his 1924 emigration from Barbados to the United States through New York City's Ellis Island, Sinclair Clark learned tanning from taxidermist James L. Clark (no relation) \\\\--who himself had learned from Carl Akeley, considered to be the ‚Äúfather of modern taxidermy.‚Äù Akeley, whom Sinclair Clark had met his very first week of work at James L. Clark‚Äôs taxidermy studio, had recently proposed that the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) build a Hall of African Mammals, and James Clark had begun working with Akeley on that project. As a result, it was Sinclair Clark who tanned the skins of the majority of the large mammals exhibited in the over 29 habitat dioramas of that hall, as well as of the original four of the herd of eight African elephants that comprise the hall's main exhibit. In rare archival footage, Sinclair Clark can be seen at work in the museum's 1927 film, \\"Modern Taxidermy: Mounting Indian Elephants for the American Museum of Natural History.\\" Akeley requested that Sinclair Clark accompany him on his 1926 African safari, but Sinclair‚Äôs mother forbade it. It turned out to be Akeley‚Äôs last safari; during the trip, he became ill and died in the Belgian Congo. In 1936, his proposed Hall of African Mammals opened in the American Museum of Natural History and was named The Akeley Hall of African Mammals in his honor. An independent contractor, during his career Sinclair Clark worked with noted taxidermists, including Louis Paul Jonas of the world-famous Jonas Bros. Taxidermy Studio, which since 1908 has specialized in museum-quality taxidermy. (Stephen I. Horn, who succeeded co-founder John Jonas there, hired Sinclair Clark to run the Jonas Bros. tannery). And at the American Museum of Natural History, his tanning methods became the standard for all diorama animal exhibits, as noted in the project blog of the museum's Natural Science Conservation lab: When considering the production and acquisition of historical taxidermy at the Museum, particularly for use in dioramas, the period of interest spans from approximately 1925 to 1965. Though we do not have a complete understanding of all the tanning methods in use at, and for, the Museum during this 40-year time frame, we were able to partner with a local tanner trained by Sinclair Clark, a renowned tanner who was on staff at the Museum around 1924‚Äì1927. Clark later set up tanneries in other locations, but maintained his relationship with the Museum tannery over a long period of time. In general terms, Clark‚Äôs method involves the following: The skin is salted to remove moisture and stabilize it prior to tanning Tanning begins with rehydration in a saltwater bath until the skin is soft and pliable It is next soaked in an acid pickle until swollen, and then shaved down on a fleshing machine or by hand The skin is returned to the pickle, and, if needed, shaved again The skin is then removed from the pickle and the acid is neutralized Warmed oil is applied either by hand or with a ‚Äúkicking‚Äù machine The skin is left to sit overnight or for one day before being tumbled in hardwood sawdust until dry and soft. Throughout his career, Sinclair Clark mentored other taxidermists and helped them set up their studios. Following his death, the National Taxidermists Association created an annual award in his name--The Sinclair Clark Memorial Award--for excellence in taxidermy.

It is found on coral reefs at depths of in the Indo-Pacific. Description Cephalopholis igarashiensis has a deep body with the depth of the body being greater than the length of the head, the standard length is 2.0 to 2.4 times the depth of the body. The dorsal profile of the head is straight or marginally concave to beyond the eye while the nape is distinctly convex. The preopercleis rounded and the edges have fine serrations although those on the ventral margin are slightly less fine giving it a more irregular appearance but the serration remain enclosed within the skin. The dorsal fin contains 9 spines and 14 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 9 soft rays. The caudal fin rounded. The overall colour of this species is reddish-orange and it has seven wide, lemon-yellow bars on the upper flanks which reach onto the dorsal fin, and three wide yellow irregular oblique stripes on the head. The juveniles are yellower, darkening on the lower body, and they have several white bars on the body and a large black eyespot on the soft rayed part of the dorsal fin. They also have blackish pelvic fins, and a black area at the base of the anal fin. This species attains a maximum standard length of >, but a more common length is 25 cm (10 in). Distribution Cephalopholis igarashiensis is found mainly in the Western Pacific Ocean where it is found as far north as Japan, east to Fiji and French Polynesia and south to Australia. In Australia it has been reported from Scott Reef in Western Australia, east to the Arafura Sea off the Northern Territory. It is also found around Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Habitat and biology Cephalopholis igarashiensis is a demersal species of steep reef drop-offs, seamounts and offshore banks in deep waters at depths of . It feeds on fishes and crustaceans. Taxonomy Cephalopholis igarashiensis was was first formally described in 1957 by the Japanese ichthyologist Masao Katayama with the type locality given as Sumisu-tu in the Izu Islands of Japan. Utilisation The flamboyant red and yellow patterns of this species makes it an attractive species to keep in aquaria, however, the garish hind is naturally rare and it is extremely hard to take it up to the surface because the fish cannot adapt to the changing water pressure; so special decompression procedures are required to keep the fish alive. Consequently, this species is extremely expensive; a juvenile in Singapore sold for $8000 SGD($ 6300 USD). This species is targeted in subsistence fisheries and as a gamefish. Fishermen in Okinawa call it the Indian Mibai because of its flamboyant patterns. Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in Japan became the first aquarium to display this species in January 2009.

The world of Ravnica was originally created for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game and first appeared in the card set Ravnica: City of Guilds, which was released in 2005. It is a high-magic world with a loose Slavic flavor, and features a single city which spans the entire planet that is controlled by ten competing guilds of different ideologies.  Contents  Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica is a 256-page campaign and adventure guide for using the Ravnica setting, from the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, in the 5th edition. The book includes a ninety page overview of \\"the ten guilds of Ravnica along with the Tenth District where most of the guilds operate. There's also nearly 40 pages dedicated to building adventures in Ravnica that include hooks to include different guilds. The book also contains about 70 pages filled with stat blocks for the monsters and NPCs that occupy Ravnica\\". The book expands on game elements for the 5th edition, such as: * Five new races ‚Äî centaurs, minotaurs, loxodon, Vedalkin, and Simic hybrids * Two subclass options ‚Äî the Order Domain Cleric and the Circle of Spores Druid * Ravnica themed magic items and treasure  Publication history  Starting in 2016, James Wyatt, a \\"longtime Wizards employee who worked on D&D; for over a decade before moving over to Magic in 2014\\", began to write a series of free PDF releases called Plane Shift where various Magic: The Gathering planes were adapted for Dungeons & Dragons. The positive response to the \\"Plane Shift\\" articles lead to the publication of Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica, the first full hardcover Dungeons & Dragons guide to the Magic setting. The book's cover and full listing were leaked early on Amazon in July 2018. Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica was published on November 20, 2018 and features cover art by Magali Villeneuve. Wyatt was the lead designer on the book and he stated \\"this book is, essentially, Plane Shift: Ravnica\\". Nathan Stewart, director of Dungeons & Dragons, said in a press statement: \\"With the huge surge in popularity of D&D; and Magic's commitment to bring the lore and storytelling to life, the timing seemed perfect. Ravnica is full of adventure possibilities and I can't wait for fans to jump in to embody a member of one the iconic guilds\\". Elaine Chase, vice president, global brand strategy and marketing for Magic: The Gathering, said in a press release: \\"It‚Äôs super cool for fans of D&D; and Magic to be playing together in the same multiverse\\".  Related products = Plane Shift Series  The various planes from Magic: The Gathering were first adapted for Dungeons & Dragons in a series of free PDF releases called Plane Shift by James Wyatt. Wyatt also writes the text for the series of Art of Magic: The Gathering coffee table books, which reprint illustrations from the cards with details for each plane's lore; the Plane Shift releases were created to allow players to use those books as campaign setting guides by providing the necessary rule adaptations. Between 2016 and 2018, six Plane Shift articles were released: Amonkhet, Dominaria, Innistrad, Ixalan, Kaladesh, and Zendikar, along with an Ixalan-set adventure. However, these articles are not considered official material for organized play. In 2017, Mike Mearls wrote: \\"It's basically a thing James does for fun, and we don't want to burden it with needing all the work required to make it official\\".  Guilds of Ravnica  Guilds of Ravnica was a Magic: The Gathering post-block set expansion released on October 5, 2018. The three related card sets carried \\"the classic collectible card game into its 26th year\\".  Icons of the Realm  WizKids released a set of 55 Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica themed Dungeons & Dragons miniatures as part of their Icons of the Realm blind box line. It was nominated for \\"Best Game Accessory\\" in the 2019 Origins Award.  Reception  In Publishers Weekly's \\"Best-selling Books Week Ending December 3, 2018\\", Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica was #17 in \\"Hardcover Nonfiction\\" and the book was called a \\"Black Friday winner\\". Richard Jansen-Parkes, for the UK print magazine Tabletop Gaming, wrote \\"in terms of raw mechanical content Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica is solid throughout, with long sections laying out creatures and monsters unique to the plane as well as a heaping of flavourful magic items. However, while the surface-level information about the great city is stellar ‚Äì the art is beautiful throughout ‚Äì it all feels a little shallow when you come to plot an actual adventure there. It‚Äôs clear that Ravnica is a realm that was never intended to live and breathe in the way that you‚Äôd expect from an RPG setting, and while Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica goes some way to ironing this out there‚Äôs still a lot of work for the DM to do. [...] It‚Äôs a fascinating world to dabble in and borrow from, but falls just short of being a viable plug-and-play setting\\". Gavin Sheehan, for Bleeding Cool, wrote \\"overall, Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica is a fine addition to 5E, but I also recognize this isn't going to be for everyone. [...] DM's and players alike should recognize that there are people who love Dungeons & Dragons to death but have zero interest in Magic: The Gathering. I would recommend this book for people who have played MTG and understand a little bit of what's going on, or players who want to learn more about this world and want to incorporate more of it. It's not impossible to get people with no interest involved, but do prepare yourself for a steeper climb up the hill if you do\\". Matthew Beilman, for CBR.com, highlighted the book's setting and wrote: \\"Ravnica is a rich setting with countless story hooks available for adventurers. The 10 guilds and their machinations on the world city guarantee there is never a shortage of intrigue or varying ways to run a campaign. More traditional dungeon crawls and monster hunting is totally viable, but it's the technological and social elements of the worldwide city that make this setting truly magic\\". In January 2020, Christian Hoffer, for ComicBook, highlighted that over the past 18 months Wizards of the Coast has published \\"product tie- ins with Stranger Things, Rick & Morty, Critical Role, and Magic: The Gathering, plus several new products meant to appeal to new players that have never played D&D; before. [...] Some fans feel that this push for new players has come at the cost of keeping the game's current players sated. These players wonder why D&D; is dedicating resources towards Ravnica (from Magic: The Gathering) and Exandria (from Critical Role) instead of dusting off classic campaign settings like Greyhawk or Dragonlance or Dark Sun, worlds that are mentioned in D&D;'s core rulebooks but haven't gotten any kind of strong focus\\". Hoffer reported that the 5th Edition development process is deliberately slow with the Dungeons & Dragons team publishing about three books a year (from adventure campaigns and rulebooks to campaign setting books). Collaborative IP books, such as Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, Acquisitions Incorporated, and Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, were added \\"to the schedule in addition to D&D;'s three annual publications\\" and thus didn't impact plans to release older settings for the 5th Edition.

Wyatt and F. Wesley Schneider were the lead designers on the book. The new sourcebook was announced on March 2, 2020 after being leaked through an Amazon product listing. While the book was originally scheduled for release on June 2, 2020, printing delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the hardcover release was delayed to July 21, 2020. An alternate art cover of the book was released as a local game store exclusive. The book is also available as a digital product through the following Wizards of the Coast licensees: D&D; Beyond, Fantasy Grounds, and Roll20. When asked in an interview on what elements from the card game were carried over and what elements were cut during development, Wyatt said, \\"I think the process was more additive than anything else, we took the world guides that were created for Theros for the card sets and expanded those to flesh it out. I think of Magic worldbuilding like building a movie set. The old fashioned stereotype of the movie set where you walk down the streets of the town in the western and it's just a facade and there are no actual buildings behind them. The Magic team is very good at creating the illusion that there is a world beyond those walls, but D&D; players need to be able to go there, in ways that the card set doesn't. So, we did a lot of fleshing out\\".

In February 2020, Screen Rant reported that \\"As popular as the setting has been thanks to its Greek influences, the most recent set has experienced some controversy. Following the poor handling of the novel that accompanied the previous set War of the Spark, the story material for Theros Beyond Death was delayed indefinitely; no novel was released, and story updates were never posted on Magic's website. This has disappointed fans greatly, as some very popular characters appeared in Theros Beyond Death and players bemoaned missing the chance to learn more about them. The official statement from Wizards is that it is waiting for the proper time and channel to release the story materials.

Icons of the Realm  WizKids released a set of 45 Mythic Odysseys of Theros themed Dungeons & Dragons miniatures as part of their Icons of the Realm blind box line.  Reception  In Publishers Weekly's \\"Best-selling Books Week Ending July 25, 2020\\", Mythic Odysseys of Theros was #7 in \\"Hardcover Nonfiction\\" and sold 14,028 units. Gavin Sheehan, for Bleeding Cool, reported that the timing of book's publication, between Critical Role's sourcebook and the COVID-19 pandemic, meant that Mythic Odysseys Of Theros \\"got passed over in a lot of eyes\\" especially since by the time of the D&D; Live 2020 event the focus had shifted to the new adventure book Icewind Dale: Rime Of The Frostmaiden. Sheehan wrote that while the book is a good sourcebook it also \\"feels like a throwaway book made simply to rehook MTG players after Ravnica\\". Sheehan highlighted that the book has similar flaws as the Magic card set it is based on and that \\"there's an argument that you can miss entire sets of the TCG and not play the game for years, come back, and pick up right where you left off with the caveat of having to learn a few things that changed while you were away. And part of that theory is that some of the sets are just straight up forgettable and don't play into any major storyline or development of the game as a whole. And Theros is one of those sets as it came, did its thing for a year, and barely left a mark on the series. It makes for interesting storytelling, but it fails to seize on a lot of the things that make MTG popular, which shows up in this book as well\\". Riley Silverman, for Nerdist, highlighted that the setting of the sourcebook \\"is entirely self-contained within the gaming system. You don‚Äôt need to know the card block or even any Greek mythology to play it\\". Silverman wrote that \\"Theros is a setting for players looking for a little more Clash of the Titans instead of Lord of the Rings. [...] One of the biggest departures from other D&D; games is just how active a role gods play within Theros. [...] I particularly love the way the book incorporates the flavor of the gods themselves in their individual chapters, including examples of myths the folk of Theros might have about them. [...] If you‚Äôve got the time to invest and a group willing to look over a new setting, Theros offers a unique D&D; experience that allows for a break from the type of story without having to learn another gaming system, and it‚Äôs a vibrant and exciting setting that is definitely worth a look\\". Simon Yule, for GeekDad, wrote \\"Fans of Magic The Gathering will recognize this new setting, as Mythic Odysseys of Theros comes straight from WotC‚Äôs other main product line. And, like the accidental second child of an already stretched and loveless marriage, D&D; fans will have to put up with some of Magic‚Äòs oversized hand-me-downs. But don‚Äôt worry: those slightly worn-out jeans and unwanted, stained Converse All-Stars can find a new lease of life as second hand treasure\\". Yule highlighted that the sourcebook includes 50 pages of new monsters including new Mythic level monsters that add \\"a brand new mechanic to help DMs keep their players guessing. Each of these creatures has Mythic Traits and Actions which the Dungeon Master can use to ramp up the difficulty and really hammer home the sense of a truly terrifying and world-ending threat\\". Yule also highlighted that the sourcebook adds new player races and reprints some races, however, \\"in Theros they have their own unique traits, abilities, and characteristics that distinguish them from their Forgotten Realms counterparts\\".

The campus includes Firth Court, Alfred Denny Building, Western Bank library and Arts Tower, Geography and Planning building, Bartolom√© House, Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings, the Sheffield Students' Union building, the Octagon Centre, Graves Building, Hicks Building and the Information Commons. The nearest motorway is the A57. Location The Western Bank Campus refers to the campus area located to the west of the Sheffield Inner Ring Road. It is so called because this campus has expanded from Firth Court on Western Bank. To the east of the ring road is the St George‚Äôs campus area of the university. The Western Bank Campus is divided by Western Bank (A57) into the northern and the southern areas. The University Concourse under the A57 flyover connects Alfred Denny Building on the north of Western Bank and Students' Union on the south. Three pedestrian crossings (at Firth Court, at the Arts Tower and at Favell Road) allows easily moving between buildings in this cluster. Buildings in the northern area=Firth Court and Alfred Denny Building The University Concourse underpass that leads to Firth Court and Alfred Denny Building Firth Court is the main administrative centre for the University of Sheffield, stands at the heart of the university precinct on Western Bank. It originally housed the Arts, Science and Medicine departments, while it is currently home to the Department for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and Biomedical Science. The Grade II listed building, named after Mark Firth, was designed by Edward Mitchel Gibbs and built in 1903 to 1905. Firth Court is a red brick Edwardian building with ashlar dressings and slate roofs in Perpendicular Revival style. The building was opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1905. Located to the left of Firth Court, the Rotunda is the Registrar and Secretary's Office. Formerly the Edgar Allen Library, it is an neo-Gothic style octagonal chapter house opened 26 April 1909 by Prince and Princess of Wales, which has a circular arcade with compound piers and transoms containing portraits of university benefactors. It is linked to the main block via a glazed corridor. The Firth Court quadrangle, comprising Firth Hall Block, North Block, West Block, and Florey and Addison buildings, was completed in 1914 also by Gibbs. Gibbs planned to build a double quadrangle but was never happened. During the Second World War, the quadrangle was converted into an air raid shelter. Alfred Denny Building, a red brick building named after the first Professor of Zoology at the department, is connected to Firth Court via the Addison Building. The building houses the Biomedical Science, Animal and Plant Science Departments including its associated museum, Disability and Dyslexia Support Service, and the Perak Laboratories. Western Bank Library and Arts Tower The Arts Tower is a Grade II* listed building opened in 1966. It was the tallest structure in Sheffield from 1965 to 2010, and is the tallest university building in the UK. The building, previously housed several academic departments, is now mainly an administration block and has the architecture department in it. The Arts Tower houses one of Europe's few surviving examples of a paternoster lift. A bridge at the mezzanine level links the tower to the Western Bank Library. The two buildings, both designed by Gollins Melvin Ward, are intended to be viewed together.Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004) Pevsner City Guides: Sheffield, pp82-84\\\\. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. The library was designed as a result of a national competition. It was opened by poet T. S. Eliot in 1959. Formerly known as the University Library, the Western Bank Library was the main library of the University of Sheffield until the Information Commons was established in April 2007. The Grade II*-listed library is home to 25,000 rare books and 150 special collections. Bartolom√© House Bartolom√© House, Sheffield Law School Bartolom√© House is a set of grade II-listed buildings on Winter Street, which house the School of Law at the University of Sheffield. It was designed by S. L. Swann in Gothic Revival style in red brick with ashlar dressings and slate roofs. Originally constructed in 1881 as the Winter Street Hospital for Infectious Diseases, it became a dedicated tuberculosis hospital in 1912, and was later the St George's Hospital for geriatric patients, which closed in 1990. After refurbishment it became the School of Nursing for the University of Sheffield in 1997. It was named Bartolom√© House in 1998 after Dr Mariano Martin de Bartolom√©, who was President of the Sheffield Medical School for 22 years in the 19th century. In 2008 it was taken over by the School of Law. Other buildings The Dainton Building, houses the Department of Chemistry and Faculty of Sciences, is named after Sheffield academic chemist and university chancellor Frederick Sydney Dainton. The East Wing of Dainton Building was renamed Richard Roberts Building after Nobel Laureate and University graduate Richard Roberts. The Dainton Building was opened by the Duke of Scarborough in the 1950s. The East Wing (Richard Roberts Building) was built in 1961, followed by the West Wing (Haworth Wing) in 1964, and the North Wing (Beaumont Wing) in 1968. The Geography and Planning building is located next to Weston Park opposite Bartolom√© House. It was designed as a cluster of hexagons in 1960, and is home to the departments of Geography, and Urban Studies and Planning. Buildings in the southern area=University House and Octagon Centre The original University House was built in 1963, which is one of the first buildings with glass curtain walls in the world. The building complex was redesigned and refurbished by HLM architects between 2012 and 2013, and currently known, together with adjacent Link buildings, as the Students' Union Building. The Octagon Centre is a multi-purpose conference centre and music venue situated at the Western Bank campus. The Octagon Centre comprises an eight-sided auditorium with a capacity of 1,600, offices, meeting rooms, and a lounge with bar and patio. The University Grants Committee agreed to construct a new oval shaped theatre in 1958 next to University House. The plan was suspended in 1963, and instead, the Drama Studio was refurbished from the former Glossop Road Baptist Church and opened in 1970 as a studio theatre. In 1981, the university had made plans to build a new premises and the Octagon Centre building was eventually opened in 1983. The Octagon Centre consists of a main auditorium known as the Convocation Hall, with offices and meeting rooms in corridors across two floors at a lower elevation on the southern side of the building, and a bar lounge. All of these areas are connected by a foyer entrance block. The building is connected to University House by a skyway, offering access to University House's catering facilities.

The body profile is deep and stout with a dark blotch on the upper region of the gill cover. This species can grow up a maximum length of . Pacific Ocean specimens have generally pale reddish brown to yellowish brown, with numerous small dense brownish spots on the head, fins and the body. Disitribution Cephalopholis sonnerati is has an Indo-Pacific distribution which extends from the coast of East Africa from the Gulf of Aden south to Durban in South Africa; east in to the Pacific Ocean as far as the Line Islands, north as far as southern Japan and south to Australia. In Australia it is found from the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia to the vicinity of Darwin, Northern Territory and from the Cape York Peninsula, Queensland to the South West Rocks, New South Wales, as well as Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea. It is not found in the Chagos Island, the Red Sea or Persian Gulf Habitat and biology Cephalopholis sonnerati occurs on deep lagoon reefs, outer reef slopes and in coastal areas with rocky substrate. The juveniles are usually found near sponge or coral heads. It is a solitary species with adults usually being accompanied by cleaner shrimps. They live in moderate depths of 30 to 100 m (98 to 332 ft). It feeds on small fishes and crustaceans. Maturity for males is reached at 34cm (13 inches ) and 28cm (11 inches) for females. Taxonomy Cephalopholis sonnerati was first formally described as Serranus sonnerati in 1828 by the French zoologist Achille Valenciennes (1794-1864) with the type locality give as Puducherry in India. Utilisation This species is of commercial importance and usually sold fresh throughout its range. The tomato hind is caught using hook and line, spear, and in traps. It is found at Hong Kong live reef fish markets.

In 1830, he became the first horse to earn the title of Leading sire in North America, followed by wins in 1831, 1832, 1833 and 1836. Background Sir Charles was a chestnut stallion bred in Virginia by James J. Harrison and foaled at Harrison's Diamond Grove plantation in Brunswick County. He was sired by Sir Archy, who is generally regarded as the first great American-bred racehorse and sire. In addition to Sir Charles, Sir Archy sired Bertrand (who also became a leading sire) and Timoleon (the sire of Boston who in turn sired the great Lexington). Sir Archy was by Diomed, who won the first Epsom Derby in 1780 but had little success at stud in England. Imported into America in 1798 at the advanced age of 21, Diomed proved himself \\"utterly revolutionary\\" as a stallion in his new country. His sire line dominated the North American breeding lists through the 19th century. Little is known about the dam of Sir Charles, a mare by Citizen. She is a member of American Family 19, which descends from Jenny Dismal, imported from England in 1756. Jenny Dismal is thought to descend from Sister to Leedes, though this is not documented in the English Stud Book. Racing career Sir Charles won twenty times from twenty six starts, and finished second four times. He raced mainly in the heat races that were the fashion of the time, at distances ranging from two to four miles. In heat racing, a horse had to win two heats on the same day to be considered the winner of the race. If different horses won the first two heats, a third heat was required to determine the winner. His wins were broken down by distance as \\"four at four-mile heats, four of three-mile heats, six of two-mile heats, in six, distances not given.\\" Sir Charles' last race was his most famous, even though it was a loss. Sir Charles was considered the champion of the South and American Eclipse was the champion of the North. Harrison issued a challenge to the owner of Eclipse on September 30, 1822, referring to Sir Charles as \\"this Golden horse, that commanded the wind to stand still, and all creation to bend before him,\\" while conceding that Eclipse was said to be a fine horse who \\"would be benefitted [sic] by southern fame\\". The two were set to race on November 22 at the Washington, D.C. course in the first of what became a series of North-South challenge races. Unfortunately, Sir Charles \\"struck a tendon\\" the day before the race and Harrison had to pay a $5,000 forfeit. Harrison agreed to one heat, which American Eclipse then won with ease. Stud career After retirement from racing, Sir Charles was purchased by Col. William Ransom Johnson of Chesterfield County, Virginia, who owned the Oaklands plantation on the Appomattox River. Sir Charles first stood at Oaklands and was later moved to a nearby stud owned by George W. Johnson, William Johnson's son. John Charles Craig purchased a half interest. In 1830, Sir Charles headed the American sire list, compiled by pedigree consultant Anne Peters, in the first year for which specific data was available. Prior to 1830, the list was not broken down by year, and win totals were not available. In 1830, horses sired by Sir Charles won 38 races, with Bonnets o' Blue being his top earner. Sir Charles led the sire list four more times, in 1831 with 19 wins, 1832 with 43 wins, 1833 with 23 wins and 1836 with 28 wins. His best runners include Wagner (winner of 14 of 20 races), Bonnets O'Blue and Trifle. Sir Charles' sire line persisted through Wagner until the end of the century, but he proved most influential through his daughters. Bonnets O'Blue produced Hall of Fame inductee Fashion, Rosalie Somers produced Revenue (who himself was a leading sire) and Charlotte Hamilton was an ancestor of the great Himyar. Sir Charles died on June 7, 1833. Pedigree An asterisk before a horse's name means they were imported into America.

It was a short four mile line (eventually with about five miles of lateral connections) extending from Port Carbon, Pennsylvania along the Mill Creek towards active anthracite coal mines. Its purpose was to transport mined coal to Port Carbon which was the terminus for the Schuylkill Canal, the conduit to markets in Philadelphia. History A legislative act authorizing the incorporation of the Mill Creek and Mine Hill Navigation and Railroad Company was passed by the Pennsylvania legislature on February 7, 1828.HISTORY OF SCHUYLKILL COUNTY, PA, with Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers, New York: W.

It was a wooden strap-rail/animal powered operation. The railroad was visited by some of the managers of the Schuylkill Navigation to see this method of tranport. Pott had thirteen cars loaded, ready to take to the canal, when they saw him fasten a single horse to the lead car. They asked if he proposed to move one car with one horse. When they saw this one animal move the entire train of thirteen cars (about twenty tons) to the canal, they were quite surprised and it became clear that railroads were destined to become intertwined with coal mining in America.

The Schuylkill Canal extended from Philadelphia to Port Carbon. The Canal above Reading was constructed primarily to transport coal and timber from the source to Philadelphia In May, 1829, work began on the two-mile, 40-inch gauge railroad. By July 4, 1829, it was near completion and coal was being transported and passed to the canal in that same year,Heydinger, Earl J., Railroads of the First and Second Anthracite Coal Fields of Pennsylvania, Bulletin of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society, Volumes 106, April 1962, pp.37-38 prior to its completion, making it the third commercial operational railroad in the United Staes. The railroad utilized English strap rail which enabled a single horse to easily pull six tons in six cars, and the Mill Creek R. R. was the first line in operation in the Southern Anthracite Coal Field. From its opening date, between150 to 225 tons of mined coal were carried over the line daily. The finished railroad initially had a four-mile main line and three miles of laterals.Heydinger, April 1962, pp. 37-38 Mill Creek flowing through present day Port Carbon, PA.Philadelphia rail advocate George W. Smith described the Mill Creek railroad in 1832, as quickly and cheaply built without direction of an engineer and in the infancy of railroads. Heydinger, April 1962, p. 38 Eventually it had nine lateral branches totaling five miles. It carried 30,300 tons of coal, in 1831, for an average haul of three miles. Horse power and the 40-inch gauge prevailed on the Mill Creek until 1844 when a link with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R;) brought implementation of iron T-rails and standard gauge. The P&R; had constructed a 2.5 mile railroad to Port Carbon to connect with its terminal at Mount Carbon, Pennsylvania and offering mine operators alternative railroad transportation for mined coal.Report of the Operations of the Philadelphia and Reading Company, Moss:Philadelphia, 1844, p. 56 In 1849, the Mill Creek R. R. distribution to the Schuylkill Canal and the P&R; was over 100,000 tons of coal to the canal and 140,000 tons to the railroad. An 1857 charter supplement authorized the Mill Creek R.

Chely Lima (born 1957) is a queer Cuban American writer of novels, poetry, and plays, as well as a photographer, editor, and screenwriter.  Biography  Lima was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1957. His father was a doctor, and he had several half-siblings. He was educated in his native city, including studying Japanese at the Instituto de Idiomas M√°ximo Gorki in Miramar. In 1978 he began to work in the offices of the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematogr√°ficos, and the following year he began to work in radio, writing for a musical and news show. In 1979 he met the writer Alberto Serret, who became his husband and collaborator on many literary and artistic projects. The couple worked so closely together, \\"It's not possible for me to delineate Chely and Alberto,\\" their longtime friend and fellow poet Sigfredo Ariel said. The following year, the two moved to Isla de la Juventud, where Lima worked with a children's theater group and as a literary advisor. He also began working as an editor of a literary magazine. His first book of poems, Tiempo nuestro, was released in 1981, after having won the University of Havana's 13 de Marzo Prize the previous year. The next year he published a book of stories, Mon√≥logo con lluvia, which had also been recognized in 1980 with the David Prize. Lima published his first works of science fiction in the 1983 book Espacio abierto, written in collaboration with Serret, with whom he also wrote his first work of theater, Retratos, which was published the following year. In 1986 he began to write TV scripts for the series Del lado del coraz√≥n, also with Serret. The following year the couple premiered Violente, the very first Cuban rock opera. He received the 13 de Marzo prize again in 1987 for his children's book El barrio de los elefantes. In that same year he also wrote the TV series Hoy es siempre todav√≠a in collaboration with Serret, Da√≠na Chaviano, and Antonio Orlando Rodr√≠guez, which also received several prizes. In 1990 he published his first work of crime fiction, the book of stories Los asesinos las prefieren rubias, again co-authored with Serret. The couple also released the cantata Se√±or de la alborada that year. The following year, Lima published his first novel, Brujas. In February of that year, Lima moved to Ecuador with his partner, where he worked on a variety of projects including for TV and radio. He worked as an editor for the Ecuadorean newspapers Hoy, El Comercio, and La Hora. He also taught classes and workshops at the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador, Universidad Cat√≥lica de Santiago de Guayaquil, and other institutions. He published his novels Confesiones nocturnas and Tri√°ngulos m√°gicos in Mexico in 1994. That year he also began to work for the Ecuadorian national TV channel Ecuavisa, for which he co-wrote with Serret the miniseries El Chulla Romero y Flores (1995), 7 lunas, 7 serpientes (1996), and Solo de guitarra (1997). From 1997 until 2003 he worked as part of the writing team for the series Pasado y confeso. In 1998, Lima won the Juan Rulfo Prize for Children's Literature for his story El cerdito que amaba el ballet. After 22 years of partnership, Serret died of a heart attack in 2001. Lima remained in Ecuador for a few more years and immersed himself in various projects, including the script for the play Tres historias de hotel, which premiered in Quito in 2001. Lima moved to Buenos Aires in 2003, where he stayed for a few years. There, he joined the writing team for the telenovela Yo vendo unos ojos negros, taught scriptwriting classes, and in 2006 wrote, along with Jos√© Zambrano Brito, the script for a film adaptation of Lima's unpublished novel Filo de amor. In late 2006, Lima moved to the United States, settling first in San Francisco, where he completed an internship at the De Young Museum. In 2007 he began working in photography. The following year he moved to Miami, where he currently resides and teaches creative writing and screenwriting workshops at Miami-Dade College and other institutions. Lima is transgender, and his work has touched on sexuality, gender identity, and how social conventions can impede individual freedoms. Although Lima publicly came out as trans later in life, he told an interviewer in 2016 that, \\"In my case, for my close friends‚Äîat least those with whom I could be honest‚Äîand for the people with whom I've lived as a couple, it was never a secret that I have always been a man.

She married her cousin Francisco Serrano y Dom√≠nguez, 20 years her senior, on 29 September 1850 in Madrid. She became a Dame of the Order of Maria Luisa in 1856.  Sexenio democr√°tico  Winterhalter Following the overthrow of Isabella II in the 1868 Glorious Revolution, many members of the aristocracy vied for the return of the Bourbons; however the Duchess of La Torre (whose husband soon became President of the Provisional Government and later Regent of the Realm) had no interest whatsoever in such prospect and confronted the likes of Sofia Trubetskaya, the Duchess of Sesto and Marchioness of Alca√±ices, founding a rival political salon in Madrid. Always involved in the affairs of her husband, both political and particular, she also displayed a mutual animadversion and rivalry towards Francisca Ag√ºero, the widow duchess of Prim. Following the election of Amadeo of Savoy to the Spanish throne in 1870, the new king offered Antonia Dom√≠nguez the Court post of Camarera mayor de la Reina but she rejected it. After the in January 1874, she became a prominent figure of the First Spanish Republic, which became presided by her husband as a sort of a Spanish MacMahon.

It was an independent school, not attached to any particular church or monastery. The origins of the school are unclear. The Patriarch Acacius (485‚Äì495/6) taught in Seleucia-Ctesiphon after leaving the School of Edessa and this has been taken as evidence for the school in the late 5th century. According to the foundation legend in the Chronicle of Siirt, the Patriarch Aba I (540‚Äì552) defeated a Zoroastrian adversary in a debate and founded the school at that very spot. This is not mentioned in Aba's earlier and more reliable biography. A fragment of Bar·∏•adbshabba's On the Cause of the Foundation of the Schools also ascribes the founding of the school to Aba I. Jean Maurice Fiey argues that the school of Acacius was re-founded under Aba. The Chronicle of Siirt states that it was restored and rebuilt under the Patriarch Ezekiel (567‚Äì581). It was certainly in existence by that time. Its early prestige can be judged by the fact that its headmaster or director, Ishai, took part in the selection of a new patriarch. When, between 596 and 602, the Roman emperor Maurice sent a certain Maruta as ambassador to the Sasanian king Khosrau II, the ambassador listened to lectures at the school, gave gifts to the students and was received directions for his return journey from the headmaster, Bokhtisho . The school appears to have been at the centre of the Christian community in the Sasanian capital and could host a visiting Roman dignitary. There was some exchange of personnel and texts between the School of Seleucia and the older School of Nisibis. According to the Chronicle of Siirt, Aba studied at Nisibis before founding the school in Seleucia. Gregory of Kashkar, who became archbishop of Nisibis (c.596) after studying there, originally studied the Psalms at Seleucia. The Patriarch Ishoyahb III (649‚Äì659) studied at Nisibis and tried to move part of the School of Seleucia to the Monastery of Beth Abe, probably to protect it after the fall of the Sasanian Empire to the Arabs. In the late 7th and early 8th century, Gabriel Arya of Beth Qatraye taught at Seleucia. Among his students were the future patriarchs Hnanisho I (686‚Äì700) and Aba II (742‚Äì753). Gabriel is known to have written biblical commentaries and Aba II works of philosophy. The latter had a dispute with his clergy over the running of the school.

This unit provides general engineering support during military operations. It is an Echelon Above Brigade (EAB) engineer unit, composed of five-line companies, one support company, one headquarters company, and one firefighting detachment. As of October 16, 2005, it is stationed at Fort Knox under the 20th Engineer Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps.

MOTTO: ACUTUS ACUMEN (1952-1976) ACUTUM ACUMEN (1976-Present) Translation: \\"SHARP INGENUITY\\"  Unit History = World War II  The parent unit of the 19th Engineer Battalion was constituted on October 1, 1933, in the Regular Army as the 36th Engineer Regiment. The 19th Engineer Battalion originated as the 3rd Battalion of the 36th Engineer Combat Regiment. The regiment was activated at Plattsburg Barracks in June 1941. The Regiment was trained for amphibious and support operation, earning the unit its distinctive seahorse. During World War II, the battalion conducted five amphibious landings while accompanying allied armies through Africa, Italy, France, Germany, and Austria. 3rd Battalion deployed to the North Africa Campaign in 1942, where it conducted its first contested amphibious landing as a part of Operation Torch. The unit would move with and support allied forces east through North Africa during the Tunisia Campaign. After pushing Axis forces out of North Africa, the battalion participated in the Battle of Sicily, its second amphibious landing. It would push across the island with the 7th Army, eventually forcing German and Italian forces off Sicily. The unit followed across the Mediterranean, taking part in its third amphibious assault at Naples-Foggia, followed by its fourth in support of Operation Shingle near Anzio. For fifty days, the battalion was part of the 7 miles (11 kilometers) Brigade front, earning the distinction as \\"The Little Seahorse Division\\" by the German Army. In 1944, the 3rd Battalion participated in the invasion of southern France, code-named Operation Dragoon, conducting what would be its fifth and final amphibious assault of the war. It would continue to support Allied forces through three subsequent campaigns: the Rhineland Campaign, the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign, and the Central Europe Campaign. On February 15, 1945, the unit was re-designated the 36th Engineer Combat Group, with the 3rd Battalion being re-designated the 2828th Combat Engineer Battalion at Fort Lewis. The battalion had suffered 902 combat casualties, including 44 killed in action. For their gallantry and service, the battalion was awarded 10 campaign streamers from World War II. Soldiers in the battalion earned seven Silver Stars and 13 Bronze Stars.  Cold War  Stateside = On April 29, 1947, the 2828th Engineer Battalion was re- designated the 19th Engineer Combat Battalion and activated at Fort Meade, MD on July 9, 1952. During this time it focused mainly on training, local construction, and domestic relief missions on the East Coast of the United States. In October 1954, it responded to the destruction caused by Hurricane Hazel, helping to clear and rebuild the area around Cambridge and Wingate, Maryland. In August 1955, the 19th assisted the citizens of northern Pennsylvania after Hurricane Diane caused massive flooding in the region. In the winter of 1958, the battalion returned to Maryland to assist with a snow emergency in Baltimore. Finally, they travelled to French Creek in Pennsylvania where they conducted explosive clearing of ice floes in two gorges to prevent flooding. = Vietnam War = In 1965, the Battalion deployed to Vietnam in an amphibious landing on the beaches of Qui Nhon. Its primary mission was to upgrade highway QL-1 from a dirt trail to an all- weather road connecting Qui Nhon and Bong Son. The first phase of this project consisted of the construction of seven Bailey Bridges, decking three existing railroad bridges, and building six timber trestle bridges. During this time, the battalion completed construction projects in support of the Republic of Korea Tiger Division, the 4th Cavalry Division, the Americal Division, the 4th Infantry Division, and the 199th Light Infantry Brigade, to include port and airfield repair, warehouses, fuel and ammo depots, and pipelines. In the end, the 19th improved and upgraded more than 70 kilometers of QL-1, constructing 11 Bailey Bridges and 34 timber pile bridges, so multiple times, through near- daily enemy contact. The unit returned to Fort Lewis, on October 14, 1970, having suffered more than 505 casualties including 105 killed in action.  Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm  The Battalion deployed to Saudi Arabia in early 1991 in support of the 1st Armored Division, during which time they constructed two crossing routes over the Trans-Arabian pipeline. With the beginning of the invasion of Iraq on February 24, B Company pushed 200 lanes through the berms along the Iraq/Saudi Arabia border. As the 1st Armored Division pushed into Iraq, the battalion built 220 km of road and constructed FARPs for 4th Aviation Brigade's AH-64 Apache helicopters. They also provided recovery support for the 1st Armored Division as their vehicles became stuck in the wet sand of the region. All told, the 19ths built or maintained more than 475 km of roads, 15 helipads, four pipeline crossings, three prisoner holding areas, and 241 points of entry into Iraq.  Global War on Terror  Operation Iraqi Freedom = On October 16, 2005, the 19th Engineer Battalion was reactivated at Fort Knox, KY, as the Army's first modular Engineer Battalion, allowing each company to deploy individually in support of US operations. In August 2006, the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Forward Support Company, 15th Engineer Company, and 72d Survey and Design Detachment deployed to Iraq, followed in October by the 60th Engineer Company. The battalion was assigned the mission of assured mobility, partnering with Iraqi Army Engineer Units to provide General Engineering (GE) support within Task Force Lightning's (25th Infantry Division) Area of Operations (AO). It repaired 2664 road craters and 40 destroyed culverts throughout its 15-month deployment, returning to Fort Knox in November 2007. = Operation Enduring Freedom = In December 2006, the 76th Engineer Company deployed to Afghanistan in support of a brigade expansion. With the Afghan Theater expanding to include two Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), life support capabilities needed to be expanded to accommodate the increased troop presence. As such, half of the company began construction to expand Bagram Airfield before moving to FOB Fenty in February 2007 to rapidly expand housing and infrastructure. The other half of the company was tasked with the same mission at FOB Salerno before the company reconsolidated at FOB Fenty in June 2007. When 173d Airborne Brigade Combat Team took over the battlespace, 76th continued their work, constructing 185 B-huts, four SEA-huts, and six brick- and-mortar barracks across 14 FOBs. The company was then tasked with the winterization of the theater, constructing or upgrading infrastructure at 16 FOBs simultaneously. The company returned to Fort Knox in March 2008. On April 28, 2009, the battalion returned to Afghanistan with 15th Engineer Company, 60th Engineer Company, 76th Engineer Company, and eventually 502d Multi-role Bridge Company, setting up its battalion command post at Kandahar Air Field. With Kandahar as the main hub, the battalion pushed companies to FOBs Wolverine, Frontenac, and Spin Buldak, respectively. Though deployed independently of each other, the three engineer companies had similar missions: expanding life support areas and improving FOB security and force protection measures throughout their AOs. These improvements included helipads, taxiways, UAV landing strips, berms, entry control points, and ammunition holding areas among other construction projects. In total, the battalion completed more than $23 million worth of work while deployed. In August 2009, 502 MRBC joined the battalion in Afghanistan to conduct fixed and float bridging operations throughout Afghanistan. Most of the company, including the headquarters, was stationed at Camp Leatherneck to support operations in the Helmand river valley, while one platoon remained at Kandahar. These elements provided bridge site reconnaissance and support to their respective AOs. Sites included the Saracha Bridge along Highway 1, the Regak Bridge in Uruzgan Province, and the construction of a Mabey Johnson Bridge at the Andar Bridge site. In April 2010, the 19th Engineer Battalion began its return to Fort Knox.

Biography  Fifi Mukuna Fifi Mukuna was born in Kinshasa in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1968. Her father was a diplomat. She attended elementary school in Belgium, where her father was assigned, and became a fan of Bob et Bobette, a comic series created by Willy Vandersteen. She became interested in drawing, and on her return to Zaire she studied at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Kinshasa in 1989.Christine Avignon, \\"Portrait de Fifi Mukuna, la premi√®re femme caricaturiste du Congo\\", Africultures, 2009-12-11 After graduating, Mukuna began contributing political caricatures to various newspapers and magazines including Le Palmar√®s, Le Phare, and Le Grognon, working closely with popular Congolese artists and graphic designers. Of her work as a caricaturist for Le Phare, she has said, \\"It was dangerous, but I enjoyed it a lot.\\" Some of this work was published under a pseudonym, and many readers assumed she was a man, which protected her when authorities on one occasion came to the newspaper office to pressure the artists not to draw. She also published comic strips in the journal of the Franco-Congolese Alliance, a Congolese nonprofit association operating in partnership with the Alliance Fran√ßaise in Paris. Mukuna received further training through workshops organized by the Centre Wallonie-Bruxelles. In 2001, she contributed to a collection of work by African authors, √Ä l'ombre du baobab, in which she focused on the lives of street children. Concerned about increasing backlash to her caricatures after the government discovered her identity, Mukuna left her country in 2002 and settled in France. She received political refugee status, and her children were able to come live with her in France, but her husband who had stayed behind in Kinshasa died before he was able to join her. In France, Mukuna resumed her work as a comic book author. She contributed to the third issue of Afrobulles, the publication of the collective of the same name led by another Congolese cartoonist, Alix Fuili, as well as three other collections: Une journ√©e dans la vie d'un africain d'Afrique, L√†-bas ... Na poto, and New Arrivals. She also contributed to the Italian magazine Linus, in collaboration with the writer Christophe Ngalle Edimo, and participated in the exhibition Matite africane. She also collaborated with Edimo on an adaptation of a story by Carl Norac on the theme of water and ecology. In 2005 she published the comic Si tu me suis autour du monde.Sa√¢d-Edine Fatmi, La bande dessin√©e africaine : de l‚Äôimitation √† l‚Äôaffirmation?, Universit√© de Mascara, agence universitaire de la Francophonie. She published her first solo graphic novel, Kisi le Collier, in 2013. Beyond producing her own work, Mukuna teaches, including at the Higher Regional School of Visual Art in Tourcoing. She is also a cultural ambassador for the Alliance Fran√ßaise and the Red Cross.

Terms According to the initial agreement, Mozambique will eliminate tariffs on various Indonesian goods - primarily palm oil and its derivatives, but also certain industrial products such as pharmaceuticals and papers. There are also other Indonesian commodities with tariffs being cut by 25 to 70 percent from their initial tariffs. Indonesia, on the other hand, eliminated tariffs on Mozambican nuts, soybeans, sunflower seeds, cotton, and aluminium, in addition to reduction of tariffs ranging from 20 to 40 percent. Overall, this covered 217 Indonesian products and 242 Mozambican products. Both parties would be capable of requesting a review of the agreement two years after it has been ratified and implemented. History Negotiators in Maputo, February 2019, during final negotiations Initial agreement between the heads of state of the two countries to form a preferential trade agreement (PTA) occurred in 2017, during a meeting of the Indian Ocean Rim Association. Negotiations for a potential PTA between Indonesia and Mozambique were proposed in April 2018, during the Indonesia‚ÄìAfrica Forum in Bali. In addition to Mozambique, negotiations were also initiated following the event with Morocco and Tunisia. In that year, Indonesia and Mozambique traded US$91.9 million worth of goods with one another, with a trade balance of US$30.9 million in favor of Indonesia. The initial round of negotiations began in Maputo between 31 May and 1 June 2018. In total, three rounds of negotiations were held ‚Äì the initial negotiations, another round in November 2018, and a final round in February 2019. The final agreement was signed in Maputo between Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita and his Mozambican counterpart Ragendra de Sousa (Minister of Industry and Commerce) on 27 August 2019, during the annual international trade fair FACIM.

He was Professor of Archaeology at the University of the Witwatersrand.  Early life and career  Mason was born in Johannesburg, grew up in Saxonwold and matriculated from St John's College. He attained a B.Comm degree from the University of the Witwatersrand and was awarded the Aitken medal for the best graduate in commerce as well as the Chamber of Industries medal and the Dean‚Äôs award. However after attending a lecture presented by the anthropologist Raymond Dart he became fascinated with archaeology and decided to study it at the University of Cape Town. He was awarded his doctorate in archaeology at the age of 28, with a thesis entitled \\"The prehistory of the Transvaal : a record of human activity.\\" At the age of 24 he had successfully excavated Makapansgat and in so doing discerned three layers of the Stone Age within the excavation. He returned on occasion to St John's to present talks on new archaeological finds and led the St John's College Archaeology Club to excavate a Boer War site in the Magaliesberg. In 1954, at the age of 25, Mason climbed the Brandberg Mountain in Namibia searching for rock art created by the indigenous San people. He discovered abstract San rock art that became known as the Brandberg Picasso. Mason was appointed a professor by Wits as a successor to Clarence van Riet Lowe. In 1976 the university created the Archaeological Research Unit for Mason and his staff and appointed him as Director, a post he held until his early retirement in 1989. During his career Mason excavated several significant sites including Melville Koppies, Linksfield Ridge, Bruma, and Sterkfontein. He discovered prehistoric iron furnaces and Tswana villages in Johannesburg and excavated a site in Broederstroom which dates back to 300 CE. Part of his life's work was the construction of an archaeological map of the North West and Gauteng provinces. This map is a direct contradiction of the myth perpetuated by the Apartheid government in which it was claimed that the southern portion of the African continent was uninhabited until the arrival of the Dutch settlers in 1652, the so-called \\"empty land\\" myth.

It was founded in 1921 at the University of Missouri. Eventually chartering at least three chapters, it survived into the 1950s. History and Mission Pi Delta Nu's origin dates to April 12, 1921 with its establishment at the University of Missouri. Annual editions of the Missouri Savitar yearbook show it continuing until at least 1956 at the school.1924 The Missouri Savitar yearbook, p.370, accessed 24 Aug 2020.

A third unit was established at Syracuse University with active members at least until 1940.A member was noted at Syracuse for being tapped into the \\"General Science Honorary\\" of Pi Delta Nu in 1940, as mentioned in the Gamma Phi Beta magazine, December, 1940, p.47, accessed 24 Aug 2020. There may have been others. The society was originally organized for women in chemistry, but later widened its scope to include girls interested in the fields of bacteriology, zoology, pre-medicine, and physical therapy.1952 Minnesota Gopher yearbook, p.321, accessed 24 Aug 2020. The first two editions of the Missouri Savitar yearbook showing the group actually list the society as \\"Pi Delta Nu and The Retort,\\" indicating it may have evolved from a publication committee. Its motto, as cited soon after WWII, was: \\"Victory Through Foresight.\\" The sorority had three purposes: \\"To bring together women interested in science, to help fit women for scientific careers, and to inculcate scholarly ideals in its members.\\" Chapters *1921 Alpha chapter - University of Missouri *1922 Beta chapter - University of Minnesota *19xx _____ chapter - Syracuse University Insignia and Traditions Pi Delta Nu's badge had originally been an oblong square in gold, with a band in the center supporting its letters. This was soon replaced, according to yearbook photos, by a stylized pin in gold, consisting of two equilateral triangles pointing up and down and overlapping, with the letters of the sorority on a center band. Above the letters was a silhouette of a glass beaker used in chemistry called a retort. The pin was surrounded by 22 pearls, eleven above and eleven below. The sorority's flower was the violet. Its color was similarly \\"gentian violet,\\" noteworthy as the name of a dye that was once used in certain antibacterial and classification procedures. The Fraternity's magazine was The Retort, named after a common glass distillation flask.

There were up to 30 fielders and 3 innings, making the game finish in a day. https://www.wnpr.org/post/there-was-baseball-there-was-wicket\\"But there are big differences between cricket and wicket, starting with the wicket itself. In the game of wicket, the wicket was long: six feet, and low, only inches above the ground, making it easy for the bowler or pitcher to knock the wicket off its stumps. But the wicket batsmen had an answer to the long exposed wicket: a big paddle-like bat that resembled an oversized spoon. Another big difference was the duration of the game. With as many as 30 people fielding the ball, and only three innings, a wicket game can wrap up in an afternoon, unlike cricket matches that can last for days.\\" The creases that batters had to run across to score runs were called \\"Tick Marks\\", scoring a run (cricket) (which happened when the batters crossed each other and to the other wicket) could be called a \\"cross\\", and the cricket pitch where the ball was bowled was called an alley. Run outs were known as \\"ticking [out]\\" the batter.https://www.friendsofvintagebaseball.org/PDF/wicket.pdf In some forms of wicket, a batter could be out LBW if the ball hit them on the body (known as a \\"sham\\" or \\"shinning\\") thrice under certain circumstances.https://ourgame.mlblogs.com/an-old-yankee-ball- game-1231b6983086\\"The ‚Äúsham‚Äù was when a player dropped on his knees before the wicket and, failing to hit the ball, blocked it with his thighs. It wasn‚Äôt an attitude that allowed hard hitting, but it tired out the best bowlers. This plan drove the opponents of the ‚Äúsham‚Äù team to their wits‚Äô end [...] subsequently a new rule, ‚Äúthree shams out,‚Äù broke up a practice which, if continued, would have wrecked the sport.\\" ReferencesExternal links * https://protoball.org/Chronology:Wicket Category:Forms of cricket ","title":"Wicket (sport)"},{"id":"65068870","text":"The De La Rosa Elevated Walkway is a network of elevated pedway in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines.
