Biography Capewell was born in Birmingham, England and came to the United States in 1845. He was educated in Woodbury, Connecticut and went to work at fifteen for the Scoville Manufacturing Company in Waterbury, Connecticut. At twenty he was Mechanical Superintendent of Cheshire Manufacturing Company. In 1870 he founded a business manufacturing metal devices of his own invention. The most well known was the Capewell Giant Nail Puller. In 1876, he began the invention of an automated process to produce horse nails. After years of frustration, failure, and the loss of thousands of dollars, a perfected machine was exhibited to investors in Hartford, Connecticut in the fall of 1880. In 1881, Capewell formed the Capewell Horse Nail Company in Hartford, making it the horshoe nail capital of the world. In 1887, he established two companies in England; the Capewell Horse Shoe Nail Company (Limited) and the Capewell Continental Patent Company (Limited). He worked as director in both of the companies. He had to rebuild his factory after fire destroyed the building in 1902. Capewell was among the passengers who attended the maiden voyage of the RMS Lusitania in September 1907. Due to worker shortages during World War I, Capewell began hiring female workers. He opened a free daycare at the factory so that mothers could work without leaving their children at home. Capewell was the holder of over 100 patents including the Capewell Giant Nail puller (patented 1872); the Capewell self-fastening cone-button (patented 1866); electric trucks; anti- friction roller bearings, revolving wheel-fender for carriages; a machine for forming glass buttons and ornaments; and a machine for driving and pulling tacks and nails. He died on November 6, 1919 and was interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. The company continued to manufacture nails in Bloomfield, Connecticut on machines designed by Capewell until it closed in 2012.

Biography Zanella was born to an Italian father and Slovene mother in Fiume, Austria-Hungary (present-day Croatia). He attended Hungarian Commercial School in Fiume and Budapest. Soon he was professor of bookkeeping in the same school in Fiume, but year later he resigned. During the clash between Liberalism and radicalism in Hungary, Zanella emerged as the local leader of the Kossuthist faction in Fiume. He became the leader of the Autonomist Association, known also as Autonomist Party in Fiume, after Michele Maylender resigned in 1901. With Zanella the party abandoned its liberal stance and turned to the Kossuthist independence party for support. Embracing a staunch Italian nationalist stance (in its vehemence typical of the Kossuthists political style) his popularity grew especially among the lower and middle classes, eventually becoming elected mayor (Podest√†) of Fiume in 1914, but the nomination was vetoed by the Emperor Franz Joseph. During World War I, Zanella fought in a Hungarian unit on the Russian front where he promptly deserted to the Russians. In 1916 he arrived in Rome where he started an agitation campaign for the Italian annexation of Fiume. After the War ended in 1918 he came back to Fiume where he was greeted as a hero, but quickly distanced himself from the Italian National Council in Fiume that assumed the powers in the City. After Gabriele D'Annunzio on September 12, 1919, seized the city of Fiume, Zanella led the Autonomist opposition to the D'Annunzio‚Äôs regime of occupation and personal dictatorship. His chance came as D'Annunzio ignored the Treaty of Rapallo and declared war on Italy itself, finally surrendering the city in December 1920 after a bombardment by the Italian navy. Zanella served in office as president of the Free State of Fiume from 5 October 1921 to 3 March 1922, when his term was cut short due to Italian occupation, following a fascist putsch. Italy formally annexed the territory on 16 March 1924. During 1930's Zanella resided mainly in exile in Belgrade. Following World War II Zanella demanded the restoration of the Free State as a sovereign entity, but failed to receive support for his idea at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco. Nevertheless, he restated the request also to the London Council of Foreign Ministers in September 1945. Thereby he compared the Free State of Fiume, \\"submerged by an act of Fascist aggression\\" to that of Albania and Ethiopia. Moreover, he denied its annexation to Croatia or Yugoslavia, where it never belonged, since it was a country of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Zanella's efforts proved utterly unsuccessful and he died in exile in Rome in 1959.

Feral horses with specific conformation traits discovered in 1977, the name applies only to wild-captured individuals and does not apply to their bred-in-captivity progeny, which are known as Kiger horses. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers two herd management areas for Kiger mustangs in the Burns District‚ÄîKiger and Riddle Mountain, in the Steens Mountain area. DNA testing has shown that Kiger mustangs are descended largely from Spanish horses brought to North America in the 17th century, a bloodline thought to have largely disappeared from mustang herds before the Kiger horses were found. Kiger mustangs are most often dun in color, although they are found in other solid colors. Compact and well-muscled in appearance, their coloration and phenotype make them some of the most desired by private buyers when horses are removed from the feral herds. The BLM rounds up the horses from the two herd management areas every three to four years, and auctions excess horses to the public, returning horses to public lands that meet the desired coloration and phenotype and sometimes exchanging horses between the two herds to maintain genetic diversity. Horses in private ownership may be registered in several breed associations, the largest and oldest being the Kiger Meste√±o Association, established in 1988. Characteristics A Kiger mustang. Kiger mustangs are most commonly dun in color, although the breed registry also allows bay, black and roan horses to be registered. There are numerous shades of dun, all variations on a tan base, and many shades have their own names. The Kiger Meste√±o Association separates dun shades into four categories: dun, red dun, grulla, and claybank. \\"Dun\\" as used by the Kiger registry covers dun horses with black points, and adds the terms zebra dun, dusty dun, smutty dun or coyote dun, depending on the exact shade of body color. Red dun, or the variation \\"apricot dun\\", covers horses with points that are red, brown or flaxen. Grulla covers horses with blueish, mousy or slate-colored bodies and black points, and these horses may also be called lobo duns, olive grullas, silver grullas or smutty grullas. Claybank, another variation of red dun, describes Kiger horses who have golden body coats with red or orange tints and darker red points. Dun horses may have primitive markings, which include any of the following: a dorsal stripe, lightened outer guard hairs on the manes and/or tails, zebra-like stripes on the upper legs, transverse striping over the upper shoulders, dark color around the muzzle, and ears with dark outlines and lighter interiors. Kiger mustangs generally stand high. They are compact, well-muscled horses with deep chests and short backs. In general, they are agile and intelligent, with the stamina and sure-footedness seen in many feral horse breeds. They are generally bold but gentle and calm. They are used for pleasure riding as well as endurance riding, assorted performance competition under saddle, driving, and many other situations where an athletic horse is desired. History Horses have been present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were released by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendants crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved across the border from Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in the American West. Discovery of the Kiger mustang was the result of a BLM mustang roundup in the Beatys Butte area in Harney County in 1977. During the roundup, it was noticed that among the horses collected from the area, there was a group with similar color and markings. DNA testing by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century. These distinct horses were separated from the other horses and the BLM placed two groups in separate areas of Steens Mountain to preserve the breed. Seven horses were placed in the Riddle Mountain Herd Management Area (HMA) and twenty in the Kiger HMA. In 2001, the Kiger mustang was proposed as the state horse of Oregon. State Senator Steve Harper proposed Senate Joint Resolution 10 after being encouraged to do so by the Kiger Meste√±o Association. The resolution, however, failed to pass. Kiger mustangs have been used as models for model horses and animated films. The original herd stallion Meste√±o was used as the model for a series of Breyer Horses, showing the horse at several ages from foal to old age. It was the first time the company had made a series of models showing the same horse. The artist's model for the title horse of the animated film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was a Kiger Mustang named Donner, who now lives at the Return to Freedom American Wild Horse Sanctuary. BLM management and private ownership The Kiger HMA, southeast of Burns, Oregon, and east of Diamond, Oregon, covers and hosts a population that ranges between 51 and 83 horses. The Riddle Mountain HMA, southeast of Burns, covers and contains between 33 and 56 horses. Horses are sometimes exchanged between the herds to maintain the highest possible level of genetic diversity. After roundups, horses with the desired physical characteristics (including phenotype and coloration) are returned to the herds to maintain a high quality of breeding stock. The herds are rounded up every three to four years, and excess horses are auctioned to the public. At two of the more recent auctions, in 2007 and 2011, over 100 horses were auctioned at each event. The 2007 event resulted in 106 horses being adopted to homes in 14 states for a total of $100,206. The two horses with the highest bids went for $7,800 and $7,400. This is much higher than the adoption fees paid for other mustangs; horses removed from other herds in Oregon can be adopted for a walk-up fee of $125. Genetic testing has shown that Kiger mustang is a descendant of the Spanish horse. Many of today's Kiger mustangs can be traced back to a single stallion named Meste√±o, captured with the original herd in 1977 and released back to the Kiger HMA. Several organizations exist which inspect and register Kiger mustangs; each has their own standards for entry into the stud book. In 1988, the Kiger Mustang Association (now the Kiger Meste√±o Association) was formed as the original registry for the herd. By 2013, the organization had registered around 800 horses, and annually inspects between 75 and 100 new horses. Two other associations are the Steens Mountain Kiger Registry, established in 1993, and the Kiger Horse Association and Registry. The Kiger mustangs of the Riddle Mountain and Kiger HMAs are the best known herds of mustangs in Oregon, despite making up only a small portion of the population. As of 2013, the state had a total estimated BLM-managed feral horse population of almost 2,600, roaming over 17 HMAs and a Wild Horse Territory co-managed with the US Forest Service. A census taken in April 2010 found 60 Kiger mustangs in the Riddle Mountain HMA and 81 in the Kiger HMA; estimates made in February 2013 list 40 horses in Riddle Mountain and 61 in Kiger.

He was the great grandson of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko and the father of Boris Artzybasheff, who emigrated to the United States and became famous as an illustrator. Following the Russian Revolution, in 1923 Artsybashev emigrated to Poland where he died in 1927. Biography =Early life= Artsybashev, c. 1905. Artsybashev was born in khutir Dubroslavivka, Okhtyrka county, Government of Kharkov (currently Sumy Oblast, Ukraine). His father was a small landowner and a former officer. His mother, who was Polish, died of tuberculosis when he was only 3 years old.Biographical note by Artsybashev, from The Millionaire, B.W. Hubsch, 1915. His other ethnic roots included French, Georgian and Tatar.Michael R. Katz in Mikhail ArtÔ∏†sÔ∏°ybashev, Sanin: a novel, Cornell University Press (2001), p. 261 He attended school in Okhtyrka until the age of 16. From 1895 to 1897 he was an office worker.Reference Guide to Russian Literature, Taylor & Francis, 1998. He studied at the Kharkov School of Drawing and Art (1897‚Äì1898). During this time he lived in poverty, and was often unable to buy art supplies. In 1897 he attempted suicide. In 1898 he married Anna Vasilyevna Kobushko, with whom he had his son Boris. The couple separated in 1900. =Career= In 1898 he relocated to Saint Petersburg, where he worked as a freelance journalist, and published humorous stories. In 1901 he was expelled from the city for taking part in a demonstration. He wrote his first important work of fiction, the story Pasha Tumanov in 1901, but was unable to publish it until 1905 due to its being banned by the censor. He considered his novel The Death of Ivan Lande (1904) to be his best work, but his major success was the novel Sanin (1907), which scandalized his Russian readers and was prohibited in many countries. He wrote Sanin in 1903, but was unable to publish it until 1907, again due to censorship. The protagonist of the novel ignores all social conventions and specializes in seducing virgin country girls. In one notorious scene, a girl tries to wash embarrassing white stains off her dress after sexual intercourse with Sanin, an incident omitted from the 1914 English version. The novel was written under the influence of the philosophy of Max Stirner, and was meant to expound the principles of Individualist anarchism. Artsybashev said the following in regard to his development as a writer: > \\"My development was very strongly influenced by Leo Tolstoy, although I > never shared his views on non-resistance to evil. As an artist he > overpowered me, and I found it difficult not to model my work on his. Fyodor > Dostoyevsky, and to a certain extent Anton Chekhov, played almost as great a > part, and Victor Hugo and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe were constantly before > my eyes. These five names are those of my teachers and literary masters.\\" In a 1913 interview he gave his views on literature:Introduction, Sanin: a Novel, Cornell University Press, 2001. > \\"Common sense, consistency, argumentation, a clear and concrete idea of > one's subject that constitutes the plot of the work, a thoughtful evaluation > of the phenomena introduced in the novel, clarity and concreteness- these > are the things I demand of a literary work.\\" He made this comment concerning Friedrich Nietzsche: > \\"It is often thought here (in Russia) that Nietzsche exercised a great > influence over me. This surprises me, for the simple reason that I have > never read Nietzsche. This brilliant thinker is out of sympathy with me, > both in his ideas and in the bombastic form of his works, and I have never > got beyond the beginnings of his books. Max Stirner is to me much nearer and > more comprehensible.\\" =Later life= He moved to Moscow in 1912. In 1917-18 he published his anti- Bolshevik work Notes of a Writer. In 1923 Artzybashev emigrated to Poland as an optant (his mother was Polish), where he edited the newspaper For Liberty! (–ó–∞ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—É!). He was known as an irreconcilable enemy of the Bolshevik regime, and Soviet critics dubbed the novels of his followers saninstvo and artsybashevchina (both terms are considered derogatory). He died in Warsaw on March 3, 1927 from tuberculosis and was buried at the Orthodox Cemetery in Warsaw. English translations *The Millionaire, Ivan Lande, and Nina, (stories/short novels), B.W.

She was loaned to the U.S. Navy on 18 March 1949 and was redesignated as AKL-398 (although the Navy retained her Coast Guard-given name) on 31 March 1949. The Navy had her converted at Long Beach, California and she was commissioned on 23 July 1949 under the command of LCDR F. E. Clark, USN. Following shakedown, Redbud departed Long Beach 3 August 1949 and headed for the east coast. On 18 September she arrived at Boston, whence she continued on to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, to join the support force for the construction and maintenance of air bases and early warning installations in the North Atlantic and Arctic areas. Through the end of the year and into 1950, she operated along the southwestern coast of Greenland, adding more northerly ports and those on the Canadian side of Baffin Bay to her schedule during the warmer months. Until 28 February 1952, she continued her support of Arctic bases, rehabilitating navigational aids, activating and repairing submarine petroleum lines, and delivering bulk petroleum and general cargo, as a commissioned U.S. Navy ship. Then decommissioned, she was simultaneously placed in service, assigned to MSTS, and, with a civil-service crew, returned to sealift support for the Northeast Command (SUNEC). In 1956 Redbud's schedule was altered to include winter (November through March) supply runs to the Texas Towers which alternated with warmer weather (April through October) SUNEC duties. Maintaining that schedule through the 1960s, her primary mission continued to be her SUNEC missions, and, until 1970, she was usually the first MSTS ship to arrive in the far north to open a new resupply season. On 10 November 1970 she was returned to the Coast Guard and was struck from the Navy list ten days later. She was then transferred to the Republic of the Philippines on 1 March 1972 under a grant-in-aid. She served the Philippines as Kalinga (AG-89).

The Torrej√≥n Air Base/Madrid‚ÄìTorrej√≥n Airport also lies on the municipality.  Etymology  Torrej√≥n comes from torre (\\"tower\\"); the suffix -j√≥n is a diminutive that ultimately makes reference to the small or unimportant nature of the noun. The Ardoz add-on comes from the namesake creek.  History  While there is no certainty of the origin of Torrej√≥n de Ardoz, it probably dates from the 12th century, associated to fortifications built to protect Alcal√° de Henares.Torrej√≥n Townhall website It was part of the Land of Alcal√° for all purposes until 1554, when it was granted the status of town. In 1843 it was the place of a short battle between general Ram√≥n Narvaez and senator Antonio Seoane, as part of the rebellion against Espartero.Torrej√≥n Townhall website The United States Air Force jointly occupied the Torrej√≥n Air Base, installed in 1955, under agreements made with Francisco Franco. The base was subject of criticism since its beginnings and a meeting place of pacifist demonstrations attended by progressives and ecologists. One of the election platforms of Felipe Gonz√°lez's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) was to close the base to the American fighter wing. Once Gonz√°lez became prime minister, the lease of the then 401st Tactical Fighter Wing (now the 401st Air Expeditionary Wing) was not renewed and the F-16 fighter wing left the base in the early 1990s.

The album is a collection of cover versions. It was co-produced with Mike Hedges and released in March 1987 on Polydor. Through the Looking Glass was preceded by the single \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\". It was the second and final album recorded with guitarist John Valentine Carruthers. Some of their cover songs were praised by the original artists themselves. History The title of the record, Through the Looking Glass, referred to Lewis Carroll's book of the same name. The band had already been inspired by Carroll's work when naming their label, Wonderland, which was derived from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The record was also an ode to David Bowie's Pin Ups, a covers album recorded in the early 1970s. After spending more than a year working on 1986's Tinderbox, the Banshees wanted spontaneity, and quickly returned to the studio after the tour, to record their own covers album. It was a project they had been considering since recording a version of the Beatles's \\"Dear Prudence\\" in 1983. For the Looking Glass sessions, which took place in September and October 1986, they chose material mainly dating from the first half of the 1970s, from an era preceding the 1976 formation of their band. Most of the songs were from artists who had influenced them: Roxy Music, John Cale, Iggy Pop, the Doors and Kraftwerk. Producer Mike Hedges, who hadn't worked with them since 1984, was called back. The instrumentation was different; for this album, they hired other instrumentalists including a brass section and a harpist. Musician Martin McCarrick, who would become an official member of the Banshees after this album, created string arrangements for several tracks. The band's version of Iggy Pop song \\"The Passenger\\" featured brass arrangements played by Pete Thoms and Luke Tunney, who had already worked with Siouxsie and Budgie on the Creatures' single \\"Right Now\\".  Release  Through the Looking Glass was released on 2 March 1987 on Polydor. A few weeks after, Bowie contacted them to be the special guests at two shows on his Glass Spider Tour in Anaheim. The album was reissued on CD with bonus tracks in October 2014. A 180g vinyl reissue of the album, remastered from the original ¬º‚Äù tapes and cut half-speed at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell, was released in August 2018.  Reception  Ralf H√ºtter of Kraftwerk lauded the version of \\"Hall of Mirrors\\" and stated: \\"In general, we consider cover versions as an appreciation of our work. The version of 'Hall of Mirrors' by Siouxsie and the Banshees is extraordinary\\". Iggy Pop said of their cover of \\"The Passenger\\": \\"That's good. She sings it well and she threw a little note in when she sings it, that I wish I had thought of. It kind of improves it [...]. The horn thing is good\\".\\"120 Minutes\\" Iggy Pop interview. MTV. June 1990. Excerpt about Siouxsie and the Banshees from 08:33 LA Timess reviewer stated: \\"These songs are superbly rearranged, retaining enough of what was special about the originals and adding just the right new twists.\\" Critic Terry Atkinson wrote about their cover of \\"Strange Fruit\\": \\"Only someone as brash as Siouxsie Sioux would re-record Lewis Allan's \\"Strange Fruit,\\" a song so strongly identified with Billie Holiday. And only someone as serious and sensitive could bring it off like this. A solemn string section behind the vocals and--best of all--a bridge of New Orleans funeral-march jazz enhance Siouxsie's evocative interpretation\\". Atkinson then concluded emphazing, \\"Such inventive touches permeate a great album\\". Sounds praised the rendition of \\"Trust in Me\\" as \\"quite astonishing. Whereas once it was about a python getting ready to crush a little boy to death, now it's a harp-laden lullaby of rampant, swirling eroticism\\". Writing in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Mark Coleman and Mac Randall gave Through the Looking Glass a rating of 2.5 stars out of five, saying that it contains \\"overpolished covers of the group's obvious influences\\".

It is based on John Katzenbach's novel of the same name. Plot Paul Armstrong (Sean Connery), a liberal Harvard professor and former lawyer opposed to capital punishment, is persuaded by an elderly woman (Ruby Dee) to go to Florida to investigate the conviction of her grandson Bobby Earl Ferguson (Blair Underwood) for murder. Ferguson, a former Cornell University student, was convicted of raping and brutally murdering a young white girl named Joanie Shriver (Barbara Jean Kane) eight years prior. Ferguson tells Armstrong that he was physically and psychologically tortured by two police detectives to get a forced confession, but firmly states he is innocent. Armstrong, believing in his innocence, must save him from being executed in the electric chair. As Armstrong digs deeper into the case, he discovers that Tanny Brown (Laurence Fishburne), the chief detective on the case, did indeed coerce Ferguson's confession. Ferguson tells the professor that the murder was actually committed by Blair Sullivan (Ed Harris), a serial killer awaiting execution. According to Ferguson, Sullivan constantly taunts him about his conviction for the crime. Sullivan, through the use of Biblical cryptic clues, later reveals the location of the knife used to kill the girl. Armstrong and Brown go to the place, where Armstrong asks Brown to retrieve the knife as Brown's the actual police officer. Brown tries to threaten Armstrong into abandoning the investigation. Armstrong then discovers why Brown is so passionate to get Ferguson convicted: the murdered girl was Brown's daughter's best friend. With a new testimony and with the murder weapon at hand, Ferguson gets a re-trial and is acquitted and thereafter freed from prison. Subsequently, the governor authorizes Sullivan's execution. Armstrong receives a call from Sullivan, who says he has a final clue to share, but first wants Armstrong to visit Sullivan's parents and tell them he said goodbye. Arriving at the house, Armstrong sees various religious items before finding their butchered decaying bodies. Back at the prison, Sullivan gloats that he and Ferguson struck a deal: Ferguson would kill Sullivan's parents in exchange for freedom, while Sullivan would claim responsibility for the girl's murder, which Ferguson did in fact commit. Armstrong asks why he was needed for their scheme, and Sullivan replies that was \\"Bobby Earl's call\\", meaning that Armstrong would be much more believable in establishing the verdicts than either Ferguson or Sullivan. Armstrong, in his anger at being played, lies to Sullivan and tells him his parents were alive and that they \\"forgive him.\\" Sullivan becomes enraged. Afterwards, he is forcefully taken by the guards to the electric chair, where he is executed. Armstrong and Brown go after Ferguson, after Armstrong suspects that Ferguson has kidnapped his wife and daughter. Ferguson's motives for everything turn out to be a desire for revenge on Armstrong's wife Laurie (Kate Capshaw); she was the prosecutor against him in a previous rape case which, while ultimately dropped due to lack of evidence, resulted in him being brutalized and castrated in jail when she had him remanded to make a name for herself, as well as losing his scholarship and being kicked out of Cornell in the process, thus robbing him of any chance of a family or a decent future. At the local regional swamps, Armstrong finds his wife and daughter in a small shack, where Ferguson appears. Ferguson's plans include raping and murdering Armstrong's wife and daughter (Scarlett Johansson) and then disappearing. At a critical moment, Brown reappears (after seemingly being attacked and killed by Ferguson) and he and Armstrong join forces. They wound Ferguson, who drowns and is subsequently eaten by an alligator. Armstrong's family is thus saved. Cast *Sean Connery as Paul Armstrong *Laurence Fishburne as Detective Tanny Brown *Kate Capshaw as Laurie Prentiss Armstrong *Blair Underwood as Bobby Earl Ferguson *Ed Harris as Blair Sullivan *Christopher Murray as Detective T. J. Wilcox *Ruby Dee as Evangeline Brown *Scarlett Johansson as Katie Armstrong *Daniel J. Travanti as Warden *Ned Beatty as McNair *Kevin McCarthy as Phil Prentiss *Richard Liberty as Chaplin Production Sean Connery turned down the role of King Edward I in Braveheart in order to star in this film. Originally, Will Smith was in talks to take on the role of Bobby Earl Ferguson. Connery and director Arne Glimcher are close friends, and Glimcher took on directing duties so that they could both work on the film together. Principal photography began on May 16, 1994, and took place in and around the state of Florida. Locations include Bonita Springs, Fort Denaud, Fort Myers, Gainesville, Miami Beach, as well as around Lee and Collier counties. Filming also included Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Production wrapped on August 2, 1994, and also marked the final theatrical film for Hope Lange. Reception Unlike Glimcher's previous film, The Mambo Kings, Just Cause received mostly negative reviews, with a \\"Rotten\\" 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews. The site's consensus states; \\"Just Cause you round up a phenomenal cast, that doesn't mean you have everything you need for a solid legal thriller -- and this film is forgettable proof.\\" Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both commented that the film's first half is quite good, particularly as a character study, but in its second half it becomes buried in gratuitous plot twists before ending in a ludicrous showdown. However, Siskel ultimately recommended the film, while Ebert did not. Event occurs at 1:28-4:40. Janet Maslin praised the performances of Laurence Fishburne and Ed Harris, but found the entire film is colored by director Arne Glimcher's inappropriately polished and antiseptic visual style. She summarized it as \\"a crime story so gritless that even the forensic photos of a stabbing victim look good.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum likewise praised Fishburne's performance and blamed the film's artistic failure on the direction, saying Glimcher consistently drained the story of its thrills with heavy-handedness. She gave the film a C-. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Release Just Cause was released on February 17, 1995 in 2,052 theatres. It opened at #2 at the box office grossing $10.6 million in its opening weekend. It remained at #2 for its second week, grossing $6.6 million. After 5 weeks in theatres, the film went on to gross $36.8 million, making it a moderate success.

It was released in 1983. The rifle is bundled with three games on tape: High Noon, Shooting Gallery, and Grouse Shoot for the Spectrum. Different games were offered for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 versions (all the games for these two systems were included on one cassette).The Stack Light Rifle is differentiated from future light guns as being realistic looking. The main pistol is attached to 12 feet of cable which ends in a dead-ended ZX81-size connector which plugs into the Spectrum's user port. A barrel, stock and telescopic sight can all be attached to the pistol. The barrel actually facilitated the gun's performance as it filtered out ambient light. These three parts combined to provide a reasonable - if not perfect - degree of accuracy, and allowed the user to effectively use the light gun from the comfort of an armchair. One can extrapolate that the multi-part design was later mimicked on the Sega Menacer. Variants of the Light Rifle were available for the ZX Spectrum, VIC-20, and Commodore 64 and all perform the same function. Like the Atari XG-1 light gun, the Stack Light Rifle was treated by the hardware as a light pen. Due to lack of availability of software drivers for the Light Rifle, only the three games that came with the device were available. In April 1985, Sinclair User magazine reported that Stack Computer Services company disappeared. Technical specifications The main component of the Stack Light Rifle System is the electronic target pistol that is connected to the computer by a generous length of lead. At the computer end, depending on the version, there is a connector for the appropriate socket or edge connector. On the ZX Spectrum version the connector contains two chips and a couple of simple components to interface the main electronics inside the gun to the computer. To make the pistol more accurate and to turn it into a rifle - it is supplied with a shoulder stock that clips and secures to the rear of the pistol, a barrel and a make-believe telescopic sight. The electronics inside the pistol consist of a light detector or photo-diode and a small amplifier and buffer. Light coming down the barrel is focused by a small plastic lens onto the photo-diode, and the device is sensitive enough to detect the changes in intensity of the picture. Once boosted by the amplifier, the signal is clipped to provide a digital pulse rather than an analogue waveform and is then fed to the computer via the switch. The screen position that is being scanned at that moment is the position the rifle is pointing at. As the computer receives the pulse from the Light Rifle it compares the value of its scan registers with the screen position of the target and, if a match is found, the played has scored a direct hit.

They usually cater to \\"sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas.\\" FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field. Some, operated by non-profit organizations as children's museum or science museums, tend to be geared toward edutainment experiences rather than simply amusement. History FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of theme restaurants that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and midway games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues (water parks, skate parks, billiard halls, bowling alleys, and so on). All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors. Chuck E. Cheese, opened in 1977 as Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, California, was one of the earliest widely known examples of these in the United States. Attractions Ball pits are a popular attraction at family fun centers.Most FECs have at least five common major or \\"anchor\\" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction. Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.): *Amusement/thrill rides (elevated, but generally small-scale) *Animatronics displays *Arcade games *Ball pit *Batting cages *Bowling alley *Bumper boats *Restaurant *Food: Snack bar and fast food (often pizza) *Food: Quality family and group dining in theme restaurant *Inflatables *Kiddie rides (ground-level) *Kart racing *Laser tag *Miniature golf *Movie theater *Music and dancing *Playground equipment and climbing structures *Redemption games and merchandiser games *Roller skating *Specialty shops (toys, comics, music, etc.) *Virtual Reality *Water slide Multi-tiered climbing structures such as this one are common at family entertainment centers. The most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food & beverages, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners. FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors. Any given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times. Business model FECs tend to serve \\"sub-regional markets\\", such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city. Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings. Because most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC, two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, \\"the fun factor in the overall decor\\". Parental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves. An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining. Non-traditional FECs Various major media and entertainment brands, including Disney, Lego, NASCAR, Sega, Sony, United Artists/Regal and Viacom, have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less \\"traditional\\" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas. The first such urban entertainment center (UEC) was the Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles, California, which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties. Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of \\"sustained buzz\\" in the retail real estate industry, which began \\"embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers\\". Another significant UEC was the Sony Metreon in San Francisco, California (1999-2006). Some nonprofit, educational installations, such as the Exploratorium in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix edutainment with simpler amusement attractions. In Canada *Chuck E. Cheese's (U.S.-owned) *Playdium In Mexico *KidZania (Mexico City, 1999) *America's Incredible Pizza Company (Monterrey, U.S.-owned) In the United States The main national industry group in the U.S. is the National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC), which is a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA). Some U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations. American FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features. Some of the larger businesses in this category have included: *Adventure Landing (Jacksonville Beach, Florida, 1995) *America's Incredible Pizza Company (chain, based in Springfield, Missouri, 2002) *Boomers!

He is well known for the \\"paradramatic\\" absurd humorous sketches of the Green Goose Theatre. The grave of Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski and his wife Natalia on the Military Graveyard on PowƒÖzki in Warsaw. Biography Born to a lower-middle-class family in Warsaw, Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski was evacuated with his parents at the outbreak of World War I, and from 1914 to 1918 he lived in Moscow, where he attended a Polish school. Returning to Poland in 1918, he studied classics and English language at the University of Warsaw, submitting a dissertation on a non-existent nineteenth- century English poet, Morris Gordon Cheats. His literary debut came in 1923 and was a member of the Kwadryga group of poets, and he was linked to satirical and political publications. In 1930 he married Natalia Avalov. From 1931-33, he held the post of cultural attach√© in Berlin. From 1934-36 he was in Vilnius. He settled there at 2 M≈Çynowa Street. There, in 1936, the couple's daughter Kira was born. Through his works Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski refers to the atmosphere of Vilnius, and that which Adam Mickiewicz left behind. With the outbreak of World War II, Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski received a draft card from the army. He took part in the Polish September Campaign of 1939. On 17 September, he became a Russian prisoner of war and was later captured by the Germans. He spent the duration of the occupation in the Stalag XI-A prisoner-of-war camp in Altengrabow, his poems printed secretly in anthologies. After the war he travelled to Brussels and Paris, returning to Poland in 1946. He established The 13 Muses Club in Szczecin in 1948 before moving back to Warsaw, and produced work for numerous weekly magazines. Many of his postwar pieces, including \\"A Poem for the Traitor\\" (\\"Poemat dla zdrajcy\\"), an attack on Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, \\"Chryzostom Bulwieƒá‚Äôs Trip to Ciemnogr√≥d\\" (\\"Podr√≥≈º Chryzostoma Bulwiecia do Ciemnogrodu\\") and the panegyric \\"Stalin is Dead\\" (\\"Umar≈Ç Stalin\\") (1953), were written according to socialist realist conventions. In 1950, he became the object of an ideological battle, his artistic work denounced by Adam Wa≈ºyk at the Reunion of Polish Writers as petit-bourgeois. In the later years of his life, he wrote several greater poetic forms: * \\"Jan Sebastian Bach's Easter\\" (1950) (\\"Wielkanoc Jana Sebastiana Bacha\\") * \\"Niobe\\" (1951) * \\"Wit Stwosz\\" (1952) * \\"Olsztyn Chronicle\\" (1952) (\\"Kronika Olszty≈Ñska\\") Bust of the poet in front of the museum in the forester's lodge Pranie. Stone in memory of Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski at the intersection of Towarowa and Grzybowska Streets in Warsaw where he lived in 1906‚Äì1931. From 1950 to 1953, he was linked with the forester‚Äôs lodge at Lake Nidzkie, where he wrote numerous works, including \\"Olsztyn Chronicle\\". It is there that his museum is currently located. He published the volumes of poetry Enchanted Droshky (1948) (\\"Zaczarowana doro≈ºka\\"), Wedding Rings (1949) (\\"≈ölubne obrƒÖczki\\") and Songs (1953) (\\"Pie≈õni\\"). He also produced translations, or paraphrases, of A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare (1952) and Ode to Joy by Friedrich Schiller. He is portrayed, under the name of 'Delta,' in Mi≈Çosz's The Captive Mind (1953). Death He died on 6 December 1953, aged 48, following a third heart attack.LE≈öNICZ√ìWKA PRANIE p. 133 Artistic legacy Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski's poetry is an inspiration to many authors of popular music; some of his poems having a number of interpretations. They were used by Olga Lipi≈Ñska in her TV cabaret among others. At the time of the People's Republic of Poland, his poem Beloved Country (Ukochany kraj) was made into a socialist feel-good song. A musical, Beloved Country, was directed by Janusz J√≥zefowicz at Studio Buffo musical theatre. The most famous songs based on a Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski text include the following: * \\"The Ballad about Two Sisters\\" (\\"Ballada o dw√≥ch siostrach\\"), with music by Stanis≈Çaw Staszewski, sung by Kazik Staszewski with Kult * \\"The Ballad about Two Sisters\\" (\\"Ballada o dw√≥ch siostrach\\"), with music by Adam S≈Çawi≈Ñski, sung by Stan Borys * \\"The Ballad about Easter Ham\\" (\\"Ballada o Wielkanocnej szynce\\"), with music by Krzysztof Knittel, sung by Jan Kobuszewski * \\"Barbara Ubryk\\" (\\"Barbara Ubryk\\"), with music by Krzysztof Knittel, sung by Jan Kobuszewski * \\"What Have I Done?\\"/\\"What am I Guilty of?\\" (\\"C√≥≈ºem winien\\"), with music by Adam Tkaczyk, sung by Tkaczyk with Wyspy Dobrej Nadziei * \\"The Woodpecker and the Girl\\" (\\"Dziƒôcio≈Ç i dziewczyna\\"), sung by Maryla Rodowicz * \\"The Woodbine\\" (\\"Dzikie wino\\"), music Wojciech Trzci≈Ñski, sung by Magda Umer * \\"Today I Was Lying Again\\" (\\"Dzi≈õ znowu le≈ºa≈Çem\\"), with music by Jerzy Derfel, sung by Jan Kobuszewski * \\"If You Were to Stop Loving Me One Day\\" (\\"Gdyby≈õ mnie kiedy≈õ\\"), with music by Tomasz ≈Åuc, sung by Katarzyna Groniec *¬∑\\"I Say!

There is Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski Street in Warsaw. =Institutions named after Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski= Approximately 30 schools in Poland are named after Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski, among them Secondary School No 1 in Otwock, Secondary School No 2 in Olsztyn, Gymnasium No 7 in Czƒôstochowa, Primary School No 7 in Legnica, Gymnasium No 2 in Stargard Szczeci≈Ñski and in Pozna≈Ñ Secondary School No 20 and, until 2000, the former Primary School No 37. Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski is also the patron of libraries, one community centre and the Happy Islands Foundation for Friends of Children with Cancer. The Green Goose Theatre Among Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski's best known works are the satirical mini-pieces of the Green Goose Theatre (\\"Teatrzyk Zielona Gƒô≈õ\\"). Several hundred of these ostensible dramas, usually only a few lines long, appeared in the Krak√≥w literary journal Przekr√≥j.Gerould, Daniel (ed.), Twentieth-Century Polish Avant-Garde Drama: Plays, Scenarios, Critical Documents (Cornell University Press 1977), p.61 They frequently parody serious drama and cultural icons ‚Äì in Hamlet and the Waitress, Hamlet is unable to choose between coffee and tea in a caf√© and expires from indecision to be buried in a coffin marked HAMLET IDIOT, while in Greedy Eve Adam fails to get a bite of the apple, causing the entire Bible to be \\"a total loss\\".Gerould, Daniel (ed.), Twentieth-Century Polish Avant-Garde Drama: Plays, Scenarios, Critical Documents (Cornell University Press 1977), pp.231, 237 The final curtain is frequently brought into the action, being variously scripted as falling \\"optimistically\\", as coming down accidentally and then going up again, or as being lowered by an anteater.

(; 13 April 1751 - 30 January 1793), also known in the United States as \\"Colonel Armand\\", was a Breton cavalry officer who served under the American flag during the American War of Independence. He was promoted to brigadier general after the Battle of Yorktown. He is also known as one of the early leaders of the Breton Association (the Chouannerie) during the French Revolution. Military career Destined for a military career from his earliest years, his impetuous temperament soon brought him to public attention. He spent a stormy, riotous and rebellious youth, in and around the French royal court, serving as an officer in the gardes fran√ßaises. Infatuated with an actress (Mademoiselle Fleury born 1766), he was thwarted in his intention of marrying her and met his rival, the count of Bourbon-Busset, in a duel. He thus fell into disgrace with the king and, ejected from the gardes, took poison and went to la Trappe to die. However, his friends met him there and prevented his suicide. His family then made him return to Foug√®res, though he did not remain there long. American Revolution At the end of 1776, he embarked at Nantes to join the Americans in their fight for independence. The Morris, the ship in which he crossed the Atlantic, was attacked by 3 British ships on its arrival. It was sunk in Chesapeake Bay (Delaware), but La Rou√´rie succeeding in getting to the shore, albeit completely naked and with only 3 surviving servants. Under the orders of George Washington, he became colonel Armand and recruited volunteers, paid from his own pocket. Pulaski's Legion, initially named after its commander, was renamed the 1st Partisan Corps (or Armand's Partisan Corps or Armand's Legion) after Pulaski's death at the end of 1779. Made up of infantry and cavalry, this corps of foreign volunteers fluctuated between 3 and 5 companies strong. Made a general on 25 June 1778, he took part in the battles of New York, Monmouth, Short Hills, Brandywine, Whitemarsh, the Campaign in Virginia, and the Siege of Yorktown. In 1781, Colonel Armand returned to France to re-equip his troops, and was there made a knight of the Order of Saint-Louis. On 26 March 1783, he was made a Brigadier General in the American Army, though he left the American army on 25 November that year. He returned to France for good in summer 1784, covered in glory and retaining Washington's friendship (the pair continued to correspond), though he is less-remembered than Lafayette in treatments of French participation in the War. As well as his military deeds, he also brought back American tulip trees (offered him by Washington). French Revolution In 1785 La Rou√´rie married Louise-Caroline Gu√©rin, marquise de Saint-Brice, a rich aristocrat. Shortly afterwards, his wife went mad and was treated by doctor Valentin Chevetel, with whom La Rou√´rie became friends, discussed politics and shared the same liberal political ideas. In the troubles leading up to the French Revolution, La Rou√´rie declared himself the champion of the nobility and parliament of Brittany, which was struggling against the central court at Versailles. He was one of 12 angry deputies sent to the king in 1787, to petition for the restoration of the province's privileges. In 1788 he gave up his military career when he was offered a command by Louis XVI, out of opposition to his suppressing the liberties which the kingdom of France had accorded Brittany on their union, and so was imprisoned in the Bastille on 15 July that year, making him a popular hero. He was freed a month later, but would give up his ideas. Initially he welcomed the Revolution which came soon afterwards, but at the Estates General of 1789 he was indignant to see the Breton nobility succumbing to the pretensions of the Third Estate. Excited to resistance, he provoked a refusal to send representatives to the Estates, saying that he did not want this ancient nobility to bend over itself to become a double representation of the people. Finally, having made this chivalrous protest, they signed it in the blood of the Breton nobles, against the Ministry's anti-monarchist innovations. Breton Association Initially the partners, reaffirming citizenship, were as a simply defensive Association against the factious crowd, robbers or criminals,Bazin, p. 169 but as the Republicanism became more radical in Paris, and as foreign war became increasingly inevitable, the association radicalized in the early 1792, now favoring armed struggle. Back in Brittany, La Rou√´rie received powers granted to him by the Comte d'Artois: > Statements of Monseigneur the Count d'Artois: > 1) That it is far from any proposal to despotism, its principles are very > opposed to arbitrary government, and that he wants the King to put the state > to strengthen the foundations of the monarchy, and return the happiness of > its people, the exercise of authority tempered by laws, and restore the true > French Constitution, which can easily be reconciled with a reasonable > freedom. > 2) That the relief he promised freely, and that there is no reason to fear > that restoring order would be purchased by the dismemberment of any part of > the kingdom. > 3 ) That can be counted one of the first effects of the revolution will be > against returning the provinces to their rights, and making statements that > the convocation will be held at the same time that the orderly return of the > permit. > 4) Let us spare tracks the rigor that it will be possible, we will employ > force only to subdue the stubborn rebellion, and that those who at the time > of the publication of manifestos, return of loyal subjects to the duty, with > research on their past conduct, with the exception of the heads of sedition, > and convicted of major crimes that can not be removed from the prosecution > of justice, will be tried according to the laws and judicial forms National > Archives, W. 274 Thereafter, the association also received the support of Count of Provence, who in the meantime had also emigrated. The 4 October 1791, he wrote: > You can, sir, I assure Mr. Marquis de La Rou√´rie, that the Count of Artois's > Plan of Association, that he has proposed for the good of the province of > Brittany, I do not hesitate to join my approval to my brother and that, > knowing how much the same sentiments, the principles and the wise leadership > of Mr. De La Rou√´rie worthy of trust, I agree that my brother gave him. I > urge him to continue to address this subject, that will certainly maintain > our support. The Marquis de la Rou√´rie La Rou√´rie then began to organize the association. In each City bishopric, were placed six commissioners and a secretary of the association from the three orders. Administration was provided by two secretaries: Deshayes and Loaisel. The treasurer of the association was Andr√© D√©silles.The father of Antoine-Joseph-Marc D√©silles, killed at the Case of Nancy. Bazin, p. 232. Thomazeau, of Saint-Malo, was responsible for stewardship. Two men, Henry, innkeeper at Saint-Servan and Vincent were charged with links to Jersey. The partners received the delivery, through England, of silver, 6600 guns, powder, 300 complete uniforms and 4 Cannon.Len√¥tre, p. 89 They raised troops; recruitment of volunteers was organized; measures were taken to build support garrisons of the National Guard. He was scheduled to address the ranks, by the number of men, so that, for example, twenty men of arms will be taught, thirty, will be sub- lieutenant, forty, lieutenant, etc.., all without making distinctions based on the nobility of any volunteer.Bazin, op. cit. p. 76 La Rou√´rie now found support among the population of Brittany, which was very disappointed with the Revolution, after having first been in favor, and strongly opposed to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. La Rou√´rie was Catholic, too, although not practicing,Bazin, p. 121 he criticized the Civil Constitution of clergy, and prepared as the manifesto of the association: > They can not conceal that the discontent of the people is spreading more and > more, as the distance that generally reflects constitutional for the > priests, as also the general desertion of their church announce too clear, > that the wish of the vast majority of the people is contrary to the laws > that divided the church, and destroyed the French clergy, without any reason > of public utility.Bazin, op. cit. p. 247 He also argued that since the abolition of the States of Brittany, poverty had increased, and taxes were now three times higher. > You can not hide any more, that the public misery worsens by the day, that > trade languishes increasingly, that the resources of old people are emptied, > and that he sees, however, in whispering, expenses increase, and religion to > become for him the subject of a new tax.Bazin, op. cit., pp. 247‚Äì48 La Rou√´rie also took with him three aides de camp: Aim√© Picquet du Boisguy, aged only fifteen years, of Picot Limo√´lan, father of Joseph Picot de Limo√´lan and his cousin Gervais Marie-Eug√®ne de La Rou√´rie Tuffin, became liaison officer of Fontevieux. Of other nobles, who later can be distinguished in the wars of the Chouannerie who joined the association in Brittany, included: Amateur-J√©r√¥me Le Bras des Forges de Boishardy, Charles de La Bourdonnaye Severus, Toussaint du Breil de Pontbriand, Vincent de Tint√©niac Sebasti√°n de La Hague Silz, Louis Pontavice of the brothers Charles and Louis-Edouard- Joseph de La Haye-Saint-Hilaire, Auguste de Bonteville Hay, and the Prince of Talmont. If the common people, like Pierre Guillemot, had joined the Association, the majority of members were, however, from the aristocracy. La Rou√´rie and Noyan had also attempted to write a manifesto, to present the claims of the association: > The purpose of the association is to contribute primarily to the most > peaceful return of the monarchy, the salvation of the rights of the > province, the properties and honorLen√¥tre Breton, op. cit., p. 66. The other manifesto presented to the Count d'Artois, at the end of the year 1791 began: > We the undersigned citizens of the province of Brittany, believe giving the > reasons for our present Association, First, declare unanimously that the > dearest wish of our heart is to live free or die, as expressed by its > organization, our former government and Breton prescribed Moreover, Article > 6, Section 5 Chapter I of the Constitution of 3 September 1791, and our > intention is only propagated to any principles or we allow any acts that can > be taken for an indirect violation of the oath. > We declare more it must be clearly understood that he does from us > obedience and fidelity that we owe it to the king, our legitimate sovereign, > and we look on the contrary, as our enemies all those who reported abuse and > its benefits his tender solicitude for his people, seeking to weaken its > authority guardianship, reduce its powers and destroy his throne by the > insinuation of criminal republican ideas, the spread of which it is our > duty, as good and loyal subjects, to oppose with all our strength. > We declare that we finally adopt the unrestricted basic principle of the > current constitution, which is embodied in Article 6 of the Declaration on > the Rights of Man and Citizen that the law is an expression of general will, > and that all citizens have the right to contribute personally to their > training.

They received the same day, the support of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Army of √âmigr√©s, the first coalition against Revolutionary France was formed. The Breton Association was ready for battle, the numbers were strong, with 10,000 men.Journal of Brittany collection Jacques Marseille, published by Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 67 =Chouannerie= Bordering the park of the castle Launay-Villiers was the Misedon Forest. This forest was the hideout of John Cottereau, said Jean Chouan and his men who took the name Chouans. Cottereau and his companions had revolted on 15 August 1792 against the revolutionaries in Saint-Ouen-des- Toits. Since they had organized various helping hands against the Patriots. There is no evidence that La Rou√´rie and John Chouan had met, or that he had been recruited by the Association, but La Rou√´rie remained for three months Launay-Villiers until early in September. La Rou√´rie might ignore the disturbances that shook the Mayenne at that time.Bazin, p. 195 At this time in Bourgneuf-la-For√™t, there was a battle between the Chouans the revolutionaries. They were beaten with loss of 18 dead. The sources reported that an unknown royalist appeared suddenly during the battle, took command of Chouans and would be withdrawn once the victory gained. Although this story appears in part legendary, and magnified by the royalist authors, the presence near the head of the Breton Association did think that the man in question could be La Rou√´rie.Bazin, pp. 196‚Äì97 =La Guyomarais= Meanwhile, la Rou√´rie, an outlaw, wandering in the countryside of Brittany, as Claude Basiri later wrote: > La Rouerie had not lost anything of his fervor. This indefatigable > conspirator, resting rarely ran from castle to castle, committee to > committee to revive hopes. Constantly wandering in the forests or the hills, > still armed, he never took the battered roads, and often spent the night in > caves, inaccessible to others, at the foot of an oak tree, or in a ravine. > All were good hiding places for him, and he never does stay twice in the > same place. One can imagine the difficulty to deal with a man so wise, that > he was fearless.Bazin, op.cit. p. 211 He had adopted the false name of Gasselin and was accompanied by only Loaisel Fricandeau, his secretary, and Saint-Pierre, one of his servants. The 12 January 1793, after galloping around the forest of La Hunaudaye, la Rou√´rie and his two companions went to seek refuge near GuyoMarch The castle, which belonged to the family of the same name in the parish of Saint-Denoual. It had snowed that day, and Saint-Pierre was suffering from fevers. Monsieur de La Guyomar was a member of the Association and had already hosted la Rou√´rie three times during the previous month. They were housed in a room of the castle, but the state of Saint-Pierre is not improving. The next day, Loaisel Morel fetched a surgeon at Planco√´t. On January 18 Saint-Pierre was healed, but the la Rou√´rie in turn fell ill on January 19.Len√¥tre, p. 209 The recalled Guyomar Dr. Morel, then as a precautionary measure, sent for Dr. Taburet of Lamballe. Suffering from chills, and severe coughing, he actually had pneumonia. On January 24, the National Guard of Lamballe made a raid on the castle of GuyoMarch Alerted by a neighbor, La Guyomar hid the marquis at the Gouhandais, a farm, located some hundred meters from the castle. The Republicans did not discover anything, but this treatment could not improve the health status of la Rou√´rie.Len√¥tre, p. 211 The next day, Schaffner and Fontevieux came to GuyoMarch They brought with them a newspaper from which they had learned of the execution of Louis XVI on January 21. But the partners decided not to disclose the death of the King to the Marquis, saying that this would aggravate the fever. In spite of the episode of the previous evening, they maintained hope for his recovery. La Rou√´rie, however, asked to read the newspaper, because he wanted news of the trial of the king. It was his servant Saint Pierre who asked, but the Marquis sensing perhaps that he was hiding something, asked Saint Pierre to fetch him a drink. He left the newspaper in the room, which La Rou√´rie read, and learned the death of Louis XVI.Len√¥tre, p. 218 La Rou√´rie then had a crisis of delirium, he jumped out of bed, dressing, said he would leave, but collapsed totally weakened. For three days, he lay dying, alternating between prostration, delirium, and unconsciousness.Bazin, p. 220 A third doctor, Lemasson, was dispatched but could not do anything. La Rou√´rie died on 30 January 1793, at four thirty in the morning.Len√¥tre, p. 220 =End of Association= From the reports of Chevetel, Lalligand did arrest several members of the Breton conspiracy. He also discovered papers buried by D√©sille. But most associates avoided detection, because Th√©r√®se de Mo√´lien burned the list of members of the Association, shortly after the death of la Rou√´rie. A total of 27 Lalligand prisoners were led to Paris to be judged. The trial opened on 4 June 1793, and ended on 18 June 1793. At the end of the trial thirteen defendants were acquitted, two were sentenced to deportation, and the gardener Perrin, and the doctor Lemasson who sent to Bic√™tre, were executed 26 June 1794 at the Prisons of the Reign of Terror., Twelve others were sentenced to death: Mr. and Mrs. La Guyomar, Louis du Pontavice the Chauvin, Madame de la Flonchais, Morin de Launay, Locquet Granville Jean Vincent, Groult La Motte, of Limo√´lan Picot, Georges de Fontevieux and Th√©r√®se de Mo√´lien.Len√¥tre, p. 361 They were all executed on the same day.

He studied physics in Berlin and Bonn before receiving his doctorate from the University of W√ºrzburg. He went on to work for Telefunken, becoming head of the radio receiver laboratories. A Jew, he fled Germany in 1935, leaving behind all his possessions, and settled in England. There, he dropped the H in his first name, becoming Eric, and found work with the Marconi Company. In 1947 he founded the Department of Electronics at University College, Southampton (now the University of Southampton), one of the first in the world. In 1949 the post of Chair of Electronics was created for him. The department is now home to the Zepler Building, named after him. He wrote several textbooks on electronics, the best known being his first The Technique of Radio Design. It is said that many of his radios were used in World War II (on both sides). Zepler was also a very significant figure in the field of chess problems. One of the leading composers of the new German school (also known as the logical school), he mainly composed three- and more-mover directmates, and also produced a small number of endgame studies. In 1957 he became an International Judge of Chess Compositions, and in 1973 an International Master of Chess Compositions. He is the eponym of Zepler doubling, after his pioneer problem published in the Hamburgischer Correspondent, 1929. Zepler often worked with another German problemist, Adolf Kraemer; Im Banne des Schachproblems (1951, revised 1971) is a collection of their best work and considered one of the finest of all collections of chess problems. The two also published Problemkunst im 20.Jahrhundert (1956), a compilation of what they considered to be the finest 20th century problems. Their friendship was remarkable, since Kraemer was a member of the SA, and possibly of the SS. The mate in four to the right is one of Zepler's numerous First Prize-winners, and demonstrates his logical style well. White would like to play 1.Ra2+ Qxa2 2.Qb4#, but the White queen is pinned to the king, making the mate impossible. White must therefore move his king to a different square; the direct approach with 1.Kf8 or 1.Kg7 fails to 1...Qb2!, and moves to the e-file allow 1...Qe1+, so instead the unobvious 1.Bxf5! is needed. After 1...Qxf5+ 2.Ke7 Qb1 (on any other checks, the queen is simply captured) we have the original position again except that the king is no longer on the a2-g8 diagonal, making the mate possible: 3.Ra2+ Qxa2 4.Qb4#. Zepler was also a strong chess player being a member of Southampton Chess Club.

He left the Soviet Union with the Polish army led by General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders and through Iran came to Iraq and then Palestine.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Broniewski (1897.12.17 - 1962.02.10) at granice.pl After World War II and the establishment of the Polish People's Republic, he compromised by writing in 1951 a poem S≈Çowo o Stalinie ('A Word about Stalin'). Subsequently, Broniewski became an important political figure and was proclaimed a foremost national poet by the authorities. He still managed to preserve a certain degree of independence, and some of his poems from this period are a testimony to his talent. He had also been an accomplished translator of poetry and prose, translating, among others, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Sergei Yesenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Bertolt Brecht. During the last years of Broniewski's life, his health had been ruined by alcohol abuse. He died in Warsaw. Poetry Broniewski's poetry deals with problems of human life in the context of historical events, such as wars and revolutions (for example, the Paris Commune), and with questions of justice, fight for freedom, patriotism and personal suffering. This last aspect is evident in the cycle Anka, dedicated to the memory of tragically deceased poet's daughter Anna, who was gas- poisoned on 1 September 1954 (often compared to Jan Kochanowski's Laments). Another important Broniewski's poem is Ballady i romanse, alluding to the title of Adam Mickiewicz's collection. Ballady i romanse is about the Holocaust. Its hero is a thirteen years old Jewish girl Ryfka, who dies together with Jesus Christ shot by the Nazis. Broniewski was conservative regarding poetic form. He used classical forms of verse, traditional metres and stanzas. He often employed the dactylic metre.Wiktor Jaros≈Çaw Darasz, Polski daktyl, Jƒôzyk Polski 3-4/2000, p. 257-265.

History Cini was a member of The Florentine Academy of Art which was founded by Grand Duke Cosimo I at the height of the Medici power during the 16th century. Cini's contemporaries there were his fellow authors Amberi, Lasca (author of the renowned Story of Dr Manente), Cecchi and Gelli. They studied the intellectual philosophies from Plautus and Terence to Ariosto and Machiavelli. =Theater work= At the time Florence led Europe as a theatrical center. By the 15th century the city was renowned for its \\"sacre rappresentazioni\\": these were religious dramas incorporating stage machinery. However what was an important step to what was to become modern theater was the Florentine love of staging classical comedies, unlike the rest of intellectual Europe which merely read them. The first instance of a Florentine classical production was as early as 1476 when Terence's Andria was performed translated into Latin so that it could be clearly understood by a wider audience. The next step came in the late 16th century came when musical interludes were incorporated into the text and spoken dialogue‚Äîthis was the birth of modern opera. One of these early \\"operas\\" was Cini's principal work which drew on the fables of Cupid and Psyche. This work, which Cini dedicated \\"to the future of Grand Duchy of Florence\\"' was performed accompanied by music composed by Alexander Striggio. Striggio (1535‚Äì1589) was the principal composer to the Florentine Medici court. Another of his works, La Vedova (\\"The Widow\\"), received a famous theatrical set designed by the Medici's architect Baldassarre Lanci ‚Äì complete with mechanical revolving scenery. Lanci actually changed the location of the play in order to include more scene changes than Cini had written. Performances These elaborate and complicated performances were generally staged to honor weddings and baptisms of the Medici family, or to greet the arrival of foreign princes and potentates in Florence. During Cini's time, performances were generally held in the courtyard of a palazzo where often grandstands would be erected. The courtyard would be tented by cloth on which was painted a sky. The Palazzo Pitti (which the Medici had purchased from Luca Pitti in 1549) had an amphitheatre constructed in its Boboli Gardens for such performances. At one performance it was recorded that seventy candelabra bearing putti were suspended from the \\"sky\\" providing light, while the performers entered the theatrical arena on ornamental floats against a background showing Venice. Venice and the Sahara were a popular locations for Florentine plays, and in choosing these locations Cini was no exception.

He joined Nantes on a loan contract in January 2004, and on 17 May, he signed a three-year contract, because his contract with Beveren was due to expire in the summer. At this stage of his career, he played as an attacking midfielder. He was on the fringe at Nantes in the 2005‚Äì06 season, prompting a loan move to Young Boys.

He scored his first goal for the club on 1 August 2010, in a 3‚Äì0 home win against FC St. Gallen. With Basel, Yapi Yapo won the Swiss Championship at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. During just the second game of the 2011‚Äì12 Swiss Super League season, Yapi Yapo suffered a rupture of the cruciate ligament, and did not play again until the away draw in the Stade de Suisse against Young Boys on 16 February 2012. At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Yapi Yapo won the double, the League Championship title and the Swiss Cup with Basel. At the end of the 2012‚Äì13 Swiss Super League season, he won the Championship title, and was Swiss Cup runner up with Basel. In the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Europa League, Basel advanced as far as the semi-finals, there being matched against the reigning UEFA Champions League holders Chelsea, but were knocked out being beaten 2‚Äì5 on aggregate. On 9 November 2014, Aarau player and former Basel teammate Sandro Wieser committed a knee-high challenge on Yapi Yapo in a league match, leaving the latter's career in serious doubt. He suffered torn anterior and cruciate ligaments, a torn meniscus, a torn kneecap tendon, serious cartilage damage and deep bruising to his thigh. Wieser was shown a straight red card for the tackle, and was later suspended for six matches by the Swiss league. With Yapi Yapo highly unlikely to ever play again, Z√ºrich president Ancillo Canepa launched legal proceedings against Wieser. Yapi Yapo did eventually return to action as a first-half substitute, in a 3‚Äì3 draw against FC Thun at the Letzigrund on 13 September 2015, scoring the third Z√ºrich goal in the process.

It is located at 33 LeCount Place, between Main Street North and Main Street South. The center was built on the site of the former New Rochelle Mall which closed in 1992. History Electrictime clock in front of IMAX Theater Unable to attract a new anchor once Macy's had left, the New Rochelle Mall shut down in 1995, creating a chasm in the city's center. New Roc City which opened in the summer of 1999, was developed as the centerpiece of the efforts to revitalize the downtown business area of New Rochelle. The project cost $190 million and featured a 19-screen movie theater, Westchester County's first IMAX theater (preceding White Plains City Center's Cinema de Lux), a health club, an ice rink (now Monroe College Athletic Center), restaurants, shopping centers and an indoor amusement park. New Roc began a major conversion into a retail-based complex beginning in May 2008. It was rumored that the new retail stores to occupy New Roc would be Target and Kohl's. Best Buy, for a while, was also rumored to be another planned store. The space is currently occupied by Planet Fitness. New Roc now houses Monroe College's Athletic Complex and student cafeteria. Design The core and shell architecture for New Roc City was designed by the White Plains, New York-based architecture firm Peg Park LLC. PEG Park was also the architect of record for this project. Design for the exterior facades and the interiors of arcade was done by Haverson Architecture & Design from Greenwich, Connecticut. At the request of the developer Louis Capelli, the facades were designed to resemble classic New York City buildings. Originally, what is now the Speedway was a second ice skating rink themed to look like Central Park. When viewed from this rink, the second and third floors were given faux detailing to mimic the riveted steel construction seen at Grand Central Station. The third floor arcades were themed to look like NYC rooftops. Murals depicting the surrounding NYC skyline surround the whole third floor. Faux brick and stone parapet walls along with dramatic lighting enhance the rooftop effect. Standard Star bldg & Space Shot amusement ride Atop New Roc City, in the center of the arcade, is an amusement ride called the Space Shot. It is a 185' tall 8'x 8' wide tower with 12 seats on a roller assembly attached to the outside of the tower.

He was known as \\"Slipper of the Yard\\" (referring to Scotland Yard). He was mainly known for his role in investigating the Great Train Robbery of 1963, and in tracking down Ronnie Biggs after he escaped from prison in 1965, although he had to leave Brazil without Biggs. Early life Slipper was born in Ealing, west London, and educated at Little Ealing School. He left school aged 14 and worked as an electrician's apprentice until 1941, when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force. He served as an electrician with a nightfighter squadron at West Malling, and was then posted to the Rhodesian Air Training Group in Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) in 1943. Having grown to 6'3\\", he became light heavyweight boxing champion of the Rhodesian combined services. He was demobilized in 1946 and returned to work in London as an electrician. Early police career Slipper joined the Metropolitan Police in 1951. He trained at Hendon Police College, and served briefly as a police constable in Brentford before moving to Chelsea. He undertook traffic duties, and guarded the residence of the US Ambassador in South Kensington. He joined the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in 1956. After an unusually short probationary period of little more than 2 years (rather than the usual 3 or 4), he was posted to Acton as a Detective Constable. He joined the Flying Squad in 1962, and was quickly promoted to Detective Sergeant, becoming a Detective Inspector by 1968. He left the Flying Squad to be posted to Harlesden. In 1971, he became a Detective Chief Inspector in Q Division (formed in 1965 to cover the Wembley area, previously divided between S and T Divisions) and moved to Harrow, then Detective Chief Superintendent of the stolen-car squad at Chalk Farm. He was in charge of operations at the Flying Squad from 1973 to 1977 as its deputy head under Commander Don Neesham, and then head of Q Division detectives at Wembley. He was involved in the investigation of the Shepherd's Bush murders in which three unarmed policemen were shot dead in Shepherd's Bush in August 1966, for which three men were later convicted. Great Train Robbery Slipper is mainly notable for his role in investigating the Great Train Robbery in August 1963. Then a Detective Sergeant with the Flying Squad, Slipper was one of six police officers chosen by its head, Tommy Butler, to form a special unit to catch the robbers. According to the police investigation, several of the robbers had left fingerprints or palm prints at the gang's temporary hideout at Leatherslade Farm in Buckinghamshire. Biggs' fingerprints were found on a bottle of tomato sauce. Slipper was present when Biggs was arrested at his home in Redhill on 4 September 1963. After being sentenced to 30 years imprisonment in 1964, Biggs escaped from Wandsworth Prison in 1965. Biggs travelled via Paris to Spain and then Melbourne, Australia, where, despite plastic surgery to alter his appearance, he was identified by his dental records after visiting a dentist. In January 1968 after six years with the Flying Squad, and most of the wanted Train Robbers caught, Slipper decided to return to Division and gained promotion to Detective Chief Inspector in September of that year. After a few other postings, in March 1973 he returned to the Flying Squad as operational Chief Superintendent. =1974 extradition attempt= Despite rumours, Biggs remained untraced until 1974, when he gave an interview to the Daily Express. The newspaper passed his location on to the police, and Biggs was captured on 1 February. Slipper travelled to Brazil, where he attempted to arrest Biggs in a hotel in Rio de Janeiro, with the words \\"Long time no see, Ronnie.\\" But the Brazilian government turned down the request for extradition, on the grounds that Biggs was to become the father of his pregnant Brazilian girlfriend's child (Michael Biggs, to be born 16 August 1974), and Slipper was forced to return home empty-handed. Famously, Slipper was photographed on the plane home, sleeping next to an empty seat, and was christened \\"Slip-up of the Yard\\" by the press. =1981 Scots Guardsmen kidnapping= Biggs was abducted by former Scots Guardsmen in 1981 and taken to Barbados. An extradition request was made, but it was denied due to the lack of a treaty between Great Britain and Barbados; he was returned to Brazil. =Biggs' return to U.K.= Biggs finally returned voluntarily to the UK in May 2001. He was accompanied by Bruce Reynolds on a private plane. Slipper believed that Biggs should not be released, and regularly appeared in the media to comment on any news item connected to the robbery. Later police career He was involved in several major investigations such as the Bank of America robbery in April 1975, in which ¬£8 million was stolen from a branch in Davies Street, Mayfair. He was also involved with Britain's first \\"Supergrass\\" trial in 1973, in which bank robber Bertie Smalls testified against his former associates in exchange for his own freedom, and then in the trials supported by the evidence of \\"King Squealer\\" Maurice O'Mahoney. Slipper helped to set up the Robbery Squad, which later merged into the Flying Squad. After the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Robert Mark, initiated an \\"interchange\\" policy, which required CID officers to return to uniformed work, Slipper ended his career as a uniformed chief superintendent as head of X Division in Ruislip. Later life Slipper retired in 1979 after 28 years service, and became a security consultant. He worked in security for IBM UK in the 1980s and 1990s from offices in Greenford, West London. He also enjoyed playing golf at Sudbury. He published an autobiography, Slipper of the Yard, in 1981. He sued the BBC for libel after a television film, The Great Paper Chase, portrayed Slipper (played by Jeremy Kemp) and his colleagues as incompetent. The legal action was financed by Sir James Goldsmith, and Slipper won damages of ¬£50,000, his costs (estimated at ¬£400,000), and an apology. He was awarded the Lord Willis Award in 2004 for his CID work. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1999 and died 6 years later, aged 81. He was survived by his wife, Anne, and two daughters.

The Yamasee engaged in revolts and wars with other native groups and Europeans while living in North America, specifically from Florida to North Carolina. The Yamasee, along with the Guale, are considered by many scholars to be Muskogean from linguistic evidence, such as the Yamasee term 'Mico,' meaning chief. After the Yamasee migrated to the Carolinas, they began participating in the slave-raiding culture of the English which was a large cause of the Yamasee War, which they are perhaps most well-known for. History = Location = The Yamasee lived in coastal towns in southeast Georgia, Florida (La Florida), and South Carolina. The Yamasee migrated from La Florida to South Carolina and became friendly with the British Colonists in the late 16th century. The Yamasee were joined by members of another colonial native group, the Guale, and their cultures intertwined. = European Contact =  Slavery in the Carolinas  The Yamasees were one of the largest slave-raiding groups in the south east during the late 1600s, and have been described as a \\"militaristic slaving society,\\" after being influenced by the English and Spanish. The slave raids can be partially attributed to the Yamasees aligning with western cultures to avoid assimilation.  Charles Town, South Carolina  The Yamasee migrated to the British Colony, Charles Town, SC in 1686 likely in pursuit of British Trade, or to escape the Spanish. In Charles Town, some Yamasee families looked toward missionaries to educate their children in reading and writing as well as converting them to Christianity. It was easier for the English to convert the Yamasees, along with the Guales, because they had been around Spanish missionaries and were more open to conversion.  Spanish Contract  The Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 traveled into Yamasee territory, including the village of Altamaha.Green et al 14-15 In 1570, Spanish explorers established missions in Yamasee territory. The Yamasee were later included in the missions of the Guale province. Starting in 1675 the Yamasee were mentioned regularly on Spanish mission census records of the missionary provinces of Guale (central Georgia coast) and Mocama (present-day southeastern Georgia and northeastern Florida). The Yamasee usually did not convert to Christianity and remained somewhat separated from the Christian Indians of Spanish Florida. Pirate attacks on the Spanish missions in 1680 forced the Yamasee to migrate again. Some moved to Florida. Others returned to the Savannah River lands, safer after the destruction of the Westo. In 1687, Spaniards attempted to send Yamasees to the West Indies as slaves, and as a result of this attempt the tribe revolted against the Spanish missions and their Native allies and moved into the British colony of the Province of South Carolina (present day South Carolina). They established several villages, Pocotaligo, Tolemato, and Topiqui, in Beaufort County, South Carolina. A 1715 census conducted by John Barnwell counted 1,220 Yamasee living in ten villages in near Port Royal, South Carolina.Gene et al 14 = Yamasee War = See main article: Yamasee War The Yamasee war began due to Yamasee's being indebted to the English, as a result of unfair trading by the English. This was a war between the English colonists and the Yamasees, who were allied with multiple other Native American groups, which began after the massacre of South Carolina citizens by the Yamasees on April 15, 1715. For years, the Yamasee and the Carolinian colonists conducted slave raids upon Spanish-allied Indians and attacked St. Augustine, Florida. In 1715, the Yamasee joined an intertribal war against the British, triggering the Yamasee War, which lasted until at least 1717. Many tribes allied themselves with the Yamasee. British Governor Charles Craven defeated the Yamasee at Salkechuh (Saltketchers, Salkehatchie) on the Combahee River. The tribe was driven across the Savannah River back into Spanish Florida. The Yamasee then migrated south to the area around St. Augustine and Pensacola, where they allied with the Spanish against the British. In 1727, the British attacked the tribe's settlement and slaughtered most of them. Some survivors joined the Seminole tribe and some joined the Hitchiti people and disappeared from the historical record. = The Yamasee Prince = In 1713, a Yamasee man (who is unnamed and generally referred to as the \\"prince\\" or \\"Prince George\\") was sent on a journey from Charleston, SC to London, GB, funded by Anglican Missionaries. The prince's journey was a measure of religious diplomacy on the Yamasee's part because in the early 1700s, the colonists treated the natives poorly, at points even enslaving them. If the prince was a successful convert, it was believed that the British Empire and the Yamasees would be politically intwined. Around the time of the prince's travels the Yamasee's were largely unwilling to convert to Spanish culture in general and relations with the English had already begun. The prince returned to Charleston, which was then called Charles Town, in 1715 right when the Yamasee attacked the British in the Yamasee War and shortly after his father and the rest of his family were taken as slaves by the Europeans.  Heritage  The Yamasee language, while similar to many Muskogean languages, is quite similar to Creek, for they share many words. Many Spanish missionaries in La Florida were dedicated to learning native languages, such as the Yamasee, so that they could convert them easier. By gaining the trust of the Yamasee, it was easier for the Spanish and British to convert the Yamasee people. Steven J. Oatis and other historians describe the Yamasee as a multi-ethnic amalgamation of several remnant Indian groups, including the Guale, La Tama, Apalachee, Coweta, and Cussita Creek, among others. Historian Chester B. DePratter describes the Yamasee towns of early South Carolina as consisting of Lower Towns, consisting mainly of Hitchiti- speaking Indians, and Upper Towns, consisting mainly of Guale Indians., National Register Submission, National Park Service Language The name \\"Yamasee\\" perhaps comes from Muskogee yvmvsƒì, meaning \\"tame, quiet\\"; or perhaps from Catawban yƒØ mus√≠:, literally \\"people-ancient\\". Little record remains of the Yamasee language. It is partially preserved in works by missionary Domingo B√°ez. Diego Pe√±a was told in 1716-1717 that the Tuskegee also spoke Yamasee.Hudson 1990 Hann (1992) claims that Yamasee is related to the Muskogean languages. This was based upon a colonial report that a Yamasee spy within a Hitchiti town could understand Hitichiti and was not detected as a Yamasee. Francis Le Jau stated in 1711 that the Yamasee understood the Creek. He also noted that many Indians throughout the region used Creek and Shawnee as lingua francas. In 1716-1717, Diego Pe√±a obtained information that showed that Yamasee and Hitchiti-Mikasuki were considered separate languages.Goddard 2005 Inconclusive evidence suggesting the Yamasee language was similar to Guale rests on three pieces of information: * a copy of a 1681 Florida missions census states that the people of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria de la Tama speak \\"la lengua de Guale, y Yamassa\\" [the Guale and Yamasee language]; * a summary of two 1688 letters, sent by the Florida governor, mentions prisoners of the \\"ydioma Yguala y Yamas, de la Prova de Guale\\" [the Yguala and Yamas language of the province of Guale]; and * the Guale called the Cusabo Chiluque, which is probably related to the Muscogee word ƒçil√≥¬∑kki \\"Red Moiety.\\" The Spanish documents are not originals and may have been edited at a later date. The name Chiluque is probably a loanword. It seems also to have been absorbed into the Timucua language. Thus, the connection of Yamasee with Muskogean is unsupported. A document in a British Colonial Archive indicates that the Yamasee originally spoke Cherokee, an Iroquoian language, but had learned another language.Anderson & Lewis 1983 p. 269 Research The Yamasee Archeological Project was launched in 1989 to study Yamasee village sites in South Carolina. The project hoped to trace the people's origins and inventory their artifacts. The project located a dozen sites, two of which, Pocosabo and Altamaha are now on the National Register of Historic Places.

He was born in Jackson, Mississippi, the elder brother of Carson Whitsett. Biography Whitsett's instrumental \\"Jive Harp\\" b/w \\"Pipe Dreams\\" was released on Imperial Records when he was sixteen. With his band, The Imperials (later renamed The Imperial Show Band), he recorded over twenty singles in a variety of genres (R&B;, Pop, Instrumental) for a number of labels, including Epic, Ace, Atlas, Capitol, Lowery, Sue, Island, Musicor and others, as well as for his own Rim Records. In 1966, at the peak of tensions in Mississippi over civil rights, Whitsett introduced two new singers to his band, Tommy Tate and Dorothy Moore, both black, and both later to achieve chart acclaim as solo artists. Considering the times and possible repercussions, the band from Mississippi was extremely well received by both black and white southerners, as well as audiences in the Great Lakes, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Lake Tahoe, New York City and elsewhere. Until disbanding the group in 1969, Whitsett wrote, produced, arranged, or played on numerous records for other artists, including The Vels, Peggy Scott & Jo Jo Benson, Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith & The Clowns, Bobby Marchan, Junior Parker, Paul Davis, Barbara Lynn, Sam Myers, Dorothy Moore and others. Due to many personnel changes resulting from marriages and the military draft for the Vietnam War, Whitsett dissolved The Imperial Show Band. Shortly afterwards, in 1970, some demos the group had recorded ended up in the hands of noted producer Don Davis, who was then vice president of Stax Records. The MGs were breaking up. Booker T. Jones had just left the company, and Steve Cropper would soon follow. Davis wanted Whitsett‚Äôs band to augment The Bar-Kays as a second house band for Stax. However, Whitsett's musicians had now scattered, joining other bands in other parts of the country. Davis then signed Whitsett and Tommy Tate as producer/songwriters. But within days of arriving at Stax, Whitsett was asked to take charge of the company‚Äôs music publishing division, East/Memphis Music Corp., which included works written or recorded by Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Al Green, Isaac Hayes, Rufus Thomas and Booker T. & the MGs. During his years with Stax, Whitsett was the motivating force behind the releases of million sellers, such as \\"I've Been Lonely For So Long\\" (Frederick Knight), \\"I'll Play the Blues For You\\" (Albert King), and \\"Mr. Big Stuff\\" (Jean Knight), among others. In 1976, Whitsett resigned as president of East/Memphis when offered the opportunity to run Chrysalis Music's European division in London. Six years later, he took another senior management position in London with Chappell Music, prior to its acquisition by Warner Music Group. He also forged a partnership with Chick Churchill, keyboardist with British rock group Ten Years After, in a record production and music publishing company, Whitsett Churchill Music. At Chrysalis, then Chappell, Whitsett managed song catalogs that included works by David Bowie, Jethro Tull, The Chieftains, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Chuck Berry, George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein, etc. In 1982, Whitsett set up a consultancy service for music publishers, which included specialized newsletters and target-marketing directories. Clients included EMI, Chappell, Gamble and Huff, Jobete, CBS Songs, Virgin, MCA, et al., as well as publishing companies owned by Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson and Elton John. Returning to the States, Whitsett founded Urgent! Records. The label's roster included Bobby Rush, The Dells, Luther Ingram, Tommy Tate, and Jerry Butler. The label was later folded into the Malaco Music Group, with whom Whitsett became associated in 1998. In addition to his work with Malaco Records, Whitsett authored three music- publishing textbooks and a dictionary of music business terms, while actively maintaining his consulting services for music publishers and copyright investors. In 2008, Whitsett's Big Mistakes: The Memoirs of Tyrone Hatchback, a novel, was published. That same year, Whitsett founded LocoBop which started out as a digital only record label, but has since began to release physical CDs as well. Artists include, among many others, Ivory Joe Hunter, The Bar- Kays, Rufus Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Jerry Butler, The Masqueraders, Carla Thomas, and Luther Ingram.

From 1930 to 1939 he was a cultural attach√© at the Polish embassy in Paris. After the fall of France to Nazi Germany, he left for Brazil and later settled in New York City. There he co- edited many Polish newspapers and magazines; in 1942 he co-founded the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America. On the suggestion of a psychiatrist, Lecho≈Ñ started writing a diary (1949‚Äì56). Amid recondite autobiographical reminiscences, the diary also documents Lecho≈Ñ's attempts to come to terms with his homosexuality. \\"Oppressed by a sense of √©migr√© obsolescence and poetic sterility, unable to resolve the conflict between his programmatically traditionalist Polish public persona and the anxieties of an aging, impecunious homosexual in an America beset by McCarthyism ...\\",Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon - Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II, 261 Lecho≈Ñ committed suicide on 8 June 1956 by jumping from the twelfth floor of the Hudson Hotel. At the time, his motive for doing so was given as depression deepened by \\"social degradation\\". The memoirs of Adam Cio≈Çkosz point also to depression caused by the strengthening of the communist regime in Poland. In 1991 Lecho≈Ñ's remains were exhumed from Calvary Cemetery in Queens and transferred to a cemetery in Laski, to a family tomb shared with his parents, W≈Çadys≈Çaw and Maria Serafinowicz. Work Grave of Lecho≈Ñ in Laski Lecho≈Ñ made his literary debut at the age of 14 with poetry collections entitled Na z≈Çotym polu ('In a Golden Field', 1913) and Po r√≥≈ºnych ≈õcie≈ºkach ('On Different Paths', 1914). In 1916, his drama W pa≈Çacu Stanis≈Çawa Augusta ('At the Palace of Stanis≈Çaw August') premiered at the Old Orangery in Warsaw. His poetry collection Srebrne i czarne ('Silver and Black') earned him an award from the Polish Book Publishers' Association. However, growing interest in Lecho≈Ñ's work and his successes in the field of poetry had a negative influence on him. He found his status and fame overwhelming and did not publish further until the outbreak of World War II. Poland's wartime demise awakened in him the passion to continue writing. He published Lutnia po Bekwarku in 1942 and Aria z kurantem in 1945, as well as Marmur i r√≥≈ºa. His other works include Karmazynowy poemat and Iliada. Lecho≈Ñ's poetry, which combined romantic and classicist elements, was different from that of other members of the Skamander group. He also translated several dramas, wrote reviews and essays. From Lecho≈Ñ's Diaries \\"Mankind prospers in one of the falsest illusions, that the world is run by wise people. This would be impossible, if only because most of mankind are mediocrities, if not outright stupid people. If we speak with a physician, say about a writer, the physician is convinced that the writer is a good writer. We writers know that maybe 10 percent of writers are good, the rest being mediocrities and idiots. Likewise the writer supposes that a physician with whom he is unfamiliar is an accomplished expert in his line of work‚Äîwhereas he is usually a mediocrity. It is amazing that, in spite of this, the world looks as it does.\\"\\"Ludzko≈õƒá prosperuje w jednym z najfa≈Çszywszych z≈Çudze≈Ñ, ≈ºe ≈õwiat prowadzƒÖ ludzie mƒÖdrzy.

The 2011 census reported the parish had 1,469 people in 555 households. Like most fen- edge parishes, it was laid out more than a thousand years ago, in an elongated form, to afford the produce from a variety of habitats for the villagers. The village itself lies along the road between King Street, a road built in the second century, and Baston Fen which is on the margin of the much bigger Deeping Fen. Until the nineteenth century, the heart of Deeping Fen was a common fen on which all the surrounding villages had rights of turbary, fowling and pasture. History A significant Roman feature of Baston is the Roman road leading across the fen towards Spalding. Part of the modern fen road follows it. At the end of the village, near King Street, was an Anglian cemetery which was in use up to about the year 500. This coincides approximately with the date of the beginning of King Arthur's exploits, as reported by the Historia Brittonum, when Arthur fought his first battle at the mouth of the River Glen and stopped the spread of Anglo-Saxon settlement for fifty years. The Anglo-Saxon cemetery, of funerary urns, was found by Rev. Edward Trollope in 1851. He found around 10 burials in 1863 and traces of another 16 were found in 1963 Like most places in Europe, Baston suffered from the plague. Some Baston plague victims are shown in burial lists. A possible plague burial was uncovered during the building of a corn dryer. The 'Baston Pig' was a name for the Lincolnshire Curly Coat pig. Governance Baston is served by a Parish Council, two District Councillors who represent Casewick Ward on South Kesteven District Council and a County Councillor representing Deepings West & Rural Division on Lincolnshire County Council. The current District Councillors elected in May 2011 and re-elected in 2015 are Kelham Cooke (Con) and Rosemary Trollope-Bellew (Con). The Lincolnshire County Councillor elected in 2017 is Rosemary Trollope-Bellew (Con). Geography Geographically, in the fen, the parish's northern boundary lies on the River Glen, beyond which is Thurlby. To the south is Langtoft and beyond King Street in the west is Greatford. =Geology= The parish lies on a fan of gravel from the Devensian glacial period, which spreads from the upland mouth of the valley of the River Welland, to the east of Stamford, Lincolnshire. There are two main forms of business in the parish: arable farming and gravel extraction. The flooded gravel pits subsequently lend themselves to development for leisure pursuits such as angling, birdwatching and watersports. The gravel was washed down from the tundra environment to the west and deposited in the periglacial lake, known as Lake Fenland, below the icy waters of which the site of Baston then lay. The authors are not entirely convinced by some of the earlier published references in this regard, but they do link to them. Education Independent special school Kirkstone House School has been situated in the village since 1964. Sport In 2002, a group of local residents decided that the village needed an area where a range of sports could be conducted. The cost of a sports hall was thought to be prohibitive, so the project was focused on a multi-use sports and skateboarding area. Following a village-wide survey, which had a 37% return rate, a public meeting was held in June 2002. As a result of both the survey and public meeting, it was decided that there was a mandate from the village to progress the project. Consequently, B-Active was formed as a sub-committee of the BPFMC. As part of this the Baston Football Club was formed in 2005, and joined the Grantham & District Saturday Afternoon League. The club runs two adult teams playing in the Peterborough & District League on a Saturday afternoon. It plays its home games at Brudenell Playing Field in Baston, and is sponsored by local businesses. Baston cricket club plays in the south Lincs Division 1 league. The club won promotion last year by winning the division 2 title. Off the playing field the cricket club is advancing at a rapid pace. Last year saw the club purchase covers, and new this season is a pair of sight screens built from scratch and kindly donated by club member 'Big' Dave Ford. There are tennis courts for year-round use. Both sports field and village hall are managed by the Brudenell Playing Fields Management Committee.

It combines the contents of four earlier modules, all set in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting and intended for use with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons first edition rules. Scourge of the Slave Lords was ranked the 20th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004. Overview The original series consisted of four modules: * A1 Slave Pits of the Undercity * A2 Secret of the Slavers Stockade * A3 Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords * A4 In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords Each module is a self- contained adventure that leads into the next in the series. The series is intended for use in the World of Greyhawk, but can be imported to any campaign setting. The modules are set in the Pomarj. According to From the Ashes, this adventure took place in Highport and Drachensgrabs. Component modules =A1 Slave Pits of the Undercity= Slave Pits of the Undercity was published by TSR in 1980 as a twenty four page booklet, and was written by David Cook. The cover artwork by Jeff Dee features an illustration of two aspis fighting a party of adventurers (including a bearded female dwarf). The interior art was done by Dee, David S. LaForce, Jim Roslof, and Bill Willingham.Cook, David. Slave Pits of the Undercity (TSR, 1980), As the first module in the series, Slave Pits of the Undercity was the first TSR publication to introduce players in the Greyhawk setting to the Slave Lords and their operations in the central and southwestern Flanaess. The module has been described as the first in a series of medium-level scenarios that provide the player characters with a mission to track down marauding coastal raiders. (preview) Synopsis The events of the adventure are set in 580 CY, following four years of raids by slavers on the coastal population along the Sea of Gearnat from Onnwal to the Wild Coast. Local lords, finally tired of the situation, hire a band of adventurers to attack the slavers in their home. The adventure begins in the Pomarj city of Highport at a ruined temple which serves as a headquarters for the slavers. The module takes the group through the temple and into the sewers below where giant insect-like creatures make their lair along with the slave lords. As the adventurers progress on their mission to break up the band of slavers, they battle orcs and the insects in the sewers of the slavers' conquered city. Eventually the group reaches the prisoners and their captors, and finds a map showing the route of the caravans. Following this map leads the group to the second module, Secret of the Slavers Stockade. =A2 Secret of the Slavers Stockade= Secrets of the Slavers Stockade was published by TSR in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder, and was written by Harold Johnson and Tom Moldvay. The cover artwork by Jim Roslof features a drawing of two hobgoblins, one of which is a sergeant with a leashed boggle, and a party of adventurers. The interior art was done by Roslof, Dee, Willingham, and Erol Otus.Johnson, Harold, and Tom Moldvay. Secret of the Slavers Stockade (TSR, 1981), The scenario leads to a lost fortress where slaves are being kept and fattened. Synopsis The previous adventure ends with the capture of a map to a fortress citadel in the hills, used by the slavers as a waypoint on their route. The A2 module gives the Dungeon Master the option to run an overland adventure of 110 miles (177 kilometers) through the Drachensgrab Hills to reach the fort shown on the map, or simply start the adventure with the party overlooking the fort itself. The object of the module is to enter the fort through stealthy means and slowly eliminate the slavers before a general alarm can be raised. Eventually the group of adventurers makes their way through the fort, avoiding hobgoblin patrols, and reaches a dungeon area. After exploring the dungeons, the players eventually learn that this fort is not the headquarters of the Slave Lords. In fact, the real stronghold of the Slave Lords is located somewhere in the Drachensgrab Hills. This revelation leads the adventurers to the third installment in the series. =A3 Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords= Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords was published by TSR in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder, and was written by Allen Hammack. The cover artwork by Jeff Dee features a drawing of five of the nine Slave Lords. These five are Nerelas the assassin, Mordrammo the priest, Feetla the master buccaneer, Ajakstu the magic-user, and Brother Milerjoi the monk. The interior art was done by Dee, LaForce, Otus, Roslof, and Willingham.Hammack, Allen. Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords (TSR, 1981), This scenario continues the characters' search for the slavers deep under the Drachensgrab Mountains. Synopsis The first part of the module consists of a dangerous labyrinth. This portion of the adventure is meant to be finished within three hours, in tournament mode. It is a trap-filled, monster-heavy section used to lure the group into a secret tunnel leading to the hidden city of Suderham. In the second part of the adventure, the group discovers the haven of the Slave Lords, a town on an island in a volcanic crater. This new setting, the city of Suderham, offers the players an opportunity to test their roleplaying skills rather than primarily focusing on combat or stealth. The module provides a number of non- player characters in the city with whom the players can interact and exchange information. To complete the module, the group must find one of several secret entrances to the catacombs beneath the city where the final part of the adventure plays out. The third section of the adventure moves at a rapid pace in tournament mode, and each room encountered in the level is filled with dangerous creatures. In the final room of the section, the players are captured as a set-up for In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords. If this section is played outside of a tournament, however, it is possible for the players to defeat the slavers and exit the area victorious. =A4 In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords= In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords, the final module in the series, was published by TSR in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder, and was written by Lawrence Schick. The cover artwork by Erol Otus features a drawing of a group of myconid (fungus men) fighting a party of adventurers. The interior art was done by Otus, Roslof, Willingham, Steve Sullivan, David C. Sutherland III, and Jean Wells.Schick, Lawrence. In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords (TSR, 1981), Synopsis The A3 module finishes with the player characters as captives of the Slave Lords, and they begin module A4 in the same condition. The module starts with the party trapped, without any gear, deep beneath a volcanic island. The Slave Lords have captured them, and have left them in this dark cave system to die when a volcanic eruption destroys the entire island. Through a series of incidents they quickly find themselves free but completely bereft of equipment and spells. The final scenario plays out as a massive earthquake threatens to bring down the tunnels around the group, and they must exit the caverns within four hours or perish in the ensuing collapse. The labyrinth is a difficult test for characters without equipment and spells, and challenges the players' wits and role-playing ability rather than focusing on traditional combat. Once the players emerge from the caverns, they face the final test of escaping the island itself, which can be accomplished by attacking the surviving Slave Lords, escaping via a different boat, or possibly by swimming. Pre-generated characters Because the original modules were run as a tournament event, the compilation includes nine pre-generated characters for use in tournament mode. They are Elwita (dwarf fighter), Ogre (human fighter), Freda (human ranger), Karraway (human cleric), Blodgett (halfling thief), Dread Delgath (human magic-user), Phanstern (human illusionist), Eljayess (half-elf cleric/fighter), and Kayen Telva (elf fighter/magic-user). Each of these characters has a standard list of equipment and prepared spells so that tournament players can begin the game with very little preparation. Scoring Due to their design for use at Gen Con XIII, each A series module includes a scoring scheme. This scheme essentially takes the number of surviving characters and gives them points for visiting the largest number of areas described in the adventure. Each area contains additional points available for gain or loss based on specific actions by the players. Publication history The A series of modules was created for tournament use at Gen Con XIII in 1980, as the AD&D; Open Tournament. The first two modules, and the first part of the third module serves as the tournament's first round, while the second part of the third module was the semifinal and the fourth module was the final round. The modules were then expanded and published to facilitate campaign play; the original areas from the tournament are clearly marked on the maps and in the related text, and a scoring system is included for those interested in recreating the competition. Slave Pits of the Undercity, for example, contains both characters that had been tested in tournament play and a tournament scoring system. The first module was published in 1980, and the other three were published in 1981. The omnibus A1‚Äì4 supermodule was published in 1986 as a 128-page book with a sixteen-page map booklet and a cover by Jeff Easley, and was slightly revised for play by higher level characters in order for it to be used as a continuation adventure for campaigns beginning with supermodule T1‚Äì4 The Temple of Elemental Evil. The overall campaign could then be continued into the GDQ1‚Äì7 supermodule Queen of the Spiders. Design contributors to the revision (including the original module designers) were David Cook, Allen Hammack, Harold Johnson, Tom Moldvay, Lawrence Schick, and Edward Carmien. Cook did the revision, and editing was by Johnson, Jon Pickens, Brian Pitzer, Edward G. Sollers, Stephen D. Sullivan, and Steve Winter. In 2000, Wizards of the Coast released Slavers, a sequel adventure for 2nd edition AD&D; rules. The sequel is also set in Greyhawk, and takes place ten years after the conclusion of the events in A1‚Äì4. In 2002, Kenzer and Company published a HackMaster module based on Scourge of the Slavelords, named Smackdown the Slavers. All four modules of the A-series were included as part of the Against the Slave Lords hardcover collection, released on June 18, 2013. Also included is an all-new fifth adventure -- A0: Danger at Darkshelf Quarry. The hardcover includes a foreword written by each of the four surviving designers of the original modules. David Cook writes: \\"In the early days of TSR, we were still feeling things out, learning what we could and couldn't do. It was in a previous GEN CON Game Fair that we had heard murmurs that the AD&D; tournament needed some work. We hadn't realized until then how much the tournament could be, should be, a showcase event. The players who came to Wisconsin deserved a deliberately crafted experience, something that could show TSR and AD&D; in the best possible way.\\" Harold Johnson writes: \\"Our goal was to provide a model for a new type of adventure that encouraged DMs to use strategy to challenge the players to think. Up to this point, adventures presented monsters that attacked and fought to the death. We wanted to show that even weak monsters could be dangerous when played intelligently.\\" Allen Hammack writes: \\"Some people have asked about names in the modules. Yes, I have fun with words. Combining Latin and Greek, pulling player and character names from my campaign, and twisting the results so they sounded right when I heard them‚Äîall were in the bag of tricks. \\"Suderham,\\" for example, combined elements that to me meant \\"south home\\" (a nod to my Alabama roots), and was also a tip of the hat to my artist friend, the late, great Dave Sutherland. 'Ayares the Cutpurse' reflected my long- standing annoyance with the Internal Revenue Service.\\" Lawrence Schick writes that he was inspired by an idea from Harold Johnson: \\"In his campaign one night, Harold had our characters get captured, whereupon he took away all our stuff and threw us in a dungeon. The challenge: escape without relying on all our carefully hoarded adventuring gear. Were our characters people with skills and brains, or were they really just lists of equipment?\\" The original TSR product codes for modules A1, A2, A3 and A4 are 9039, 9040, 9041, and 9042 respectively. Reception Elisabeth Barrington reviewed Slave Pits of the Undercity in 1981, in The Space Gamer No. 35. She felt that the art was neat and organized, and on par with other art from TSR, although she felt that the maps required thorough study before play, as they are slightly too small for quick reference. Barrington felt that the module would not require much re- working, stating that it is \\"Recommended as is for AD&D; enthusiasts.\\" Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds notes that Slave Pits of the Undercity has \\"Some ingenious situations.\\" Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Slave Pits of the Undercity as one of the ten best classic adventures. According to Lev Lafayette of RPGNet, Slave Pits of the Undercity is a fairly good dungeon crawl. It has problems, such as a too-small font and underdeveloped storyline. On the other hand, Lafayette felt that its difficulty was appropriate for characters level 4‚Äì7, and that the tournament scoring system worked well. Lafayette called Secret of the Slavers Stockade \\"the low point of the four A series modules\\". Although he liked that it had forty pages, he also felt the artwork was sparse, and that the module was overly difficult for its intended character levels. Secret of the Slavers' Stockade was reviewed in Different Worlds magazine in November 1981. The reviewer complained that the module was poorly edited, and that it would have been easier to use with a roster of monsters provided. However, he said the module was \\"reasonably well done\\" overall, and a \\"good, workman-like\\" adventure. He praised the development of the antagonists and the care to characterize the reactions of the various monsters. All four modules were reviewed by Jim Bambra in issue No. 33 of White Dwarf magazine, who scored them 7 out of 10 as a whole, and reported A4 as the best adventure. He felt they were tough and held some surprises for players used to hack-and-slash dungeons. He also said Dungeon Masters needed to be creative and adaptive in describing dungeon rooms and remember that the occupants were dynamic and reacted to characters. Bambra was very critical of the editing done on the modules and pointed out several mistakes, concluding that \\"these modules should never have been released with such errors\\". Ken Rolston reviewed Scourge of the Slavelords for Dragon magazine #133 (May 1988). Rolston felt that a lot of the new material added to develop the Slavelords campaign was \\"quite good, particularly the first two new chapters of campaign material which bring the characters up to the original A1-4 scenarios\\". He noted that the scenarios from the four original tournament designs were mostly unchanged, and that the designs are \\"superior examples of their genre, though some are more suited to campaign play\\". He concluded the review with an evaluation stating: \\"The quality of the new campaign material varies from excellent to acceptable, but at its best, it‚Äôs really satisfying. As a campaign pack, we‚Äôre talking a minimum of nine big gaming sessions (and probably more; if the DM develops the campaign outlines and additional encounters). It‚Äôs occasionally clumsy and unconvincing, but what it lacks in polish and refinement it makes up for in sheer mass, energy, and fiendishness.\\" Scourge of the Slave Lords was ranked the 20th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004.

The Ionian school of Pre-Socratic philosophy was centred in Miletus, Ionia in the 6th century BC. Miletus and its environs was a thriving mercantile melting pot of current ideas of the time.See Farrington, Greek Science, two vols, 1953. The Ionian School included such thinkers as Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, and Archelaus.American International Encyclopedia, J.J. Little Co., New York 1954, Vol VIII The collective affinity of this group was first acknowledged by Aristotle who called them physiologoi (œÜœÖœÉŒπŒøŒªœåŒ≥ŒøŒπ),Aristotle, Metaphysics, 986b. meaning 'those who discoursed on nature'. The classification can be traced to the second-century historian of philosophy Sotion. They are sometimes referred to as cosmologists, since they were largely physicalists who tried to explain the nature of matter. While some of these scholars are included in the Milesian school of philosophy, others are more difficult to categorize. Most cosmologists thought that, although matter could change from one form to another, all matter had something in common which did not change. They did not agree on what all things had in common, and did not experiment to find out, but used abstract reasoning rather than religion or mythology to explain themselves, thus becoming the first philosophers in the Western tradition. Later philosophers widened their studies to include other areas of thought. The Eleatic school, for example, also studied epistemology, or how people come to know what exists. But the Ionians were the first group of philosophers that we know of, and so remain historically important. Thales Thales (Greek: ŒòŒ±Œª·øÜœÇ, Thalƒìs) of Miletus (c. 624 ‚Äì c. 546 BCE) is regarded as the earliest Western philosopher. Before him, the Greeks explained the origin and nature of the world through myths of anthropomorphic gods and heroes. Phenomena like lightning and earthquakes were attributed to actions of the gods. By contrast, Thales attempted to find naturalistic explanations of the world, without reference to the supernatural. He explained earthquakes by imagining that the Earth floats on water, and that earthquakes occur when the Earth is rocked by waves. Thales' most famous belief was his cosmological doctrine, which held that the world originated from water. Aristotle wrote in Metaphysics, \\"Thales, the founder of this school of philosophy [Ionian School], says the permanent entity is water (which is why he also propounded that the earth floats on water). Presumably he derived this assumption from seeing that the nutriment of everything is moist, and that heat itself is generated from moisture and depends upon it for its existence (and that from which a thing is generated is always its first principle). He derived his assumption, then, from this; and also from the fact that the seeds of everything have a moist nature, whereas water is the first principle of the nature of moist things.\\" Anaximander Anaximander (Greek: ·ºàŒΩŒ±ŒæŒØŒºŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ, Anaximandros) (c. 610 ‚Äì c. 546 BCE) wrote a cosmological work, little of which remains. From the few extant fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or first principle (arche, a word first found in Anaximander's writings, and which he probably invented) is an endless, unlimited mass (apeiron), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived. Anaximenes Anaximenes of Miletus (Greek: ·ºàŒΩŒ±ŒæŒπŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ ·ΩÅ ŒúŒπŒªŒÆœÉŒπŒøœÇ; c. 585 ‚Äì c. 528 BCE), like others in his school of thought, practiced material monism and believed that that air is the arche. Heraclitus Heraclitus (Greek: ·º©œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒøœÇ, Hƒìrakleitos) of Ephesus (c. 535 ‚Äì c. 475 BCE) disagreed with Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras about the nature of the ultimate substance and claimed instead that everything is derived from the Greek classical element fire, rather than from air, water, or earth. This led to the belief that change is real, and stability illusory. For Heraclitus \\"Everything flows, nothing stands still.\\" He is also famous for saying: \\"No man can cross the same river twice, because neither the man nor the river are the same.\\" Anaxagoras Anaxagoras (Greek: ·ºàŒΩŒ±ŒæŒ±Œ≥œåœÅŒ±œÇ) of Clazomenae (c. 510 ‚Äì c. 428 BCE) regarded material substance as an infinite multitude of imperishable primary elements, referring all generation and disappearance to mixture and separation respectively. All substance is ordered by an ordering force, the cosmic mind (nous). Archelaus Archelaus (Greek: ·ºàœÅœáŒ≠ŒªŒ±ŒøœÇ, Arkhelaos) was a Greek philosopher of the 5th century BCE, born probably in Athens. He was a pupil of Anaxagoras, and is said by Ion of Chios (Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 23) to have been the teacher of Socrates. Some argue that this is probably only an attempt to connect Socrates with the Ionian School; others (e.g. Gomperz, Greek Thinkers) uphold the story. There is similar difference of opinion as regards the statement that Archelaus formulated certain ethical doctrines.

He won four gold medals at two Olympic Games (1988 and 1992) and was unbeaten in the individual medley events from 1985 until his retirement in 1993. He is the first swimmer ever to swim the 200 m medley (long course) in less than 2 minutes. Career Possibly one of the greatest medley swimmers of all time, Tam√°s Darnyi dominated his speciality between 1985 and 1993. He won the 200/400 m medley double at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, the 1986 and 1991 World Championships, and the 1985, 1987 and 1989 European Championships. He also won a European title in the 200 m butterfly, and a world bronze in the same event. A teen talent, Darnyi might have competed at the 1984 Olympics, but both the Eastern European boycott and a personal accident prevented this. He was hit by a snowball in the left eye, which left him blind in one eye. After recovering, he started an unbeaten streak in medley events that lasted from 1985 to 1993. During that period, he bettered the world record in both medley events three times. After his final European title in 1993 (400 medley), he retired and managed a Budapest sports school. He was named Male World Swimmer of the Year in 1987 and 1991 by Swimming World magazine. He was elected Hungarian Sportsman of the Year in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1992 for his achievements.

Lysimachia () was an important Hellenistic Greek town on the north-western extremity of the Thracian Chersonese (the modern Gallipoli peninsula) in the neck where the peninsula joins the mainland in what is now the European part of Turkey, not far from the bay of Melas (the modern Gulf of Saros).  History  The city was built by Lysimachus in 309 BC, when he was preparing for war with his rivals; for the new city, being situated on the isthmus, commanded the road from Sestos to the north and the mainland of Thrace. In order to obtain inhabitants for his new city, Lysimachus destroyed the neighbouring town of Cardia, the birthplace of the historian Hieronymus,Strabo, Geography, 2.5.40, 7.52, 7.54; Pausanias, Description of Greece, 1.9.8; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca, 20.29.1; Polybius, Histories, 5.34; Pliny, Natural History, 4.11.48 . and settled the inhabitants of it and other Chersonesean cities here.John Freely (1998). Turkey around the Marmara. SEV Matbaalƒ±cƒ±k ve Yayƒ±ncƒ±lƒ±k, A.≈û. ƒ∞stanbul. p.104. Lysimachus no doubt made Lysimachia the capital of his kingdom, and it must have rapidly risen to great splendour and prosperity. After his death the city fell under Seleucid dominion, and during the wars between Seleucus Callinicus and Ptolemy Euergetes it passed from the hands of the Seleucids into those of the Ptolemies. Whether these latter set the town free, or whether it emancipated itself, is uncertain; at any rate it entered into the relation of sympolity with the Aetolian League. In 287 BC, the city was severely damaged by an earthquake, as reported by the Roman historian Justin (17.1.1-3). In 277 BC, near Lysimachia the Macedonian king Antigonus II Gonatas defeated the Gauls. As the Aetolians were not able to afford the town the necessary protection, it was destroyed again in 197 BC by the Thracians during the war of the Romans against Philip of Macedonia. Antiochus the Great restored the place, collected the scattered and enslaved inhabitants, and attracted colonists from all parts by generous promises.Livy, History of Rome, xxxiii. 38, 40; Appian, The Foreign Wars, \\"The Syrian Wars\\", 1. This restoration, however, appears to have been unsuccessful, and under the dominion of Rome it decayed more and more. The last time the place is mentioned under its ancient name, is in a passage of Ammianus Marcellinus.Ammianus Marcellinus, Histoire de Rome, xxii. 8. The emperor Justinian (527-565) restored it and surrounded it with strong fortifications,Procopius, De aedificiis, iv. 10. and after that time it is spoken of only under the name of Hexamilion.Symeon Metaphrastes, Chronicon.

Coastwatch station at right History The National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) was founded in Cornwall in 1994 following the deaths of two local fishermen who drowned below a recently closed coastguard station at Bass Point. Most of HM Coastguard's visual watch stations were closed following a period of rationalisation and modernisation. The institution, registered charity number 1159975, originated from a campaign to re-establish a visual coastal watch in Cornwall. The first NCI Coastwatch station was thus established at Bass Point, on The Lizard peninsula, Cornwall by November 1994. Following the successful launch of NCI Bass Point, other stations quickly followed in Devon, Cornwall, East Anglia, Somerset, Sussex, Essex, Dorset, and South Wales. As of December 2019, there are 56 NCI stations operational around the coast of England and Wales, from Fleetwood in the Northwest, through Wales, along the south coast, and up the east coast to Hornsea, East Yorkshire with over 2,600 trained volunteer watchkeepers. The institution has a joint memorandum of understanding with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), HM Revenue and Customs and more recently the Home Office Border Force, and these documents are guides to NCI's role and provide the basis for the working relationship the institution enjoys with all these departments. Most NCI stations have acquired, or are working towards acquiring \\"declared facility status\\", giving NCI a very important role to play when needed among the UK's search and rescue organisations. Most have also achieved QAVS. (Queen's Award for Voluntary Service). Work As of January 2019, the NCI's 2,500-plus uniformed trained volunteer watchkeepers maintain a visual watch along part of the UK coastline with 54 established NCI watch stations. These stations provide a daily visual watch in all weathers, monitoring marine radio channels, sea conditions and weather, using radar and providing a listening watch in poor visibility. All emergencies are reported to the appropriate authorities for action, the majority of NCI work being working mainly with HM Coastguard and other statutory authorities. Most NCI stations are manned on a daily basis providing a regular daily watch from 8:00am to dusk. In 2017 a total of 312,350-man- hours watch was performed by NCI watchkeepers, recording over 232,961 commercial, military and leisure vessel movements, and reporting a total of 498 incidents to HM Coastguard, fire, police and ambulance services, of which 41 were NCI-initiated lifeboat rescues. All this work was carried out at no cost to the public purse. All volunteers are provided with training in visual observation techniques, marine chart-work, Ordnance Survey mapping, critical reporting, marine radio procedures, and radar, ensuring all volunteers reach the standards expected by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The NCI works with HM Coastguard, the MCA, the RNLI and the other emergency services. In 2007, some of the 498 incidents reported by NCI to the MCA ended with the call-out of the RNLI lifeboats, RAF air-sea rescue, MoD ordnance units, fire, ambulance and other rescue agencies. These incidents included vessels sinking, vessels on fire, vessels in danger and distress, swimmers, surf boarders and kite boarders in difficulties, inflatable toys with children on board being blown out to sea, persons fallen over cliffs, persons washed off jetty, land fires, dangerous munitions washed up, personal injuries, and so on. In addition, many hundreds of minor incidents were dealt with including informing the coastguard and police of lost, found and missing children, distressed marine wildlife, ordnance on beaches, chemical drums, large carcasses and dangerous debris washed up. 2009 saw the fifteenth anniversary of the foundation of the National Coastwatch Institution.

C tuning is a type of guitar tuning. The strings of the guitar are tuned two whole steps lower than standard tuning. The resulting notes can be described most commonly as C-F-A‚ôØ-D‚ôØ-G-C or C-F-B‚ô≠-E‚ô≠-G-C. This is not to be confused with C tuning, which is one and one half steps lower than standard tuning. The tuning is commonly used by metal and hard rock artists to achieve a heavier, deeper sound. Slackening regular strings on a regular guitar to a lower pitch makes bending easier. Depending on personal playing style, some guitarists find this desirable, while others switch to heavier-gauge strings to avoid unintentional bending and to play chords in tune more easily. Another option is the use of a baritone guitar, which is built slightly longer and stronger than a regular guitar to achieve the desired pitch with heavy strings at average tensions.

He inspired many famous practitioners of the fingerstyle acoustic guitar such as Bert Jansch, Wizz Jones, John Renbourn, Martin Carthy, John Martyn, Paul Simon and Jimmy Page, who based his solo \\"White Summer\\" on Graham's \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\". Graham is probably best known for his acoustic instrumental, \\"Anji\\" and for popularizing DADGAD tuning, later widely adopted by acoustic guitarists.The DADGAD article, for example, lists users of this tuning, including M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill, D√°ith√≠ Sproule, Russian Circles, Stan Rogers, Jimmy Page, Artie Traum, Pierre Bensusan, Eric Roche, Laurence Juber, Tony McManus, Bert Jansch, Richard Thompson, Dick Gaughan, Imaad Wasif, Jeff Tweedy, Paul McSherry, DEPAPEPE, Ben Chasny and Trey Anastasio. Biography =Early life= Graham was born in Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England, \\"Folk musician Davy Graham honoured with birthplace plaque\\", BBC, 27 November 2016. Retrieved 28 November 2016 to a Guyanese mother and a Scottish father. He grew up in Westbourne Grove, in the Notting Hill Gate area of London. Although he never had any music theory lessons, he learnt to play the piano and harmonica as a child and then took up the classical guitar at the age of 12. As a teenager he was strongly influenced by the folk guitar player Steve Benbow, who had travelled widely with the army and played a guitar style influenced by Moroccan music. =\\"Anji\\"/\\"Angi\\"= At the age of 19, Graham wrote what is probably his most famous composition, the acoustic guitar solo \\"Angi\\" (sometimes spelled \\"Anji\\": see below). Colin Harper credits Graham with single-handedly inventing the concept of the folk guitar instrumental. \\"Angi\\", named after his then girlfriend, appeared on his debut EP 3/4 AD in April 1962. The tune spread through a generation of aspiring guitarists, changing its spelling as it went. Before the record was released, Bert Jansch had learnt it from a 1961 tape borrowed from Len Partridge. Jansch included it on his 1965 debut album as \\"Angie\\". The spelling Anji became the more widely used after it appeared on Simon & Garfunkel's 1966 album Sounds of Silence. In 1969, the same name for Chicken Shack's 100 Ton Chicken was used. \\"Anji\\" soon became a rite of passage for many acoustic finger-style guitarists. Arlen Roth has recorded \\"Anji\\" on two separate albums of his. Some other musicians of note who have covered \\"Anji\\" are John Renbourn, Lillebj√∏rn Nilsen, Gordon Giltrap, Clive Carroll and the anarchist group Chumbawamba, who used the guitar piece as a basis for their anti-war song \\"Jacob's Ladder (Not in My Name)\\". \\"Angi\\" is the second track on the first CD of the Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten. =Folk fame= Graham came to the attention of guitarists through his appearance in a 1959 broadcast of the BBC TV arts series Monitor, produced by Ken Russell and titled Hound Dogs and Bach Addicts: The Guitar Craze, in which he played an acoustic instrumental version of \\"Cry Me a River\\". During the 1960s, Graham released a string of albums of music from all around the world in all kinds of genres. 1964's Folk, Blues and Beyond and the following year's collaboration with the folk singer Shirley Collins, Folk Roots, New Routes, are frequently cited among his most influential album releases. Large as Life and Twice as Natural includes his cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"Both Sides, Now\\" alongside unprecedented explorations of Eastern Modes and scales played in Faustian takes on a Gibson J45 steel string guitar. His continuous touring of the world as a beat mystic traveller, picking up and then recording different styles of music for the guitar, has resulted in many musicians crediting him with founding world music.Simon Broughton, Mark Ellingham, Richard Trillo: World Music: The Rough Guide, Rough Guides, 1999, . p. 81. \\"Graham, who worshipped blues gods like Big Bill Broonzy and Leadbelly and modern jazz icons Thelonious Monk and Charlie Mingus...was equally intrigued by far eastern music and indeed any other strange styles he chanced upon, and was constantly off on different tangents, inventing new fusion styles that no-one else could get near. The big rewards eluded him, but for many, Davy Graham was ‚Äî still is ‚Äî the man.\\" However, though Graham recorded in a variety of genres and loved to play the oud, he was no purist, absorbing all his influences into his own ever-expanding conception of the possibilities of guitar music. Quizzed, for instance, on his introduction of a chord progression into an Arabic maqam, his amiable retort was to the effect that, if he felt like it and it sounded alright, why shouldn't he? Graham appears (uncredited) playing guitar in a pub in Joseph Losey's 1963 film The Servant. =Retirement= Graham married the American singer Holly Gwinn in the late 1960s and recorded the albums The Holly Kaleidosope and Godington Boundary with her in 1970, shortly before Gwinn had to return to the US and he was unable to follow her, because of his visa problem due to a marijuana conviction. He later described himself as having been \\"a casualty of too much self-indulgence\\", becoming a heroin addict in imitation of his jazz heroes. During this period, he taught acoustic guitar and also undertook charity work, particularly for various mental health charities. For several years he was on the executive council of Mind and he was involved for some time with the mystic Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh). In 1976 Graham recorded All That Moody, essentially a private pressing that remains his most collectible vinyl record owing to its \\"moody\\" nature and rarity. He recorded two further groundbreaking albums for Kicking Mule, 1978's The Complete Guitarist and 1980's Dance For Two People. He continued to play concerts, but dedicated the main thrust of his life to studying languages; he was fluent in Gaelic, French, and Greek and could hold his own in Turkish. He collected poems and folk songs and would regale his neighbours. After some time he became increasingly disinhibited. His penultimate album Playing in Traffic was so titled as he was frustrated by trying to learn Bach in the noise of 11 Lyme Street, Camden, where a boatyard used to operate on the canal just outside his bedroom. =Rediscovery and death= Graham was the subject of a 2005 BBC Radio documentary, Whatever Happened to Davy Graham? and in 2006 featured in the BBC Four documentary Folk Britannia. Many people sought out Graham over the years and tried to encourage him to return to the stage to play live; the last of this long line of seekers was Mark Pavey, who arranged some outings with guitarists and old friends including Bert Jansch, Duck Baker and Martin Carthy. These concerts were typically eclectic, with Graham playing a mix of acoustic blues, Romanian dance tunes, Irish pipe tunes, songs from South Africa and pieces by Bach.The Guardian, 17 December 2008, Obituaries section, p. 32. His final album, Broken Biscuits, consisted of originals and new arrangements of traditional songs from around the world. Graham was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008 and died on 15 December of that year. He is survived by his two daughters, Mercy and Kim. In November 2016, a blue plaque was installed at his birthplace, the former Bosworth Park Infirmary building. Influence Graham did not seek or achieve great commercial success, though his music received positive critical feedback and influenced folk revival artists and fellow players such as Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Martin Carthy, Ralph McTell, Wizz Jones, John Martyn, Nick Drake, Ritchie Blackmore, and Paul Simon, as well as folk rock bands such as Fairport Convention and Pentangle. Though Graham is commonly referred to as a folk musician, the diversity of his music shows strong influences from many genres. Elements of blues, jazz, and Middle Eastern music are evident throughout his work. Martin Carthy described Graham as \\"...an extraordinary, dedicated player, the one everyone followed and watched ‚Äì I couldn't believe anyone could play like that,\\" while Bert Jansch claimed that he was \\"courageous and controversial ‚Äì he never followed the rules.\\" Ray Davies maintained that the guitarist was \\"the greatest blues player I ever saw, apart from Big Bill Broonzy\\". According to George Chkiantz, \\"What impressed me with Davy Graham...was he played the guitar fretboard somehow as if it was a keyboard. There was a kind of freedom. You weren't conscious of him using chord shapes at all: his fingers just seemed to run around with complete freedom on the fretboard.\\"Sean Egan, Not Necessarily Stoned But Beautiful, Unanimous Ltd, 2002, p. 137. =DADGAD= One of Graham's lasting legacies is the DADGAD (Open Dsus4) guitar tuning, which he popularised in the early 1960s. While travelling in Morocco, he developed the tuning so he could better play along with and translate the traditional oud music he heard to guitar. Graham then went on to experiment playing traditional folk pieces in DADGAD tuning, often incorporating Indian and Middle Eastern scales and melodies. A good example is his arrangement of the traditional air She Moved Through the Fair, which he recorded live at the Troubadour in Earl's Court in 1964. The tuning provides freedom to improvise in the treble, while maintaining a solid underlying harmony and rhythm in the bass‚Äîthough it restricts the number of readily playable keys. While guitarists used \\"non-standard\\" or \\"non-classical\\" tunings before this (e.g., open E and open G in common use by blues and slide guitar players) DADGAD introduced a new \\"standard\\" tuning. Many guitarists now use the tuning, especially in folk and world music.

It occupies almost two million acres (8,000 km¬≤) and stretches for about across southern Utah. The largest national forest in Utah, it straddles the divide between the Great Basin and the Colorado River. In descending order of forestland area it is located in parts of Garfield, Washington, Iron, Kane, Wayne, and Piute counties. The majority (over 55%) of forest acreage lies in Garfield County. Elevations vary from above sea level near St. George, Utah to at Blue Bell Knoll on Boulder Mountain. The southern rim of the Great Basin, near the Colorado River, provides spectacular scenery. Colorado River canyons are made up of multi-colored cliffs and steep-walled gorges. The Forest is divided into four geographic areas. High altitude forests in gently rolling hills characterize the Markagunt, Paunsaugunt, and Aquarius Plateaus. Boulder Mountain, one of the largest high-elevation plateaus in the United States, is dotted with hundreds of small lakes 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400 m) above sea level. The forest includes the Pine Valley Mountains north of St. George The Forest has many climatic extremes. Precipitation ranges from in the lower elevations to more than per year near Brian Head Peak . At the higher elevations, most of the annual precipitation falls as snow. Thunderstorms are common during July and August and produce heavy rains. In some areas, August is the wettest month of the year. Temperature extremes can be impressive, with summer temperatures exceeding near St. George and winter lows exceeding on the plateau tops. The vegetation of the Forest grades from sparse, desert-type plants at the lower elevations to stand of low-growing pinyon pine and juniper dominating the mid- elevations. At the higher elevations, aspen and conifers such as pine, spruce, and fir predominate. The Dixie Forest Reserve was established on September 25, 1905 by the General Land Office. The name was derived from the local description of the warm southern part of Utah as \\"Dixie\\". In 1906 the U.S. Forest Service assumed responsibility for the lands, and on March 4, 1907 it became a National Forest. The western part of Sevier National Forest was added on July 1, 1922, and all of Powell National Forest on October 1, 1944.

His fame and skill were such that he was crowned Olympic champion by default in 336 BC when no other pankratiast dared meet him on the field. This kind of victory was called \\"akoniti\\" (literally: without getting dusted). The most famous story of Dioxippus is his victory over Coragus of the Macedonian army.  Coragus  Dioxippus, by then a former Pankratiast, attended a banquet hosted by Alexander the Great, who liked and respected the athlete. According to Curtius Rufus, Alexander's men mocked the guest, probably out of jealousy, and accused him of being a bit of a glutton. During the banquet, a distinguished Macedonian soldier named Coragus became drunk and belligerent, insulted Dioxippus, and challenged him to a match. Dioxippus enthusiastically and contemptuously agreed to the match. Alexander attempted to dissuade the two from fighting, but could not, due to the enthusiasm of the rest of the camp. The Macedonians supported Coragus and the rest of the Greeks supported Dioxippus.Quintus Curtius Rufus, \\"The History of Alexander\\", Penguin Classics (c) 2004, pg. 229 Alexander scheduled a day for the bout. The fight is well illustrated by Curtius Rufus. Dioxippus reportedly came out well oiled and nude, carrying a purple cloak in his left hand and a heavy club in his right. Coragus, however, wore full armor, carried a bronze shield and long pike called a sarisa in his left hand, a javelin in his right hand, and wearing a side sword. During the match, the Macedonian threw his javelin, which Dioxippus dodged. Then, before Coragus could transfer his pike to his right hand, Dioxippus attacked, shattering the weapon with his club. The Macedonian attempted to draw his sword, but Dioxippus wrestled him, getting double underhooks or as Rufus described as a \\"bear hug\\", or a bodylock, swept him to the ground, disarmed him, and immobilized him. He then stepped on Coragus' throat and could have killed him, but Alexander stopped the fight at this point. But this victory became Dioxippus' downfall. Alexander and the Macedonians were disappointed and embarrassed by the outcome of the match, particularly since their defeat occurred in front of recently conquered Persian prisoners. Alexander's disfavor was noted by the Macedonians, who conspired to embarrass Dioxippus by putting a golden cup underneath his pillow and accusing him of theft. Dioxippus felt this dishonor deeply. Realizing the Macedonians had framed him, he wrote a letter to Alexander describing the conspiracy, then committed suicide by falling on his sword. Alexander's regret at the death of Dioxippus, which he felt was unwarranted, was made even more bitter by the joyous reactions of the Macedonian camp which revealed their complicity.Quintus Curtius Rufus, \\"The History of Alexander\\", Penguin Classics (c) 2004, pg. 230 This story was recorded by the ancient historians Diodorus Siculus in \\"Library of History\\" and Quintus Curtius Rufus in \\"The History of Alexander\\". Quintus Curtius Rufus discusses the Dioxippus situation in book nine, part 7, paragraphs 16-26. The story of Dioxippus, the assassination of Philip II, and the ascension of Alexander the Great are novelized in Peter Katsionis' novel, \\"PATRIDA\\".

He was raised by his parents in Nuremberg where he delayed his final school exams (Abitur) and completed training as an electrician. In 1930 he and a colleague opened a store selling radios under the name F√ºrth, Grundig & Wurzer (RVF), generating one million Reichsmark in sales by 1938. After World War II business expanded with a successful range of consumer electronics. In 1972 the company became a corporation and was sold to Philips in 1984. His company was one of the first to produce FM radios, cutting out static interference for clearer reception. In 1952, it was one of the first European companies to start producing television sets. Grundig built his company up after World War II to become a market leader in home entertainment products and a symbol of West Germany's Wirtschaftswunder. It was only in the late 1970s that it began to lose some of its market share as it came under increasing pressure from lower-priced Japanese products, and in 1980 the company recorded its first losses. Grundig's answer to the Asian competition was to form EURO, a common front of European manufacturers. It did not stave off the challenge, however, and the company was forced to close eleven plants and cut its workforce from thirty-five thousand to twenty-nine thousand workers. In 1984, the Dutch Philips group bought out nearly a one-third share and took over the management. Colleagues described Max Grundig, the son of a warehouse manager, as a workaholic who made decisions alone and took interest in the minutest details of his business. \\"Order is holy to him; it means as much as half,\\" was an official company description of him. Grundig's father died when he was twelve and his mother had to support her five children on a factory wage. Young Max started his working life as a plumber's apprentice but by the age of twenty-two had set up his own radio shop with a friend in Nuremberg. After World War II, he was permitted by the Allies to relocate his business to the Franconian city of F√ºrth, right near Nuremberg, where he set up his own factory to produce radio parts. At the age of 21 he married Berta Haag, daughter Inge was born 1930. After this birth the marriage was divorced. In 1938 he married soprano Anneliese J√ºrgensen. In 1981 he married his third wife Chantal Grundig. They had daughter Maria-Alexandra. He received the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation in 1982.

Punding is a term that was coined originally to describe complex prolonged, purposeless, and stereotyped behaviour in phenmetrazine and chronic amphetamine users, by Swedish forensic psychiatrist G. Rylander, in 1968. It was later described in Parkinson's disease. It has also been described in methamphetamine and cocaine users, as well as in some patients with gambling addictions, and hypersexuality. Punding activity is characterized by compulsive fascination with and performance of repetitive, mechanical tasks, such as assembling and disassembling, collecting, or sorting household objects. For example, punding may consist of activities such as: * collecting pebbles and lining them up as perfectly as possible, * disassembling wristwatches and putting them back together again, * building hundreds of small wooden boxes * trying but failing to systematically remove the entire contents of all the drawers and shelves in the home and sort through all their contents. People engaging in punding find immersion in such activities comforting, even when it serves no purpose, and generally find it very frustrating to be diverted from them. They are not generally aware that there is a compulsive element, but will continue even when they have good reason to stop. Rylander describes a burglar who started punding and could not stop, even though he was suffering from an increasing apprehension of being caught. Interrupting can lead to various responses, including violent rage. Dopamine overactivity results in punding. It is commonly associated with side effects of drugs used against Parkinson's disease and with the use of methamphetamine. In Parkinson's, punding can be alleviated by lowering the medication dose. Punding is also similar to behaviors associated with autism. Punding as a drug-induced behaviour is similar to that observed in obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. Many disorders can be precipitated by drug use and tend to dissipate following cessation of drug use, although some disorders may affect the consciousness longer, depending on duration and frequency of drug use, as such behaviours can become embedded in the psyche if repeatedly performed.

Founded in 1988, the chain has its headquarters in Doral, Miami- Dade County, Florida. It is best known for marinated and grilled chicken and various sides including black beans and rice, corn casserole and more. History Pollo Tropical was founded in 1988 by two brothers from Miami, Larry and Stuart Harris. The chicken recipe was the result of Larry's studying cookbooks on Latin American cuisine and conducting experiments on his backyard grill to perfect the marinade. From the outset, the restaurant's strategy was to grill the marinated chicken in the customers' view. There were no prepackaged, precooked menu items and no microwave ovens. By 1993, the company had eight stores and went public. It opened 19 locations in one year including those in New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Tampa. Most of the new locations closed within a year after opening. In 1998, Pollo Tropical was sold to Carrols Restaurant Group, which was and is Burger King's largest United States franchisee. After a period of rapid expansion, there were sixty-nine company- owned locations and numerous franchisees in the Latin American and Caribbean regions. Pollo Tropical is now a subsidiary of Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc., which was spun-off from Carrols Restaurant Group in 2012. Fiesta owns, operates and franchises the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurant brands. Its headquarters have been located in the Doral area of Miami since 2017. The company currently owns and operates more than 140 locations throughout Florida, plus five licensed restaurants on college campuses and 32 franchised locations throughout the Caribbean, Central America, South America and Puerto Rico. Food concepts In addition to its fire-grilled chicken, the restaurant provides other regional foods such as Mojo Roast Pork, rice, beans, corn casserole and plantains. In 2018 the company began offering fried chicken in addition to their traditional fire-grilled recipe. Challenges in the United States After a decline in sales, Fiesta began closing its Texas restaurants, including Pollo Tropical locations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin, in the second quarter of 2017. The Texas restaurants were shuttered as part of closings of 30 stores, including locations in Georgia and Tennessee. This was part of a trend announced earlier in 2017, as the company moved to slow development, having grown \\"too far, too fast.\\" Instead of trying to open 30 new stores, the company planned to open 8 to 10, all in Florida, which is its core market. While its grilled chicken and other offerings are seen as healthy alternatives to fried chicken, hamburgers and french fries, the style and taste does not immediately draw customers outside Florida, and so requires some explanation to lure new customers in other markets.

Life and career Ada Agnes Jane McElhenney was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1834. She grew up under the care of her maternal grandfather as part of an aristocratic Southern family, but started her career as a writer around age 18, writing under the pseudonyms Clare and later Ada Clare. She moved to New York City in 1854, took up acting, engaged in a widely publicized liaison with pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk, and bore a son out of wedlock. During the height of her acting career, she frequented Pfaff's Cellar, where she became known as the \\"Queen of Bohemia\\". She also wrote for the Saturday Press, an iconoclastic weekly magazine of the arts. Her only novel, entitled Only a Woman's Heart, was poorly received by reviewers, who criticized the author for her lack of skill with plot and dialogue. Clare was devastated, and returned to acting in a provincial stock company. On September 9, 1868, Clare married actor Frank Noyes in Houston, Texas. Clare suffered a dog bite in her theatrical agent's office and died from rabies in 1874.

Bush's five-week summer vacation there in 2005, named after Iraq War casualty US Army Specialist Casey Sheehan. A panoramic photograph of Camp Casey on August 18, 2005 Arriving on a bus that departed the Veterans for Peace National Convention, Sheehan walked with the support of Camilo Mej√≠a and other veterans who helped Cindy gain passage when multiple officers of the law attempted to persuade her from advancing beyond the Crawford Texas Peace House Sheehan failed to get a second meeting with President Bush for an explanation of the cause for which her son, Casey, died. Having been turned away, she pitched a tent by the side of the road and announced her intention to stay, day and night, for the full five weeks or until such a meeting is granted. She also promised that, if she were not granted a second meeting, she would return to Crawford each time Bush visited. Other members of Gold Star Families for Peace and other anti-Iraq War activists joined them, camped in public land, such as ditches by the road. A local property owner provided them with a place to camp, which became known as \\"Camp Casey II.\\" Two weeks after the establishment of \\"Camp Casey,\\" counter-protestors established their own camp nearby. Administration Response There had been reports that the police had threatened to arrest all protesters on site on Thursday, August 11, 2005, when Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would be at the president's nearby ranch. However, no arrests in connection with the protest were made. President George W. Bush did speak to reporters at his ranch, saying: > I sympathize with Mrs. Sheehan. She feels strongly about her position, and > she has every right in the world to say what she believes. This is America. > She has a right to her position, and I thought long and hard about her > position. I've heard her position from others, which is: 'Get out of Iraq > now.' And it would be a mistake for the security of this country and the > ability to lay the foundations for peace in the long run if we were to do > so.http://premium.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/08/11/bush.ap/ Prior to going on a bicycle ride on his Texas ranch on August 13, 2005, Bush gave journalists and aides a defense of his not meeting with Sheehan stating, as reported by Ken Herman of Cox Enterprises: > I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who > have got something to say. But I think it's also important for me to go on > with my life, to keep a balanced life ... I think the people want the > president to be in a position to make good, crisp decisions and to stay > healthy. And part of my being is to be outside exercising. So I'm mindful of > what goes on around me. On the other hand, I'm also mindful that I've got a > life to live and will do so. Sheehan later issued a statement, which among other things outlined the purpose of the protest.https://news.yahoo.com/s/huffpost/20050811/cm_huffpost/005472 Beyond Sheehan When Sheehan had to go to Los Angeles on August 18, after her 74-year-old mother suffered a stroke,http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/08/18/crawford.protest/index.html/ she said she would be back when she could and that she would follow Bush to Washington at the end of his vacation. \\"Camp Casey\\" remained active in her absence, with over 150 protesters sleeping in tents or cars,http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/12452106.htm and hundreds more participating sporadically. During this time, Bush flew to another state to continue his vacation with a fishing trip. Less than two days later (still during the scheduled vacation), he and his administration began a new public relations campaign to rally support for the war in Iraq. The campaign was primarily set in Idaho and Utah. Support During Sheehan's vigil, a number of organizations and individuals expressed and provided support to the activists at \\"Camp Casey.\\" One of these was the national organization Veterans for Peace, at whose convention Sheehan spoke just prior to beginning her vigil in Crawford. Members of the organization like Desert storm Veteran Dennis Kyne assisted in the initiation of the \\"Camp Casey\\" site. Others were installing and maintaining the Arlington West display there. The website MoveOn.org announced on August 10, 2005, that it was gathering comments via email to place in a two-page newspaper spread in a Sunday edition of the Waco Tribune newspaper in support of Sheehan and her efforts. MoveOn gathered more than 250,000 comments, many of which were included in the advertisement. Tom Matzzie of MoveOn said: > In her grief and bravery, Cindy has become a symbol for millions of > Americans who demand better answers about the Iraq war. Though right-wing > pundits have attacked her personally, her honesty is unimpeachable. Now more > and more mothers (and fathers, brothers, sisters, wives, husbands, sons and > daughters) are standing up with Cindy. Please join us, and together, we'll > make sure that President Bush can't escape the reality of this war‚Äîeven in > Crawford, Texas. Supporters pointed out that the Crawford protest highlighted the Bush administration's belief in selective violence and the claim that the President failed to take responsibility for the deaths of those he commanded. On the week of August 8, 2005, several other groups were reported traveling to Texas to join the protest. Sherry Bohlen, field director of the Progressive Democrats of America (PDA), was one person traveling to Crawford, and said of the protest: > We'll be sleeping in a tent in the ditch along the roadside (the only place > that the authorities will allow us to be). I spoke with Cindy by phone again > yesterday. She said that local authorities have told her that if we're still > there by Thursday we'll be arrested as \\"national security risks\\"... She > could well be the Rosa Parks of the movement against the Iraq War. Just as > Rosa refused to leave the bus, Cindy is refusing to leave the roadside. > She's the spark that is igniting the anti-war movement. On August 9, 2005, Sheehan began writing a blog concerning (among other things) her experience at Camp Casey, her thoughts on the Iraq War, and her response to right-wing criticism of her. It was featured on several websites, including The Huffington Post, Daily Kos, and Michael Moore.com. She spoke at the laissez-faire Ludwig von Mises Institute, whose founder and president, the free-market capitalist Lew Rockwell, regularly features Sheehan's columns on his website. Parents of other troops killed in Iraq On August 17, 2005, Jane and Jim Bright, parents of slain Army Sgt. Evan Ashcroft, attended a vigil in support of Sheehan, saying \\"their son's memory would not be lost in the anti-war movement.\\" They also said their son, like Sheehan's son, \\"was a hero who died for what he believed in.\\" Jim Bright went on to say \\"People are looking inside themselves and saying, is this war worth it?\\".http://www2.dailynews.com/news/ci_2951258 Celeste Zappala, mother of slain Sgt.

Ryan, a Marine who was killed in Ramadi, says of Sheehan: \\"She's going about this not realizing how many people she's hurting. When she refers to anyone killed in Iraq, she's referring to my son. She doesn't have anything to say about what happened to my son,\\" On August 15, 2005, Matt and Toni Matula, parents of Matthew Matula, a Texas Marine killed in Iraq, requested that the white cross representing their dead son as a victim of the war in Iraq be removed, stating that they did not wish their son's name to be part of an anti-war demonstration. Mr. Matula said, \\"It's fine for people to grieve their own way. It aggravates me to see them using other people's names to further their cause.\\" Natalie Healy, mother of Dan Healy, a Navy SEAL who was killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan, organized a rally on August 20, 2005, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to counteract Sheehan's message, stating: \\"We just want to let the fellas know that we're supporting them and that we're not going to wimp out on them.\\" Gary Qualls whose son, Marine Corporal Louis Wayne Qualls died in Iraq, started what was dubbed \\"Fort Qualls\\" in Crawford, Texas, to counter the \\"Camp Casey\\" protests.

Lyrics I come to the garden alone, While the dew is still on the roses; And the voice I hear, falling on my ear, The Son of God discloses. Refrain: And He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own, And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known. He speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so sweet the birds hush their singing; And the melody that He gave to me Within my heart is ringing. I'd stay in the garden with Him Tho' the night around me be falling; But He bids me go; thro' the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling.

Biography Coventry was the second son of George Coventry, 9th Earl of Coventry. He served in the Worcestershire Regiment but was seconded to the Bechuanaland Mounted Police Force from 1888-96..He took part in the Matabeland War of 1893 and the Jameson Raid of 1896 (for which he was briefly imprisoned). He then joined the West African Frontier Force for a short period, but at the same time was also commissioned into the Worcestershire Yeomanry. Coventry took command of the latter during the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. In April 1916 he was captured with many of the regiment at Katia, Egypt, and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner in Turkey. In 1922 he took command of the re-formed Worcestershire and Oxfordshire Yeomanry Brigade, now serving as 100 Field Brigade, Royal Artillery. He retired from the Yeomanry in 1925. Cricket He played his cricket for Worcestershire when it was still a minor county, that is, a county without first-class status. He was described as \\"a fair bat with a free style who can hit hard\\". When the English tour to South Africa in 1888-89 was being put together, because the South Africans were considered weak, weaker players were selected for the English team. Coventry was one of those players selected. England still won the two games against representative South African sides easily, though Coventry did not feature greatly in either game: he batted at number 10 and did not bowl. Coventry played no first-class cricket other than in those two Tests. Family Coventry married, in St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, on 16 January 1900, Lily Whitehouse, younger daughter of Mr. FitzHugh Whitehouse, of Newport, USA. His younger son Francis briefly succeeded as 12th Earl of Coventry.

Family and early life Ramaswami came from one of the leading sports families in India. He was the youngest son of Buchi Babu Naidu, often considered the father of South Indian cricket. His two brothers, son and four nephews all played first class cricket. When the only brother of his mother died young, Ramaswami was given in adoption to his maternal grandfather, which led to his family name being different from that of his brothers. He studied in Wesley High School, Wesley College and the Presidency. On one occasion while at Wesley, he put on more than 200 runs for the last wicket to win a match after his team was 50 for nine, himself scoring 188*. Cambridge He joined Cambridge University in 1919 where he studied until 1923. In the summer of 1920, he won the singles title at the Doherty Cup tennis tournament open to all students in the university. He won a 'half blue' that year, representing Cambridge in the doubles, and earned a blue in 1921. On a tour of Holland, he won the singles and the doubles partnering S. M. Hadi - another future first class cricketer. In 1922, Ramaswami represented India in the Davis Cup with Dr. A. H. Fyzee and A. A. Fayzee. India defeated Romania in the first round at Bristol but lost to Spain in Beckenham. Ramaswami played only in the doubles partnering Dr. Fayzee and won both his matches. The Spanish pair of Comte de Gomar and Flaquer, whom they beat in five sets, went on to play the doubles finals at Wimbledon in 1923. In 1922, Ramaswami took part in Wimbledon, reaching the second round. In 1923 he won the singles title at the South of England Championships defeating Gordon Lowe in the final in three sets. Ramaswami is one of the three Indian cricketing double internationals, the others being M. J. Gopalan and Yuzvendra Chahal. Career in India Ramaswami returned to Madras in January 1924 and joined the Agricultural Department as an Officer. He served in different parts of the Madras Presidency in the next 24 years. His two appearances in Test matches came in England in 1936 when he was already 40. He wrote later in his autobiography that he was picked for non-cricketing reasons. Though well past his prime at the time, he scored 40 and 60 on debut and ended his career with an average of 56. He was a left-handed batsman and an attacking player. Ramaswami played for Hindus against Arthur Gilligan's MCC team in 1926-27 and scored 83 against Jack Ryder's Australian Services XI in 1935-36. After the end of his career, he served as a selector, and manager to the Indian team to West Indies in 1952-53. His Ramblings of a Games Addict is one of the earliest autobiographies in Indian cricket. Ramaswami married Lakshmi Chaya Devi in 1928. He had two sons, Ram Swarup and Lakshman Swarup, and a daughter, Shantha Devi. Ram Swarup represented Madras and Andhra in first class cricket. Disappearance Ramaswami left his home in Adyar on the morning of 15 October 1985 and never returned. There have been occasional rumours about him being sighted. Wisden listed him as 'presumed dead' from 1988 to 1991. When doubts were raised about his fate, this was removed in 1992 but brought back in 1996. In the more recent editions, he has the status 'd. unknown'. Notes * Ramaswami's family name appears variously as Cota, Cotah and Cotar - Cota being the most common version. This article uses Cotah as the title because this is the version used by Ramaswami in his memoirs. * CricketArchive recently modified the entry of Ramaswami and records his month of death as January 1990.

Although the Dormobile name was primarily associated with motor homes based on the front-engined Bedford CA, conversions were also offered of competitor vehicles with more intrusively located engines such as this 1965 Morris J4. The Bedford Dormobile is a 1960s-era campervan (motorcaravan, motorhome) conversion, based on the Bedford CA van, and subsequently on the Bedford CF. It was manufactured in Folkestone in Kent, southern England, by Martin Walter. The first Bedford CA based Dormobile motorhome, complete with a gas stove, a sink and cupboards and seats which converted into beds, appeared in 1957. The elevating roof, hinged on one side and featuring a red and white striped canopy, was quickly evolved in order to make it possible to stand within the vehicle. The campervan idea originated as a compromise negotiated with the UK tax office. Earlier in the 1950s, the manufacturers specialised in converting the Bedford CA van into a mini-bus, featuring extra side windows and seats. The UK tax authorities asserted that the converted vehicle was effectively a form of estate car, and therefore its retail price should bear passenger car purchase tax, a burden from which buyers of vans were spared. However, the manufacturers negotiated an agreement whereby Dormobile converted vans could be sold without purchase tax, provided they incorporated \\"built-in life support equipment\\" such as a cooking device, and facilities for the washing and storage of clothes. These stipulations triggered a move away from minibus conversions to motorhome conversions, which carved out a substantial new life-style market as the ensuing decade saw a substantial increase in disposable incomes in the UK. The company subsequently converted a number of different van-based vehicles to other uses, including minibuses and ambulances, before collapsing in the mid-1990s. The novelist Anthony Burgess and his wife, Liana, owned one and used it as a home and means of travelling throughout Western Europe in the late 1960s.

He was portrayed by Dean Winters from 1997 to 2003. Character overview O‚ÄôReily is an Irish- American sociopathic hoodlum originally sentenced to 12 years to life for killing two people while driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, then 40 to life after confessing to a murder he had his brother, Cyril, commit. Before he was arrested for his original crime he was running a street gang of Irish-American hoodlums called the Bridge Street Gang, with Cyril as his lieutenant/bodyguard. When his brother is permanently brain-damaged in a fight with a rival at a funeral, Ryan, blaming himself, goes on a drug and alcohol-fueled rampage throughout the city. Highly intelligent and completely ruthless, O'Reily survives in Oz by manipulating everyone around him, and working with the most dangerous inmates using a variety of inmate gangs to get whatever he wants; series creator Tom Fontana has likened him to Iago, the villain of Shakespeare's Othello. Ryan is extremely protective of his intellectually disabled brother Cyril, and has no qualms against striking anyone who threatens him, including prison guards. Above all else, Ryan strives to keep Cyril in Emerald City, where Ryan can protect him. Cyril in turn cares about Ryan and depends on him a great deal, usually obeying him, which leads to Ryan taking advantage of him more than once. Fictional history =Season 1= He was the cause of nearly every death in the first season of Oz: * In the pilot episode, he bribes the guards in solitary confinement to allow Johnny Post in to burn Dino Ortolani. He then betrayed Post to the Italian gang. * He sets up Jefferson Keane to be killed. This backfires, but Keane goes to death row for killing one of his attackers. * Along with Simon Adebisi, he feeds Nino Schibetta ground glass over the course of a few weeks, causing him internal hemorrhaging. With all his major competition eliminated, O‚ÄôReily becomes a major player in Oz's drug scene. He also plays a major role in feeding Tobias Beecher's heroin addiction, being his main supplier. Throughout the season O'Reily allies himself with the Italians and Homeboys, but behind their backs, he often calls the Italians \\"dagos\\" and \\"wops\\", the Homeboys \\"niggers\\", and the Latinos \\"spics\\". =Season 2= In the second season, O‚ÄôReily is enjoying his new status in the Oz drug scene when he is diagnosed with breast cancer. He is helped through his treatment and chemotherapy by Dr. Gloria Nathan, Oz's chief physician. O‚ÄôReily falls in love with her and is so overcome with jealousy of her husband that he tells his mentally handicapped brother, Cyril, to kill Dr. Nathan's husband. Cyril is arrested and sent to Oz, but is put in a different unit from his brother. There, Cyril is raped by Vernon Schillinger and his Aryan Brotherhood gang. This enrages O‚ÄôReily, but he can't do anything about it. In order to protect Cyril, he asks the manager of his unit, Tim McManus, to transfer Cyril into Em City with him. McManus agrees in return for O‚ÄôReily's admission of guilt in Preston Nathan's death, which O‚ÄôReily refuses. Later, when a guard is blinded by Miguel Alvarez and needs a blood transfusion, it turns out that O‚ÄôReily is the only prisoner in Oz to match his blood type. He uses this as leverage to secure a place for his brother in Em City with him. O‚ÄôReily then admits his guilt in Preston Nathan's murder so that he can remain in Oz to protect Cyril. McManus then informs him he will be brought up on charges for ordering the murder of Preston Nathan. =Season 3= Still eager for revenge on Schillinger, Ryan manipulates Jaz Hoyt into attacking Schillinger, but Schillinger escapes unharmed. Furious, O‚ÄôReily joins forces with Tobias Beecher and Chris Keller, two other inmates who are looking to get even with Schillinger. When Schillinger's son Andrew comes to Em City, O‚ÄôReily tortures him when he stops selling him drugs, forcing Andrew to buy them through non- white inmates. Because Andrew has been trained as a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, he can't bring himself to buy drugs from those inmates. After Andrew (having befriended and received counseling from Beecher and becoming clean from drugs) publicly embarrasses his father, Vern Schillinger, by ignoring his attempts to reconcile with him and renounces his racist beliefs, his humiliated father gives his son enough heroin to overdose when Andrew is sent to the hole as a kind of test - which he \\"fails\\" by dying. Meanwhile, the prison administrators hire a new CO supervisor, Sean Murphy. Murphy and O'Reily bond over the Spanish Armada myth of the Black Irish and develop a kind of friendship. When Murphy organizes a boxing tournament, O‚ÄôReily enters Cyril. To ensure Cyril's victory, he spikes his opponents' water bottles with chloral hydrate. Cyril beats James Robson in the first round. As a result, Ryan wins money in the bets and the Aryans leave Cyril alone for good. From there, Ryan then spikes Miguel Alvarez's water and tells Alvarez's opponent, gay inmate Jason Cramer, that the Latinos will rape his lover if he loses the fight. Alvarez loses, the Latinos look worse, and Carmen Guerra grows suspicious of O‚ÄôReily's winning streak. In round two, Cyril must fight Italian inmate Chucky Pancamo. O'Reily arranges the death of William Cudney, who threatened to expose him for cheating, and spikes Pancamo's water with heroin. Cyril easily beats Pancamo. Murphy discovers O‚ÄôReily cheating thanks to a tip from Nikolai Stanislofsky, and tells O'Reily to stop to prevent a riot. In order to allow Cyril to keep his edge and win the final fight against Muslim inmate Hamid Khan, O‚ÄôReily invites their abusive father to visit him and Cyril. Ryan then encourages Cyril to think about their father's abuse during the fight. Pushed into a rage, Cyril beats Khan into a coma, making him brain dead. The resulting racial tension forces Oz into a lockdown. =Season 4 Part I= O'Reily and Cyril participate in an interaction session with Gloria Nathan and her deceased husband's parents. Nathan wants him there to condemn him for killing her husband, but O‚ÄôReily turns the tables on them when he says that she and McManus had an affair. She is later raped by Irish hoodlum Patrick Keenan, and she suspects O‚ÄôReily of setting her up. Although he didn't, he tells her that he did so she can feel whole again. O'Reily then kills Keenan. Nathan takes a leave of absence shortly after. O'Reily also has a dispute over possession of a contraband cell phone with Nikolai Stanislofsky, eventually resulting in Stanislofsky's demise at the hands of Officer Claire Howell, a CO whom he begins to have occasional sex with, though he quickly tries to put an end to it. In Em City, white and Latino inmates and guards are constantly being traded for black guards and inmates who support Adebisi, so O‚ÄôReily and Keller unite to turn the tables. They murder inmates Nate Shemin and Mondo Browne, and frame Supreme Allah. As a result, Unit Manager Martin Querns is fired and McManus is rehired. =Season 4 Part II= A television crew comes to Oz to film the prisoners' daily lives, headed by Jack Eldridge, a reporter who once reported on Irish gang activity in general, and the O'Reilys in particular. This report exposed them as criminals to their mother, who was emotionally devastated upon finding out. In his interview with Eldridge, O'Reily gets some revenge on Eldridge by refusing to give any information about Adebisi's death. Meanwhile, Dr. Nathan returns to Oz and admits to prison psychiatrist Sister Peter Marie that she did indeed have feelings for O'Reily, which Sister Pete encourages her to put out of her mind. Supreme Allah is released from solitary and tells O'Reily that he knows who framed him, so O'Reily and Keller go to Burr Redding and ask that he be eliminated. Redding then has Tug Daniels visit and stab Supreme Allah, who was in Oz for murdering Daniels' brother. A woman named Suzanne Fitzgerald (Betty Buckley) comes to visit, claiming to be his birth mother. O'Reily does not believe her at first, but accepts it after his father tells him about her. His mother turns out to be a 1960s radical on the run who is looking to settle down. Asian inmate Jia Kenmin tells Cyril that he will teach him karate, resulting in a fight that puts Jia into a coma. The staff, remembering Hamid Khan, threaten to send Cyril to a mental institution. Meanwhile, Provisional IRA member Padraig Connolly arrives and plans with O'Reily to blow up Em City. At the last minute, O'Reily decides that it is wrong and that many people including his brother and Dr. Nathan may be harmed, but Connolly attempts to set off the bomb early. The bomb, however, fails to detonate, and O'Reily goes unpunished since he had tried to rid Em City of the bomb. =Season 5= O‚ÄôReily's mother turns herself in and Governor James Devlin reduces her charge to a two-year community service sentence at Oz. Inmate Li Chen arrives shortly afterward, and Jia Kenmin plots with him to put the O‚ÄôReily brothers on death row. He pays inmate Glen Shupe to lie to Cyril about Chen planning to rape Fitzgerald. Cyril and Ryan attack the two, and Cyril stabs and kills Chen while defending his brother, and stands trial for murder. The O‚ÄôReily family decides that Cyril is too mentally scarred to live, so they do not oppose his trial. O‚ÄôReily, in the meantime, shares a cell with Father Daniel Meehan, an Irish-American priest imprisoned for his part in a violent protest, who helped prison psychiatrist Sister Peter Marie Raimondo fight for Cyril's life. After finding out that Shupe was paid to lie, O‚ÄôReily plots revenge. Picking up on the grudge between Kenmin and Enrique Morales, O‚ÄôReily makes a deal with the Latinos. The Latinos agree to horribly injure Shupe, making sure it won't be traced back to O‚ÄôReily; in return, O‚ÄôReily agrees to murder Jia. The Latinos cut off Shupe's arm, and O‚ÄôReily provokes Kenmin into a fight where he ends up helping the guards restrain Kenmin. He convinces officer Robinson that Kenmin talked badly of the guards and, as a result, they kill him in the solitary confinement ward. Motivated by O'Reily's previous bad blood with the Aryans, O‚ÄôReily and Poet announce in the cafeteria that Aryan James Robson had the gums of a black man surgically implanted, with O'Reily citing aloud that he \\"went to the dentist, and got himself a nice pair of dirty ghetto gums\\", and the whole cafeteria erupts in laughter. Robson is kicked out of the Brotherhood for his \\"black blood\\", leaving him defenseless from the other prisoners. With Meehan's guidance, O‚ÄôReily opens up about his childhood traumas and, after a while, finally joins the effort to save Cyril. His brother is nevertheless sentenced to death. O‚ÄôReily vows to be there in the appeal process. =Season 6= O‚ÄôReily forces Shupe to tell the truth to Cyril's attorney Arnold Zelman, who is unable to get him to testify. Shortly afterward, Meehan dies from a brain embolism, Ryan then washes the body in the morgue, reading a piece from the bible out of respect for Meehan. Peter Schibetta, the son of Nino Schibetta (the former leader of the Italian gang, who was killed by O'Reily in the first season), is rumored to have killed him by giving him \\"the evil eye\\" in return for O'Reily having killed his father, since Schibetta had previously vowed to curse everyone O‚ÄôReily loves. O‚ÄôReily goes to Chucky Pancamo and tells him that Schibetta plans to use the evil eye on the superstitious Pancamo as revenge for his failure to protect him from his brutal rape from Adebisi. Enraged, Pancamo and the Italians have Schibetta killed, notably removing his eye. It's throughout this season that Zelman unsuccessfully appeals Cyril's case. Jahfree Neema, a former Black Panther, is sent to Oz and turns out to be connected romantically to Suzanne. He initially hates O‚ÄôReily, who tries to get Redding to murder him. Neema, however, tells O'Reily that he wants to save Cyril, and he organizes every inmate from every gang to protest the execution, resulting in a last second stay of execution and as a result, Ryan gains respect for him. O'Reily also believes God saved Cyril because of his sincere prayers on what was meant to be the night of Cyril's execution. Meanwhile, their father, Seamus, arrives in Oz and tries to kill Neema, but ends up in the hospital instead. Eventually, Cyril is executed despite Ryan's efforts, it's during the execution that Ryan is seen walking the maze in the gym unsupervised and visibly upset. Dr. Nathan enters the gym and she and O'Reily kiss passionately, culminating the five-season narrative arc initiated by O'Reily's unrequited love. The screen then fades to black, leaving the two. Seamus O'Reily, while in the hospital, has come to regret how he treated his sons (with the help of a stern speech given to him by Suzanne) and asks Ryan if he can see Cyril, Ryan tells him it's too late as Cyril has already been executed, the father and son then reconnect through their grief. Ryan O'Reily is last seen wheeling Seamus onto a bus during an attack involving a mysterious contaminate orchestrated by Keller. =Murders committed= *Two construction workers - Ran over by a car, while Ryan was intoxicated. *Nino Schibetta - Killed by Ryan and Adebisi, to take over his drug trade in Oz. *Patrick Keenan - Killed by Ryan for raping Gloria Nathan, as an attempt to earn her love. *Supreme Allah - Killed by Ryan via food poisoning (on a tip given by Augustus Hill). Reception Sean O'Sullivan and David Wilson describe the character as \\"the arch schemer,\\" while USA Today labels him as \\"Oz's resident troublemaker\\". O'Sullivan and Wilson also write that \\"O'Reily is one of the most appealing characters in the show, and someone whom it is possible to follow because of his continuing story arc...O'Reily's Machiavellian scheming is one of the main entertainment features of the show.\\" References External links * Official character biography at Oz website Category:Fictional murderers Category:Oz (TV series) characters Category:Fictional characters with cancer Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 Category:Fictional career criminals Category:Fictional heroin users Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional smokers Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Ryan O'Reily"},{"id":"2529489","title":"The Rapture (album)"},{"id":"2529493","text":"Surduc Pass (in Romanian: Defileul Jiului or Pasul Surduc, in Hungarian Szurdok-szoros) is a mountain pass in the Gorj and Hunedoara counties of Southwestern Romania, connecting the Petro≈üani Depression with Oltenia.

The Romanian name of the pass derives from the Hungarian word \\"szurdok\\", which means \\"defile\\" or \\"canyon\\".

Essentially a solo venture, Recoil began whilst Wilder was still in Depeche Mode as an outlet for his experimental, less pop- oriented compositions. Once he announced his departure from the group in 1995, Recoil became Wilder's primary musical enterprise. 1980s and 1990s Recoil began in 1986, when Daniel Miller (record producer and founder of Mute Records) heard some of Alan Wilder's demo recordings, which he had made on a 4-track cassette machine. These recordings were substantially different from anything Depeche Mode had released ‚Äî whilst they were still created using synthesizers and sampling, they featured little of Depeche Mode's catchy pop songwriting, instead opting for an experimental, John Cage-esque style. Due to the primitive and decidedly uncommercial nature of these pieces, Wilder and the record label decided to release the album inconspicuously, naming it 1 + 2. It eventually came out in mid-1986, not long after the release of Depeche Mode's well-received Black Celebration. In January 1988, during the middle of Depeche Mode's hugely successful \\"Tour for the Masses\\", Mute released the second Recoil album ‚Äî Hydrology. This followed in a similar vein to the previous Recoil record, consisting of entirely instrumental, synthesized landscapes. Unfortunately, due to Wilder's busy touring schedule, he was unable to effectively promote the record. Recoil's first single was from his third album Bloodline, a cover of the Sensational Alex Harvey Band's \\"Faith Healer\\", with Douglas McCarthy from Nitzer Ebb on vocals. McCarthy would later reappear for two songs on the next album, Unsound Methods, including the single \\"Stalker\\". 1997's Unsound Methods was the first release after Wilder's decision to leave Depeche Mode. The fifth album, Liquid was released in 2000. =Continuing artwork= The cover of 1 + 2 features \\"1+2\\" in transparent varnish, covering the front and back of the LP sleeve. Similarly, the cover of the Hydrology LP features a large \\"3\\" and \\"4\\" in transparent varnish. The back cover of Bloodline features \\"5 + 6\\" in pink and grey type. SubHuman... 2007‚Äì2008 Although there had been no releases for some time, in 2005 Alan Wilder confirmed that he would start work on a new album. On 20 October 2006, Wilder appeared on a web greeting confirming a Summer 2007 target date for the next Recoil album. On 22 April 2007, Wilder released a statement on his MySpace page that the new album would be entitled subHuman and had been provisionally set for release on 9 July 2007. Included as guest vocalists this time were Carla Trevaskis and Joe Richardson. The latter also delivered the vocals for a track titled \\"Prey\\" which was the only single taken from subHuman. A sample from the song was also put on Recoil's MySpace page. \\"Prey\\" was released on 27 June 2009 via iTunes and related download portals. In addition, 2007 saw the re-release of Bloodline (originally released in 1991) and Hydrology plus 1 + 2 (originally released in 1988). iTunes also prepared a special Recoil pack (similar to the Depeche Mode iTunes pack) holding all Recoil releases. It was the first time that all Recoil material was available via iTunes. The packet didn't hold exclusives but did come in a DRM free high quality download version. A special download-only remix of subHuman track \\"Killing Ground\\" by The Slips was released on 1 October 2007 on The Slips' MySpace page. Rumours surfaced that Alan Wilder was to start work on a new album pretty soon. Late 2007, IGN, a unit of Fox Interactive Media, Inc., selected Recoil's subHuman album as \\"Best Electronic Album\\" for the year 2007. In February 2008, Alan Wilder announced, due to popular demand, a limited edition CD release of the double sided Recoil single \\"Prey\\"/\\"Allelujah\\" out on 25 February 2008. The CD was issued, with the support of Mute, through the Russian label Gala Records in conjunction with depeche-mode.ru and is exclusively available on-line via their website. Also in February, the ex- Depeche Mode member released an open letter on the Side-Line Magazine website, titled \\"Music for the Masses ‚Äì I think not\\". In the article Wilder handles his vision on today's shifting music market and the position of the artist in this. In the small essay Wilder touches the volume war, the effect of excessive compression, the download spiral, alternative ways to release music, the birth of the fan powered release of the limited enhanced single \\"Prey\\"/\\"Allelujah\\" in Russia, Mute Records, Depeche Mode, and much more. December saw a brand new free bonus mix of \\"Prey\\" (taken from the subHuman album) released as a Xmas download on 8 December. The mix was approved by Alan Wilder and re-mixed by David Husser. Selected... 2010‚Äì2014 In January 2010, Alan Wilder announced a new compilation (Selected) and tour (\\"Selected Events 2010\\") on his official Recoil website. With tracks selected by Wilder himself, Selected is a collection of Recoil tracks culled from prior albums. A special bonus disc includes exclusive remixes and alternative versions. \\"Selected Events\\" took Alan Wilder through Europe and North America, spanning from March through May 2010. These shows represented the first live performances ever undertaken by Wilder with the Recoil project. The next part of the tour kicked off with dates across North America, South America and ended in Europe between October & December 2010. On 17 February 2010, Alan Wilder reunited briefly with former band Depeche Mode live on-stage at the Royal Albert Hall for one song, accompanying Martin Gore for a rendition of the Depeche Mode standard, \\"Somebody\\". This was the first time in nearly 16 years that Wilder performed with Depeche Mode, and roughly 15 years since he left the band. The band was playing a charity show, benefiting the Teenage Cancer Trust. According to Wilder, \\"Dave contacted me a few weeks back and asked if I'd be willing to join them on-stage. He assured me that everyone in the band was into the idea. I was very happy to accept, especially as it was all in a good cause and we were long overdue some kind of reunion of this sort. It was great to see everyone again and catch up a bit, and it was also the first time I have actually 'seen' Depeche Mode perform!\\" \\"Selected Events\\" continued in 2011, featuring shows in three Baltic countries and appearances at festivals until the end of October. Also in 2011, Alan Wilder organised with Omega an auction selling a lot of DM collectable items on 3 September in Manchester. A DVD called Collected+ was released as promotion for this event. The Blu-ray only live disc A Strange Hour in Budapest was released in 2012, from the Selected Events from Recoil's tour.

In concept, although not in actual design, it was an extended version of the Fend Flitzer invalid carriage. Approximately 15,000 were built before it was replaced by the Messerschmitt KR200 in 1956.Microcar Museum: 1954 Messerschmitt KR175 History Messerschmitt, temporarily not allowed to manufacture aircraft, had turned its resources to producing other products. In 1952, Fend approached Messerschmitt with the idea of manufacturing small motor vehicles.Wagner, p.163 These were based on his Fend Flitzer invalid carriage.Wagner, p.165 The first of Fend's vehicles to enter production at Messerschmitt's Regensburg factory was the KR175. The title Kabinenroller means \\"scooter with cabin\\".Wagner p.162 While the Messerschmitt name and insignia were used on the car, a separate company, incorporated as Regensburger Stahl- und Metallbau GmbH, was created to manufacture and market the vehicle. There were several problems with the first KR175s to be built, resulting in 70 design modifications between the beginning of production in February and June 1953. The KR200 was developed from the KR175 and replaced it in 1955. Features 1954 Messerschmitt K175 Being based on the Kabinenroller platform, the KR175 had tandem seating accessed by a hatch that opened upward and to the right. The standard version of the KR175's hatch had a canopy made from a large Plexiglas dome with a cutout at the front for a small, flat glass windshield and a cutout on either side for the frames for the sliding windows. A \\"sportster\\" model was available without the dome or the windows, with only the windshield attached. The windshield wiper was manually operated. The front fenders did not have wheel cutouts. =Engine and transmission= The KR175 ran on a Fichtel & Sachs air-cooled single cylinder two-stroke engine positioned in front of the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine was started with a pull rope as standard, but there was an option of an electric starter. The electric starter became standard in 1954. The transmission was a sequential, positive-stop type with four speeds and no synchronization nor reverse gear. =Controls= Mivalino controls, similar to those of the KR175 The KR175 used the standard Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, on the right side of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly. In 1954, the clutch lever was replaced by a pedal. MI-VAL Mivalino MI-VAL Mivalino Italian motorcycle manufacturer Metalmeccanica Italiana Valtrompia s.p.a., makers of the brand , assembled KR175s in Brescia, Italy, using components imported from Messerschmitt but with their own two- stroke engine installed. These cars were sold as the MI-VAL Mivalino.

He is best known for his defeat at the hands of the Athenian Dioxippus, practitioner of pankration. During a banquet thrown by the Macedonian emperor, Coragus challenged Dioxippus to single combat, which he accepted. Coragus attended the duel in full body armor and weaponry, including javelins, a spear, and a sword, while Dioxippus appeared with a simple club. After having his javelin dodged and his spear shattered by Dioxippus, Coragus approached the warrior to engage him with his sword, but before he could draw his blade Dioxippus utilized his pankration techniques to topple the Macedonian warrior. With Dioxippus' foot on his neck, Coragus was spared and released, and Dioxippus was declared the winner of the duel, much to the chagrin of the Macedonians (and the joy of the Athenians in attendance.)

After leaving Blanco y Negro, the Reid brothers signed to Sub Pop in the U.S. and Creation, who had released their debut single \\"Upside Down\\" in 1984, in the UK. The origin of the album title, according to Ben Lurie in an interview with Spin magazine, was that they \\"wanted an un-Mary Chain-like title...It doesn't mean anything. It's just a word. Misspelled on purpose.\\" In an interview with The Herald, Jim said that their sister Linda suggested it. This was the band's final studio album before their 8-year breakup from October 1999 to June 2007. The album features an appearance from Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star, who had previously duetted with the band on the single \\"Sometimes Always\\", and includes the singles \\"I Hate Rock 'n' Roll\\" (released in 1995), \\"Cracking Up\\" and \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll.\\" The album is often thought of as sounding \\"divided\\" due to the Reids' crumbling relationship, as Jim Reid recalled: \\"Me and William weren't really getting along at all. That last year we barely even spoke. Munki is one of my favorite albums, but it was really divided. William would go into the studio with the rest of the band and record while I wasn't there, and then I'd go in with them when William wasn't there.\\" According to an interview in Alternative Press magazine, Jim said that \\"I Hate Rock 'n' Roll\\" was written by his brother \\"out of sheer frustration with the kind of crap we have to deal with in the music business.\\" To counterbalance these sentiments, Jim wrote \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" because \\"I thought it left [Munki] kind of negative - I felt it was only half the story.\\" In the same issue of Alt Press, Munki was rated a perfect 5 out 5. Most other reviews, like those from Allmusic and Rolling Stone linked on this page, were less enthusiastic. Munki peaked at No. 47 in the UK album charts, the band's first studio album not to make the Top 40.

Biography Born to a slave-holding family in Kentucky in 1841, Shaler studied at Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School under Louis Agassiz.Cooper, Lane (1917). \\"How Agassiz Taught Professor Shaler,\\" in Louis Agassiz as a Teacher. New York: The Comstock Publishing Co., pp. 14-26. After graduating in 1862, Shaler went on to become a Harvard fixture in his own right, as lecturer (1868), professor of paleontology for two decades (1869‚Äì1888) and as professor of geology for nearly two more (1888‚Äì1906). Beginning in 1891, he was dean of the Lawrence School. Shaler was appointed director of the Kentucky Geological Survey in 1873, and devoted a part of each year until 1880 to that work.Zabilka, Ivan L. (1980). \\"Nathaniel Southgate Shaler and the Kentucky Geological Survey,\\" The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, Vol. 80, No. 4, pp. 408-431. In 1884 he was appointed geologist to the U.S. Geological Survey in charge of the Atlantic division. He was commissioner of agriculture for Massachusetts at different times, and was president of the Geological Society of America in 1895. He also served two years as a Union officer in the American Civil War.  Research: ecology, geology, and scientific racism  Early in his professional career Shaler was broadly a creationist and anti- Darwinist. This was largely out of deference to the brilliant but old- fashioned Agassiz, whose patronage served Shaler well in ascending the Harvard ladder. When his own position at Harvard was secure, Shaler gradually accepted Darwinism in principle but viewed it through a neo-Lamarckian lens. Shaler extended Charles Darwin's work of the importance of earthworm soil bioturbation to soil formation to other animals, such as ants.Shaler, N. S. (1891). The Origin and Nature of Soils, in Powell, J. W., ed., USGS 12th Annual report 1890-1891: Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, pp. 213-45. Like many other evolutionists of the time, Shaler incorporated basic tenets of natural selection‚Äîchance, contingency, opportunism‚Äîinto a picture of order, purpose and progress in which characteristics were inherited through the efforts of individual organisms. Shaler was an apologist for slavery and an outspoken believer in the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race. In his later career, Shaler continued to support Agassiz's polygenism, a theory of human origins that was often used to support racial discrimination, falling under the category of Scientific racism.Livingstone, David N. (1987). Nathaniel Southgate Shaler and the Culture of American Science. University of Alabama Press, pp. 124-125. In his 1884 article, \\"The Negro Problem\\", published in the Atlantic Monthly, Shaler claimed that black people freed from slavery were \\"like children lost in the wood, needing the old protection of the strong mastering hand,\\" that they became increasingly dominated by their \\"animal nature\\" as they grew from children into adults, and American slavery had been \\"infinitely the mildest and most decent system of slavery that ever existed.\\"Shaler, N.S. (1884). \\"The Negro Problem,\\" Atlantic Monthly, p. 697-698. Shaler published work describing the physical geography of different continents and linking these geologic settings to the intelligence and strength of human races that inhabited these spaces. In Nature and Man in America, Shaler justifies the superiority of the Aryan race based on their development within European topography, \\"marvelously suited to be the cradles of people\\", erroneously attributing their origin to the Scandinavian provinces, \\"a field which seems to have been the seat of the strongest men in the world for thousands of years.\\" Expanding upon this logic, Shaler explains that a Scandinavian origin is most fitting because it would seem strange that the \\"most vigorous and at the same time the most plastic of the world-peoples should have developed among the limited opportunities afforded by high Asia.\\" Similarly, Shaler disparages the topography of the Americas, Africa, and Australia, claiming that these continents \\"have shown by their human products that they are unfitted to be the cradle places of great peoples.\\" Nevertheless, Shaler is particularly interested in North America. Although he explains that its \\"large, simple, and easily comprehensible geographic features\\" as well as unfavorable climate for agriculture render the continent \\"unfit to cradle great peoples\\", he argues that the topography is perfectly suited for a race with better characteristics. Thus, Shaler argues that North America has \\"peculiar advantages‚Äù for American people (of Aryan descent) because the climate and topography of the land is ideal for the institution of slavery, which made it possible to cultivate this \\"new and rude land\\". As previously alluded, Shaler believed that slavery was greatly beneficial for the United States, and even went so far as to suggest that slaves themselves benefitted from this institution, suggesting slavery \\"led to the rapid accumulation of wealth, and in this way brought the people the sooner into a condition in which they could control their own destiny.\\" Expressing concern that the South will \\"release into barbarism\\", Shaler proposes that \\"the advance of the negro to a satisfactory grade in development still depends upon his remaining in close contact with the superior race.\\"  Legacy at Harvard University  In his later career, Shaler served as Harvard's Dean of Sciences and was considered one of the university's most popular teachers.Bacon, H. Philip (1955). \\"Fireworks in the Classroom: Nathaniel Southgate Shaler as a Teacher,\\" Journal of Geography 54, p. 350. He published scores of long and short treatises in his lifetime, with subjects ranging from topographical surveys to moral philosophy. Shaler mentored many students, including William Morris Davis, who worked for him as a field assistant, and was later hired by Shaler to teach at Harvard. William Morris Davis became a renowned geographer, and similar to Shaler, wrote about how different geographies produced more or less fit societies. When Shaler passed, a fund was set up by alumni in his honor, which was specified to be used for field experiences, and these funds are still in use for student field trips today.

She was the fifth of Fred and Evelyn Coachman's ten children. Coachman was unable to access athletic training facilities or participate in organized sports because of the color of her skin. Added to the list of training barriers was her status as a female athlete during a time of widespread opposition to women in sports. She trained using what was available to her, running shoeless along the dirt roads near her home and using homemade equipment to practice her jumping. Coachman attended Monroe Street Elementary School where she was encouraged by her fifth-grade teacher Cora Bailey and by her aunt, Carrie Spry, despite the reservations of her parents. Upon enrolling at Madison High School in 1938, she joined the track team, working with Harry E. Lash to develop her skill as an athlete. Within a year she drew the attention of the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. In 1939 she joined the Tuskegee Preparatory School at the age of 16 after being offered a scholarship. The scholarship required her to work while studying and training, which included cleaning and maintaining sports facilities as well as mending uniforms. Coachman went on to graduate with a degree in dressmaking from the Tuskegee Institute in 1946. The following year she continued her studies at Albany State College, receiving a B.S. in Home Economics with a minor in science in 1949. She became a teacher and track-and-field instructor. =Athletic career= Prior to arriving at the Tuskegee Preparatory School, Coachman competed in the Amateur Athletic Union's (AAU) Women's National Championships breaking the college and National high jump records while competing barefoot. Her unusual jumping style was a combination of straight jumping and western roll techniques. Coachman dominated the AAU outdoor high jump championship from 1939 through 1948, winning ten national championships in a row. In addition to her high jump accomplishments, she won national championships in the 50-meter dash, the 100-meter dash and with the 400-meter relay team as a student at the Tuskegee Institute. During the same period, Coachman won three conference championships playing as a guard on the Tuskegee women's basketball team. Despite being in her prime, Coachman was unable to compete in the 1940 and 1944 Olympic Games as they were canceled because of World War II. In the opinion of sportswriter Eric Williams, \\"Had she competed in those canceled Olympics, we would probably be talking about her as the No. 1 female athlete of all time.\\" Coachman's first opportunity to compete on a global stage was during the 1948 Olympic Games in London. She qualified for the US Olympic team with a high jump of 5 feet 4 inches breaking the previous 16-year-old record by ¬æ of an inch. In the high jump finals of the 1948 Summer Olympics, Coachman leaped 1.68 m (5 ft 6‚Öõ in) on her first try. Her nearest rival, Great Britain's Dorothy Tyler, matched Coachman's jump, but only on her second try. Coachman was the only American woman to win an Olympic gold medal in athletics in 1948. Her medal was presented by King George VI. Upon her return to the United States after the Olympics, Coachman had become a celebrity. Soon after meeting President Harry Truman and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, she was honored with parades from Atlanta to Albany and was thrown a party by Count Basie. In 1952 she became the first African-American woman to endorse an international product when she was signed as a spokesperson by the Coca-Cola Company who featured her prominently on billboards alongside 1936 Olympic winner Jesse Owens. In her hometown, Alice Avenue, and Coachman Elementary School were named in her honor. =Later life= Coachman's athletic career ended when she was 24. She dedicated the rest of her life to education and to the Job Corps. Coachman died in Albany, Georgia on July 14, 2014, of cardiac arrest after suffering through respiratory problems. She had a stroke a few months prior for which she received treatment from a nursing home. She had two children during her first marriage to N. F. Davis, which ended in divorce. Her second husband, Frank Davis, preceded her in death. =Legacy= Alice Coachman Elementary School In 1979 Coachman was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. During the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Coachman was honored as one of the 100 greatest Olympians. She was an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, inducted in 1998https://aka- web.s3.amazonaws.com/files/Coachman_Davis_Obituary.pdf In 2002, she was designated a Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project. Coachman was also inducted to the USA Track and Field Hall of fame in 1975 and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2004. Coachman has received recognition for opening the door for future African-American track stars such as Evelyn Ashford, Florence Griffith Joyner, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. In fact, in the years since her display of Olympic prowess, black women have made up a majority of the US women's Olympic track and field team. \\"I think I opened the gate for all of them,\\" she reflected. \\"Whether they think that or not, they should be grateful to someone in the black race who was able to do these things.\\" References  Further reading  * \\"Alice Coachman, 1st Black Woman Gold Medalist, To Be Honored.\\" Jet (July 29, 1996): 53. * Cummings, D.

His feast day in the Aberdeen Breviary is 17 October. Biography Tower of St. Rule's Church at St Andrews The details of Saint Regulus' life are unclear and differ in the several extant accounts. Saint Regulus was a monk or bishop of the city of Patras, in present-day Greece, then part of the Roman Empire. In AD 345 Regulus was told by an angel in a visionary dream that the Emperor Constantine had decided to remove Saint Andrew's relics from Patras to Constantinople, and in some retellings that Constantine was about to invade Patras. For safekeeping Regulus was to move as many bones as far away as he could to the western ends of the earth, where he should found a church dedicated to St Andrew. He was accompanied on his voyage by a number of consecrated virgins, among these Saint Triduana. According to the various accounts Regulus was either shipwrecked or told by an angel to stop intentionally on the shores of Fife at the spot called Kilrymont, a Pictish settlement which is now St. Andrews. Here he was welcomed by a Pictish king, √ìengus I (who was actually of the eighth century). Regulus is claimed to have brought three fingers of the saint's right hand, the upper bone of an arm, one kneecap, and one of his teeth. Legacy In approximately 1070 Robert I, Prior of St Andrews built St Regulus Church in the town of St Andrews in order to house the relics of St Andrew that Regulus had supposedly brought to the town. It would serve as a landmark for the many pilgrims that would come to the area in the next few centuries. Its main architectural feature is its 33 metre tall tower, and the church itself is now principally known in the town as St Rule's tower. The legend of St Regulus came to have political significance in the later Middle Ages. It served to authenticate the apostle Andrew as patron saint of Scotland. The Regulus legend was publicised by Scottish kings, nobles and churchmen from the 12th century onwards. Scottish independence had come under threat from England since the late 11th century, and the Scottish church was contesting a claim to primacy by the archbishop of York. By promoting the story of Saint Andrew's choice of Scotland in the 4th century, the Scots acquired an important saint, a separate identity from England, and a date for the supposed foundation of the Scottish Church which predated the foundation of the English and Irish churches by several centuries. Furthermore, during the wars of Scottish independence the Scots used the legend to persuade Pope Boniface VIII to issue the papal bull of 1299 which demanded that Edward I of England end the war against Scotland. The legend would also lead to the adoption of the saltire on the Scottish flag and the importance of the archdiocese of St Andrews in the early Scottish Church. St Regulus Hall, the student hall of residence at the University of St Andrews is named after Saint Regulus.

Burns was born in Glasgow, the son of Rev John Burns (1744‚Äì1839), a Presbyterian minister. George was the younger brother of James Burns (1789-1871), with whom he formed a partnership, J. & G. Burns. Together, they started sailing ships between Glasgow and Liverpool, as well as across the Atlantic to Canada and the United States. J. & G. Burns set up the regular steamer service to the Inner and Outer Hebrides. This was sold to David Hutcheson & Co in 1851, and by the mid-1870s, it formed the basis of David MacBrayne Ltd, which today operates as Caledonian MacBrayne across the west coast of Scotland. Burns was party to the consolidation of a number of companies, including the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, into the Cunard Line, which had been begun by Sir Samuel Cunard. The Cunard Line merged with the White Star Line in 1936, and was to launch liners such as the RMS Queen Mary (1936). Today it is a US-owned cruise company, which operated the famous RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2). In addition to his shipping interests, Burns was also one of the largest shareholders in The Glasgow and South-Western Railway Burns retired to Wemyss Bay in Renfrewshire (Inverclyde). He was made a baronet at age 94 in 1889, the oldest ever recipient of the award. A devout Episcopalian, Edwin Hodder wrote a hagiography of Burns, and J.J. Burnet's Inverclyde Church was instituted in the memory of Burns and his wife. John Burns (1829‚Äì1901), his eldest son, succeeded him in the baronetcy, became head of the Cunard Company and was created a peer, under the title of Baron Inverclyde, in 1897.

She had a distinguished career in public relations, served in the Red Cross during World War II, and was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1968 to 1984, representing Louisville's 41st state legislative district. During her tenure in elective office, she was known for her sponsorship of landmark legislation. House Bill No. 27 which became law in 1972 created the Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC) which promotes and finances low-income housing in the state. In 1974, this particular bill was officially designated as the \\"Mae Street Kidd Act.\\" Representative Kidd also led the campaign for Kentucky to ratify the United States Constitution's 13th Amendment (abolishing slavery), 14th Amendment (defining citizenship) and 15th Amendment (granting all men the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude). Known collectively as the \\"Reconstruction Amendments,\\" all three of those constitutional amendments had become law shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War when a sufficient number of lawmakers in other states had ratified them. Representative Kidd offered and secured adoption of a resolution in 1976 to post-ratify the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. Biography Born on February 8, 1904, in Millersburg, Kentucky to Anna Belle Leer (1883‚Äì1984) who worked for a well-to-do white family with a large farm in central Kentucky. Kidd's father, Charles Robert Jones (February 6, 1875 - March 15, 1972), was the son of her mother's employers; and, she was their second child together. Her older brother was George William Jones (July 18, 1901 - July 6, 1986). As a girl she was called Minne Mae Jones. She attended Springfield Institute from 1948 to 1950, University of Louisville, and American University, 1966‚Äì67. Kidd spent her early years in Millersburg, a town in Bourbon County. When she was two, her mother married a tobacco farmer, James W. (Willie) Taylor (1881‚Äì1959), who later became a chicken breeder. Kidd's mother, meanwhile, had a thriving catering business and often served as a local midwife. Kidd knew that her real father had married and began a family of his own, \\"and they and their mother used to come visit my mother, who was very friendly with his white family,\\" she recalled in an oral history interview with Wade Hall. \\"But I never wanted anything to do with them. I was hurt that he couldn't--or wouldn't--acknowledge me openly as his daughter. It was a painful part of my childhood, but I got over it.\\" Millersburg's blacks lived in a section of the town called Shippsville, and Kidd went to school there until the eighth grade. As a youngster, she realized that her light skin made it possible for her to skirt the Jim Crow laws that were a feature of life in the American South at the time: under these acts, blacks were restricted to certain schools, seating areas of public transportation, and even drinking fountains and rest rooms. She recalled that she liked to go into the Millersburg millinery shops and try on hats as a little girl, and pointed out that all in the town knew that she was of mixed heritage. Kidd's mother eventually moved the family to Millersburg proper after asking her cousin, who was white, to purchase the house and have the deed transferred to her. Both Kidd's mother and stepfather worked hard to provide a solid home for the children, which included two more of their own: Kidd's half brother Webster Demetrius Taylor, and a half sister, Mary Evelyn Taylor. As a teenager, Kidd wanted to contribute to the household herself, but her mother refused to let her work for white families, telling her, \\"Mae, I have to serve other people because I don't have a choice. I want you to have a choice when you grow up.\\" Since her school only went up to the eighth grade, it was decided that she would be sent away to the Lincoln Institute in Simpsonville, created to provide a better educational opportunity in the Jim Crow era. She was 15 years old when she left home in 1919, and spent two years there before her family's financial circumstances forced her to return home. Kidd found a part-time job selling insurance as an independent sales agent for the Mammoth Life and Accident Insurance Company, a thriving, black-owned company based in Louisville. At the time, black-owned insurance companies were an important part of the African-American economy and some of the largest black-owned businesses of their era. Like black-owned banks, they served a community that was often discriminated against by mainstream American institutions. From 1921 to 1925 Kidd sold policies for Mammoth and collected premiums; to do so she walked all over the black neighborhoods in both Millersburg and a nearby city. \\"I never had any bad experiences anywhere because everybody knew my parents in Millersburg, and in Carlisle I soon became known and the older people began watching over me,\\" she recalled in an oral history interview, noting that she sometimes collected a hundred dollars in a day. After four years as a salesperson, Kidd was offered a job at the Mammoth headquarters in Louisville as a file clerk. She shared an apartment in the Mammoth building with a friend, a young woman whose father was a board member of the insurance company. Kidd was thrilled to be supporting herself and living in a relatively large city, which was still a relative rarity for a single woman of any color in 1925. Louisville was still part of the South, however, and it did have unspoken boundaries. \\"I couldn't use the main public library,\\" Kidd recalled. \\"I couldn't go to the first-run movie shows on Fourth Street.\\" After a time, Kidd was promoted to assistant bookkeeper, and then moved to the policy-issue office. In 1935 she became supervisor of policy issues, a job she held for eight years which entailed reviewing all applications for insurance that arrived at headquarters. By then Kidd had married Horace Street, a top Mammoth executive thirteen years her senior. Though much had changed in the years since her girlhood in Kentucky, Kidd still trod a fine line because of the color of her skin, even in the 1940s. Her husband refused to let her travel with him when Mammoth business took him to cities farther South, fearing an incident on the train or the refusal to be rented a hotel room, since Kidd was often mistaken for white. Street died of heart disease in 1942. Kidd joined the American Red Cross in 1943 and was sent to England during World War II. There she served as assistant director of a service club for black American soldiers in Southampton. According to Wade Hall in his biography of Kidd, while traveling by train in her Red Cross uniform with her darker-complected brother in his Army uniform during World War II, Kidd was asked to move from the \\"colored\\" section of the train to the \\"white\\" section. Kidd repeatedly refused‚Äîand also refused to explain herself, later saying: \\"I was a grown woman. I was wearing my Red Cross uniform. My brother was a grown man, wearing his Army uniform. We were a brother and sister going to see our parents before we shipped overseas. We were both American citizens serving our country. We didn't owe anybody an explanation.\\" After the end of the war and her Red Cross duties in England, Kidd took a job in Portland, Maine, running its United Seaman's Service Club, a social gathering spot for merchant seamen. Though she was eager to return to Mammoth, she was uninterested in her former job in the policy office, and instead had gained valuable experience in both Maine and England in the relatively new field of public relations. Kidd studied on her own and designed a program for Mammoth. She made her proposal before the board, who voted to accept it, and was given her own office and a secretary. As the public relations counselor from 1946 to 1956, Kidd supervised all company communications and began a number of programs to create goodwill between policyholders and with the communities the company served. Her plan was so successful that she was hired by the National Negro Insurance Association to create a public-relations plan for all of its member companies. In 1948, Kidd also organized the first Louisville Urban League Guild and served as President of the Lincoln Foundation. She married an American army officer, James Kidd‚Äîwhom she met while overseas‚Äîand moved to Detroit, where he lived. For a time, she worked for a door-to-door cosmetics company, Fuller Projects, in both Detroit and Chicago. Kidd trained agents and sold the line herself, and quit after a time to run a campaign for a candidate running for a seat on the Detroit City Council. It was her first exposure to politics, and she drew heavily on her public-relations experience to help make the campaign a successful one. When Kidd did return to Louisville, she was not given her former job as Mammoth's public-relations person. Instead she was forced to return to the ranks of company sales agents. Her boss, she recalled in an interview with Hall, \\"wanted to embarrass me by sending me back to selling ordinary insurance, but I embarrassed him by selling more insurance than anyone in the history of the company.\\" She retired from the company in 1966, at the age of 62. Much had changed since she began with Mammoth in the early 1920s, when it was one of several dozen such insurance companies that served the African-American community. \\"Unfortunately, with integration in the 1950s and 1960s, the white companies began opening up their policies to blacks, and blacks deserted their own companies in droves.... It's sad but true that this desertion by blacks of black insurance companies is just a part of a larger problem in the black community: we just don't have enough confidence in our own people to patronize each other.\\" Public office Two years later, at the dawn of a new civil rights era with federal laws barring racial discrimination in all forms, Kidd was invited by a number of Louisville Democrats to run for a seat in the House of Representatives in Kentucky General Assembly. She declined several times, but her husband thought it would be a good opportunity for her talents. So Kidd agreed, and won her first election after campaigning with a carload of neighborhood children, who helped her pass out flyers nightly in different sections of her Louisville district. \\"Their youth and energy boosted me when I was exhausted,\\" she recalled. \\"They liked riding in my car and meeting people and being part of an important project.\\" Elected that fall, Kidd went to Frankfort and took her seat in Kentucky's General Assembly. She was one of just three African-Americans in the legislature at the time. The first bill she sponsored prohibited racial discrimination in housing. After several of Kentucky's cities passed their own local open-housing legislation in 1966 and 1967, Kidd worked with Senator Georgia Davis Powers and Representative Hughes McGill to introduce the Kentucky Fair Housing Act to the Kentucky General Assembly. Kidd's bill passed in 1968, making Kentucky the first Southern state to enact such laws on its own. In the early 1970s, she sponsored a low-income housing bill that created a state agency to provide low-interest mortgages to first-time home buyers. Kidd struggled for some time to get this bill passed, and only with the election of a new governor in 1972 did she finally succeed in seeing it signed into law. She also sponsored a proposal to make the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. an official state holiday. In her career in Kentucky's General Assembly, Representative Kidd's \\"firsts\\" also included being the first female on the Rules Committee. Re-elected until 1984, when she lost after her district was gerrymandered several times, Kidd made civil rights her focus. In the mid-1970s she learned that Kentucky had voted against the 13th amendment in 1865 and never ratified the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These abolished slavery and gave U.S. citizenship and the vote to African Americans. It was a symbolic oversight, and Kidd was determined to correct it. She launched a campaign in 1976 to have the amendments officially ratified, and it passed unanimously. \\"It was especially important to me because I am a proud Kentuckian, and I didn't want that blot to remain on our history,\\" she wrote in her memoir. Kidd also introduced a bill to make Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday an official state holiday. For a number of years, Kidd was a frequent presence in civil-rights marches and events in her state. She was also known for speaking her mind. Mervin Aubespin, associate editor of Louisville's Courier-Journal, told a reporter for the paper that early in her political career Kidd never hesitated to call the paper over its political coverage, especially when a reporter's article included quotes only from white males. \\"She would call up and say 'I was there and nobody asked me.' She raised holy sin.... She figured that people who voted for her needed to know what her position was on a number of issues that came through the legislature.\\" End of career Kidd was active in a number of charitable organizations throughout her life, including the Lincoln Foundation, which helped disadvantaged children at the facility that had once schooled her. Toward the end of her life, she lost her eyesight. She died in Louisville on October 20, 1999. Her biography, based on nearly 40 oral history interviews by Wade Hall, appeared two years before her death, and its title, Passing for Black, reflected her mixed heritage and the conflicts she often experienced because of it. \\"Most of us, whether white or black, are mixtures of many races and nationalities,\\" she pointed out. \\"We all have tangled roots.\\" She noted that though times had changed considerably, her childhood was particularly difficult. She likened it to \\"living in a no- man's-land where I belonged to neither race. Because I was neither completely white nor completely black, I've been stigmatized and penalized by both races.\\" Awards The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People presented to her its Unsung Heroine Award at a National NAACP Women's Conference, and she received a Louisville Mayor's Citation for Outstanding Community Service. She also received a Top Ten Outstanding Kentuckians Award; and the Humanitarian Service Award from the United Cerebral Palsy Association. See also * Georgia Davis Powers * Bert T.

The game was originally released in April 1989 and published by Codemasters. It was the third title to feature Dizzy. Commodore 64 version In both games, Dizzy's aim in each maze is to gather all of the food (burgers, pizzas, etc.): some of the food also moves around the maze, either evading Dizzy or trying to meet him. Dizzy is pursued by four mushroom-like monsters: Bonzo, Wizza, Pippa, and Fido. Power-ups and breakable walls add to the complexity of the game. The 8-bit versions of the game were released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC and featured mazes of abstract design, whereas the 16-bit versions released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS featured entirely different environments that were identifiable as real-world locations such as gardens, harbours, graveyards and more. Development The game was playable within three days of work; the developers only took two more weeks to finalize the graphics, interface and music. The game was originally to be a marketing tool for the Happy Eater chain of restaurants, but this idea was dropped during development and Dizzy was added to the game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME0wVsGExSM Legacy A shortened, altered version of the game, entitled Easter Eggstravaganza Dizzy, was made available on Amiga Action and ST Action coverdiscs in May 1993.http://amr.abime.net/issue_117_pages Completion of this game would give players a code which would allow them to enter a competition in the magazine.

It was printed in broadsheet format for 87 years, though it is now of compact (tabloid) size. Its strapline is: \\"At the heart of island life\\". History =1890 to 1945= The Evening Post was founded in 1890 by H.P. Butterworth, with the very first issue published 30 June 1890. It was acquired only a few weeks after its launch by Walter Guiton, whose business printed it. The Post was produced sheet by sheet on a flatbed press until 1926, when Guiton oversaw the introduction and operation of the first rotary press. Guiton remained the main proprietor and editor until the following year, when his son-in-law Arthur Harrison took over. The latter stayed in both positions until he was succeeded in 1944 by his son, Arthur G. Harrison. Under the Harrisons, the newspaper, while undergoing little technical change, saw testing times as the island came under German military occupation from 1940 to 1945. Although it was still published during these years, the Post was strictly supervised and censored by the occupying forces. =1945 to 1972= After the island's liberation in 1945, the newspaper grew and in 1957 became the main asset of a newly formed business entity called W E Guiton and Co Ltd. Following the closure of the Morning News in 1949, the Evening Post has been without a regular English-language competitor, and the closure of the French-language newspaper Les Chroniques de Jersey at the end of 1959 left the Evening Post as the only newspaper of record in Jersey to publish the Jersey Gazette of official notices and promulgation of laws. In 1967, the newspaper's name was changed from Evening Post to Jersey Evening Post. =1973 to 2003= Control of the paper passed in 1973 to Frank Walker, who would later become Jersey's first Chief Minister. The Guiton Group expanded outwards from newspaper production in the late 1970s into IT, through its subsidiary company Itex. In 1998 it purchased the Guernsey Evening Press and Star. =2004 to present= Subsequently, the Guiton Group was purchased in 2004 by the Claverley Group, publishers of the Express and Star. On Christmas Eve 2008, the paper published a satirical cartoon which led to accusations of defamation by two local politicians and anti child-abuse campaigners, Trevor Pitman and Shona Pitman. The resulting libel action case was dismissed in court, in April 2012. Until the newspaper moved to Saint Saviour in 1977, it was based in Saint Helier. The distinctive fa√ßade of the former offices at the corner of Charles Street and Bath Street pictured here is still recalled in the Under the Clock column of miscellany. =2015= On June 30, 2015 the Jersey Evening Post celebrated its 125th birthday. In January the JEP donated its photographic archive of 1.5 million images to the Island. The archive ‚Äì a collection of glass plates, negatives and prints which record the richness and variety of Island life since the paper was founded in 1890 ‚Äì has been conserved and digitised by Jersey Heritage so that they can be accessed and enjoyed by Islanders for ever. In March 2015 the JEP launched their 125th anniversary exhibition at the Jersey Museum entitled \\"Your Story, Our History: 125 Years Through a Jersey Evening Post Lens\\". It included more than 1,500,000 images and tells the Island‚Äôs story through both world wars and beyond. In August 2015, JEP staff teamed up with the parish of St Saviour to work on their Battle of Flowers float. Celebrating the newspaper‚Äôs special anniversary, Hot Off The Press, featured a printing press complete with moving cogs and rolls of paper, as well as a birthday cake and a huge newspaper. It also launched the inaugural Pride of Jersey awards. The awards are split into 12 categories, each one of them celebrating the very essence of Jersey life. The winners were announced at a ceremony on 23 September 2015 at Aviation Beauport. Features =J√®rriais= From 14 March 1982George d'la Forge: Guardian of the Jersey Norman Heritage - A Study of the Life and Writings of George Francis Le Feuvre (1891‚Äì1984), Annette Torode, 2003 Jersey, until 2007 the J√®rriais articles were accompanied by a parallel translation in English. The J√®rriais - Jersey's native language column hosts articles written in Jersey's dialect of Norman, J√®rriais, accompanied by a pr√©cis and vocabulary in English. In 1911 Philippe Le Sueur Mourant (1848‚Äì1918) launched a new series of stories in the Morning News relating the adventures and opinions of Piteur Pain, supposedly a former country blacksmith turned foreman of the printing shop, and his family. This series of stories moved to the Evening Post between 1915 and 1916. Following the closure of Les Chroniques de Jersey, the Ph'lip et Merrienne articles started appearing in the Evening Post from 2 January 1960. Written by Edward Le Brocq (1877‚Äì1964), who had worked for the Evening Post before becoming editor of the Morning News, they took the form of a letter to the editor supposedly written by an old farming couple from St. Ouen commenting on personalities, events and elections laced with humorous observations on Jersey history and traditions. Following the death of Edward Le Brocq, George Francis Le Feuvre (1891‚Äì1984) contributed a Lettre du Bouonhomme George under the pen name George d'la Forge. Since he had emigrated to North America after the First World War and subsequently taken United States citizenship, most of the letters had either an international flavour, commenting on life and politics in America, or nostalgia for the Jersey of Le Feuvre's boyhood. Following the death of George d'la Forge, Sir Arthur de la Mare (1914‚Äì1994), a retired ambassador, took over the task of contributing regular columns to the newspaper. Written in the Trinity dialect, as distinct from the St. Ouen dialect used by George d'la Forge, Sir Arthur's articles included reminiscences of his life as a diplomat, especially in the Far East, as well as comments on events and politics in Jersey. Since Sir Arthur's death, a roster of contributors have maintained the tradition of the weekly (or fortnightly) newspaper column. Currently the writer of this feature is Geraint Jennings. Price The news-stand price is 75 pence.

It was created and made formidable by King Philip II of Macedon; previously the army of Macedon had been of little account in the politics of the Greek world, and Macedonia had been regarded as a second-rate power. The latest innovations in weapons and tactics were adopted and refined by Philip II, and he created a uniquely flexible and effective army. By introducing military service as a full-time occupation, Philip was able to drill his men regularly, ensuring unity and cohesion in his ranks. In a remarkably short time, this led to the creation of one of the finest military machines of the ancient world. Tactical improvements included the latest developments in the deployment of the traditional Greek phalanx made by men such as Epaminondas of Thebes and Iphicrates of Athens. Philip II improved on these military innovators by using both Epaminondas' deeper phalanx and Iphicrates' combination of a longer spear and smaller and lighter shield. However, the Macedonian king also innovated; he introduced the use of a much longer spear, the two-handed pike. The Macedonian pike, the sarissa, gave its wielder many advantages both offensively and defensively. For the first time in Greek warfare, cavalry became a decisive arm in battle. The Macedonian army perfected the co-ordination of different troop types, an early example of combined arms tactics ‚Äî the heavy infantry phalanx, skirmish infantry, archers, light cavalry and heavy cavalry, and siege engines were all deployed in battle; each troop type being used to its own particular advantage and creating a synergy of mutual support. The new Macedonian army was an amalgamation of different forces. Macedonians and other Greeks (especially Thessalian cavalry) and a wide range of mercenaries from across the Aegean and Balkans were employed by Phillip. By 338 BC, more than a half of the army for his planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia came from outside the borders of Macedon ‚Äî from all over the Greek world and the nearby barbarian tribes, such as the Illyrians, Paeonians, and Thracians. After Philip's death, his successor, Alexander the Great, used the army to conquer the Achaemenid Empire. Unfortunately, most of the primary historical sources for this period have been lost. As a consequence, scholarship is largely reliant on the works of Diodorus Siculus and Arrian, plus the incomplete writings of Curtius, all of whom lived centuries later than the events they describe.Connolly, pp. 64-70. Origins Philip II of Macedon - Roman medallion depicting the Macedonian king. If Philip II of Macedon had not been the father of Alexander the Great, he would be more widely known as a first-rate military innovator, tactician and strategist, and as a consummate politician. The conquests of Alexander would have been impossible without the army his father created. Considered semi-barbarous by some metropolitan Greeks, the Macedonians were a martial people; they drank deeply of unwatered wine (the very mark of a barbarian) and no youth was considered to be fit to sit with the men at table until he had killed, on foot with a spear, a wild boar.Bury, p. 684. When Philip took over control of Macedon, it was a backward state on the fringes of the Greek world and was beset by its traditional enemies: Illyrians, Paeonians and Thracians. The basic structure of the army inherited by Philip II was the division of the companion cavalry (hetairoi) from the foot companions (pezhetairoi), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries.; The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon, while Macedonian troops are accounted for in the history of Herodotus as subjects of the Persian Empire fighting the Greeks at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. Macedonian cavalry, wearing muscled cuirasses, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War (431‚Äì404 BC), at times siding with either Athens or Sparta and supplemented by local Greek infantry instead of relying on Macedonian infantry.; see also for further details. Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen eager to win glory. An early 4th-century BC stone-carved relief from Pella shows a Macedonian hoplite infantryman wearing a pilos helmet and wielding a short sword showing a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before Philip II. Nicholas Sekunda states that at the beginning of Philip II's reign in 359 BC, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, the latter figure similar to that recorded for the 5th century BC. However, Malcolm Errington cautions that any figures for Macedonian troop sizes provided by ancient authors should be treated with a degree of skepticism, since there are very few means by which modern historians are capable of confirming their veracity (and could have been possibly lower or even higher than the numbers stated). The Alexander Mosaic showing the Battle of Issus; a Roman copy of a Hellenistic painting, c. 100 BC Philip's first achievement was to unify Macedon through his army. He raised troops and made his army the single fount of wealth, honour and power in the land; the unruly chieftains of Macedonia became the officers and elite cavalrymen of the army, the highland peasants became the footsoldiers. Philip took pains to keep them always under arms and either fighting or drilling. Manoeuvres and drills were made into competitive events, and the truculent Macedonians vied with each other to excel.Lendon, p. 129. As a political counterbalance to the native-born Macedonian nobility, Philip invited military families from throughout Greece to settle on lands he had conquered or confiscated from his enemies, these 'personal clients' then also served as army officers or in the Companion cavalry. After taking control of the gold- rich mines of Mount Pangaeus, and the city of Amphipolis that dominated the region, he obtained the wealth to support a large army. It was a professional army imbued with a national spirit, an unusual combination for the Greek world of the time. The armies of contemporary Greek states were largely reliant on a combination of citizens and mercenaries. The former were not full-time soldiers, and the latter, though professional, had little or no inherent loyalty to their employers. By the time of his death, Philip's army had pushed the Macedonian frontier into southern Illyria, conquered the Paeonians and Thracians, asserted a hegemony over Thessaly, destroyed the power of Phocis and defeated and humbled Athens and Thebes. All the states of Greece, with the exception of Sparta, Epirus and Crete, had become subservient allies of Macedon (League of Corinth) and Philip was laying the foundations of an invasion of the Persian Empire, an invasion that his son would successfully undertake.Bury, pp. 685-687. One important military innovation of Philip II is often overlooked, he banned the use of wheeled transport and limited the number of camp servants to one to every ten infantrymen and one each for the cavalry. This reform made the baggage train of the army very small for its size and improved its speed of march.Connolly, pp. 68-69. Troop types and unit organisation =Heavy cavalry= The Companion cavalry Coin of Perdikkas II showing a Macedonian cavalryman armed with two long javelins Alexander the Great as a cavalryman. He wears a helmet in the form of the lion-scalp of Herakles. Detail of the so-called Alexander Sarcophagus, excavated at Sidon. Macedonian cavalryman (wearing a Thracian helmet and wielding a xyston lance) riding down a Persian footsoldier, fresco in the Kinch Tomb, 310-290 BC, Lefkadia The Companion cavalry, or Hetairoi (), were the elite arm of the Macedonian army, and have been regarded as the finest quality cavalry in the ancient world. Along with Thessalian cavalry contingents, the Companions ‚Äî raised from landed nobility ‚Äî made up the bulk of the Macedonian heavy cavalry. Central Macedonia was good horse-rearing country and cavalry was prominent in Macedonian armies from early times. However, it was the reforms in organisation, drill and tactics introduced by Philip II that transformed the Companion cavalry into a battle-winning force, especially the introduction of, or increased emphasis on, the use of a lance and shock tactics. Coinage indicates that from an early period the primary weapons used by Macedonian cavalry were a pair of javelins. This remained true through to the reign of Archelaus I (413-399). Subsequently, despite the adoption of the lance, it is highly probable that the Companion cavalry continued to employ javelins when on scouting or skirmishing missions.Markle, pp.104-105 The hetairoi were divided into squadrons called ilai (singular: ilƒì), each 200 men strong, except for the Royal Squadron, which numbered 300. The Royal Squadron was also known as the Agema - \\"that which leads\\". Each squadron was commanded by an ilarchƒìs (ilarch) and appears to have been raised from a particular area of Macedon. Arrian, for instance, described squadrons from Bottiaea, Amphipolis, Apollonia and Anthemus.Arrian I.2,, I.12,, II.9 It is probable that Alexander took eight squadrons with him on his invasion of Asia totalling 1,800 men, leaving seven ilai behind in Macedon (the 1,500 cavalrymen mentioned by Diodorus).Connolly, p. 71. Between 330 BC and 328 BC, the Companions were reformed into regiments (hipparchies) of 2-3 squadrons. In conjunction with this, each squadron was divided into two lochoi. This was probably undertaken to allow for the increase in size of each squadron, as reinforcements and amalgamations meant that the Companion cavalry grew in size. At this time, Alexander abandoned the regional organisation of the ilai, choosing their officers regardless of their origins.Ashley, pp. 30-31. The individual Companion cavalry squadrons were usually deployed in a wedge formation, which facilitated both manoeuvrability and the shock of the charge. The advantage of the wedge was that it offered a narrow point for piercing enemy formations and concentrated the leaders at the front. It was easier to turn than a square formation because everyone followed the leader at the apex, \\"like a flight of cranes\\". Philip II introduced the formation, probably in emulation of Thracian and Scythian cavalry, though the example of the rhomboid formation adopted by Macedon's southern neighbours, the Thessalians, must also have had some effect.Lendon, p. 98. The primary weapon of the Macedonian cavalry was the xyston, a double ended cornel-wood lance, with a sword as a secondary weapon. From descriptions of combat, it would appear that once in melee the Companion cavalryman used his lance to thrust at the chests and faces of the enemy. It is possible that the lance was aimed at the upper body of an opposing cavalryman in the expectation that a blow which did not wound or kill might have sufficient leverage to unseat. If the lance broke, the Companion could reverse it and use the other end, or draw his sword. Cleitus, an officer of the Companions, saved Alexander the Great's life at the Granicus by cutting off an enemy horseman's arm with his sword.Gaebel, pp. 162-164. Companion cavalrymen would normally have worn armour and a helmet in battle.Sidnell, p. 84 Although the Companion cavalry is largely regarded as the first real shock cavalry of Antiquity, it seems that Alexander was very wary of using it against well-formed infantry, as attested by Arrian in his account of the battle against the Malli, an Indian tribe he faced after Hydaspes. There, Alexander did not dare assault the dense infantry formation with his cavalry, but rather waited for his infantry to arrive, while he and his cavalry harassed their flanks.Arrian, Book 6 Ch. 8 It is a common mistake to portray the Companion cavalry as a force able to burst through compact infantry lines. Alexander usually launched the Companions at the enemy after a gap had opened up between their units or disorder had already disrupted their ranks. However, the ancient historian Arrian implies that the Companion cavalry were successful in an assault, along with heavy infantry, on the Greek mercenary hoplites serving Persia in the closing stages of the Battle of Granicus. Their success may have been largely due to the poor morale of the hoplites, who had just witnessed the rest of their army broken and put to flight.Sidnell, pp. 96-98 The original 1,800 Companions who accompanied Alexander to Asia were augmented by 300 reinforcements arriving from Macedon after the first year of campaigning. They were usually arrayed on the right flank (this being the position of honour in Hellenic armies, where the best troops would be positioned), and typically carried out the decisive manoeuvre/assault of the battle under Alexander's direct leadership.Connolly, p. 73. Thessalian cavalry A heavy cavalryman of Alexander the Great's army, possibly a Thessalian. He wears a cuirass (probably a linothorax) and a Boeotian helmet, and is equipped with a scabbarded xiphos straight-bladed sword. Alexander Sarcophagus. Following the defeat of Lycophron of Pherae and Onomarchos of Phocis, Philip II of Macedon was appointed Archon of the Thessalian League; his death induced the Thessalians to attempt to throw off Macedonian hegemony, but a short bloodless campaign by Alexander restored them to allegiance. The Thessalians were considered the finest cavalry of Greece.Ashley. p. 31. The Thessalian heavy cavalry accompanied Alexander during the first half of his Asian campaign and continued to be employed by the Macedonians as allies until Macedon's final demise at the hands of the Romans. Its organization and weaponry were similar to the Companion Cavalry, though the earlier Thessalian way of fighting emphasised the use of javelins.English, p. 62 The Thessalian cavalry was famed for its use of rhomboid formations, said to have been developed by the Thessalian Tagos (head of the Thessalian League) Jason of Pherae. This formation was very efficient for manoeuvring, as it allowed the squadron to change direction at speed while still retaining cohesion.Lendon, pp. 98-101. The numbers given for Alexander's invasion of the Persian Empire included 1,800 such men. This number would have risen no higher than 2,000. They were typically entrusted with the defensive role of guarding the left flank from enemy cavalry, allowing the decisive attack to be launched on the right. They often faced tremendous opposition when in this role. At Issus and Gaugamela, the Thessalians withstood the attack of Persian cavalry forces, though greatly outnumbered.Ashley. p. 32. At Ecbatana, the Thessalians with Alexander's army were disbanded and sent home. Some remained with the army as mercenaries, yet these too were sent home a year later when the army reached the Oxus River. Other Greek cavalry The Hellenic states allied to, or more accurately under the hegemony of, Macedon provided contingents of heavy cavalry and the Macedonian kings hired mercenaries of the same origins. Alexander had 600 Greek cavalrymen at the start of his campaign against Persia, probably organised into 5 ilai. These cavalrymen would have been equipped very similarly to the Thessalians and Companions, but they deployed in a square formation eight deep and sixteen abreast. The Greek cavalry was not considered as effective or versatile as the Thessalian and Macedonian cavalry.Ashley, 33-35 =Light cavalry= Light cavalry, such as the prodromoi (literal trans. \\"those who run ahead\\"), secured the wings of the army during battle and went on reconnaissance missions. There is some ambiguity concerning the use of the term prodromoi by the sources; it may have been used to describe any cavalry undertaking a scouting, skirmishing or screening mission, or it may have denoted a single unit, or indeed both.Gaebel, p. 178 Apart from the prodromoi (in the sense of a single unit), other horsemen from subject or allied nations, filling various tactical roles and wielding a variety weapons, rounded out the cavalry. By the time Alexander campaigned in India, and subsequently, the cavalry had been drastically reformed and included thousands of horse-archers from Iranian peoples such as the Dahae (prominent at the Battle of Hydaspes). Prodromoi/Sarissophoroi (cavalry unit) Scholarship is divided as to the ethnic composition of the prodromoi of the Macedonian army. Most authorities regard the prodromoi as being raised from Macedonians, which would parallel the Athenian prodromoi, who were raised from the Thetes, the lowest census class of Athenian citizens. Sekunda, however, gives them an origin from Thrace. Arrian usually differentiates the prodromoi from the Paeonian light cavalry, which suggests a fixed ethnic composition. This uncertainty is probably due to the lack of a definite understanding of the use of the term prodromoi by the primary sources, referred to above. The prodromoi, are sometimes referred to as sarissophoroi, \\"pikemen\\" or \\"lancers\\", which leads to the conclusion that they sometimes were armed with an uncommonly long xyston (believed to be 14 ft long), though certainly not an infantry pike. In the primary sources, Arrian mentions that Aretes commanded the prodromoi; in the same context Curtius says that Aretes commanded the sarissophoroi. It would appear that the same unit of cavalry was known by both names.Arrian, trans. Hammond, p. 267 The prodromoi/sarissophoroi acted as scouts, reconnoitering in front of the army when it was on the march. In battle, they were used in a shock role to protect the right flank of the Companion cavalry. Persian light cavalry took over these duties when they became available to the Macedonian army following Gaugamela. The prodromoi then assumed a purely battlefield role as shock cavalry. It is possible that the prodromoi, due to their skill in wielding long lances and their extensive battle experience, were considered more valuable in the role of shock cavalry, especially after the departure of the Thessalian cavalry. Four ilai, each 150 strong, of prodromoi operated with Alexander's army in Asia.Ashley. pp. 32-33. At Gaugamela, the prodromoi under Aretes were responsible for finally routing the Persian left wing cavalry, winning the battle in this sector. Paeonian cavalry These light cavalry were recruited from Paeonia, a tribal region to the north of Macedonia. The Paeones had been conquered and reduced to tributary status by Philip II. Led by their own chieftains, the Paeonian cavalry was usually brigaded with the Prodromoi and often operated alongside them in battle. They appear to have been armed with javelins and swords and are, unusually, described as carrying shields. Initially only one squadron strong, they received 500 reinforcements in Egypt and a further 600 at Susa.Ashley. p. 34. Thracian cavalry Javelin-armed Thracian horseman - hunting wild boar. Largely recruited from the Odrysian tribe, the Thracian cavalry also acted as scouts on the march. In battle, they performed much the same function as the Prodromoi and Paeonians, except they guarded the flank of the Thessalian cavalry on the left wing of the army. The Thracians deployed in their ancestral wedge formations and were armed with javelins and swords. At Gaugamela, the Thracians fielded four ilai and were about 500 strong. Horse archers In 329 BC, Alexander, while in Sogdiana, created a 1,000 strong unit of horse archers that was recruited from various Iranian peoples. They were very effective at scouting and in screening the rest of the army from the enemy. Firing their bows whilst mounted, they offered highly mobile missile fire on the battlefield. At the Battle of Hydaspes, the massed fire of the horse archers was effective at disordering the Indian cavalry and helped to neutralise the Indian chariots.Ashley. p. 35. =Heavy infantry= The Foot Companions A drawing of a Macedonian phalanx. The shields depicted are smaller and lighter than those employed in a traditional hoplite phalanx, the sarissa is twice as long as the hoplite spear and fully enclosed helmets weren't as widespread as this drawing suggests. Painted depiction of a soldier wearing the linothorax, from the Tomb of Judgement at Mieza in Imathia, Greece, 4th/3rd century BC Suitable men from the Macedonian peasantry were recruited into an infantry formation, called the phalanx. It was developed by Philip II, and later used by his son Alexander the Great in his conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. These infantrymen were called Pezhetairoi, which translates as 'Foot Companions'.Elis, pp. 52-56 Philip II spent much of his youth as a hostage at Thebes, where he studied under the renowned general Epaminondas, whose reforms formed the basis of Philip's later tactics. The equipment of the Macedonian phalangite is believed to have been influenced by the 'peltast' developed by the Athenian general Iphicrates. The Iphicratean peltast was not a skirmisher but a form of light hoplite, characterised by using a longer spear and smaller shield.Mattew, p. 119 However, the introduction of the sarissa pike in conjunction with a smaller shield seem to have been innovations devised by Philip himself, or at the very least he produced the definitive synthesis of earlier developments.Elis, p. 56 Diodorus claimed that Philip was inspired to make changes in the organisation of his Macedonian infantry from reading a passage in the writings of Homer describing a close-packed formation.Lendon, p. 11. Imitating the Greek example of martial exercises and issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, Philip II transformed the Macedonian army from a levied force of farmers into a well- trained fighting force.: \\"the crucial necessity of drilling troops must have become clear to Philip at the latest during his time as a hostage in Thebes.\\" Foot Companions were levied from the peasantry of Macedon. Once levied they became professional soldiers. Discharge could only be granted by the King. Under Philip, the Foot Companions received no regular pay. This seems to have changed by Alexander's time as during the mutiny at Opis in 324 BC, the men were chastised by Alexander for having run up debts despite earning \\"good pay\\".The Campaigns of Alexander, Arrian, VII.10 Through extensive drilling and training, the Foot Companions were able to execute complex manoeuvres in absolute silence, an ability that was fascinating and unnerving to enemies.Ashley, p. 172 These soldiers fought in close-ranked rectangular or square formations, of which the smallest tactical unit was the 256 men strong syntagma or speira. This formation typically fought eight or sixteen men deep and in a frontage of thirty-two or sixteen men accordingly. Each file of 16 men, a lochos, was commanded by a lochagos who was in the front rank. Junior officers, one at the rear and one in the centre, were in place to steady the ranks and maintain the cohesion of the formation, similar to modern-day NCOs. The commander of the syntagma theoretically fought at the head of the extreme far-right file. According to Aelian, a syntagma was accompanied by five additional individuals to the rear: a herald (to act as a messenger), a trumpeter (to sound out commands), an ensign (to hold the unit's standard), an additional officer (called ouragos), and a servant. This array of both audial and visual communication methods helped to make sure that even in the dust and din of battle orders could still be received and given. Six syntagmata formed a taxis of 1,500 men commanded by a strategos, a variable number of taxeis formed a phalanx under a phalangiarch. On his Asian campaign, Alexander, had a phalanx of 6 veteran taxeis, numbering 9,000 men. Between Susa and India a seventh taxis was created. Antipater, as regent in Macedonia, was left with 8 taxeis of younger, less-experienced recruits.Ashley, p. 39. Each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa, which was a type of pike. The length of these pikes was such that they had to be wielded with two hands in battle. The traditional Greek hoplite used his spear single-handed, as the large hoplon shield needed to be gripped by the left hand, therefore the Macedonian phalangite gained in both weapon reach and in the added force of a two handed thrust. At close range, such large weapons were of little use, but an intact phalanx could easily keep its enemies at a distance; the weapons of the first five rows of men all projected beyond the front of the formation, so that there were more spearpoints than available targets at any given time. The men of the rear ranks raised their sarissas so as to provide protection from aerial missiles. A phalangite also carried a sword as a secondary weapon for close quarter fighting should the phalanx disintegrate. The phalanx, however, was extremely vulnerable in the flanks and rear.Ashley, pp. 37-38. The phalangite was equipped with a shield, often called the 'Telamon shield', which was smaller and less deeply convex than the aspis shield employed by Greek hoplites (and probably the hypaspists). The extent to which phalangites were armoured is unclear, and may have changed over time. They were equipped with helmets and greaves, but do not appear to have worn the thorax at the time of Philip II, as this armour is not mentioned as forming part of the necessary equipment for sarissa-armed infantry. The thorax is, however, shown being worn by an infantryman on the Alexander Sarcophagus, however, this figure is equipped with an 'aspis' shield and may depict a hypaspist, rather than a phalangite.Markle, p. 94 It is indicated in the Military Decree of Amphipolis that the phalangites wore the kotthybos, a form of defence of uncertain nature. Alexander did not use the phalanx as the decisive arm in his battles, but instead used it to pin and demoralize the enemy while his heavy cavalry would charge selected opponents or exposed enemy unit flanks, most usually after driving the enemy horse from the field.Ashley. p. 39. Polybius (18.31.5), emphasises that the phalanx required flat open places for its effective deployment, as broken country would hinder and break up its formation.Markle, p. 99 The phalanx carried with it a fairly minimal baggage train, with only one servant for every ten men. This gave it a marching speed that contemporary armies could not hope to match -- on occasion forces surrendered to Alexander simply because they were not expecting him to show up for several more days. This was made possible thanks to the training Philip instilled in his army, which included regular forced marches.Connolly, pp. 68-69 Ancient depiction of a Macedonian infantryman (right). He is equipped with a hoplon (Argive) shield, so probably is a Hypaspist. He also wears a linothorax cuirass and a Thracian helmet. Alexander Sarcophagus. Hypaspists The Hypaspists (Hypaspistai) were the elite arm of the Macedonian infantry. The word 'hypaspists' translates into English as 'shield- bearers'. During a pitched battle, such as Gaugamela, they acted as guard for the right flank of the phalanx and as a flexible link between the phalanx and the Companion cavalry. They were used for a variety of irregular missions by Alexander, often in conjunction with the Agrianians (elite skirmishers), the Companions and select units of phalangites. They were prominent in accounts of Alexander's siege assaults in close proximity to Alexander himself. The Hypaspists were of privileged Macedonian blood and their senior chiliarchy (œáŒπŒªŒπŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±) formed the AgemaEllis, J. R., p. 27 foot bodyguard of Alexander III.Ashley, pp. 39-40.Campbell and Lawrence (ed.s), p. 165 The organisation of the hypaspist regiment seems to have been into units of 500 (pentakosiarchies) before 331 and later, by 327, it was divided into three battalions (chiliarchies) of 1,000 men, which were then further sub-divided in a manner similar to the Foot Companions. Each battalion would be commanded by a chiliarch, with the regiment as a whole under the command of an archihypaspist.Campbell and Lawrence (ed.s), pp. 164-165 In terms of weaponry, they were probably equipped in the style of a traditional Greek hoplite with a thrusting spear or doru (shorter and less unwieldy than the sarissa) and a large round shield (hoplon).Heckel, p 41 As well as this, they would have carried a sword, either a xiphos or a kopis. This would have made them far better suited to engagements where formations and cohesion had broken down, making them well suited to siege assaults and special missions. Their armour appears to have varied depending on the type of mission they were conducting. When taking part in rapid forced marches or combat in broken terrain, so common in the eastern Persian Empire, it appears that they wore little more than a helmet and a cloak (exomis) so as to enhance their stamina and mobility. However, when engaging in heavy hand-to-hand fighting, for instance during a siege or pitched battle, they would have worn body armour of either linen or bronze. This variety of armaments made them an extremely versatile force. Their numbers were kept at full strength, despite casualties, by continual replenishment through the transfer of veteran soldiers chosen from the phalanx.Ashley, p. 40. A new term for hypaspistai emerged after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC: the argyraspides ('silver shields').; The latter continued to serve after the reign of Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin. However, in regards to both the argyraspides and chalkaspides ('bronze shields'), Malcolm Errington asserts that \\"these titles were probably not functional, perhaps not even official.\\" Sekunda states that Alexander's pike-wielding infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite hypaspistai and 9,000 of which were pezhetairoi. However, in discussing the discrepancies among ancient historians about the size of Alexander the Great's army, N.G.L. Hammond and F.W. Walbank choose Diodorus Siculus' figure of 32,000 infantry as the most reliable, while disagreeing with his figure for cavalry at 4,500, asserting it was closer to 5,100 horsemen. Greek hoplites The army led by Alexander the Great into the Persian Empire included Greek heavy infantry in the form of allied contingents provided by the League of Corinth and hired mercenaries. These infantrymen would have been equipped as hoplites with the traditional hoplite panoply consisting of a thrusting spear (doru), bronze-faced hoplon shield and body armour. In appearance, they would have been almost identical to the hypaspists. In battle, the Greek hoplites had a less active role than the Macedonian phalangites and hypaspists. At Gaugamela, the Greek infantry formed the defensive rear of the box formation Alexander arranged his army into, while the Macedonians formed its front face.Green, p. 290 Nevertheless, they performed a valuable function in facing down attempts by the Persian cavalry to surround the Macedonian army and helped deal with the breakthrough of some Persian horsemen who went on to attack the baggage.Sandler, p. 313 =Light infantry= Peltasts Agrianian peltast - modern reconstruction by Johnny Shumate The peltasts raised from the Agrianes, a Paeonian tribe, were the elite light infantry of the Macedonian army. They were often used to cover the right flank of the army in battle, being posted to the right of the Companion cavalry, a position of considerable honour. They were almost invariably part of any force on detached duty, especially missions requiring speed of movement.Ashley, p. 45-46. Other nationalities also provided peltasts for the Macedonian army. Especially numerous were the Thracians; the Thracian peltasts performed the same function in battle as the Agrianians, but for the left wing of the army. It is unclear if the Thracians, Paeonians, and Illyrians fighting as javelin throwers, slingers, and archers serving in Macedonian armies from the reign of Philip II onward were conscripted as allies via a treaty or were simply hired mercenaries. Peltasts were armed with a number of javelins and a sword, carried a light shield but wore no armour, though they sometimes had helmets; they were adept at skirmishing and were often used to guard the flanks of more heavily equipped infantry. They usually adopted an open order when facing enemy heavy infantry. They could throw their javelins at will at the enemy and, unencumbered by armour or heavy shields, easily evade any counter-charges made by heavily equipped hoplites. They were, however, quite vulnerable to shock-capable cavalry and often operated to particular advantage on broken ground where cavalry was useless and heavy infantry found it difficult to maintain formation.Connolly, pp. 48-49.Sidnell, pp. 57-59 Archers Philip II was also able to field archers, including mercenary Cretan archers and perhaps some native Macedonians.; In most Greek states, archery was not greatly esteemed, nor practised by native soldiery, and foreign archers were often employed, such as the Scythians prominent in Athenian employ. However, Crete was notable for its very effective archers, whose services as mercenaries were in great demand throughout the Greek World. Cretan archers were famed for their powerful bows, firing arrows with large, heavy heads of cast bronze. They carried their arrows in a quiver with a protective flap over its opening. Cretan archers were unusual in carrying a shield, which was relatively small and faced in bronze. The carrying of shields indicates that the Cretans also had some ability in hand-to-hand fighting, an additional factor in their popularity as mercenaries.Connolly, p. 45. Archers were also raised from Macedonia and various Balkan peoples. Alexander inherited the use of Cretan archers from his father's reign, yet around this time a clear reference to the use of native Macedonian archers was made. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace and were organized into chiliarchies. The use of Asiatic soldiers under Alexander the Great According to Arrian, Alexander used Arachosian, Bactrian, Parapamisadaean, Sogdian, Indian, and Scythian troops. They were present at the grand army revue Alexander assembled in 324 BC. Alexander was said to have been impressed by the drill of the 30,000 Persians who had been trained in the methods of the Macedonian phalanx.Ashley, p. 48 The army supposedly reached 120,000 front-line troops at one point. This did not include camp followers. There has been considerable debate as to when Alexander first used Orientals on active service with the army.English, pp. 50‚Äì51 During his campaign in Asia against the Persian Empire he formed a hipparchia (i.e. unit of a few hundred horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic Persians. The introduction of Asiatic troops into the army was actively resented by many of the native Macedonians, especially when the cadre of young Persians from aristocratic families was trained in Macedonian fighting techniques and enrolled in the companion cavalry.Green, pp. 333-336 Alexander's reaction was to make plans to rule Asia with a locally recruited army, but his death intervened before he could carry out this plan. His successors reversed his aim of diversifying the army and recruited Greeks and Macedonians almost exclusively.Ashley, p. 49 Arms and armour ancient Macedonian shield displaying the 'Vergina Sun', a royal symbol. Excavated at Bonƒçe, North Macedonia. Philip II's phalangite infantry were equipped with a 'proto-Telamon shield' that already diverged from the hoplon style shield featured in sculpted artwork of a Katerini tomb, dated perhaps to the reign of Amyntas III of Macedon. His early infantry were also equipped with protective helmets and greaves, as well as sarissa pikes, yet according to Sekunda they were eventually equipped with heavier armour such as cuirasses, since the Third Philippic of Demosthenes in 341 BC described them as hoplites instead of lighter peltasts.; see also for further details. As evidenced by the Alexander Sarcophagus, troops serving Alexander the Great were also armoured in the hoplite fashion. However, Errington argues that breastplates were not worn by the phalanx pikemen of either Philip II or Philip V's reign periods (during which sufficient evidence exists). Instead, he claims that breastplates were only worn by military officers, while pikemen wore the kotthybos along with their helmets and greaves, wielding a dagger as a secondary weapon along with their shields. There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that the different classes of Macedonian soldier trained to use a variety of arms and equipment. Certainly, cavalry, including Alexander himself, fought on foot during sieges and assaults on fortified settlements, phalangites are described using javelins and some infantrymen were trained to ride horses. The deployment of differing types of armour and weapons was dependent solely on the requirements of a particular tactical situation.Markle, p. 100 =Weapons= The hunter on the right is wielding a kopis cutting sword, the hunter on the left holds a scabbarded xiphos straight sword. Both types of sword were used by Macedonian cavalry and infantry. Lion Hunt mosaic from the Macedonian capital Pella, late 4th century BC. Fresco of an ancient Macedonian soldier with a grounded spear. He wears 3 items of clothing, which, in combination, are considered typcal of Macedonians: The kausia cap, the Macedonian type of chlamys (cloak) and krepides (boots), from the tomb of Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki, Greece.Saatsoglou-Paliadeli, C., Aspects of Ancient Macedonian Costume, The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 113 (1993), pp. 122-147, The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies Most troops would have carried a type of sword as a secondary weapon. The straight-bladed shortsword known as the xiphos (ŒæŒØœÜŒøœÇ) is depicted in works of art, and two types of single-edged cutting swords, the kopis and machaira, are shown in images and are mentioned in texts. An archaeological find of a well-preserved Macedonian xiphos revealed a sword with a blade length of 55 cm and a weight of 300g.Markle, p.101 The cutting swords are particularly associated with cavalry use, especially by Xenophon, but pictorial representations would suggest that all three sword types were used by cavalry and infantry without obvious distinction.Connolly, p. 77. Each Companion cavalryman was equipped with a 3-metre double-ended spear/lance with a cornel wood shaft called the xyston. The double spear points meant that, should the xyston break during a battle, the rider need only turn his weapon around to re-arm himself. The Thessalian and Greek cavalry would have been armed similarly to the Companions. The xyston was used to thrust either overarm or underarm with the elbow flexed.Gaebel, p. 164. This is usefully illustrated in the Alexander Mosaic, King Alexander is shown thrusting with his xyston underarm, whilst immediately behind him a cavalryman is employing the overarm thrust. There is no evidence that the Macedonian cavalry ever used a two-handed grip on their lances, as did later Sarmatian and Roman lancers.Markle, p.106 The shaft of the xyston was tapered allowing the point of balance, and therefore the hand grip, to be approximately two thirds of the length of the spear away from the point.Sidnell, p.83 The armament of the phalangites is described in the Military Decree of Amphipolis. It lists the fines imposed upon the soldiers who fail to maintain their armament or produce it upon demand. Offensive weapons were a pike (sarissa), and a short sword (machaira). The sarissa was over 6 m (18 ft) in length, with a counterweight and spiked end at the rear called a sauroter; it seems to have had an iron sleeve in the middle which may mean that it was in two pieces for the march with the sleeve joining the two sections before use. Like the xyston, the sarissa was greatly tapered towards the point. This, along with the sauroter, helped to make the point of balance as far towards the butt of the weapon as possible. It should be stressed that the archaeological discoveries show that the phalangites also used the two- edged sword (xiphos) as well as the traditional Greek hoplite spear (doru/Œ¥œåœÅœÖ), which was much shorter than the sarissa. The sources also indicate that the phalangites were on occasion armed with javelins. The sarissa would have been useless in siege warfare and other combat situations requiring a less cumbersome weapon.Ashley, pp. 35-36.Markle, pp. 99, 102 Hypaspists and allied and mercenary Greek heavy infantry were equipped as classic hoplites and would have employed the hoplite spear and a sword.Connolly, p. 63 Light troops were provided by a number of subject and allied peoples. Various Balkan peoples, such as Agrianes, Paeonians and Thracians, provided either light infantry or cavalry or indeed both. Typical light infantry peltasts would be armed with a number of javelins. The individual javelin would have a throwing thong attached to the shaft behind its point of balance. The thong was wound around the shaft and hooked over one or two fingers. The thong made the javelin spin in flight, which improved accuracy, and the extra leverage increased the power of the throw and the range achievable.Connolly, pp. 48-49 Foot archers, notably mercenary Cretans, were also employed; Cretans were noted for the heavy, large-headed arrows they used. Light cavalry could use lighter types of lance, javelins and, in the case of Iranian horse archers, compact composite bows.Ashley, pp. 34-35 (light cavalry weaponry), 45 (javelins), 47-48 (bows/archery). =Helmets= pilos) of a type worn by some Macedonian infantrymen. A Thracian helmet. It lacks its cheek pieces. Boeotian bronze helmet, the front of the helmet is to the right Virtually all helmets in use in the Greek world of the period were constructed of bronze. One helmet prominent in contemporary images was in the form of a Phrygian cap, that is it had a high and forward-projecting apex, this type of helmet, also known as a \\"Thracian helmet\\", had a projecting peak above the eyes and usually had large cheek pieces which were often decorated with stylised beards in embossing. Late versions of the Chalcidian helmet were still in use; this helmet was a lightened form developed from the Corinthian helmet, it had a nasal protection and modest-sized cheek pieces. Other, more simple, helmets of the conical 'konos' or 'Pilos type', without cheek pieces, were also employed. These helmets were worn by the heavy infantry.Connolly, pp. 70. The Thracian helmet was worn by Macedonian cavalry in King Philip's day, but his son Alexander is said to have preferred the open-faced Boeotian helmet for his cavalry, as recommended by Xenophon.Anderson, pp. 147- 148. The royal burial in the Vergina Tomb contained a helmet which was a variation on the Thracian/Phrygian type, exceptionally made of iron, this would support its use by cavalry.Heckel, p 61 Additionally, a fresco depicting a Macedonian mounted lancer spearing an infantryman, from the Kinch Tomb, near Naousa, shows the cavalryman wearing a Thracian type helmet.Markle, p.90 The Boeotian helmet, though it did not have cheek pieces, had a flaring rim which was folded into a complex shape offering considerable protection to the face. The Alexander Mosaic suggests that officers of the heavy cavalry had rank badges in the form of laurel wreaths (perhaps painted or constructed from metal foil) on their helmets.Connolly, pp. 72-73. The Alexander Sarcophagus shows Alexander the Great wearing an elaborate helmet in the form of the lion scalp of Herakles. Alexander's cousin Pyrrhus of Epirus is described as wearing a helmet with cheek pieces in the shape of ram's heads. Many examples of helmets from the period have crest or plume-holders attached, so that a high degree of martial finery could be achieved by the wearing of imposing headpieces.Connolly, p. 63. =Body armour= Hellenistic muscle cuirass and a helmet derived from the Thracian/Phrygian type, combined with elements of the Boeotian type Alexander the Great in battle. The king wears a composite cuirass which copies the shape of the linothorax. The shoulder elements and upper chest are of plate iron, whilst the waist is composed of scale armour for ease of movement. There are pteruges of leather or stiffened linen at the shoulders and hips. The king wears a xiphos sword. Detail of the Alexander Mosaic (A Roman copy of a Hellenistic painting). Body armour in the Macedonian army was derived from a repertoire found throughout the Greek-speaking world. The most common form of armour was the linothorax, which was a cuirass of stiff linen built up of glued or stitched layers of textile; though it is possible that linen was used as a facing material over leather.Mattew, p. 116 It was composed of the 'girdle' a tubular section, often of four vertical panels, that enclosed the torso. A shoulder-piece was attached to the upper rear section of the girdle, this element was split into two wings which were pulled forward over the top of each shoulder and laced to the chest-section of the girdle. Ancient representations show the shoulder pieces standing vertical when not laced down to the chest of the corselet. This suggests that the linothorax as a whole was very stiff and inflexible. Pteruges, strips of linen or leather, protected the upper arms and hips of the wearer. The linothorax could be reinforced with plate bronze or bronze scale elements. Defences of a similar appearance composed of quilted textile are also described.Connolly, p. 58.Mattew, pp. 114-116 Less common, due to its expense, was the muscle cuirass. This was a defence made entirely of plate bronze consisting of a breast and backplate, usually with shoulder pieces, modelled in relief on the form a muscular male torso. This was often given pteruges to extend the area of the body covered.Connolly, pp. 54-58. A complete cuirass of plate iron, decorated with gold and modelled on the form of the linothorax, was discovered in the Macedonian royal burial at Vergina. This, alongside the evidence of the depiction of Alexander the Great in the Alexander Mosaic, shows that the technology to make plate armour in iron existed at this time.Connolly, pp. 58-59. It is to be doubted that this type of armour was worn by persons other than of royal or very exalted rank.Mattew, p. 121 All of the above forms of armour could be described as thorakes (plural of thorax). Other forms of armour are mentioned in original sources, such as the kotthybos and a type of \\"half-armour\\" the hemithorakion (·º°ŒºŒπŒ∏œâœÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ); the precise nature of these defences is not known but it would be reasonable to conclude that they were lighter and perhaps afforded less protection than the thorax.Connolly, pp. 79-80. However, it has been suggested that when the terms kotthybos, hemithorakion and thorax occur together, as in the Amphipolis regulation, then thorax may refer specifically to the bronze muscle cuirass. Within the phalanx the thorax and hemithorakion were reserved for hegemones, the officers.Hatzopoulos and Juhel, p. 113 It has also been proposed that the kotthybos might refer to a form of linothorax. It is recorded that Alexander ordered the burning of old armours, which suggests that the armour in question was non-metallic.Mattew, pp. 119-120 Archaeological remains exist for only one type of limb armour: bronze greaves, which protected the lower leg. Greaves could be worn by both heavy infantry and heavy cavalry, but they are not in great evidence in contemporary depictions. However, greaves are mentioned in the Military Decree of Amphipolis and a pair of greaves, one shorter than the other, were found in the Vergina Tomb.Connolly, p. 80 Xenophon mentions a type of armour called \\"the hand\\" to protect the left, bridle, arm of heavy cavalrymen, though there is no supporting evidence for its widespread use. It may have resembled the later manica armour used by Roman gladiators and cataphract cavalry.Anderson, p. 148. =Shields= The Macedonian phalangite shield, also termed the 'Telamon shield', was circular and displayed a slight convexity; its outer surface was faced by a thin bronze sheet. The inner face of the shield was of wood or a multilayered leather construction, with a band for the forearm fixed to the centre of the shield. Plutarch noted that the phalangites (phalanx soldiers) carried a small shield on their shoulder. This probably meant that, as both hands were needed to hold the sarissa, the shield was worn suspended by a shoulder strap and steadied by the left forearm passing through the armband. The left hand would project beyond the rim of the shield to grip the sarissa. Recent reconstructions of the sarissa and phalangite shield showed that the shoulder strap supporting the shield effectively helps to transfer some of the weight of the sarissa from the left arm to the shoulders when the sarissa is held horizontally in its fighting position. The Macedonian phalangite shield is described by Asclepiodotus (Tactica, 5) as being eight palms wide (equivalent to 62 cm or 24 inches) and \\"not too hollow\\".Connolly, p. 79.Markle, p.92 The lefthand figure shows the armband and grip on the inside of a hoplon or Argive shield - painted Corinthian krater c. 560BC. From pictorial sources, it is probable that the Hypaspists, elite members of the infantry, including the Agema of the King's personal foot guard, employed a shield of larger dimensions, the traditional Greek hoplite shield called the hoplon or aspis (·ºÄœÉœÄŒØœÇ), it is also referred to as the 'Argive shield'. This shield, also circular, was larger than the phalangite shield, it had sheet-bronze facing over a wooden base; it was held with the left forearm passing through a central armband with a hand-grip set just inside the rim. This shield was more much convex than the phalangite shield and had a projecting rim, both features precluding its use with a double handed pike. The style of shield used by cavalry, if any, is less clear; the heavy cavalry of Alexander's time did not employ shields.Connolly. p. 72Markle, pp.97-98 Light infantry javelineers would have used a version of the pelte (Ancient Greek: œÄŒ≠ŒªœÑŒ∑) shield, from whence their name, peltast, derived. This was a light shield made of leather-faced wicker. The shield was of Thracian origin and was originally crescent-shaped, however, by the time of Macedonian greatness many depictions of peltai show them as being oval or round.Dabrowa, p. 145Lendon, pp. 95-97 Siege warfare The Macedonians had developed their siege tactics under Philip. They had for the first time conducted successful sieges against strongly held and fortified positions. This was a dramatic shift from earlier warfare, where Greek armies had lacked the ability to conduct an effective assault. For instance, during the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans were never able to take Athens despite easily conquering her surrounding territory. For the task of breaching the walled fortifications of cities, Philip II hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery firing large bolts. =Artillery= A modern reconstruction of the gastraphetes The dramatic change in the abilities of Greeks to operate against fortifications owed much to the development of effective artillery. This had begun around 400 BC in Syracuse under Dionysius I. By Alexander‚Äôs time, torsion-powered artillery was in use. Torsion machines used skeins of sinew or hair rope, which were wound around a frame and twisted so as to power two bow arms; these could develop much greater force than earlier forms (such as the gastraphetes) reliant on the elastic properties of a bow-stave. Two forms of such ballista were used by the Macedonians: a smaller bolt-shooting type called the oxybeles and a larger stone-throwing machine called the lithobolos. The largest lithoboloi could fire stones up to 80 kg in weight. Such machines could shower the defenders of a city with missiles and create a breach in the walls themselves.Connolly, pp. 279-282. Alexander the Great appears to have been one of the first generals to employ artillery on the open field of battle, rather than in a siege. He used massed artillery to fire across a river at a Scythian army, causing it to vacate the opposite river bank, thus allowing the Macedonian troops to cross and form a bridgehead.Cummings, p. 291. =Other siege engines= In conjunction with various forms of artillery, the Macedonians possessed the ability to build an effective array of siege engines. Prominent in a number of sieges, including the epic Siege of Tyre (332 BC), were siege towers; these allowed men to approach and assault the enemy walls without being exposed to potentially withering missile fire. Equally, they meant that more men could be put on the walls in a shorter period of time, as simple ladders constrained the men attacking to moving up in single file, thus making the task of defending the walls far easier. These structures, which were wheeled and several stories high, were covered with wet hide or metal sheathing to protect from missile fire, especially incendiaries, and the largest might be equipped with artillery. The Macedonian army could also deploy various forms of suspended, metal-tipped, rams. Such rams were usually provided with a wheeled, roofed covering to protect their users from missile fire; they were employed to batter down gates or to dislodge masonry from walls and so cause a breach (this latter form was sometimes called a 'drill' rather than a ram).Connolly, pp. 280-286 Battle tactics Macedonian battle formation. The Macedonian army was one of the first military forces to use 'combined arms tactics', using a variety of specialised troops to fulfill specific battlefield roles in order to form a greater whole. Although it did not succeed in every battle, the army of Philip II was able to successfully adopt the military tactics of its enemies, such as the embolon (i.e. 'flying wedge') formation of the Scythians. This offered cavalry far greater manoeuvrability and an edge in battle that previously did not exist in the Classical Greek world. The tactics used by the Macedonian army throughout the various campaigns it fought were, of course, varied; usually in response to the nature of the enemy forces and their dispositions, and to the physical nature of the battlefield . However, there were a number of features of the tactics employed by the Macedonians in pitched battles which can be identified as being typical. These features were evident in the first major battle the army, newly trained up by Philip, fought in 358 BC and could still be discerned at Gaugamela in 331 BC.Green, pp. 24-25. The battle fought in 358 BC near Lake Ohrid was intended to free Macedon of the threat from Illyria and recover some western areas of Macedon from Illyrian control. The Illyrians, led by King Bardylis, were at a similar strength to the Macedonians at about 10-11 thousands. Philip had 600 cavalry, the Illyrians were concerned about being outflanked by the Macedonian cavalry and formed up in a hollow square. Philip massed his cavalry on his right flank and arranged his army in echelon, with the left refused. As had been anticipated, the Illyrians stretched their formation in order to bring the Macedonian left wing into action. Philip waited until the inevitable gap appeared in the left of the Illyrian square, then threw his cavalry at the gap. The cavalry forced their way into the Illyrian ranks and were followed by elements of the phalanx. The Illyrians broke after a fierce struggle, and three-quarters of Bardylis' army were slaughtered. The oblique advance with the left refused, the careful manoeuvring to create disruption in the enemy formation and the knock out charge of the strong right wing, spearheaded by the Companion cavalry, became standard Macedonian practice. Decline Following the fragmentation of the empire of Alexander, Macedon became an independent kingdom once again. The military forces of this successor state, the Antigonid Macedonian army, retained many features of the armies of Philip and Alexander. The Hellenistic armies of the other Macedonian successor-states of the Diadochi period, which followed the death of Alexander, also displayed a continuation of earlier Macedonian equipment, organisation and tactics. Towards the end of the period, however, there was a general decline in the use of the combined arms approach, and the phalanx once more became the arm of decision. The phalangites were armed with longer pikes and as a result the phalanx itself became less mobile and adaptable than it had been in Alexander's era.Connolly, pp. 80-81 Because all the competing Hellenistic armies were employing the same tactics, these weaknesses were not immediately apparent. However, the Hellenistic armies were eventually faced by forces from outside the successor kingdoms, such as the Roman and Parthian armies, composed of differing troop types using novel tactics. Against such foes the Hellenistic-era phalanx proved vulnerable. The phalanx finally met its end in the Ancient world when the more flexible Roman manipular tactics contributed to the defeat and partition of Macedon in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C.Connolly, pp. 140-142, 205-207 See also * Military Decree of Amphipolis * Antigonid Macedonian army * List of Macedonian military personnel * Hellenistic armies * Seleucid army * Hoplite * Pezhetairoi * Companion cavalry * Phalanx * Sarissa * Xyston *Wars of Alexander the Great, (Battle of Granicus, Battle of Gaugamela, Battle of Hydaspes) * Battle of Pydna * Battle of Cynoscephalae * Aelianus Tacticus Notes References =Primary= *Arrian, , translated by E.J.

Its headquarters are located in Northside, Houston, Texas.  History  Shipley Do-Nuts began in 1936 by Lawrence Shipley. When Shipley first created his recipe, his doughnuts were cut by hand and served warm during the day, and sold for per dozen. Shipley and his family worked at their original bakery on 1417 Crockett Street in Houston, Texas. Shipley's goal was to continue selling hot doughnuts to customers. He said \\"When they bite into that hot doughnut, it will bring them back every time\\". Lawrence Shipley Jr. took over the business, and later still, Lawrence W. Shipley III became the president of the company. Today, the chain's headquarters remain in Houston, Texas on 5200 North Main. =Growth= Shipley Do-Nuts Sign used as advertisements on freeways. Shipley Do-Nuts began a phase of rapid expansion. Shipley Do-Nuts' locations are based primarily in the Southern United States, but their imprint has been shifting further out. In the company debuted stores in Florida, Colorado and Oklahoma. In Florida, the first location opened in Bradenton. That year, they also opened the first Colorado location in Aurora in the Denver area. The second Colorado location opened in 2019 in Fountain in the Colorado Springs area. Additionally to new states, Shipley vastly expanded in states it already served. The company is known for its flexible location as it can be attached in shopping strip centers or as a free-standing location. Marketing Primary logo with slogan (left), alternate wordmark logo (right), and the iconic Shipley red stripe Since experiencing massive growth, Shipley Do-Nuts has constantly adjusted its marketing concept accordingly. The company uses \\"Make Life Delicious\\" as its slogan. A secondary slogan has also been used as \\"The Greatest Name in Do- Nuts\\" and is displayed in some of their stores including their original location in Houston Heights. =Logo= The current company logo is derived from the original store's sign that consisted of a large, circular doughnut figure to inform customers they sold doughnuts. Since the original store began, the doughnut-shaped logo has been updated various time, but constantly kept the same theme. In its different updated, elements such as font, brightness, shading and sizing have been slightly changed overtime. In the mid-2010s, the company attempted to implement an alternate logo, but it was short lived. An alternate Wordmark is used by the company both in store signs and in packaging. Like the primary logo, the wordmark is an updated version of the original. While the logo and wordmark have a brown color base, the company's theme colors are white and red. The red is used as stripe which can be found in packaging, alone the stores walls, and often, even in the store signs. =Affiliations= Shipley Do-Nuts advertisement in Minute Maid Park Shipley Do-Nuts has sponsored and maintained affiliations with the Houston Astros and University of Houston.https://abc13.com/houston-astros-food-donuts- sports/5622057/https://www.myshipleydonuts.com/shipleys-loves-the-cougars =Notable Endorsements= *Earl Campbell *Kylie Jenner *Lizzo *Travis Scott Community involvement The company has partnered with the Salvation Army to use a portion of sales on National Doughnut Day for charity.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shipley-do-nuts-to-partner- with-the-salvation-army-for-national-do-nut-day-on-june-1st-300653015.html Shipley Do-Nuts hosted an annual Shipley Do-Nut Dash fun run to benefit the Kids‚Äô Meals Houston charity. The event raises funds to end hunger among pre- schoolers living in poverty in Houston and the surrounding area. Controversy and criticism =2015 Pregnancy Discrimination Lawsuit= In , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), charged a Shipley Do-Nuts franchisee for violating federal anti-discrimination laws when it forced an employee to take unpaid leave. The franchise owner/general manager prohibited the employee from working at the doughnut shop unless she provided documentation from a doctor that her pregnancy is not high-risk and was fired when she was unable to provide formal evidence of the doctor's release, in violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, part of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On a Federal judge signed the consent decree that settled the suit which provided non-monetary relief. =2017 Overtime Lawsuit= In , a lawsuit against Shipley Do-Nuts regarding the issue that their employees were not getting the overtime pay that they deserved. The suit alleged that \\"All plaintiffs regularly worked over forty hours per week...Shipley's knew or reasonably should have known that plaintiffs worked in excess of forty hours per workweek\\". One employee, Juan Sanchez, claimed that he \\"put in 40‚Äì60 hours in a week with minimal breaks\\". However, he believes that Shipley Do-Nuts disregarded the overage and paid him only 40 hours' worth. The suit filed claims that Shipley Do-Nuts did not maintain accurate records, failed to pay workers minimum wage, and dismissed the idea to pay overtime. Shipley Do-Nuts stated, \\"the claims by the former employees named in the lawsuit are unfounded, completely without merit and no more than a retaliation lawsuit against Shipley Do-Nuts and Lawrence Shipley III for their recent termination.\\" Legacy In 2018 Houston artist Donkee Boy created a Shipley Do-Nuts mural in a location along the Katy Freeway.

He attended school in Strasbourg until 1900, and from 1902 until 1906 studied law in Strasbourg, Munich, and Berlin. He then worked in the legal profession in Alsace-Lorraine until 1909, afterwards taking leave to study physics in T√ºbingen. He retired from the legal profession in 1912, and earned his Ph.D. in 1913. His thesis, titled Zur Prestonschen Regel, was on the subject of what would later be called the Paschen-Back effect, and was named after Back and Friedrich Paschen. Between 1914 and 1918 he served with the German Army during World War I. Following this conflict he became head of a Veifa-Werke laboratory in Frankfurt am Main, a company that produced electrical and X-ray equipment. In 1920 he left to become an assistant at the Physics Institute in T√ºbingen. He was promoted to professor in 1926 at Hohenheim University, and became a full professor in 1929. He remained at this post until 1936 when he returned to become a professor at T√ºbingen.

It should be distinguished from letter-spacing (the spacing between the letters within each word) and sentence spacing (the spacing between sentences). Typographers may modify the spacing of letters or words in a body of type to aid readability and copy fit, or for aesthetic effect. In web browsers and standardized digital typography the word spacing is controlled by the CSS1 word-spacing property. Effect on readability Word spacing is crucial for the written form because it illustrates the sound of speech where audible gaps or pauses take place.Lupton, Ellen. (2004). Thinking with Type. Princeton Architectural Press, p. 67 With typography, word spacing shows this unspoken aspect of speech. Otherwise, it would be difficult for people to read one long continuous line of letters. It is hard to determine how much spacing should be put in between words, but a good typographer is able to determine proper spacing.Carter, R., Day, B. & Meggs, P. (2002).Typographic Design: Form and Communication. 3rd Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., p. 92 When text and spacing are consistent, this makes it easier to read. Geoffrey Dowding describes the nature of spacing since the invention of printing from moveable type in the fifteenth century. Since the fifteenth century, the best work shows that text is to be read smoothly and efficiently.Dowding, Geoffrey. (1995). Finer Points in the Spacing & Arrangement of Type. Hartley & Marks Publishers Inc., p. 3 This is because they should always be closely spaced and ‚Äúnot en or em quadded!‚Äù The convention of having close spacing has lasted for two reasons: because it is easier to read than text which has wider spaces and because it looks better. For the first reason, adult readers take in words as units, and it would be unsuitable for ‚Äúcompositors, in settings not intended for young children, to break the eye‚Äôs track by introducing great gaps of white between words‚Äù. Words must flow smoothly into lines. For the second reason, the colour or ‚Äúblackness‚Äù of the line looks better when it has close word-spacing, otherwise a widely-spaced line of text will appear grey. Language can also be a factor that typographers would take into consideration for word spacing.Bringhurst, Robert. (1997). The Elements of Typographic Style. Hartley & Marks Publishers, Inc., p. 26 For a language like Latin, ‚Äúmost boundaries are marked by grammatical tags, and a smaller space is therefore sufficient‚Äù. In English, the ability to read a line easily, instead of needing to make sense of it first, is also attributed by good word spacing. Word spacing has the ability to express the meaning and idea behind a word, which typographers consider when working on design works and text. With a written piece of text, the designer has to remember to make sure they do not add too much or too little space between words; otherwise it could ruin the texture and tone. Views Jan Tschichold‚Äôs rule is that ‚Äúspacing should be about a middle space or the thickness of an ‚Äòi‚Äô in the type size used. Wide spaces should be strictly avoided.‚Äù For Tschichold, it was better for words to be broken up in order avoid wide spacing. Other views on this issue of wide spacing include that it could depend on the typeface to determine word spacing, so long as it does not look overspaced. The perfect word space is affected by the circumstance; ‚Äúat larger sizes, when letterfit is tightened, the spacing of words can be tightened as well.‚Äù Two other gentlemen have expressed different opinions on what the space between words should be. Aaron Burns, a typographer, suggested that the lowercase ‚Äúr‚Äù was the best size for spaces between words. Edward Johnston, a noted calligrapher, supported that the lowercase ‚Äúo‚Äù was the more appropriate size of measurement for spacing.

Its author was given as M. Ageyev. The English translation of the title fails to convey the double meaning of the Russian \\"–†–æ–º–∞–Ω,\\" meaning both \\"novel\\" and \\"romance.\\" Description Novel with Cocaine is a Dostoevskyan psychological novel of ideas, which explores the interaction between psychology, philosophy, and ideology in its frank portrayal of an adolescent's cocaine addiction. The story relates the formative experiences of narrator Vadim at school and with women before he turns to drug abuse and the philosophical reflections to which it gives rise. Although Ageyev makes little explicit reference to the Russian Revolution of 1917, the novel's obsession with addictive forms of thinking finds resonance in the historical background, in which \\"our inborn feelings of humanity and justice\\" provoke \\"the cruelties and satanic transgressions committed in its name.\\" Publication history Following its original publication in Numbers, the novel was published in book form; it was scorned as decadent and disgusting, to use the term applied to it by Vladimir Nabokov. In 1983 the novel was translated into French and published to nearly unanimous praise; an English translation (by Michael Henry Heim) was published in 1984. After the French translation was published, there was some brief speculation in literary circles as to whether Novel with Cocaine might actually be the work of Nabokov, perhaps one of his mystifications; the consensus is now that Nabokov was not the author. Nabokov's son Dmitri addresses this issue in an afterword to his 1986 English translation of VN's novel The Enchanter. The real author of the book is Mark Levi, a mysterious Russian √©migr√© who sent in a manuscript to the Parisian journal from Istanbul in 1934. Mark Levi returned to the Soviet Union during World War II and spent the rest of his life in Yerevan, where he died on August 5, 1973.

I never, as the saying goes, 'undressed them' with my glance, nor did I feel any carnal desire for them. In that feverish state, which might have inspired another, say to write poetry, I would simply stare into the eyes of all women walking in the other direction and wait for a similarly terrifying, wide-eyed look in response.

The building rests against Castle Rock, upon which Nottingham Castle is built, and is attached to several caves, carved out of the soft sandstone. These were reputedly originally used as a brewhouse for the castle, dating from the medieval period.  Name  The earliest known reference to the name \\"Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem\\" was in 1799. Before being known by its current name, it is believed that the pub was named \\"The Pilgrim\\" and references to this name date back to 1751. The current name is believed to come from the belief that pilgrims or crusaders would stop at the inn on their journey to Jerusalem. Some elements of the pub's name are misunderstood in the modern day: \\"Ye Olde\\" is properly pronounced \\"the old\\" and \\"trip\\" refers to a stop on a journey, rather than the journey itself. Locals often use a shortened version of the name, \\"the Trip\\". Oldest pub in England Interior view showing rock walls Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem is one of several pubs claiming to be the oldest in England ‚Äì others that claim to be the oldest include Ye Olde Salutation Inn and The Bell Inn, also in Nottingham, and Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St Albans, north of London. The pub claims that it was established in 1189 AD ‚Äì the year that Richard the Lionheart became king and Pope Gregory VIII called for a Third Crusade to the Holy Land; however, there is no documentation to verify this date. Evidence suggests that caves in the rock against which the pub is built were used as a brewhouse for Nottingham Castle, and may date from around the time the castle was built in 1067. The oldest parts of the current building were likely constructed between 1650 and 1660, though a map by John Speed shows a previous building in existence in 1610. By 1751 the building was being used as an inn with the name The Pilgrim, and was shortly after that date purchased by William Standford. The first record of the use of the name Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem dates from 1799. Brewhouse Brew House Yard acquired its name after 1680.

Waste from water-using household appliances (toilets, bathtubs, washing machines, etc.) flows through the home‚Äôs pipes into the grinder pump‚Äôs holding tank. Once the wastewater inside the tank reaches a specific level, the pump will turn on, grind the waste into a fine slurry, and pump it to the central sewer system or septic tank. Grinder pumps can be installed in the basement or in the yard. If installed in the yard, the holding tank must be buried deep enough that the pump and sewage pipes are below the frost line. A grinder pump is different from a sump pump or effluent pump. There are two types of grinder pumps, semi- positive displacement (SPD) and centrifugal.  Components  Grinder pump station with fiberglass tank and stainless steel lid installed outside a home Grinder pump station with HDPE tank being installed The grinder pump ‚Äústation‚Äù consists of the pump, a tank, and an alarm panel. A pump for household use is usually 1 hp, 1.5 hp or 2 hp. A cutting mechanism macerates waste and grinds items that are not normally found in sewage, but may get flushed down the toilet. The pump has a level sensor either built into the pump, called ‚Äúsensing bells,‚Äù or attached externally to the pump, typically float switches. (The level sensing devices vary among grinder pump manufacturers.) If the pump malfunctions and the waste level in the holding tank rises above a certain level, the alarm panel should alert the homeowner that the pump is experiencing problems. The alarm panel should have both a buzzer and an indicator light. The holding tank, likely constructed of fiberglass, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or fiberglass-reinforced polyester (FRP), has an inlet opening and a discharge opening. The pipes from the home are connected to the inlet; the pipe that leads to the sewer main is connected to the discharge. Often, more than one home or restroom (in a park, for example) can be connected to one grinder pump station. In this case, more than one inlet can be installed. It is a good idea to consult the manufacturer or factory representative before purchasing a grinder pump station to ensure that more than one inlet hole can be drilled. The tank has a lid made from heavy-duty plastic or metal that is bolted and/or padlocked shut to prevent entry by unauthorized persons.  Maintenance  Grinder pumps should not require preventive maintenance. However, grinder pumps that use floats to sense the level in the holding tank are prone to grease buildup that may turn the pump on unnecessarily, or not turn on the pump at all, causing the tank to fill up and sewage to possibly back up into the home or yard. To prevent this, grinder pumps that use float switches to sense the level in the tank are often hosed down to remove the grease from the floats. Homeowners are not usually limited by what they can or can not pour down their drains because their home has a grinder pump. Feminine hygiene products, diapers, kitty litter, paint, oil (both motor oil and cooking oils), etc. should not be flushed or poured down any drain, whether the home is connected to a gravity sewer system, septic tank, grinder pump or cesspool. Disposable wipes that are made by cleaning companies for personal use, cleaning toilets, etc. are causing problems in communities around the United States. Not only do people clog their household plumbing, they are causing problems with household grinder pumps, lift stations, and sewage treatment plants. Some wipe companies say \\"flush one at a time,\\" some say \\"not for pump systems,\\" some say \\"safe for sewers.\\" As recommended by Consumer Reports, wipes should be put into a garbage can instead of the toilet. The National Association of Clean Water Agencies has compiled a list of articles and municipal documents regarding wipes. In large sewage pump stations, clogging problems are often avoided by installing a chopper pump in the tank. A chopper pump is able to handle larger/tougher solids than a residential grinder pump, including hair balls, diapers, sanitary napkins, clothing, etc.  See also  *Sewage pumping *Sewer system *Macerator pump References Additional Links * Submersible Wastewater Pump Association * The National Association of Clean Water Agencies - Flushable Wipes and Other Non-Dispersible Products * Grinder Pump Frequently Asked Questions Category:Waste treatment technology ","title":"Grinder pump"},{"id":"2529731","text":"Zepler doubling is a manoeuvre in chess in which a piece moves along a certain line (rank, file or diagonal), then another friendly piece moves onto that same line, then the first piece moves again in the same direction as before.

It is an overview of Bruce Wayne's early life, including his parents' murder, his time spent traveling and training throughout the world, and his return to Gotham City to become Batman.  Publication history  The comic was initially published as the only original story in the Secret Origins trade paperback collection. It was later included in the 2007 trade paperback, Batman: Secrets of the Batcave.DC Comics: Batman: Secrets of the Batcave TPB. Retrieved on 31 March 2014. Plot \\"The Man Who Falls\\" consists of a series of concentrated retellings of previously published Batman stories, including Detective Comics #33, which includes Gardner Fox and Bob Kane's first version of Batman's origin. O'Neil's story begins with a young Bruce Wayne falling down a hole on the grounds of Wayne Manor. Bats begin to swarm towards him and out the hole. Bruce's father, Dr. Thomas Wayne, rescues Bruce but chastises him for his carelessness, while Bruce's mother, Martha Wayne, comforts him. When Bruce asks if he was in Hell, she reassures him it \\"was just some old cave.\\" The story then cuts to the murder of Bruce's parents and him kneeling at their dead bodies. The layouts of this version of the Waynes' murder is designed to resemble Frank Miller's Batman: Year One. At the age of 14, Bruce leaves Gotham City to explore and obtain skills in martial arts and forensics. Scenes of his early training as a teenager are depicted, including experiences with college, and a disillusioning experience in working with the FBI upon turning 20. He realizes that to achieve justice the way he sees fit, he cannot work \\"within a system.\\" The story next turns to Bruce's foreign travels, one extended scene depicts Bruce's time training at a monastery, hidden in a mountainous region of Korea. After nearly a year of training, Master Kirigi tells Bruce he has exceptional intelligence and physique, but his traumatic past has made him self-destructive. Bruce Wayne leaves Korea and heads to France, where O'Neil summarizes events from Sam Hamm's Batman: Blind Justice. Bruce trains with a bounty hunter named Henri Ducard, who shows him \\"the uses of brutality, deception [and] cunning.\\" When Ducard kills a fugitive he had been tracking one night, Bruce abandons his training, disgusted. The narration explains that Bruce meets and learns from every great detective in the world, when he approaches Willie Doggett. Summarizing events from O'Neil's own Legends of the Dark Knight story, \\"Shaman,\\" Bruce (now 23) and Doggett track down a man named Tom Woodley to a mountain ledge, where Woodley shoots and kills Doggett. Woodley himself falls from a precipice. Bruce, without food or warmth, wanders the snowy mountains. After falling unconscious, he is rescued by a Native American shaman. When Bruce awakens, the old man tells Bruce he has the mark of the bat, an animal sacred in his tribe. Bruce returns to Gotham to begin his crime-fighting career. O'Neil again recounts events from Year One: Bruce's first night out, fighting street thugs while still uncostumed, is deemed a failure. While brooding in the library of Wayne Manor that night, a bat crashes through the study window. Modeling himself after the recurring images of bats, Bruce creates his costumed identity: the Batman. Continuity \\"The Man Who Falls\\" uses parts of Year One, Blind Justice, and the first arc of Legends of the Dark Knight (Shaman) as part of the story. All these make up the training and first months of Batman's career. Later stories by Matt Wagner, Batman and the Monster Men and Batman and the Mad Monk, depict the emergence of Batman as a major presence in Gotham. Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's maxi-series Batman: The Long Halloween and Batman: Dark Victory depict the latter part of Year Two and part of Year Three (Long Halloween), and conclude the character arcs with Dark Victory during the \\"Year Four\\" time frame. In other media * \\"The Man Who Falls\\" storyline served as an influence for Christopher Nolan's 2005 film Batman Begins. While playing at Wayne Manor, a young Bruce Wayne falls down a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats. He is eventually rescued by his father. After his parents‚Äô murders, Bruce decides to leave Gotham and spends his young adult years travelling to foreign countries. He is later trained by a martial arts expert at a monastery located in the mountains of Korea. At one point, Bruce is trained by a man named Henri Ducard. Bruce abandons Ducard when he encourages Bruce to take the law into his own hands by killing criminals. After several years, Bruce returns to Gotham and starts his crime-fighting career as Batman. In this version however, Henri Ducard is revealed to be an alter-ego of Ra's al Ghul. * A small portion of \\"The Man Who Falls\\" storyline was used for the prologue of Zach Snyder's 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. During his parents funeral at Wayne Manor, Bruce Wayne runs into the nearby woods and accidentally falls into a dry well. While being swarmed by bats, Bruce recognizes the bats to be an omen and dramatically elevates off the ground.

They live primarily in the city of Mumbai (Bombay), with smaller populations in portions of Raigad (Chaul), Palghar (Bassein)& Thane (Thana) districts of Konkan, in the Indian state of Maharashtra.  History  = Pre-Portuguese era = The Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani, who was Catalan or Occitan (southern French), began evangelizing in Sopara, Thana and north Konkan in 1323. Sopara was an ancient port and an international trading center.Thana District Gazetteer Part ‚Äì I: Population:Christians-History Most Indian church history was lost between the ninth and fourteenth centuries as Persia converted to Nestorianism in 800 AD. Since church offices and public worship was dependent on a foreign source, when the foreign aid was withdrawn Indians became nominal Christians. = Portuguese era = The Portuguese came to India in 1498, and their policy was to return the Indian Christians to Roman Catholicism. Although Brahmins and other high-status Hindus who were ceremoniously converted by the Portuguese were treated with honor and distinction, groups engaged in agriculture, fishing and other rural occupations handed down by their ancestors received neither secular nor religious education. Among the Portuguese converts were a number of descendants of the Christian community reportedly founded by Apostle St. Bartholomew, whom the Portuguese molded into a community sometimes known as \\"Portuguese Christians\\". The Franciscans spearheaded the evangelization of the \\"Province of the North\\" (Prov√≠ncia do Norte). From 1534 to 1552 a priest, Ant√≥nio do Porto, converted over 10,000 people, built a dozen churches and founded a number of orphanages and monasteries. Prominent among the converts were two yogis from the Kanheri Caves who became known as Paulo Raposo and Francisco de Santa Maria. They introduced Christianity to their fellow yogis, converting many in the process. Another notable convert during this period was the Brahmin astrologer Parashuram Joshi, who was baptized on 8 September 1565 with the name Henrique da Cunha. Joshi was followed by 250 Hindus, including over 50 Brahmins. In Salsette, the priest Manuel Gomes converted over 6,000 Hindus in Bandra and was known as the Apostle of Salsette. In 1573, 1,600 people were converted. Beginning in 1548, Jesuits in Bassein (Ba√ßaim) and Bandra converted many upper-class Indians; Bassein Cathedral recorded 9,400 baptisms. The Jesuit superior Gon√ßalo Rodrigues baptized between 5,000 and 6,000 people in Thane (Tana), many of whom were orphans or the young children of lower-caste Hindus who were sold by their parents. By the end of the 16th century the Roman Catholic population of the Portuguese Province of the North was 10,000 to 15,000, centered mainly in and around Bassein. = British and modern eras = Changes occurred under British rule. On 11 May 1661, the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza‚ÄîCatarina de Bragan√ßa, daughter of King Jo√£o IV of Portugal‚Äîmade Bombay part of the British Empire as intended since the British takeover of Surat (allegedly as part of Catherine's dowry to Charles). A weakened Portugal, no longer part of the Crown of Spain, had to oblige. Nevertheless, parts of present-day Mumbai (such as Bandra, Thane and Vasai) remained Portuguese well into the first third of the 18th century. Since the early days of the East India Company, there were no other Indian Christians in the North Konkan except the East Indian Catholics. Employment intended for Christians was monopolized by the East Indians. With railways and steamships came immigrants from Goa who were also known as Portuguese Christians. The British adopted a designation which would distinguish the Christians of North Konkan (who were British subjects) from the Goan Catholics, who were Portuguese subjects (the Mangalorean Catholics were no longer Portuguese subjects). For Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, the Christians of North Konkan changed their name from \\"Portuguese Christians\\" to \\"East Indian\\" to impress on the British government of Bombay that they were the earliest Roman Catholic subjects of the British Crown in that part of India and were entitled to certain natural rights and privileges compared with the immigrants. The Bombay East Indian Association was founded on 26 May 1887 to advance the education, employment, rights and economic development of the East Indians. P. F. Gomes, who was knighted by Pope Leo XIII in 1888, was its first president and J. L. Britto its first sSecretary. D. G. Almeida donated to establish an education fund. During the 1960s, the Archdiocese of Bombay estimated that there were 92,000 East Indians in Bombay: 76,000 in suburban Bombay and 16,000 in the city. In September 2014, local non-governmental organizations such as the Watchdog Foundation, Mobai Gaothan Panchayat, the Bombay East India Association, Vakola Advanced Locality Management, Kalina Civic Forum and the Kolovery Welfare Association formed the Maharashtra Swaraj Party (MSP). The party, which represents the East Indian community, was expected to support five candidates from Mumbai's suburbs in the 13th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections.  Architecture  A typical Koli house consists of a veranda (oli), used for repairing nets and receiving visitors; a sitting-room (angan), used by women for household work; a kitchen, a central apartment, a bedroom, a devotional room (devaghar) and a detached bathroom.  Language and literature  East Indian Catholics speak a dialect of Marathi, which they retained despite Portuguese influence. The Marathi language is central to the community's identity. The author of Trans. Bomb. Geog. Soc., 1836‚Äì38, Vol. I. mentions the dialect of Marathi spoken by the East Indians of Salsette, Mahim, Matunga and Mazagon, similar to the language spoken by the Kulbis, Kolis, Bhandaris, Palshes, Pathare Prabhus, Somvanshi Kshatriya Pathares (Panchkalshis), Kuparis and Vadvals; this may have been Konkani. Some East Indian upper-class families in the Khatri ward of Thane speak Portuguese. 110 Portuguese lexical items are found in Marathi.  Traditions and festivals  Although the East Indians have preserved their pre-Christian Marathi culture and traditions, many Portuguese influences have been absorbed.  Dress  East Indian ladies of Chimbai village performing at Bandra Gymkhana Traditional dress for women is the lugra. For men, traditional wear consists of khaki shorts and a white banian. A Koli Christian bridegroom usually wears an older Portuguese admiral's uniform, which is preserved and lent out for such occasions. East Indian women wore a blouse and cotton lugra, with the back pleats tucked into the waist; women did not use the upper portion of the sari (covering the head and breast) until they were married. This mode of wearing the sari is known as sakacch nesane. Gol nesane, a cylindrical style, is popular with young girls and women.  Cultural groups  Meet the East Indians of Mumbai There are five East Indian cultural groups: Kulbis, Samavedi Christians (commonly called Kuparis), Koli Christians, Wadvals and Salsette Christians. as the east Indian working employe were in small numbers they joined all those above to distinguish themselves from, Mangaloreans, and goans, all converted to Roman Catholic in Bombay were called East Indians till today as five East Indian cultural groups: Kulbis, Samavedi Christians (commonly called Kuparis), Koli Christians, Wadvals and Salsette Christians.  Film industry  The film Tu Maza Jeev, in the East Indian language, was released on Maharashtra Day in 2009.  Singing competition  Jacinto at an East Indian singing competition in Mumbai East Indians organise singing competitions in their own language. The competition is primarily held in the evening of important village occasions; for example, Kurla has an annual competition on the eve of the phool dongri feast in May at Holy Cross Church.

As required by law, these funds are fully segregated from the company's general investment funds, hence the name. A segregated fund is analogous to the U.S. insurance industry \\"separate account\\" and related insurance and annuity products. Usage A segregated fund is an investment fund that combines the growth potential of a mutual fund with the security of a life insurance policy. Segregated funds are often referred to as \\"mutual funds with an insurance policy wrapper\\". Like mutual funds, segregated funds consist of a pool of investments in securities such as bonds, debentures, and stocks. The value of the segregated fund fluctuates according to the market value of the underlying securities. Segregated funds do not issue units or shares; therefore, a segregated fund investor is not referred to as a unitholder. Instead, the investor is the holder of a segregated fund contract. Contracts can be registered (held inside an RRSP or TFSA) or non-registered (not held inside an RRSP or TFSA). Registered investments qualify for annual tax-sheltered RRSP or TFSA contributions. Non- registered investments are subject to tax payments on the capital gains each year and capital losses can also be claimed. Features =Insurance Contracts= Segregated funds are sold as deferred variable annuity contracts and can be sold only by licensed insurance representatives. Segregated funds are owned by the life insurance company, not the individual investors, and must be kept separate (or \\"segregated\\") from the company‚Äôs other assets. Segregated funds are made up of underlying assets that are purchased via the Life assurance companies. Investors do not have ownership share. Segregated Funds have guarantees and run for a period. Should the investor leave before the end date, he/she may be penalized. =Maturity dates= All segregated fund contracts have maturity dates, which are not to be confused with maturity guarantees (outlined below). The maturity date is the date at which the maturity guarantee is available to the contract holder. Holding periods to reach maturity are usually 10 or more years. =Maturity & death guarantees= Guarantee amounts are offered in all segregated funds whereby no less than a certain percentage of the initial investment in a contract (usually 75% or higher) will be paid out at death or contract maturity. In either case, the annuitant or their beneficiary will receive the greater of the guarantee or the investment‚Äôs current market value =Potential creditor protection= Granted certain qualifications are met, segregated fund investments may be protected from seizure from creditors. This is an important feature for business owners or professionals whose assets may have a high exposure to creditors. Creditor protection for Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) is generally not available, except in Alberta. =Probate protection= If a beneficiary is named, the segregated fund investment may be exempt from probate and executor‚Äôs fees and pass directly to the beneficiary. If the named beneficiary is a family member (such as a spouse, child, or parent), the investment may also be secure from creditors in case of bankruptcy. These protections apply to both registered and non-registered investments. =Reset option= A reset option allows the contract holder to lock in investment gains if the market value of a segregated fund contract increases. This resets the contract‚Äôs deposit value to equal the greater of the deposit value or current market value, restarts the contract term, and extends the maturity date. Contract holders are limited to a certain number of resets, usually one or two, in a given calendar year. =Cost of the guarantees= The shorter the term of the maturity guarantees on investment funds - whether they are segregated funds or protected mutual funds - the higher the risk exposure of the insurer and the cost of the guarantees. This inverse relationship is based on the premise that there is a greater chance of market decline (and hence a greater chance of collecting on a guarantee) over shorter periods. A contract holder's use of reset provisions also contributes to costs, since resetting the guaranteed amount at a higher level means that the issuer will be liable for this higher amount.

Ramsey Professor (Emeritus) of Managerial Economics, a joint chair held by the Business School and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He was an influential Bayesian decision theorist and pioneer in the field of decision analysis, with works in statistical decision theory, game theory, behavioral decision theory, risk analysis, and negotiation analysis. He helped found and was the first director of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Early life After service in the Army Air Forces during World War II, Raiffa received a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1946, a master's degree in statistics in 1947 and a PhD in mathematics in 1951, all from the University of Michigan. Career *His book Applied Statistical Decision Theory with Robert Schlaifer introduced the idea of conjugate prior distributions. *A lecture of his in the 1960s concerning the use of Bayesian methods for betting on horses gave John Craven USN, a US Navy scientist the idea of using Bayesian methods to search for a missing US Air Force hydrogen bomb lost near Palomares, Spain in the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash. Craven used the same methods again in the search for the lost submarine USS Scorpion in 1968. Raiffa has analysed situations involving the use of subjective probability and argues that subjective probabilities should follow the same rules (the Kolmogorov axioms) as objective, frequency-based probabilities. Consider a situation in which you are required to gamble and are given two possible gambles. Gamble A, in which you bet on the outcome of a fight between the world's greatest boxer and the world's greatest wrestler in a ring fight. (Assume you are fairly ignorant about martial arts and would have great difficulty making a choice of whom to bet on.) If your chosen champion wins you win $500 otherwise you get nothing. You place your choice in a sealed envelope, which is opened after the game. Gamble B. Draw a ball from an opaque urn known to contain 50 orange and 50 blue balls. You will receive $500 if you draw an orange ball and nothing for a blue ball. The balls have been thoroughly mixed and you should assume that all balls are equally likely to be drawn. The draw takes place after the ring match is over. Many people would feel more unsure about taking Gamble A in which the probabilities are unknown, rather than Gamble B, in which the probabilities are easily seen to be one half for each outcome. Raiffa argues that a decision-maker should in fact assign a subjective probability of one- half to each outcome of Gamble A, provided that no information was available that makes one outcome more likely than the other. Raiffa argues as follows. Suppose someone has the following preferences. If forced to take Gamble A they would bet on the boxer, but if given a free choice between the gambles they would prefer Gamble B. Presumably, such a person when allowed to choose Gamble A would prefer to simply bet on the boxer rather than toss a coin to decide the matter of whether they should bet on the boxer or the wrestler. But this randomised approach is equivalent to Gamble B. So, by the axioms of substitutability and transitivity for utilities, they should also prefer to bet on the boxer than on Gamble B. A similar argument can be used to show that when the player has no preference between the boxer and the wrestler he should also have no preference between Gamble A and Gamble B. (The axiom of substitutability says that if someone is indifferent between outcomes A and B and indifferent between outcomes A and C, they should be indifferent between B and C. The axiom of transitivity says that if someone prefers outcome A to B and also prefers B to C, then they should prefer A to C.) Others, such as Daniel Ellsberg disagree with Raiffa's reasoning and have devised alternative interpretations of decision theory. One of the most radical departures is Dempster-Shafer theory, which rejects the use of probability theory completely, in favour of a theory of belief functions, which do not satisfy the axioms of probability.

Hemingfield railway station The Elsecar Heritage Railway currently terminates at Hemingfield, although there is no platform at present, with trains pausing before reversing back to Elsecar. However, a proposed extension of the railway to Cortonwood is well advanced, and a memorandum of understanding has been signed by the railway company and the friends of the colliery, agreeing that an intermediate station will be constructed at Hemingfield.Memorandum of Understanding outlined here A joint development project with the University of Sheffield School of Architecture in autumn 2016 resulted in initial proposals for a station at Hemingfield with the low-level platform connected to the high-level colliery buildings by means of a tall station building incorporating stairs and lifts.Plans may be viewed at this colliery webpage.

They describe themselves as the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK. It employs 300 people at its plant beside Tandragee Castle (called \\"Tayto Castle\\" as part of the advertising for the snacks) and remains the largest selling brand of crisps in Northern Ireland and the third biggest crisp and snack business in the United Kingdom. It owns the Golden Wonder, Ringos, Mr. Porky, Real Crisps, and Jonathan Crisp brands. The Northern Irish Tayto are also sold in many outlets in East Donegal and Inishowen. History Tayto (Northern Ireland) was formed in 1956 by the Hutchinson family and licensed the name and recipes of Tayto Crisps in the Republic of Ireland. The two companies operate entirely separately but have a similar range of products. On 13 January 2006 it was announced that Tayto (NI) was to acquire the Corby and Scunthorpe sites of the former Golden Wonder business and the contract to produce Mini Pringles for Procter & Gamble. This secured some 195 jobs out of 350 that were under threat following Golden Wonder's entry into administration on 9 January 2006. In December 2007, Tayto acquired Sirhowy Valley Foods Ltd, makers of the Real Crisps range. On the 14 March 2008 it was announced that Tayto would acquire Red Mill Snack foods, making it the 3rd largest crisp manufacturer in the UK. Most of the Red Mill brands were transferred under the Golden Wonder umbrella but Mr. Porky's pork scratchings continue to be produced under Tayto, from the plant in Westhoughton, Bolton. On the 21 January 2009 it was announced that Tayto has acquired Jonathan Crisp, the trading name of Natural Crisps Ltd, based in Staffordshire, England. The headquarters of the Tayto group, which is privately owned by the Hutchinson family, are in County Armagh, it now has a turnover of ¬£150 million per annum and employs more than 1,400 people.Irish Times, 21 Jan 2009 Range Like its counterpart in the Republic of Ireland, Tayto's signature brand is Cheese and Onion flavour crisps. They also sell beef & onion, ready salted, smoky bacon, salt & vinegar, worcester sauce, prawn cocktail, spring onion, roast chicken and pickled onion flavoured crisps. Most Northern Irish Tayto are vegetarian-friendly Palm oil usage Tayto NI have a low score on the Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard, which is a measure of the sustainability of palm oil buyers endorsed by the World Wildlife Foundation. Tayto NI scored only 1 point out of 9 in the 2016 Scorecard.

He was drafted by them in the first round of the 1964 NFL Draft. With Taylor, the Redskins made the playoffs five times (1971‚Äì1974, 1976) and reached the Super Bowl once (VII), after the 1972 season. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1984. Early life Born in Grand Prairie, Texas, Taylor was the second of seven children‚Äîfour girls and three boys. He was raised by his mother Myrtle and step father James Stevenson. Myrtle was a domestic, a chef, a butcher, and an owner of a restaurant and Stevenson constructed parts for airplanes. Taylor started playing sports while in junior high school and by the eighth grade he was playing football, baseball, basketball and competing in track. High school career Taylor played high school football at Dalworth High School (the former segregated black high school, now an elementary school by the name of David Daniels. Dalworth High students moved to Grand Prairie High School). He also ran the high hurdles, threw the discus and shot put, and competed in the long jump for the track team. The school did not have a baseball team, but Taylor played baseball in a summer league. He was named All-State in track and football. College career Taylor played college football at Arizona State University in Tempe as a halfback and defensive back. He was selected as an All-American two years in a row and was also selected to the All-Western Athletic Conference team. Following his final season, Taylor played in the East-West Shrine Game, the Hula Bowl, and the All-American Bowl. He also played in the College All-Star Game against the Chicago Bears in August 1964 and was named the Most Valuable Player of the game. In his three seasons at ASU, Taylor gained 1,995 yards from scrimmage and averaged 5.7 yards per carry, while also scoring 25 touchdowns. Taylor also pitched and played third base for the Sun Devils baseball team. However, during baseball practice, he was hit on a knee by a line drive, which ended his baseball career. Taylor was inducted into the Arizona State Sports Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1975. Professional career Taylor was selected by the Washington Redskins as the third overall pick of the 1964 NFL Draft. He was also selected in the AFL draft, taken ninth by the Houston Oilers. Taylor signed with Washington and won the UPI rookie of the year award as a running back, and became the first rookie in 20 years to finish in the NFL's top 10 in both rushing (sixth with 755 yards) and receiving (eighth with 53 catches for 814 yards). His 53 receptions were a record for running backs at that time. Although known as a successful running back, Taylor was switched to wide receiver in 1966 and led the NFL in receiving in both 1966 and 1967. He played that position for the rest of his career and had a record-tying seven seasons with 50 or more receptions. In the season finale in 1975, Taylor passed Don Maynard and became the NFL's all-time receptions leader with his 634th career catch on December 21 against the Philadelphia Eagles. Following Maynard's retirement in 1973, Taylor was the league's active leader in receiving yards for four seasons. He began 1974 with 7,470 yards, then 11th all-time,Career receiving yards, 1973 leaderboard and climbed up to 4th.Career receiving yards, 1977 Taylor retired following the 1977 season as the NFL's all-time leading receiver with 649 receptions, for 9,110 yards and 79 touchdowns. With 1,488 yards rushing and some kick return yardage, he totaled 10,803 combined net yards. With 11 rushing touchdowns and 79 on receptions, Taylor scored 540 points in his career. He earned first- or second-team All-NFL honors six times and was selected to play in eight Pro Bowls. Taylor was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1984 and was selected as one of the 70 Greatest Redskins of all time. In 1999, he was ranked number 85 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Coaching career After retiring, Taylor was hired to work in the Redskins' front office with Bobby Mitchell as a scout. When Joe Gibbs became head coach in 1981, he selected Taylor to be the receivers coach. He served on the coaching staff through 1993 under Richie Petitbon, but was not retained by new head coach Norv Turner in March 1994, ending three decades with the franchise. Personal life Taylor and his wife Patricia have been married since 1965. Taylor lives in Falcons Landing in Potomac Falls, VA. They have three children, Elizabeth, Erica, and Charles, Jr., and three grandchildren, Robyn, Jordyn, and Nathan. He does speaking engagements and serves as a consultant to the Redskins.

The Galway GAA Gaelic football and hurling teams use the stadium for their home games. The stadium, amongst others in the province of Connacht, is also used for games in the Connacht Senior Football Championship History =Early years= The stadium opened on 16 June 1957, as 16,000 people came to watch Galway beat Tipperary in hurling, and Kerry in football, and to watch Bishop Michael Browne bless the facility. The stadium was opened by GAA President, S√©amus McFerran. Among those invited were the 12 surviving members of the 1923 all-Ireland winning hurling team. The area on which the stadium was built was known locally as The Boggers. The site was offered to the Gaelic Athletic Association by the town secretary Sean Gillan, and terms of purchase were negotiated. Much of the land was very wet and boggy. Work was being carried out to deepen the River Corrib at the time, so the infill from the river was used to fill in parts of the pitch and give it an elevated sideline. Pearse Stadium hosted many hurling and football matches since, but it fell into disuse in the early 1990s. =Re-opening= The Stadium was renovated in 2002 and reopened in May 2003 with a capacity then set at 34,000. Since the major redevelopment of the ground, it has regularly hosted the Connacht Senior Football Championship final in recent years. In 2006 the International Series versus Australia was played in Pearse Stadium which was the first time it took place outside GAA Headquarters Croke Park. On 21 June 2008, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for Back Home Tour supporting their album Back Home.Pop singer Ed sheeran also held a concert in Pearse stadium on may the 12th 2018 and an additional stand was made so the stadium could host 60,000 fans. Parking and safety The Stadium occasionally receives negative publicity due to the lack of dedicated off-street parking. In response to repeated representations made by local residents as well as community groups campaigning on pedestrian rights and road safety issues, the Garda Siochana handed out large numbers of parking tickets on at least two occasions in October 2010. Some GAA fans saw this as harsh, and one disgruntled supporter even described the Fixed Charge Penalties issued to illegally parked vehicles as a \\"blatant attack\\" on the GAA itselfGalway City Tribune, \\"Parking tickets 'an anti-GAA vendetta'\\", Letters to the Editor, 22 October. However, both the GAA County Board and the Garda Siochana were adamant that they had issued repeated warnings in advance and insisted that illegally parked vehicles were ticketed after these warnings were ignored. A nationwide health and safety survey of GAA grounds in 2011 resulted in the certified capacity of the stadium being reduced to 26,197.

Reagan's team had somehow acquired President Jimmy Carter's briefing papers, classified top secret, that Carter used in preparation for the October 28, 1980, debate with Reagan. The briefing papers were never specified to be either vital strategy memos or just routine position papers. This leak of campaign papers was not divulged to the public until late June 1983, after Laurence Barrett published Gambling With History: Reagan in the White House, an in-depth account of the Reagan administration's first two years. 1980 presidential debate The League of Women Voters organized two debates of the 1980 U.S. presidential election The Republican nominee Ronald Reagan participated in both debates. Independent candidate John B. Anderson only participated in the first debate, while the Democratic nominee and incumbent President Jimmy Carter only participated in the second debate. The first debate took place on September 21, 1980, and the second debate took place on October 28, 1980. Key aides involved in the second Reagan debate preparation were James Baker, David Gergen, and David Stockman. They had access to briefing papers from the Carter campaign.Morton Kondracke, The New Republic, 18 July 1983, Debategate The importance of these documents is still in question. At the time the second debate took place, Reagan was ahead in the polls 43 to 37 with 11 percent undecided. The stakes were high for this debate, especially since Carter had the possibility of an October surprise, such as the release of the hostages in Iran. House Speaker Tip O'Neill said that the debate ultimately did not affect the outcome of the election, arguing that an unpopular Carter would have lost even if he had been seen to \\"win\\" the debate. Investigation The leak of the campaign papers first came to public attention in June 1983, with the publication of Laurence Barrett's Gambling With History: Reagan in the White House, an in-depth account of the Reagan administration's first two years. Comments on the matter by David Stockman, made at an Optimist Club lunch in Cassopolis, Michigan, on the day of the debate, noted that in assisting with Reagan's preparations, Stockman had had access to a \\"pilfered\\" copy of Carter's briefing book; these remarks had been reported only in local newspapers.Steven F. Hayward (2009), The Age of Reagan: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order: 1964-1980, Random House, John Eby, 6 February 2011, John Eby: Talking like trying to corral soap bubbles The publication of Barrett's book saw efforts by Jody Powell and Patrick Caddell to push the issue onto the press agenda, ultimately leading to Reagan asking the Justice Department to \\"monitor\\" the issue. The president denied having any knowledge about briefing papers his campaign was thought to have obtained. An investigation was then launched by the U.S. House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service's Subcommittee on Human Resources under the chairmanship of Donald J. Albosta (D-MI). This produced a 2,400-page report in May 1984.Julia Malone, Christian Science Monitor, 24 May 1984, New 'Debategate' report sharpens focus on Casey links James Baker swore under oath that he had received the briefing book from William Casey, Reagan's campaign manager, but Casey, then campaign manager, later CIA director, vehemently denied this. David Stockman, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, admitted using the Carter material while helping Reagan prepare for the debate. Stockman said the documents obtained were just position papers, not in question-and-answer format. Frank Hodsoll, also a member of the debate team, said that they were in Q&A; form. The investigation turned up hundreds of pages of documents from the Carter campaign in Stockman's files as well as in Reagan's campaign archives at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. One document, an itinerary for Carter during the week prior to Election Day, had \\"report from White House mole\\" written on it. This seemed to confirm author Laurence Barrett's conclusion in his book that the material had been stolen. But U.S. News & World Report indicated that the document in question had been volunteered by someone working for Carter. Other papers were turned in to The Washington Post by a collector of political memorabilia who, in October 1980, had exhumed them from a dumpster behind Reagan headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. The press speculated that the Reagan campaign had been concerned that Carter would pull an October surprise during the campaign‚Äîcutting a deal with the Ayatollah Khomeini for the release of the 52 hostages held for over a year by Iran, a bombshell that some believed might have sent Carter back to the White House for four more years. Newsweek wondered whether a clandestine operation involving ex-CIA agents had been undertaken by the Reagan team to keep close tabs on the Carter campaign. This was confirmed by Time in its July 25, 1983, issue. According to that report, William Casey brought in former agents of both the CIA and the FBI to gather information from colleagues who were still with that agency. Jimmy Carter complained that the pilfered documents revealed the \\"essence\\" of his campaign, implying that his reelection bid had been done great harm when they fell into Republican hands.Manning, Jason. \\"Eighties Club: Debategate\\" http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id293.htm The matter was never resolved as both the FBI and a congressional subcommittee reporting in May 1984 failed to determine how or through whom the briefing book came to the Reagan campaign.\\"Reagan Assures Casey He Can Stay as CIA Chief in New Term?\\", The Washington Post, September 11, 1984. The Justice Department, in closing its investigation, cited \\"the professed lack of memory or knowledge on the part of those in possession of the documents\\". Still, it said the contradictions between Reagan aides like Baker and Casey \\"could be explained by differences in recollection or interpretation\\".\\"Campaign Papers Remain a Mystery\\", The New York Times, June 18, 1984. In a case brought by John F. Banzhaf III, an order by a federal judge that the Justice Department appoint a special prosecutor was overturned on appeal in July 1984.Time, 9 July 1984, Decision: The Debategate Probe FizzlesBanzhaf v. Smith, 588 F. Supp. 1489 & 1498, rev'd on other grounds, 737 F.2d 1167 (DC Cir. 1984). - PROF. JOHN BANZHAF'S BACKGROUND IN ANTISMOKING The New York Times reported the Reagan campaign headquarters conducted a data-gathering operation to collect inside information on Carter foreign policy and used a number of former CIA officials in the effort. It said Stefan Halper, a campaign aide who handled communications for Bush and provided news updates and policy ideas to the traveling Reagan party, was in charge of the operation. Halper called the report \\"just absolutely untrue\\". Aftermath In 2004 and again in 2005, Carter accused columnist George Will of giving the briefing book to the Reagan campaign.Fresh Air, October 21, 2004; The Alabama Plainsman, July 28, 2005. In a 2005 syndicated column, Will called his role in Reagan's debate preparation \\"inappropriate\\", given his position as a columnist, but denied any role in stealing the briefing book. In his column, Will quoted from a letter he had written to Carter privately: \\"My cursory glance at it convinced me that it was a crashing bore and next to useless‚Äîfor you [Carter], or for anyone else\\". In response to Will's column, Carter wrote a letter to The Washington Post retracting his accusations. Carter apologized to Will for \\"any incorrect statement that I have ever made about his role in the use of my briefing book.... I have never thought Mr. Will took my book, that the outcome of the debate was damaging to my campaign or that Mr. Will apologized to me\\". In his 2009 campaign examination Rendezvous with Destiny, Reagan biographer and historian Craig Shirley wrote that the briefing papers were passed to Casey by Paul Corbin, an aide from Ted Kennedy's failed primary campaign. According to the book, the Kennedy family and campaign workers were embittered by Carter's treatment of Kennedy's challenge in the 1980 Democratic primary, and Corbin used connections in the White House to steal the papers in revenge. Shirley also contended that the contents of the briefing book were a compilation of Reagan's earlier speeches. Shirley concluded that the theft had no effect on the race, even though Carter continued to blame his defeat on the stolen papers.Craig Shirley, Politico, 15 October 2009, \\"New Book Pins 'debategate' on Democrat See also *Killing Reagan (film) *Full Text of the Albosta Report: Part , Part * List of scandals with \\"-gate\\" suffix  References   External links  *U.S. House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, \\"Unauthorized transfers of nonpublic information during the 1980 presidential election\\", US GPO, 17 May 1984 (both parts) *The Eighties Club on Debategate *\\"Public Papers of the Presidents.\\" National Archives and Records Administration.

The task of the Board is to give guidelines to the Executive Committee, workers and volunteers in planning the activities (approving annually the action plan and budget) and to counsel workers of the Fund in treating various issues. Members of the Board work on the voluntary basis. Members of Executive Board in 2018: Tarmo T√º√ºr, Siim Kuresoo, Kadri Kalmus, Silvia Lotman and K√§rt Vaarmari Achievements After the restoration of independence of Estonia in 1991 a political decision was taken to restitute properties including land to the former owners or their descendants. Since it is much easier to form new protected areas when the land is owned by the state, ELF took quick action to safeguard the future of valuable areas by proposing the establishment of new big protected areas and natural parks. This led to the formation of Soomaa and Karula national parks and Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve. The area of these taken together is about 740 sq kilometres. During the following years, ELF has played a significant role in the establishment of tens of other smaller protected areas in Estonia. ELF has carried on inventories of valuable habitats - wetlands, old-growth forests and meadows and participates in designing the Natura 2000 network of protected areas. In recent years ELF has more and more activities dedicated to environmental education, public awareness and public participation in environmental decisions and activities.

He was prime minister of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg from 1848 to 1849.  Life  Born at Altenburg, Hans Conon von der Gabelentz studied finance, law and oriental languages at Leipzig University and the University of G√∂ttingen. He entered the civil service in Saxe-Altenburg in 1830 and was promoted to parliamentary and government councillor in 1831. As the Landmarschall (Country Marshal) in the Grand Duchy of Weimar since 1847, he was present at the preliminary parliament for Frankfurt and then became one of the for the Saxon Duchies. Later, he was interim parliamentary envoy until the dissolution of the parliament in July 1848. At the end of November, 1848, he was named Prime Minister of the Duchy of Altenburg and resigned in August 1849. In 1850, he went to the parliament in Erfurt as a member of the Staatenhaus. In 1851, the Landschaft of Saxe-Altenburg elected him President. Gabelentz died on 3 September 1874 at his family home at Lemnitz, near Triptis. His son Georg von der Gabelentz also became a famous sinologist.  Work  The fruits of his many years of study are his El√©ments de la grammaire mandchoue (Altenburg 1833). In the Zeitschrift f√ºr die Kunde des Morgenlandes (Journal for Oriental Study), which he co-founded. He provided essays about Mongolian and then with Julius Loebe published a new critical edition of Ulfilas' Gothic translation of the Bible, together with grammar, a Greek-Gothic dictionary and a Latin translation (Leipzig 1843, two volumes). He later devoted himself to the Finnish language family, as Germany was working on rational principles for the German language at that time. He published a Mordvin grammar in Vol. 2 of his Journal, Vergleichung der beiden tscheremissischen Dialekte (Comparison of the Two Mari Dialects) in Vol. 4, and Grundz√ºge der syrj√§nischen Grammatik (Essentials of Permic Grammar) soon afterwards (Altenburg 1841).

It first aired on Fox in the United States on March 28, 2000. Candice Bergen and Faith Ford guest starred as Gloria Ironbox and Sarah Bennett, respectively. This episode is included in the Freakin' Sweet Collection. The fact that this episode was first broadcast on the same day as the previous episode \\"The King Is Dead\\" caused series creator Seth MacFarlane to become concerned the show was soon to be canceled. Plot Peter and the neighbors are notified by mail that they will receive free boats if they attend a timeshare sales pitch. However, during a high- pressure sales interview, Peter trades the boat for a mystery box, which turns out to contain tickets for a comedy club. At the club, Peter becomes drunk and attempts to tell jokes on stage. Before his brief performance, during which he mostly abuses the audience, he puts his beer bottle without the lid on in his pocket, which spills down his trousers, making it look like he wet himself. The audience, amused that Peter looks like he peed himself, laughs hysterically, making a drunk Peter to believe they liked his jokes. This leads Peter to believe his humor could be a hit. Continuing his hubris, Peter tells a sexist joke at his job at the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory that offends female co-worker Sarah Bennett who sues Peter and the factory for sexual harassment. Her lawyer, Gloria Ironbox, offers to drop the charges if Peter goes to a sensitivity-training program. But after he squeezes Gloria's breast which proves that the program has had no effect, he's further sent on a women's retreat, where he continues to make insensitive comments until he endures pain comparable to childbirth: taking his bottom lip and stretching it behind his head. By the time he returns home, he has become very effeminate. At first, Lois appreciates Peter's new sensitive nature, but she is soon tired of him spending more time in front of the mirror, doing pregnancy tests and scolding Lois for slavishly attending to her husband. She appeals to Peter's friends for help, even going to Glenn Quagmire's house to confess that the \\"new\\" Peter is not meeting all her needs. Meanwhile, the other guys try to bring Peter back to normal by bringing him among his \\"fellow men.\\" Cleveland takes Peter to a black convention (a nod to the Million Man March) where Peter blames the assemblage for all the crime and problems and chides them that they should be ashamed for ruining society; they mistakenly believe he is a racist and chase him through the streets. But when Peter and Lois attend a women's gala, Gloria insults Lois by saying that her current lifestyle is the reason for Peter's former disrespect for women. Lois reminds her that she is a woman and that she chooses to be a mother and housewife. When Gloria says Lois' children must be \\"screwed up,\\" Lois furiously punches her and they both get into a clothes- shredding catfight which turns Peter on. After Lois pins Gloria to the floor, Peter pulls Lois out and rushes her home to have sex. When they finish, Lois comments on how wonderful it was. Her voice startles Peter as he has already forgotten that she is still there, but since she is, he asks her to make him a sandwich. This pleases Lois because it means he is back to his old self. Reception In his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of IGN, rating the episode an 8.5/10, stated that the episode is \\"cleverly written\\" and features \\"a couple of the best scenes in the entire series\\". However, he noted that \\"the over- the-top satire might not hit the right chords with everyone\\". Lawsuit In July 2013, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario dismissed a frivolous and vexatious complaint filed under the name \\"Gloria Ironbox.\\" The complaint was dismissed largely because the tribunal quickly learned that the name was the same of that of a parody feminist character in this episode. The complaint attacked the \\"heteronormative\\" and \\"phallocentric\\" nature of the A&W; Burger Family. The complainant sought $50,000 in damages and an order requiring A&W; to adopt product names which better represented the \\"LGBTQ2S\\" community. One suggested product was the \\"Pillow Biter\\", described by Ironbox as \\"a large and thick dark wiener stuffed firmly between two, white, clenched buns.\\" The Tribunal found the complaint \\"outrageous\\", \\"frivolous and vexatious\\" and \\"an abuse of process.\\"http://metronews.ca/news/toronto/749321/human-rights- tribunal-tosses-case-by-fake-family-guy-feminist-gloria-dawn-ironbox/ References External links  Category:Family Guy (season 2) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes ","title":"I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar"},{"id":"2529895","text":"The Forward Scattering Alignment (FSA) is a coordinate system used in coherent electromagnetic scattering.

The genre features a distinctive record production style, drum machine-backed rhythms, pitch corrected vocals, and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences are becoming an increasing trend and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B; vocalists are often known for their use of melisma, popularized by vocalists such as Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Beyonc√©. As of late, contemporary R&B; rhythms are being combined with elements of hip hop and pop music. History Contemporary R&B; originated at the end of the disco era in the late-1970s, when Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones added more electronic elements to the sound of the time to create a smoother dancefloor-friendly sound. The first result was \\"Off the Wall\\" (1979), which‚Äîaccording to Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic‚Äî\\"was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus\\" and \\"was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk\\". Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson's \\"Control\\" (1986) was \\"important to the development of R&B; for a number of reasons\\", as she and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, \\"crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.\\" Ripani wrote that \\"the success of \\"Control\\" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development.\\" That same year, Teddy Riley began producing R&B; recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B; style and hip hop rhythms was termed \\"new jack swing\\" and was applied to artists such as Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown and Bell Biv DeVoe. 1990s R. Kelly was listed in 2010 by Billboard the most successful R&B; artist of the past 25 years. He is also referred to as the \\"King of R&B;\\". In contrast to the works of Boyz II Men, Babyface and similar artists, other R&B; artists and groups from this same period began adding even more of a hip-hop sound to their work, like the innovative group Jodeci. The synthesizer-heavy rhythm tracks of new jack swing were replaced by grittier East Coast hip hop-inspired backing tracks, resulting in a genre labeled \\"hip hop soul\\" by Mary J. Blige and producer Sean Combs who also had mentored group Jodeci in the beginning and helped them with their unique look. The style became less popular by the end of the 1990s, but later experienced a resurgence. In 1990, Mariah Carey released \\"Vision of Love\\" as her debut single. It was immensely popular peaking at number 1 in many worldwide charts including the Billboard Hot 100, and it propelled Mariah's career. The song is usually said to have popularized the use of melisma and brought it into mainstream R&B.; During the mid-1990s, Whitney Houston's \\"The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album\\" sold over 40 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling soundtrack of all time. Janet Jackson's self-titled fifth studio album \\"janet.\\" (1993), which came after her historic multimillion-dollar contract with Virgin Records, sold over twenty million copies worldwide. Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey recorded several Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, including \\"One Sweet Day\\", a collaboration between both acts, which became the longest-running No. 1 hit in Hot 100 history. Carey also released a remix of her 1995 single \\"Fantasy\\", with Ol' Dirty Bastard as a feature, a collaboration format that was unheard of at this point. Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995‚Äî\\"Daydream\\", \\"II\\" and \\"CrazySexyCool\\". In the late 1990s, neo soul, which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and Maxwell. Hill and Missy Elliott further blurred the line between R&B; and hip hop by recording both styles. Beginning in 1995, the Grammy Awards enacted the Grammy Award for Best R&B; Album, with \\"II\\" by Boyz II Men becoming the first recipient. The award was later received by TLC for \\"CrazySexyCool\\" in 1996, Tony Rich for \\"Words\\" in 1997, Erykah Badu for \\"Baduizm\\" in 1998 and Lauryn Hill for \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" in 1999. At the end of 1999, Billboard magazine ranked Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson as the first and second most successful artists of the 1990s. Simultaneously, in the second half of the 1990s, The Neptunes and Timbaland set influential precedence on contemporary R&B; and hip hop music. R&B; acts such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey are some of the best-selling music artists of all time. 2000s Usher was cited by Billboard as the no. 1 Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade, with 7 number-one singles that accumulated 42 weeks at the top. Following periods of fluctuating success, urban music attained commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&B; and hip hop artists. Alicia Keys ranked fifth on Billboard Artist of the Decade list. \\"No One\\" ranks No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs of the decade. In 2001, Alicia Keys released \\"Fallin'\\" as her debut single. It peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Mainstream Top 40 and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs charts. It won three Grammy Awards in 2002, including Song of the Year, Best R&B; Song, and Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance. It was also nominated for Record of the Year. Beyonc√©'s solo studio debut album Dangerously in Love (2003) has sold over 5million copies in the United States and earned five Grammy Awards. Usher's \\"Confessions\\" (2004) sold 1.1million copies in its first week and over 8million copies in 2004, since then it has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2016, has sold over 10million copies in the US and over 20million copies worldwide. \\"Confessions\\" had four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one singles‚Äî\\"Yeah!\\", \\"Burn\\", \\"Confessions Part II\\" and \\"My Boo\\". It won three Grammy Awards in 2005, including Best Contemporary R&B; Album, Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \\"My Boo\\" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \\"Yeah!\\" Beyonc√© was named by Billboard the most successful female act of the 2000s. In 2004, all 12 songs that topped Billboard Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number- one R&B; hits that year. Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&B; charts were topped by Outkast's \\"Hey Ya!\\", Snoop Dogg's \\"Drop It Like It's Hot\\", Terror Squad's \\"Lean Back\\" and Ciara's \\"Goodies\\". Chris Molanphy of The Village Voice later remarked that \\"by the early 2000s, urban music \\"was\\" pop music.\\" Between 2005 and 2009 Raymond, Knowles and Keys released albums‚Äî\\"B'Day\\", \\"Here I Stand\\", \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\" and \\"The Element of Freedom\\". Mariah Carey's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" (2005) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and earned ten Grammy Award nominations. Second single \\"We Belong Together\\" topped the Hot 100 charts for 14 weeks, and was later hailed \\"song of the decade\\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance in 2006. The mid-2000s came with the emergence of new R&B; acts Ashanti, Keyshia Cole and Akon. Ashanti's eponymous debut album topped both US Billboard 200 and Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It earned her three Grammy nominations winning one for the Best Contemporary R&B; Album. R&B; newcomer Chris Brown released his self-titled album in 2005 which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. His debut single \\"Run It!\\" peaked on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs and the US Radio Songs. During this time also came the emergence of R&B; songwriters. Bryan-Michael Cox co-wrote Usher's \\"Burn\\" and \\"Confessions Part II\\" (2005), Mariah Carey's \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" (2006), and Chris Brown's \\"Say Goodbye\\" (2006). Keri Hilson would co-write songs Mary J. Blige's \\"Take Me as I Am\\" (2006), Omarion's \\"Ice Box\\" (2006), and Ciara's \\"Like a Boy\\" (2006). Rico Love co- wrote Usher's \\"Throwback\\" (2005), Keri Hilson's \\"Energy\\" (2008), Pleasure P's \\"Boyfriend #2\\" (2008). The-Dream wrote Rihanna's \\"Umbrella\\" (2007), J. Holiday's \\"Bed\\" and Usher's \\"Moving Mountains\\" and \\"Trading Places\\" (2008). Ne-Yo wrote Mario's \\"Let Me Love You\\", Rihanna's \\"Take a Bow\\" and \\"Unfaithful\\", and Beyonc√©'s \\"Irreplaceable\\" (2008). According to Billboard, the most commercially successful R&B; acts of the decade were Usher, Alicia Keys, Beyonc√©, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Chris Brown and Ne-Yo. 2010s Continuing from the 1990s and 2000s, R&B;, like many other genres, drew influences from the technical innovations of the time and began to incorporate more electronic and machine-made sounds and instruments. The use of effects such as Auto-Tune and new computerized synths have given R&B; a more futuristic feel while still attempting to incorporate many of the genre's common themes such as love and relationships. Early 2010s artists such as Kelly Rowland, Ne-Yo, Usher, and Chris Brown began embracing new electronic influences while still keeping R&B;'s original feel. Kelly Rowland\\"s \\"Commander\\", Usher's \\"OMG\\", \\"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\\", \\"Scream\\" and \\"Climax\\", Chris Brown's \\"Yeah 3x\\", \\"Turn Up the Music\\" and \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" are all EDM-oriented. As this electronic element continues to grow apparent throughout the genre, contemporary artists like are gaining popularity outside of R&B; and continue to collaborate with non-R&B; artists. Singers Miguel, John Legend and Jeremih are popular in mainstream hip hop for many collaborations with rappers such as Wale, Rick Ross and J.Cole. Today's R&B; is far more diverse and incorporates more sonic elements than before, as it expands its appeal and commercial viability. Trap music's influence maintained a strong presence on the music charts with R&B; singer Beyonc√©'s songs \\"Drunk in Love\\", \\"Flawless\\" and \\"7/11\\", Bryson Tiller's debut studio album, \\"Trapsoul,\\" and Mary J. Blige's \\"Thick of It\\". Latin R&B; is gaining ground since the wave of artists began mixing trap with that sound in the middle of this decade. Spanish-language singles by Alex Rose, Rauw Alejandro and Paloma Mami, which borrow shrewdly from R&B;, are captivating a global audience. In Latin America, the genre became popular with Alex Rose's \\"Toda\\", Dalex's \\"Pa Mi\\" and \\"Cuaderno\\", and most notably Sech's \\"Otro Trago\\".

His conviction was later overturned. Shooting The shooting took place in West Belfast on 30 September 1990. Clegg, then a private originally from Bradford, England, and his fellow soldiers manning the checkpoint on the Upper Glen Road, fired nineteen bullets into a stolen Vauxhall Astra that passed through their checkpoint travelling at high speed. Clegg fired four of the bullets, the last of which killed 18-year-old passenger Karen Reilly. The driver, 17-year-old Martin Peake, also died at the scene, and the third passenger, Markiewicz Gorman, escaped with minor injuries. Sentencing Clegg was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in 1993, the court having decided that lethal force had been used without a lawful purpose. The fourth bullet was said to have been fired through the back of the car as it was leaving the checkpoint and was therefore no longer a threat to the soldiers. The murder conviction was condemned by unionists and some British newspapers, including the Daily Mail, which began a campaign for Clegg's release on the grounds that he was just doing his job in difficult circumstances. Release and aftermath Clegg was released under licence by then Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew in 1995, which in turn led to rioting in Irish nationalist areas of Belfast. Sinn F√©in repeatedly called the decision a \\"threat to the peace process\\". The release followed after a test shooting on another Astra conducted by pathologist Iain West and forensic expert Graham Renshaw on 4 June 1995. Appeals A set of appeals to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords led to the quashing of the murder conviction in 1998 and a re-trial in March 1999, on the grounds that new evidence suggested that the fourth bullet entered the side of the car. At the retrial Clegg was cleared of murder, but a conviction for \\"attempting to wound\\" the driver of the car, Martin Peake, who also died in the incident, was upheld. Another appeal, this time at the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal, led to that lesser conviction also being overturned on 31 January 2000 owing to uncertainty over the accuracy of evidence that initially suggested Clegg's final bullet was fired after the vehicle had passed. Clegg continued to serve as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade. In September 2007 the Daily Mail reported that Clegg would be serving in Afghanistan in 2008 as combat medic with the 2nd Battalion Parachute Regiment.

Herman Duryea built an estate in Old Westbury on Long Island, New York known as \\"Knole\\". Completed in 1903, it was designed by Carrere and Hastings. In 1910 he sold the property to Henry Phipps who bought it as a wedding gift for his daughter Helen's marriage to Bradley Martin. Haras du Gazon Herman Duryea also owned a large estate in Tennessee where he bred dogs and gamecocks. In 1902 he began breeding race horses and soon became one of the leading Thoroughbred racing owners in the United States. However, when many states began passing anti-betting legislation that ended most racing, Duryea moved his breeding and racing operations to Haras du Gazon in Bazoches-au-Houlme, Orne, Normandy, France acquired from Maurice Ephrussi. Among Duryea's horses were Sweeper II who won the English 2,000 Guineas in 1912 and Durbar who won the 1914 Epsom Derby. He also owned the American-born mare, Frizette (1905-1929) purchased from friend James R. Keene and Payne Whitney. Frizette, a granddaughter of Hindoo, was one of the most important foundation matrons of the twentieth century whose offspring includes Seattle Slew and Mr. Prospector. The annual Frizette Stakes at Belmont Park is named in her honor. One of the other very important fillies to race under Duryea's colors was the champion, Tanya. Foaled in 1902 by William Collins Whitney, she was leased along with several other horses to race for Duryea in 1904 as a 2-year-old and won the Hopeful Stakes, the National Stallion Stakes, and the Spinaway Stakes. Unfortunately for Herman Duryea, she was purchased that fall by Whitney's son, Harry Payne Whitney, for she is best known for her win the following spring in the Belmont Stakes. After Herman Duryea died in 1916 his widow maintained some of the French breeding farm's stallions but much of the operation would eventually be sold to Marcel Boussac.

He is known for his participation in the controversial consecration in 2000 of two bishops opposed to the blessing of same-sex unions by the Episcopal Church (United States), that took place in Singapore. He resides in Georgetown, South Carolina. Education and career Allison was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. He attended the University of the South and, after having his studies briefly interrupted by service in the United States Army during World War II after which he was discharged with the rank of Master Sergeant, he received a bachelor of arts degree in 1949. He then studied at Virginia Theological Seminary, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1952. He was ordained deacon in June 1952 and priest in May 1953. Allison later studied at Oxford University and received the Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1956. He then taught church history at the School of Theology at the University of the South and at Virginia Theological Seminary. He served as rector of Grace Episcopal Church in New York City before being elected as a Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. He began service as coadjutor of the Diocese of South Carolina in 1980, becoming the twelfth bishop on January 2, 1982. Allison retired in 1990 but has continued preaching, speaking, and writing since his retirement. Controversial consecrations In 2000, Allison participated in the consecrations of Charles Murphy and John Rogers, who were both priests in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, as missionary bishops to the United States from the Anglican churches of Rwanda and Southeast Asia. Bishops Murphy and Rogers provided leadership to the conservative Anglican Mission in America, in which Allison, although remaining a member of the Episcopal Church, has also been active. These consecrations, which occurred in Singapore, were controversial in the Episcopal Church as they were an act of protest against the church's blessing of same-sex unions but were also considered to be a breach of church unity. Other consecrators were Emmanuel Kolini, Archbishop of the Province of Rwanda, Moses Tay, Archbishop of the Province of South East Asia, John Rucyahana, Bishop of Shyira (Rwanda), Alex D. Dickson, retired Bishop of West Tennessee, and David Pytches, former Bishop of Chile, Bolivia and Peru and now a vicar in England. Writings Among Allison's books are The Rise of Moralism: The Proclamation of the Gospel from Hooker to Baxter (New York: The Seabury Press, 1966); The Cruelty of Heresy: An Affirmation of Christian Orthodoxy (Harrisburg, PA: Morehouse, 1994); \\"Guilt, Anger, and God: The Patterns of Our Discontents\\" (New York: The Seabury Press, 1972); \\"Fear, Love, and Worship\\" (published prior to 1972). His most recent book, Trust in an Age of Arrogance, was released in 2009. Allison's books argue strongly for Christian orthodoxy, and specifically for Christian pastors and teachers to be focused upon grace and justification by faith alone as the key doctrines of the Christian Church.

Its molecule has a heterocyclic core with four carbon and two oxygen atoms; the formula can also be written as . It is a crystalline colorless solid, sparingly soluble in water. It decomposes on heating with release of carbon dioxide and acetone. Properties =Acidity= The compound can easily lose a hydrogen ion from the methylene element in the ring (carbon 5); which creates a double bond between it and one of the adjacent carbons (number 4 or 6), and a negative charge in the corresponding oxygen. The resulting anion is stabilized by resonance between the two alternatives, so that the double bond is delocalized and each oxygen in the carbonyls has a formal charge of ‚àí1/2. alt=Resonance equilibrium of Meldrum's anion The ionization constant pKa is 4.97; which makes it behave as a monobasic acid even though it contains no carboxylic acid groups. In this and other properties, the compound resembles dimedone and barbituric acid. However, while dimedone exists in solution predominantly as the mono-enol tautomer, Meldrum's acid is almost entirely as the diketone form. The unusually high acidity of this compound was long considered anomalous‚Äîit is 8 orders of magnitude more acidic than the closely related compound dimethyl malonate. In 2004, Ohwada and coworkers determined that the energy-minimizing conformation structure of the compound places the alpha proton's œÉCH orbital in the proper geometry to align with the œÄ*CO, so that the ground state poses unusually strong destabilization of the C-H bond. Preparation =Original synthesis= The compound was first made by Meldrum by a condensation reaction of acetone with malonic acid in acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid. alt=Original synthesis of Meldrum's acid =Alternative syntheses= As an alternative to its original preparation, Meldrum's acid can be synthesized from malonic acid, isopropenyl acetate (an enol derivative of acetone), and catalytic sulfuric acid. A third route is the reaction of carbon suboxide with acetone in the presence of oxalic acid. Uses Like malonic acid and its ester derivatives, and other 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, Meldrum's acid can and serve as a reactant for a variety of nucleophilic reactions. = Alkylation and acylation = The acidity of carbon 5 (between the two carbonyl groups) allows simple alkylation and acylation of Meldrum's acid at this position. For example, deprotonation and reaction with a simple alkyl halide () attaches the alkyl group () at that position: alt=Alkylation of Meldrum's anion at carbon 5 alkyl halide The analogous reaction with an acyl chloride () attaches the acyl () instead: alt=Acylation of Meldrum's anion at carbon 5 acyl chloride These two reactions allow Meldrum's acid to serve as a starting scaffold for the synthesis of many different structures with various functional groups. The alkylated products can be further manipulated to produce various amide and ester compounds. Heating the acyl product in the presence of an alcohol leads to ester exchange and decarboxylation in a process similar to the malonic ester synthesis. The reactive nature of the cyclic-diester allows good reactivity even for alcohols as hindered as t-butanol. Ketoesters of this type are useful in the Knorr pyrrole synthesis. = Synthesis of ketenes = At temperatures greater than 200 ¬∞C Meldrum's acid undergoes a pericyclic reaction that releases acetone and carbon dioxide and produces a highly reactive ketene compound: alt=Pyrolysis of Meldrum's acid into ketene, acetone, and CO2 These ketenes can be isolated using flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP). Ketenes are highly electrophilic and can undergo addition reaction with other chemicals. With this approach it is possible to form new C‚ÄìC bonds, rings, amides, esters, and acids: alt=Addition reaction of an amine to a ketene, yielding amide alt=Addition reaction of an enol and a ketene, yielding ester alt=Hydration reaction of a ketene, yielding carboxylic acid Alternately, the pyrolysis can be performed in solution, to obtain the same results without isolating the ketene, in a one-pot reaction. The ability to form such diverse products makes Meldrum's acid a very useful reagent for synthetic chemists. History Incorrect structure. The compound is named after Andrew Norman Meldrum who reported its synthesis in 1908. He misidentified its structure as a Œ≤-lactone of Œ≤-hydroxyisopropylmalonic acid; the correct structure, the bislactone of 1,3-dioxane was reported in 1948.

This is often a component of larger privatization schemes. The term is most often used in the connection with privatization in former Soviet Bloc countries or in reference to settlements concerning the property of murdered or displaced European Jews. The difference between reprivatization and privatization is that only state (nationwide) property can become the subject of the transaction, but not municipal property. The economic content of these concepts also has differences: the privatized property is obtained due to the costs of the state, but the reprivatized property previously belonged to individuals who received income from its exploitation, they also created it. Reprivatization is often sought by members of the old nobility or their descendants who desire the return of the traditional family home for sentimental and/or financial reasons; by Holocaust survivors, their descendants, or survivors of persons who died in Nazi death camps and whose property was confiscated by the Nazis or by later Communist states and disposed of in various ways; and by corporations or other parties whose property was nationalized. It is very difficult to work out a one-size-fits all regime for property restitution, and it is often pursued on an ad hoc basis in the courts with varying degrees of success in different jurisdictions. A significant barrier to reprivatization is created by larger political questions, which vary by country. In Eastern Europe, there is frequently a desire to avoid the inflammation of ethnic tensions and the ostensible reversal of Potsdam conference policies; see Federation of Expellees. Outstanding reprivatization issues can sometimes be a barrier to foreign investment, as investors are wary of investing in a property to which the title is disputed or faulty.  Reasons for reprivatization  Reprivatization can be caused by the need: *to reduce the number of state property *to increase the size of the private sector in the country's economy *to strengthen competition in various industries *to increase the efficiency of the use of property as a source of improving the well-being of individuals and as a consequence of the country as a whole *to eliminate the state monopoly in certain areas  Forms and types of reprivatization  There are two main forms of reprivatization: *Restitution. In this case, the property is returned to the former private owner. *Compensation. The value of the property is reimbursed through the provision of government securities or cash. In their pure form, both these forms are rare. Most often they are used at the same time, compensating for part of the costs in the form of reimbursement of funds, the rest is provided in kind. In addition, reprivatization can also be accompanied by compensation for material damage (lost profits, downtime). Requirements for reimbursement can be put forward both by the former owner and by the state itself: *The owner can claim compensation for the amount of income that he could receive if his property was not nationalized. *The state can claim for reimbursement of expenses incurred, as a rule, it may be expenses for modernization, maintenance of the relevant condition,  Reprivatization by country  = Great Britain = Most often, when discussing reprivatization, it turns to the example of Margaret Thatcher. With the coming to power in 1979, the \\"Iron Lady\\" received the country's economy in a rather deplorable state. Therefore, after a short, tough and, in the end, victorious campaign against the trade unions, she decided to increase the role of the state in the economic system of Great Britain. One of the ways to implement the plan was to choose reprivatization. Large-scale reprivatization touched the oil, gas, electronic, aerospace and some other industries. Many enterprises that were in a difficult economic situation (including British Airways, British Petroleum), legally transferred to state ownership and received considerable financial support from it. And all this is only to be transferred to private hands through privatization ten years later. = Germany = The revival of entrepreneurship in the first period after World War II went on in the eastern lands in several forms. These were the creation of new firms, reprivatization, the organization of joint ventures with the participation of Western capital and former national enterprises. A kind of transitional measure is the decentralization of management within the former combines, as a result of which the former state enterprises begin to act as free producers in the market environment. Immediately after the unification of Germany, about 6,000 applications for the redemption of enterprises by their former owners were filed. With full redemption of the household enterprises had the opportunity to obtain a loan from the German Credit Bank under the collateral value of the land plot. = Spain = The history of privatization and nationalization in Spain is the story of the \\"nationalization of losses and the privatization of profits.\\" In crisis , the government bought up or otherwise nationalized loss-making enterprises, actually saving them from bankruptcy. Later, when for some reason they became profitable and successful companies, the government again sold them to private hands. At the same time, traditionally unprofitable industries, such as, for example, the coal industry, radio and television, railway and shipbuilding companies, remain in the hands of the state. Analysts state that the goals of privatization - to increase budget revenues as much as possible and to increase competition in different markets - are in general contradictory to each other, so it was possible to achieve either one or the other, but not both. = France = In France, as in many other European countries, a vast public sector of the economy was formed after the World War II. However, subsequently the country's leadership did not adhere to a unified policy regarding the management of state property and its fate as a whole. Here, in comparison with other developed countries, the most pronounced were the so-called waves of property transformation. The processes of nationalization and privatization consistently succeeded each other, depending on who was in power. The last large-scale nationalization took place in the early 80's. Large commercial banks and many industrial enterprises were nationalized. However, during the reign of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, the French economy was already experiencing difficulties due to high state participation and a large number of state companies. In connection with this, in the presidency of Jacques Chirac in the late 1990s. processes of privatization of the state enterprises have begun. = Poland = Unlike the industrial sector, Poland's agricultural sector remained largely in private hands during the decades of communist rule. Most of the former state farms are now leased to farmer tenants. Lack of credit is hampering efforts to sell former state farmland. Currently, Poland's 2 million private farms occupy 90% of all farmland and account for roughly the same percentage of total agricultural production. These farms are small‚Äî8 hectares (20 acres) on average‚Äîand often fragmented. Farms with an area exceeding 15 hectares (37 acres) accounted for only 9% of the total number of farms but cover 45% of total agricultural area. Over half of all farming households in Poland produce only for their own needs with little, if any, commercial sales. = Ukraine = Reforms in the more politically sensitive areas of structural reform and land privatisation are still lagging. The parliament has approved a foreign investment law allowing Westerners to purchase businesses and property, to repatriate revenue and profits, and to receive compensation in the event that property is nationalized by a future government. Outside institutions‚Äîparticularly the IMF‚Äîhave encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms and have threatened to withdraw financial support. Reprivatization in both political and economic terms is noted by the authors of the monograph \\"Privatization and Reprivatization in Ukraine after the Orange Revolution\\" - proved to be an ineffective way of reviewing the results of privatization in Ukraine. Reprivatization, which was carried out through the courts, proved to be a long and exhausting process. \\"The process of reprivatization as a way to review the results of privatization was formed under the influence of the general revolutionary moods of the population and the character of the first government team led by Yulia Tymoshenko, accustomed to an irreconcilable opposition struggle\\". Kryvorizhstal is Ukraine's largest integrated steel company. In 2004, the enterprise became an open joint-stock company \\"Kryvorozhskiy Mining and Metallurgical Combine\\". In the same year, the government of Ukraine allowed a consortium created by the structures of politicians and businessmen Rinat Akhmetov and Victor Pinchuk (son-in-law of President Leonid Kuchma) to privatize the largest steel plant for $ 803 million. After the Tymoshenko government came to power in February 2005, the procedure of judicial return of the plant to state property was launched. On April 22, 2005, the Kiev Economic Court declared illegal the sale of a 93.02% stake in Kryvorizhstal and decided to return them to the state. On October 24, 2005, Kryvorizhstal was reprivatized. The world's largest metallurgical company Mittal Steel won the contest. It laid out for a 93.02% stake in Kryvorozhstal OJSC 24.2 billion UAH ($ 4.8 billion).

He initially ruled as king from 1124 to 1132, then as emperor from 1132 to 1143. He was also known in Muslim sources as N≈´shƒ´ Taif≈´, Qushqin Taif≈´ or Qushqƒ´n, son of Baigh≈´. He fled the Liao dynasty in northern China as it was on the verge of destruction by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty and moved westward into Central Asia where he established a new empire.  Name  There are various theories regarding his name. According to Sugiyama Masaaki, Dashi (Â§ßÁü≥) might be a borrowing from Chinese title taishi (Â§™Â∏´). Qidan Guo Zhi suggests was just a nickname.Qidan Guo Zhi, vol. 19  Early life  Yel√º Dashi was a minor member of the Liao dynasty's royal Yel√º clan and an eighth generation descendant of Emperor Taizu of Liao. His date of birth is not entirely clear but may have been in either 1087 or 1094, according to various accounts of the history of Liao. The History of Liao describes him as \\"well-versed in Khitan and Chinese scripts, excelled in riding and archery, and had passed the highest imperial examination in the fifth year of the Tianqing era\\" (1115 AD).ÈÅºÂè≤ Liao Shi, volume 30, biography of Yel√º Dashi. Original text: ÈÄöÈÅº„ÄÅÊº¢Â≠óÔºåÂñÑÈ®éÂ∞ÑÔºåÁôªÂ§©ÊÖ∂‰∫îÂπ¥ÈÄ≤Â£´Á¨¨ In the twilight of the dynasty he held increasingly important administrative and military posts. He held posts of governorship of Taizhou (Ê≥∞Â∑û, in modern Tailai County, Heilongjiang) and Xiangzhou (Á••Â∑û, in modern Wanjinta Township, Nong'an County).  Jurchen invasion and end of the Liao dynasty  The Jurchens, a Tungus people who lived north of Liao dynasty in Manchuria, established the Jin dynasty in 1115 and began to dominate Manchuria. The Jurchens formed an alliance with the Song dynasty to attack the Liao, and by 1122 the Jurchens had captured a large part of Liao, including its supreme capital of Chifeng. The Liao emperor Tianzuo fled west, and his uncle Prince Yel√º Chun then formed the short-lived Northern Liao in its southern capital of Liao Nanjing (now Beijing). The Song forces under the command of Tong Guan attacked Northern Liao from the south, but under the command of Dashi and Xiao Gan, the Khitan army was able to repel the Song attacks. However, the Jurchens continued to advance from the north, and eventually captured the southern capital in 1123. Just before the Jurchen takeover, Dashi slipped away with 7000 of his troops to join the Emperor Tianzuo. Dashi was later captured by the Jurchens, but escaped five months later to rejoin the emperor. However, the emperor signalled his intention to attack the Jurchens. Dashi thought this was folly, as the Jurchens were in a strong position. Unable to convince the emperor, in 1124 Dashi led a band of his fellow Khitans northwest to the Liao garrison town of Kedun. Emperor Tianzuo was captured by the Jurchens in 1125 and the Liao dynasty ended.  Move to the west  He started out with 10,000 horses, a small force assuming at least 2 horses for every man. His new base of Kedun was about 1500 km northwest of Beijing, probably along the Orkhon River in Bulgan Province. It was an old Liao garrison with 20,000 tribal horsemen, good pasture, and protected by desert to the east and south. He probably planned to build up his forces and attack the Jurchens when an opportunity arose, which it never did. He took control of the imperial horse herds and gained some power over the local tribes. Alliances with the Western Xia to the south or the Song dynasty to the southeast never developed. As the Jurchens grew stronger the disorganized lands to the west became increasingly attractive. There had already been significant tribal movements westward, including some Khitans. On 13 March, 1130 he headed west with less than 20,000 men. After some minor fighting with the Yenisei Kyrgyz he established a new base on the Emil River just east of the current Chinese border about 1500 km west of Kedun. At about the same time, he was welcomed by the ruler of the Kingdom of Qocho (about 500 km southeast of Emil near Turfan) who became his ally or vassal. In the summer of 1131 he attacked Kashgar (over 1000 km east of Qocho), was soundly defeated and withdrew to Qocho. The Jurchens sent an army after him, but this failed because of the distance. Qara Khitai (Western Liao) established Jetysu region: Balasaghun was west of Almaty. Emil was near the lower left corner of the inset. Almaliq was near Yining in the upper Ili valley In 1131 or 1132, he was proclaimed Gurkhan by his followers, the new Central Asian title implying that he was adapting to his new homeland. He established his authority over Almaliq and Qayaliq (near Taldƒ±qorƒüan). To the west was the disorganized Kara-Khanid Khanate that had split into two. The Eastern Karakanid ruler of Balasaghun, IbrƒÅhƒ´m II b. Ahmad, invited him to help fight the Karluks and Kankalis, and in 1134 Dashi took the opportunuty to depose him, and according to Persian historian Ata-Malik Juvayni, \\"ascended a throne that had cost him nothing.\\" He made Balasaghun his new capital and took over 16,000 Khitans that had served the old ruler. He spread his power over Jetysu (eastern Kazakhstan). He sent two armies east to attack the Jurchens, which failed. He gained control over what is now Xinjiang. In May 1137 he defeated a Western Karakhanid ruler at Khujand and then spent several years consolidating his power in the Ferghana valley and Tashkent, thereby expanding his empire to the west and south. Battle of Qatwan Battle of Qatwan in 1141 The Western Karakhanids were then vassal of the Seljuks, and Mahmud appealed to the Seljuk sultan Ahmad Sanjar for help. In 1141, Dashi, interceding in a conflict between the Karakhanids and Karluk nomads, came into direct conflict with the Seljuks. Sanjar marched his troops to meet the Kara- Khitans. At the Battle of Qatwan, however, Dashi achieved a decisive victory against the Seljuk Turks. The Seljuk army suffered a great death toll, and Sanjar barely escaped with his life, but his wife and some of his best warriors were captured. The power of the Seljuks sharply declined after the battle, and the Seljuk state collapsed into internal rebellion. The Kara- Khitans became the dominant force in Central Asia, and Khwarazm and Karakhanids became vassal states of his empire. Their empire controlled an area roughly equivalent to most of today's Xinjiang, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and southern Kazakhstan.  Death  Yel√º Dashi died two years after Qatwan in 1143 as the master of much of Central Asia. At time of his death, the Qara Khitai ruled Transoxiana, Ferghana, Semirechye, the Tarim Basin, and Uyghuria. His empress Xiao Tabuyan succeeded him as regent of the dynasty.  Legacy  The dynasty Yel√º established would last until its usurpation by Kuchlug followed by conquest of its domain by Genghis Khan in 1218. His victory over the Seljuks and his amicable relations with Nestorian Christianity, which flourished under the Qara Khitai, led to his association with the legend of Prester John, a Christian king in the east who was \\"destined\\" to vanquish Islam. Bishop Otto of Freising first chronicled the story in 1145.

Channing taught at Harvard 1883‚Äì1929 and trained many PhD's who became professors at major universities. Life and works Edward Channing was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, the fifth child of Ellen Kilshaw Fuller (1820‚Äì1856), a sister of Margaret Fuller, and William Ellery Channing (1818‚Äì1901), the poet and walking companion of Henry David Thoreau. Some months after his birth, his mother died, and he was placed out with a shoemaker and his wife in Abington, Mass. Some time around 1860, his paternal grandfather Walter ChanningWho was for 33 years Dean of the Harvard Medical School and his daughter took care of him. Young Edward Channing attended a private school and entered Harvard College in autumn 1874. He received his A.B. in 1878, and two years later he received his PhD in history with a thesis on the Louisiana Purchase. In 1880, his grandfather died, leaving an inheritance of $300 (). He undertook a nine-months tour through Europe, which led him also to the Near East and North Africa. After he returned, he wrote geographical articles for Science, for example about the Sudan and geography-instruction at German schools. In 1883, he became an instructor of history at Harvard University and an assistant for professor Charles Cutler Torrey. On July 22, 1886, he married the sister-in-law of Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Alice Thacher. They had two daughters. Academic In 1883 Channing received a prize of $150 for his work \\"Town and County Government in the English Colonies of North America\\". This monograph also brought him the membership in the Massachusetts Historical Society and was the basis of the first paper given at the first meeting of the American Historical Association in 1884 in Saratoga, New York. In 1883 Channing published a revised edition (translated by William H. Tillinghast) of An Epitome of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern History by German historian Karl Ploetz, adding new sections on English and U.S. history. In 1887 Channing became assistant professor, in 1897 professor, and in 1912 McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History (one of the oldest professorships for secular history in the United States, once held by Jared Sparks). He retired in 1929. Channing was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1885.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Channing was elected president of the American Historical Association in 1919.

It was founded on 10 September 1945 and has a role to patrol Indonesia's lengthy coastline, to enforce and patrol the territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Indonesia, to protect Indonesia's maritime strategic interests, to protect the islands surrounding Indonesia, and to defend against seaborne threats. The Navy is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Navy (Kepala Staf Angkatan Laut ‚Äì KSAL or KASAL). The Indonesian Navy consists of three major fleets known as \\"Armada\\" which are Komando Armada I (1st Fleet Command) located in Jakarta, Komando Armada II (2nd Fleet Command) located in Surabaya, Komando Armada III (3rd Fleet Command) located in Sorong, and one Komando Lintas Laut Militer (Military Sealift Command). The Navy also heads the Marine Corps. All commissioned ships of the TNI-AL have the prefix KRI, standing for Kapal Republik Indonesia (Republic of Indonesia Ship) and KAL, standing for Kapal Angkatan Laut (Navy Ship) for smaller boats which have a length less than 36m, and made from fiberglass. Mission According to Article 9 of Law No.34/2004 on the National Armed Forces, the Navy has the following tasks: # perform military duties in national defence; # enforce the law and secure the order in the sea area of national jurisdiction in accordance with national laws and ratified international laws; # perform diplomatic duties in support of foreign policy set by the government; # engage other duties relevant for the maintenance and development of naval power; # support civilian empowerment in sea defence areas. History =Creation and actions during the revolution= The official Indonesian Navy's history began on 10 September 1945, at the outset of the Indonesian National Revolution. The administration of the early Indonesian government established the People's Marine Security Agency (Badan Keamanan Rakyat Laut/ BKR Laut) on 22 August 1945, the predecessor to the modern Indonesian Navy. BKR Laut with only wooden ships, a few landing craft and weapons left by Japan, was initially composed of Indonesian sailors who had served in the ranks of the Royal Netherlands Navy during the Dutch colonial period, and who had fought the Japanese during the years of military occupation, plus active militias who served with the Japanese and ex-Indonesian officers and ratings of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The formation of the Indonesian military organisation known as the People's Security Army (Tentara Keamanan Rakyat / TKR) on 5 October 1945, at the height of the National Revolution, helped spur the further existence of the TKR Naval Branch ‚Äì the Peoples' Security Navy (TLKR), which later became the Republic of Indonesia Navy (Angkatan Laut Republik Indonesia/ ALRI). The name ALRI was used until 1970, when it was changed to Tentara Nasional Indonesia Angkatan Laut (TNI-AL). As the revolution grew and the Navy began its work, naval bases were established throughout the archipelago. Former ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy handed down to the new republic were acquired. Simple strength did not discourage the Navy to deploy Sea Traffic Operations in order to spread the news of the proclamation and helping to form and train Republican military forces and militias nationwide. Besides, they also attempted to breach the Dutch naval blockade in order to obtain aid from abroad. The newly formed navy confronted the more superior Royal Netherlands Navy in Bali, Sibolga and Cirebon. Cross-sea operations are also able to prepare the armed forces in South Kalimantan, Bali and Sulawesi. Limitations in strength and ability to lead the Navy had to divert the struggle in the countryside, after most boats were sunk and nearly all bases battered by the Dutch and Allied military forces. But the determination to participate again in the sea never subsided. In the hard times during the National Revolution the Navy succeeded in forming the Fleet Forces (CA), Marine Corps (Corps Mariniers/ CM), and educational institutions in various places. The formation of these elements mark the presence of aspects for the formation of a modern national navy. =After the revolution= Grumman HU-16 Albatross of the naval aviation, 1950s‚Äì1960s The end of the War of Independence marked the development of the Navy as a modern naval power. In accordance to the results of the Round Table Conference, in 1949, the Navy received a variety of war equipment such as warships and its supporting facilities such as naval bases. This step in the consolidation of the body along with the Navy, revamping the organization and recruitment of personnel through educational institutions before manning naval equipment. During 1949‚Äì1959, the Indonesian Navy managed to enhance its strength and improve its capabilities. In the field of organization the navy reorganized its Fleet Forces, the Marine Corps ‚Äì then Korps Komando Angkatan Laut (KKO-AL ‚Äì Naval Commando Corps Command), naval aviation and a number of regions as territorial defense command aspects of the sea. Navy combat equipment grew, both from the Dutch and from other various countries. With the increased strength and the capability, the Navy began refining the strategy, tactics, and techniques of marine operations, which are directly applied in a variety of military operations in order to deal with separatist movements that have sprung up in the year from 1950 to 1959. In operations against PRRI in Sumatra, Permesta , Darul Islam in West Java, and RMS in the Moluccas, the Navy gained lessons in applying the concept of marine operations, amphibious operations, and joint operations with other forces. =At the height of the Cold War= KRI Pasopati, a Whiskey-class submarine which is now a museum ship KRI Siliwangi At the time the country started to recover from the threat of disintegration, in 1959, the Navy launched a program known as Menuju Angkatan Laut yang Jaya (rough translation - \\"Toward Distinguished Navy\\"). The Navy experienced a significant progress until 1965 which was motivated by the politics of confrontation in order to seize West Irian, which Indonesia claimed as part of its territory, a claim refuted by the Dutch government. As part of the increasing military ties between Indonesia and the Warsaw Pact, various naval combat equipments from Eastern European countries strengthened the Navy and become the dominant force at the time. Some military equipment of Soviet production served in the ranks of the Navy, among others Sverdlov-class cruiser, Skoryy-class destroyer, Riga-class frigate, Whiskey-class submarine (the first such vessels to be used in Southeast Asia), Komar-class missile boat, Ilyushin Il-28 long-range bomber aircraft of Naval Aviation and the PT-76 Amphibious light tanks, BTR-50 APCs and BM-13 MRLs (Southeast Asia's first ever MRL system in service) of the Commando Corps, the first of their kind in the region. With such power in the era of the 1960s the Navy was called the largest Navy in Southeast Asia and one of the strongest within the Asia-Pacific, outranking those of its neighbors in armament and prestige. By January 1962 the Indonesian Navy started preparing a couple of naval operations for the liberation of West Irian known as Operation Trikora, which began on 15 December the year before as part of the military component of that operation under the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat) . Beginning 1 January, fast-ship torpedo vessels of the Navy were forward deployed to deal with destroyers, frigates and aircraft of the Royal Netherlands Navy. On January 15, 1962 Commodore Yos Sudarso along with RI Macan Tutul sank in the sea battle in the Arafura Sea. This battle is known as the Vlakke Hoek incident.By mid-year the Navy was preparing to organize its role in the planned Operation Jayawijaya which would have been the largest amphibious operation in the history of Indonesian military operations if commenced. The naval component was made up of 100 warships and 16,000 sailors and Marines. The deployment of forces preparatory to the planned landings in West Papua forced the Dutch to return to negotiations and reached an agreement to hand over West Irian to Indonesia. After seizing West Irian, Sukarno by 1963 moved his sights on Malaysia. Indonesia political confrontation against Neocolonialism and Imperialism (Nekolim) continued in Operation Dwikora to oppose the formation of Malaysia. Although elements of the National Armed Forces were prepared for operational deployments to the new state, the operations were limited to the infiltration operation along the Borneo frontier. Soldiers from the marine corps were involved in the operations which targeted both the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The Marine Corps, though, would figure in the 1964 MacDonald House bombing in Singapore. =1965 onwards= , a that would later become KRI Samadikun Operation Dwikora was discontinued in 1965 along with a succession of governments in Indonesia after an abortive coup d'√©tat\\"The assassination of generals on the morning of 1 October was not really a coup attempt against the government, but the event has been almost universally described as an 'abortive coup attempt,' so I have continued to use the term.\\" . took place in Jakarta, which were organized by the self-proclaimed organization of Indonesian National Armed Forces members who, in the early hours of 1 October 1965, assassinated six Indonesian Army generals and killed 3 more. Since 1966, the Navy experienced a new chapter in its history as the military integration efforts. With the integration of the armed forces organizationally and operationally been able to keep up on the implementation of tasks in the field of defense and security so doctrinally, the direction of development of the power and capabilities of each branch to be concentrated. The operations were prominent during the period of the 1970s was Operation Seroja in the framework of the integration of East Timor to Indonesia. The Navy played an active role in the operation of landings, a joint ground operation, and transporting troops by sea. Starting the 1980s the Navy began to modernize combat equipment. Ships made in Eastern Europe that has been the core strength of the Navy in the era of the 1960s and 1970s were not suited to meet the growing and changing needs for the navy and its branches (saving for its submarines and several corvettes and frigates, the submarines were retired in 1990). The worsening relations between Indonesia and the Soviet Union after the government of President Sukarno resulted a cessation of military cooperation between the two countries and the Warsaw Pact. Therefore, the Navy switched once more to using Western technology to modernize the power and ability to buy warships, logistics vessels and other major combat equipment from various countries. Included among those commissioned during the Suharto presidency were Fatahillah-class corvette and from the Netherlands, Type 209 submarine from West Germany, fast patrol boat from South Korea, and the GAF Nomad patrol aircraft from Australia. In 1993 the Navy also received 39 ships from the former Volksmarine (East German Navy), including 16 s, 14 Frosch-class landing ship tanks (LSTs), and 9 Kondor II-class minessweepers. Aside from these the Navy reorganized its forces. In 1984, as part of an-Armed Forces wide unit reorganization, the former Naval Regions, which in turn governed Naval Bases and Naval Districts and subordinate Naval Stations and Naval Air Stations, were turned into Main Naval Bases of the Navy Fleet Commands, divided from the formerly unified National Fleet Command. KRI Cut Nyak Dien At the same time the Navy began to develop a non-combat military operations in the form of humanitarian service program Surya Bhaskara Jaya in various remote areas in Indonesia that can only be reached by sea. The core of the operating activities are health services, construction and rehabilitation of public facilities and various counseling in health, law, and civil defense. This event is held regularly every year until now. A number of countries also participated in these activities, among others, Singapore, Australia and the United States. The navy also seeks promoting the development of the maritime sector, especially those related to aspects of defense and security at sea, activities that had been present since independence before the formation of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. The actual activities undertaken today by the Navy are establishing marine development assessment bodies together with the government and private sectors in some areas, coastal village pilot programs are summarized in Coastal Rural Development (Bindesir), and the National Potential Development Program for Maritime Defense (Binpotnaskuatmar). In order to encourage the spirit of the seafaring nation, the Navy held an international scale maritime event Arung Samudera 1995. The navy was responsible for the programs for National Maritime Year 1996 and the Bunaken Declaration of 1998, which is a manifestation of marine development in Indonesia. = Expansion in the 21st century = During the presidencies of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Joko Widodo, the Navy has begun a program of expansion of its combat commands and has begun a program of national warship construction in naval arsenals, while acquiring nationally produced transport aircraft for the needs of the Navy.

Equipment Equipment of the Indonesian Navy List of active Indonesian Navy ships Ground forces =Marine Corps= Indonesian Marines The Indonesian Marine Corps () officially known as KORMAR, \\"Marinir\\" or \\"Korps Marinir\\" is an integral part of the TNI-AL. It is sized at the military corps level serving as the Naval Infantry and main amphibious warfare force of the TNI. Distinguished from other TNI-AL members by their unique qualification badges and insignia and unique magenta berets. It is commanded by a two star ranked officer. It has three divisions, which are: * Pasukan Marinir I (PASMAR I) (Marine Force I) based in Jakarta. * Pasukan Marinir II (PASMAR II) (Marine Force II) based in Surabaya. * Pasukan Marinir III (PASMAR III) (Marine Force III) based in Sorong. The three marine divisions are each led by a one star ranked officer. =Special Forces= KOPASKA KOPASKA special forces Formed in 31 March 1962, Frogman Commando (Komando Pasukan Katak) or KOPASKA is a Frogman unit of the TNI-AL. There are three units with detachments specializing in sabotage / anti-sabotage (terror), special operations, combat SAR, EOD and naval minesweeping, underwater demolition and special boat units. KOPASKA's main duties are underwater demolition (raiding enemy ships and bases), destroying main underwater installations, reconnaissance, prisoner snatches, preparing beaches for larger naval amphibious operations, and counter-terrorism. In peacetime the unit deploys a seven-person team to serve as security personnel for VIPs. Taifib Taifib personnel during training exercise Amphibious reconnaissance battalion (Battalion Intai Amfibi) or Taifib is an elite recon unit within the Indonesian Marine Corps which is tasked for conducting Amphibious reconnaissance and Special reconnaissance. Taifib was previously known as \\"Kipam\\" (abbreviation from: \\"Komando Intai Para Amfibi\\") which literally means in English: the Para-Amphibious reconnaissance Commandos. They were officially formed on 13 March 1961 as marine commandos. Set at a regimental strength of two battalions, \\"Taifib\\" was formed as the elite amphibious reconnaissance unit of the Marine Corps. Denjaka Jala Mangkara Detachment personnel Jala Mangkara Detachment (Detasemen Jala Mangkara) or Denjaka is the special operations and counter-terrorism forces of the Indonesian Navy. This is a combined detachment formed from selected personnel of the Navy's Underwater Special Unit ( Kopaska) and the Marine Corps' Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion (Taifib). The unit was formed in 1984 by the Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces to counter maritime strategic threats including terrorism and sabotage. Despite the specific reason for its formation, as in the case of any other special operations forces around the world, the detachment is also fully trained in conducting reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, and clandestine behind-enemy-lines operations. Denjaka's primary task is to develop anti-terrorism, anti-sabotage and other clandestine operations capabilities in support of maritime counter-terrorism, counter-sabotage and other special operations as directed by the commander of the armed forces. Ongoing projects The Indonesian Navy is progressing the Minimum Essential Force plan to replenish and modernise the fleet, this includes achieving 151 vessels (minimum), 220 vessels (standard), or 274 vessels (ideal), for which it has a blueprint out to 2024. Some of those platforms yet to be delivered include: * Martadinata-class frigate As of January 2018, the first two of four s were commissioned into service. *Nagapasa-class submarines As of April 2019, two South Korean Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME)-built s were commissioned into service and a third Indonesian state-owned shipbuilder PT PAL Indonesia-built submarine was undergoing sea trials. A contract for three more Nagapasa-class submarines was signed with DSME in April 2019 with completion of the final boat anticipated in 2026. In January 2020 the Indonesian Minister of Defence Prabowo Subianto during a bilateral meeting in France and met with his French counterpart Florence Parly said the Ministry is interested on French military equipment including 48 Dassault Rafale, four submarines, and two corvettes. Integrated Maritime Surveillance Systems With various coastal radars, Indonesia has one of the world's longest Integrated Maritime Surveillance Systems (IMSS). The network covers more than of coastline in the Straits of Malacca and about of coastline in the Sulawesi Sea. The IMSS is a tightly integrated network of ship and shore based sensors, communications devices, and computing resources that collect, transmit, analyze and display a broad array of maritime data including Automatic Identification System (AIS), surface radar, surveillance cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS), equipment health monitors and radio transmissions of maritime traffic in wide operating areas. Redundant sensors and multiple communication paths make the IMSS a robust and capable system. The IMSS enhances Indonesia's ability to detect, track, and monitor vessels passing through territorial and international waters. This capability is crucial to combating piracy, illegal fishing, smuggling, and terrorism within and around Indonesia's maritime borders. The IMSS is manned and operated by the Indonesian Navy, and consists of 18 Coastal Surveillance Stations (CSS), 11 Ship-based Radars, two Regional Command Centers, and two Fleet Command Centers (Jakarta and Surabaya). Chief of Staff of the Navy Rank structure In the navy, as well as in other armed forces branches in Indonesia, the rank consists of officer in Indonesian known as \\"Perwira\\", NCO \\"Bintara\\" and enlisted \\"Tamtama\\". The Indonesian Navy is one of few navies in the world which use rank titles similar to its Army, except for flag officers and lower-ranking enlisted sailors. However the Indonesian Marine Corps, which is a branch of the Navy, uses exactly the same rank titles as those of the Army, but still uses Navy-style insignia (for lower-ranking enlisted marines, blue are replacing the red colour). Starting 2006, navy personnel assigned abroad are authorized to use foreign service uniform, officially named \\"Black Navy\\" (similar to service dress blues in United States Navy) during their service overseas (e.g. during training exercises), which includes sleeve and cuff insignia. The proper title to address rank are as follows, all high-ranking officers (Admiral or Marine General) use their rank followed by \\"(TNI)\\", while other officers use their rank followed by respective branch/corps. For example, a Navy captain from fleet forces corps uses the title \\"Kolonel Laut Pelaut\\" (written as \\"Kolonel Laut (P)\\"), while a Navy Vice Admiral uses the title \\"Laksamana Madya (TNI)\\" regardless of their previous branches. Warrant officers, NCOs and enlisted seamen may put their respective branch/corps specialty, for example: \\"Pembantu Letnan Dua SAA\\" (warrant officer from surface weaponry corps) and \\"Kelasi Dua TRB\\" (seaman recruit from torpedo corps). All marine corps personnel, general officers inclusive, use their rank followed by \\"(Mar)\\". Note: Indonesia is not a member of NATO, so there is not an official equivalence between the Indonesian military ranks and those defined by NATO. The displayed parallel is approximate and for illustration purposes only. Note: The red banding on the rank insignia denotes the personnel holding a command position which is agnostic of rank. =Officers= { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" - align=\\"center\\" !

Plot Nishi is a 20-year-old loser with dreams of becoming a comic book artist. One late evening he runs into his childhood crush, Myon, on the subway. She tells Nishi she is due to marry. Nishi has flashbacks of exchanging love letters and messages with Myon and fantasizes declaring his love for her, but in reality fails to actually say anything. They go to her father's yakitori restaurant, and see Myon's father and her elder sister Yan (who runs the restaurant). Nishi also meets Myon's fianc√©e, Ryo. Two yakuza gangsters enter, Atsu and a senior yakuza whom Atsu calls Aniki (literally 'brother', a term used by Yakuza to refer to each other). They are looking for Myon's father, who seduced and stole Atsu's girlfriend, and now hides cowering behind a corner. It is later revealed through flashbacks that the senior yakuza is actually the first boyfriend of the girls' mother, who was also seduced away by her husband during a disco in their youth. As Atsu threatens Myon with a gun, Ryo steps in and tries to punch Atsu, but instead gets knocked out. Atsu then prepares to rape Myon, who calls out Nishi's name. Atsu turns on Nishi, who is rolled in a ball, terrified, placing his pistol against Nishi's anus. Atsu fires when Nishi finally musters the courage to yell, \\"I will hurt you!\\", thus killing him instantly. The senior Yakuza, offended by Atsu's lack of control, shoots him dead, and then nonchalantly orders dinner. Meanwhile, Nishi is in some sort of limbo where he encounters a being whose physical image changes every fraction of a second, Kami-sama (God). Kami-sama directs Nishi to walk into a red portal where he will disappear, but at the last moment Nishi runs for the opposite blue portal in order to return to life. Kami-sama becomes impressed by Nishi's sheer will to live, and so lets him escape. Nishi returns to the moment just before Atsu pulled the trigger. This time, Nishi seizes Atsu's gun with his buttocks, and shoots him dead. He, Yan and Myon all pile into the yakuza's car, leaving the father and Ryo (still unconscious) behind. They speed off, followed by the massed yakuzas. The Yakuza boss calls Nishi using the yakuza's car phone and reveals that Atsu was a player on the Japanese national soccer team, threatening to frame the three for armed robbery and murder. Then after further chase the boss has his men force the trio in to a dead end on a bridge. However, Nishi steers the car off the bridge and they are swallowed up by an enormous whale. Inside the whale, they meet an old man who was formerly yakuza and has been trapped in the whale for more than 30 years. (He is later shown through flashbacks to be the father of the senior Yakuza shown earlier). He shows them to the elaborate suspended house he has constructed over the 'sea' inside the whale's belly. Nishi attempts to escape the whale but he fails and they resign themselves to life inside the whale. Yan practices dancing and art, Myon practices swimming (a dream she gave up when her breasts got bigger), Nishi practices writing and drawing humorous manga and he and Myon finally become sexually intimate. They attempt to leave the whale, again failing. The old man reveals that the water level inside the whale is rising, and he believes the whale is probably dying. They concoct a plan to make a motor boat using spare parts and fuel from the car they arrived in. On the day before the final match of the soccer World Cup, the whale returns to Osaka (their home town) and Yan, Nishi, and Myon, as well as the Old Man, manage to escape. As the four fly through the air, the film returns to its very first scene, with Myon running from the Yakuza, only this time she does not get her leg caught in the door of the train, and the Yakuza is left behind on the platform. This is followed by a lengthy montage, similar to that of the opening credits, showing the histories of the various characters. The movie ends ambiguously, with the phrase \\"This Story Has Never Ended\\" appearing before the credits roll.

Konrad Wallenrod is an 1828 narrative poem, in Polish, by Adam Mickiewicz, set in the 14th-century Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Mickiewicz wrote it, while living in St. Petersburg, Russia, in protest against the late-18th- century partitioning of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Habsburg Monarchy. Mickiewicz had been exiled to St. Petersburg for his participation in the Philomaths organization at Vilnius University. The poem helped inspire the Polish November 1830 Uprising against Russian rule. Though its subversive theme was apparent to most readers, the poem escaped censorship due to conflicts among the censors and, in the second edition, a prefatory homage to Tsar Nicholas I. Though Mickiewicz later disparaged the work, its cultural influence in Poland persists. Plot In a preface, Mickiewicz briefly outlines the history of the region, describing the interactions among the Lithuanians, Prussians, Poles, and Russians. The following six cantos tell the story of Wallenrod, a fictional Lithuanian pagan captured and reared as a Christian by his people's long-standing enemies, the Order of Teutonic Knights. He rises to the position of Grand Master, but is awakened to his heritage by a mysterious minstrel singing at an entertainment. He then seeks vengeance by deliberately leading the Knights into a major military defeat. It transpires that Wallenrod has a wife, Aldona, who has been living in seclusion. The Knights discover his treason and sentence him to death; Aldona refuses to flee with him. He then commits suicide. Cultural influences The concept of \\"Wallenrodism\\" () ‚Äî the striking of a treacherous, possibly suicidal, blow against an enemy ‚Äî and certain powerful fragments of the poem have become an enduring part of the Polish psyche and found resonance in the Polish uprisings of the 19th and 20th centuries. The poem included a reference to Machiavelli's dictum that a leader must be both a lion and a fox. Its encouragement of what would later be called \\"patriotic treason\\" created controversy, since its elements of deception and conspiracy were thought incompatible with Christian and chivalric values. Mickiewicz was taken aback by the strength of the public response to his poem and regretted its publication; before his death, he expressed frustration at his financial inability to buy back and burn every copy of what he described as a mere \\"political pamphlet.\\" Konrad Wallenrod has twice been turned into an opera: as I Lituani (The Lithuanians), by Italian composer Amilcare Ponchielli (1874); and as Konrad Wallenrod, by Polish composer W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªele≈Ñski (1885). The Polish composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin may have based on this poem his Ballade No.1 in G minor. The Polish-born author Joseph Conrad, who had been christened J√≥zef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, may have selected the second part of his pen name as an hommage to the poem's protagonist. Mickiewicz's poem influenced Conrad's frequent explorations of the conflict between publicly attested loyalty and a hidden affiliation with a national cause.

By 1992 there were also MS-DOS, Atari ST and Amstrad CPC versions available. It is the sixth game in the Dizzy series, and the fourth adventure-based Dizzy title. The story, set in a fantasy world called Magicland, follows on from the events of Fantasy World Dizzy, the previous adventure title. In Magicland Dizzy the player controls Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, who is trying to save six of his friends who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks. The game was the first Dizzy game not to be developed entirely by Dizzy's creators, the Oliver Twins. Instead, whilst they were focusing on other projects, Magicland Dizzy was designed by Neal Vincent and coded by external developer Big Red Software. The Oliver Twins retained design-approval oversight. The game is sometimes alternatively known by its development title, Dizzy 4, with the Roman numeral IV visible at the top of the game screen, behind the player's score. A prequel, Into Magicland, was released to promote the game and featured a new character that was never seen in any of the series games again. The game was widely acclaimed by critics across the platforms with scores typically in the 80-95% region. Criticism was leveled at its similarity to previous games in the series and the awkward inventory system. By November 1991 it was noted that the Dizzy games had sold more than half a million units across all platforms. A NES version titled Wonderland Dizzy was developed in 1993 and later released in October 2015.  Gameplay  In Magicland Dizzy the player guides Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, in an attempt to rescue his six friends who are held captive under the influence of various magic spells. The locations are all located in the titular \\"Magicland\\" and are fantastical in nature, many inspired by fairy tales. They include a field of standing stones called Weirdhenge, a witch's island and Prince Charming's castle. Movement from one screen to the next is enabled through flip-screen such that when Dizzy touches the outer edge of one screen he is transported to the next. The individual screens consist of platforms and ladders with Dizzy able to both walk and jump to navigate the maze and its obstacles. Dizzy can collect up to three items at once which are then used at specific locations to solve puzzles and advance through the game. At the start of the game the player has three lives and a health bar which can be replenished by finding and collecting diamonds scattered throughout the maze.  Plot and characters  The Evil Wizard Zaks, the primary antagonist of the series, whom Dizzy defeated previously in Fantasy World Dizzy, has returned having \\"made certain arrangements against his premature demise\\".The back story is given in the game instruction booklet He has cast spells on six members of the Yolkfolk, egg-shaped friends and relations of Dizzy, and transported them to Magicland. At the beginning of the game Dizzy teleports himself to Magicland and must set about lifting the spells from his friends. Following their introduction in Fantasy World Dizzy, this game again features the Yolkfolk. Each of them has had a spell cast upon them by Zaks: Dylan is transfigured into a thorny bush; Denzil is frozen in ice; Dozy is put into an enchanted and perhaps everlasting sleep; Dora is turned into a frog; Daisy is enlarged and imprisoned inside Zaks' oubliette; and Grand-Dizzy trapped inside a magic mirror. Throughout the game Dizzy meets and interacts with many of Magicland's inhabitants. These include the Queen of Hearts, the good witch Glenda and Prince Charming, along with various other creatures who can help or hinder Dizzy's progress. During the course of the game Dizzy comes across the legendary sword Excalibur and has the opportunity to awaken Sleeping Beauty.  Development and promotion  This was the first Dizzy game that was not fully designed and coded by the Oliver Twins, the creators of Dizzy. After Fantasy World Dizzy they had started working more closely with Codemasters, developing games for the American market where the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was quickly capturing a large audience. In order to continue the Dizzy series, which remained popular in Codemasters' home market, the Twins had to bring in others to do the majority of the design and coding. This gave them time to concentrate on their other projects. The coding of Magicland Dizzy was contracted out to Big Red Software. In order to promote Magicland Dizzy, a five screen mini-adventure for the ZX Spectrum known as Into Magicland or unofficially Dizzy 3 and a half was given away with the January 1991 edition of Crash, a UK-based magazine. It featured Dizzy and his cousin Danny and is a prequel to the main game, ending with Dizzy teleporting to the first screen of Magicland Dizzy. This was the character Danny's only appearance in a Dizzy game. Originally Magicland Dizzy was only available as part of a five-game Dizzy compilation called The Dizzy Collection which also featured Dizzy, Treasure Island Dizzy, Fantasy World Dizzy and Fast Food. The game was later released separately at a budget price. Remake Title screen of Wonderland Dizzy Wonderland Dizzy is a platform adventure game developed in 1993 and later released in October 2015 by the Oliver Twins for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The Oliver Twins had previously released several games for the NES, published by Camerica for both the Aladdin Deck Enhancer and later sold as standalone non-licensed cartridges. Camerica also released the Codemasters-designed Game Genie cartridge, distributed in the US by Galoob and the subject of Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc. Like many of the Dizzy games ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, Wonderland Dizzy is an enhanced remake of a previously released Dizzy game ‚Äì Magicland Dizzy, albeit with an Alice in Wonderland theme. As in Magicland Dizzy, the aim of the game is rescuing the other members of The Yolkfolk who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks, however Wonderland Dizzy allows the player to play as Dizzy, Daisy or control both characters. Wonderland Dizzy was previously rejected for The Excellent Dizzy Collection. The game source code was discovered by The Oliver Twins in October 2015. The game was released in 2015 for online emulated gaming and for free download. Reception Magicland Dizzy was met with a largely positive reception. Writing in Your Sinclair, Rich Pelley gave the Spectrum version a positive review, describing it as \\"addictive\\" and \\"a bit of a spanker\\". Crash described the Spectrum version of the game as \\"one of the best [Dizzy games] so far\\" and an \\"essential purchase\\". The gameplay was described as being very similar to the previous games in the series though the Crash review still praised the addictive nature of the game and the colourful graphics and sounds. Writing in Amstrad Action, Adam Waring described the Amstrad version of the game as a \\"challenge even to those who've completed all the other Dizzy games\\". In their review of the Commodore 64 version of the game, Zzap! noted that the slower pace of the game compared to the Spectrum version made \\"exploration a bit tedious at times\\" but still praised the game overall. Your Sinclair's Rich Pelley described the game's \\"annoying menu system\\" as a minor negative point. In his review in Amstrad Action, Adam Waring noted that the background music \\"becomes annoying\\" and that \\"not as many gameplay enhancements\\" had been made compared to previous games in the series. In contrast, Stuart Campbell's review in Amiga Power described the Amiga version of the game as \\"the most accomplished game in the series so far\\" and noted that by November 1991 the Dizzy games had sold more than half a million units across all platforms. The ZX Spectrum version was voted the 12th best game of all time in a special issue of Your Sinclair magazine in 2004.

She is played by actress Linda Cardellini. Linda Cardellini's addition into the main cast opening credits was in the 5th episode of season 10.  Precursor  Sam is a nurse and single mother; she has a son, Alex (played first by Oliver Davis, later by Dominic Janes). Alex was born when she was fifteen; she has had to raise him mostly on her own. She comes from a family of alcoholics; her anger toward Abby Lockhart in Season 14 when Abby tells the staff she had a relapse while working is explained when she tells Abby that she came from a long line of drunks who never tried to stop drinking.  Life at County and career  Viewers first meet Sam in the Season 10 episode \\"Out of Africa,\\" where she distinguishes herself by quickly and effectively giving an intravenous sedative to an unruly patient, even impressing the usually stubborn Dr. Romano. Sam shows herself to be an assertive, experienced, and talented nurse throughout the episode, though she loses her professionalism a bit when she discovers Dr. Luka Kovaƒç's unknowing part in her son Alex's diabetic fit while he befriends the boy. She replaces Abby Lockhart who was head nurse, but decided to become a doctor instead. Her no nonsense attitude had gotten her in trouble early on. In the episode \\"Death and Taxes\\", she took Dr. Robert Romano's mechanical hand after the ER Chief touched her inappropriately with the device. In addition, in the episode \\"Impulse Control\\", she punches an assault victim's abusive boyfriend in the face when he threatens her as she tries to call the police, but overcomes Dr. Kerry Weaver's knee-jerk lack of support and helps the abuse victim follow through on pressing charges. Sam soon notices a bond between Alex and Luka. Though initially uncomfortable with Luka's involvement with Alex, Sam eventually accepts it and becomes good friends with Luka. Later, a romantic relationship develops. Unexpectedly, Alex's father, Steve (played by Cole Hauser), returns and attempts to push Luka out of their lives. When she discovers Steve might stay permanently, Sam panics, packs up, and runs away. Before doing so, however, Luka runs to her, trying to get information from her as to why was she is doing this. Ignoring him and his slams on the car, fighting tears, she drives away. Sam has had a history of picking up and moving around the country to escape Steve. She worries that he will ruin her and Alex's life and that they cannot coexist with Steve. She does come back thanks to Luka who finds her at a motel and brings her back. They move in together. Throughout season 11, Sam and Luka lived together, and Luka was a surrogate father for Alex, even going and meeting with a school official after Alex got caught with an issue of MAXIM magazine. At the end of season 11, Alex runs away to find Steve (now played by Garret Dillahunt), by hitchhiking after a confrontation with Sam. He is out to find Steve in Colorado, even though Sam has hidden the fact Steve is there because he is in jail on robbery charges. Luka and Sam are frantically searching for him in the opener of season 12. Sam is desperately worried about Alex because of his diabetes, and his lack of insulin could have resulted in a coma or even death. Sam immediately gets in the car and drives non-stop to Colorado. Luka worries about Sam because they have been driving non-stop, and even hit a deer which completely destroys the windshield. Sam and Luka finally find an exhausted but stable Alex at a Canon City hospital, where he claims he's okay and that he knows how to take care of himself. At this point, Sam realizes her relationship with Luka is not going to work; her personal life is too hectic for him to deal with, the two of them have communication problems, and Luka's special bond with Alex has been eclipsed by Alex's knowledge that his father is in jail. Sam breaks up with Luka awkwardly near the beginning of Season 12. Several episodes later, though, they appear to be friends again. She met and immediately befriended Dr. John Carter upon his return from Africa, happy to \\"put a face to the name\\". Later in season 12, a wealthy patient named Richard Elliot (played by Armand Assante) enters the ER. He has a debilitating disease and needs an in-home nurse. He takes a liking to Sam and offers her a well-paid position as head nurse. He assures her that she would still be able to keep her job in the ER, and invites her and Alex to live in a section of his mansion for convenience. She denies at first, but upon discovering that Alex cannot be in the tutoring program due to lack of funds, she visits Elliot's home and asks if the offer still stands. In the 12th season finale, \\"21 Guns\\", Steve, an EMT Student named Mary and another prisoner named Rafe hatch an escape plot: Steve and Rafe injuring themselves and then escaping from the hospital. They stab Luka with a syringe as Sam looks on in horror. Because the syringe contained a paralyzing drug that would have led to his death, Sam steps in and treats him in spite of the prisoners' threats, saying she is going to make sure he doesn't die regardless of what they say; Steve makes his partners back off long enough for Sam to intubate Luka. They proceed to start shooting throughout the hospital once police catch on, using Sam as a hostage. Jerry Markovic is hurt in the shooting. Steve drags Sam outside, towards the getaway van. She begs him, \\"Think about Alex!\\" but as it turns out, he already had, and Alex is tied up inside the van. Sam immediately gets in the van after seeing Alex, and later, Steve tells her that God spoke to him, and told him he had to get his family back together. With Sam and Alex as hostages, the three attempt to make an escape to Canada. However, in the 13th season premiere, \\"Bloodline,\\" the escape hits a few obstacles; Sam attempts to get help, and a police officer chases after the group, ending with the officer's (presumed) death. As the three argue about the escape plan, Steve shoots and kills Rafe and Mary, leaving only Steve, Sam and Alex. Steve tells Sam that he would rather have himself, Sam and Alex dead than apart, and then proceeds to rape Sam. Some time after, Sam, lying next to a sleeping Steve, proceeds to make her getaway with Alex. As she is about to escape, however, she returns to the still sleeping Steve, grabs his gun and kills him. The next morning, she and Alex drive back to Chicago. Tired and panicked from her ordeal, she contacts Richard Elliot, who gets her an attorney, and instructs Sam to tell everyone she was raped by Steve and later killed him in self-defense. Despite an assistant District Attorney's suspicions that Sam is lying, Elliot, through his close friendship with highly placed city officials, manages to get Steve's death listed as a justifiable homicide, thus ending Sam's legal troubles. In \\"Somebody To Love\\", Alex tells Sam he saw her shoot Steve to death. In the remaining episodes of Season 13, Alex results in telling his friend that his dad will die, relating to the trauma of his own dad's death. He also steals a credit card from Archie Morris, and (accidentally) sets their apartment on fire by playing with alcohol. Sam reluctantly sends Alex to a school for at- risk youth, and reports to her ER colleagues that he is doing better every day. Professionally, Sam has started training as a nurse anesthetist. Sam's relationship with Abby Lockhart goes through several phases in Season 14; she initially tries to comfort her when Abby's two-year-old son Joe sustains a head injury, but later treats her with anger and disgust when she finds out Abby is an alcoholic who recently had a severe relapse after several years of sobriety. The two mend fences, however, and during her last shift at County in \\"The Book of Abby\\", Abby fiercely defends Sam to the board (who are investigating her) saying to Sam, \\"nurses have gotta stick together.\\" At the end of \\"The Chicago Way,\\" it is implied that either Samantha or Dr. Greg Pratt entered a booby-trapped ambulance. The subsequent explosion resulted in a season-ending cliffhanger. The Season 15 opener, \\"Life after Death\\", revealed that Dr. Greg Pratt was in the ambulance and later died from injuries sustained in the blast. Towards the end of Season 14, Sam begins a relationship with Dr. Tony Gates. Their relationship progresses and they end up moving in together in Season 15. After Alex was seriously injured in a car accident after Tony overruled Sam by allowing Alex to go out, their relationship deteriorates and Sam eventually decides to move out, thus ending the relationship, despite Tony's multiple apologies. Things are frosty between them as Sam cannot forgive Tony, however she admits to Chuny that she still loves him but forbids her from telling anyone. In \\"A Long, Strange Trip\\", Sam was reunited with younger sister Kelly (played by Shannon Woodward), now a successful fashion designer, for the first time since their mother kicked Sam out when she was a pregnant 15-year-old. Kelly tells Sam how their mother is dying of emphysema, and after reminiscing about their childhood, Sam relents and agrees to allow Kelly to move their mother to a Chicago nursing home. Sam sees her mother for the first time in 15 years in the episode \\"T Minus 6\\", but Mary Taggart does not recognise her daughter. In the next episode, Sam is shown visiting her mother in the nursing home, where they argue about why Sam lost contact with her family, before Mary asks Sam about her son. In the Season 15 episode \\"Old Times\\", Sam accompanies Neela to Seattle to pick up a kidney for a transplant in Chicago. She briefly met Carol Hathaway and Dr. Doug Ross who revealed how they used to work at County. In the series finale \\"And in the End,\\" the staff celebrates her birthday and Alex delivers her present: a bright red vintage Ford Mustang convertible, which Tony bought and fixed up with Alex's help. When she and Tony witness a husband losing his wife (and the description of his daughter about how he never lost his love for her despite her very negative and critical ways clearly resonates with Sam), they hold each other's hands, hinting that they might rekindle their relationship.

The right to take peat was particularly important in areas where firewood was scarce. The right to collect firewood was protected by estovers. In the New Forest of southern England, a particular right of turbary belongs not to an individual person, dwelling or plot of land, but to a particular hearth and chimney. Ecology In more recent times, as the ecological significance of the bog lands has been better understood, and as the amount of remaining peat has been decreasing, partly due to fuel usage and partly due to usage of peat as fertiliser, as well as agricultural incursions into drained bog lands, some of the remaining bogs have come under environmental protection. This has created controversy over the rights of turbary, and in some cases extinguished the right. Geography Geographic regions of turbary works in Europe include the Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and The Broads in Norfolk and Suffolk, England, and the Audomarois marshlands near Saint-Omer, France The term is also used in colloquial language by older generations in Ireland, in places such as County Clare, to refer to the area where turf is cut, or to the material extracted. Etymology The word is derived from Anglo-French turberie and Low German, turf. Compare Sanskrit darbh√°, meaning tuft of grass.Entries for turbary and turf.

French Renaissance literature is, for the purpose of this article, literature written in French (Middle French) from the French invasion of Italy in 1494 to 1600, or roughly the period from the reign of Charles VIII of France to the ascension of Henry IV of France to the throne. The reigns of Francis I (from 1515 to 1547) and his son Henry II (from 1547 to 1559) are generally considered the apex of the French Renaissance. After Henry II's unfortunate death in a joust, the country was ruled by his widow Catherine de' Medici and her sons Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III, and although the Renaissance continued to flourish, the French Wars of Religion between Huguenots and Catholics ravaged the country. The word \\"Renaissance\\" The word Renaissance is a French word, whose literal translation into English is \\"Rebirth\\". The term was first used and definedMurray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) The Art of the Renaissance. London: Thames & Hudson (World of Art), p. 9. by French historian Jules Michelet (1798‚Äì1874) in his 1855 work Histoire de France (History of France).Michelet, Jules. History of France, trans. G. H. Smith (New York: D. Appleton, 1847) Michelet defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world. As a French citizen and historian, Michelet also claimed the Renaissance as a French movement.Brotton, J., The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction, OUP, 2006 . His work is at the origin of the use of the French word \\"Renaissance\\" in other languages. Introduction The 16th century in France was a remarkable period of literary creation (the language of this period is called Middle French). The use of the printing press (aiding the diffusion of works by ancient Latin and Greek authors; the printing press was introduced in 1470 in Paris, and in 1473 in Lyon), the development of Renaissance humanism and Neoplatonism, and the discovery (through the wars in Italy and through Henry II‚Äôs marriage with Catherine de' Medici) of the cultivated refinement of the Italian courts (Baldassare Castiglione‚Äôs book The Courtier was also particularly important in this respect) would profoundly modify the French literary landscape and the mental outlook (or \\"mentalit√©\\") of the period. There is a slow evolution from the rude warrior class to a cultivated noble class (giving rise to the idea of the \\"honn√™te homme\\" in the 17th century). In all genres, there is a great interest in love (both physical and Platonic) and in psychological and moral analysis. This period saw a proliferation of pamphlets, tracts, satires, and memoirs; the success of short-story collections (\\"nouvelles\\") as well as collections of oral tales and anecdotes (\\"propos\\" and \\"devis\\"); a public fascination with tragic tales from Italy (most notably those of Bandello); a considerable increase in the translating and publishing of contemporary European authors (especially Italians and Spaniards) compared to authors from the Middle Ages and classical antiquity; an important increase in the number of religious works sold (devotional books would beat out the \\"belles-lettres\\" as the most sold genre in France at the beginning of the 17th century); and finally, the publication of important works of moral and philosophical reflection. The history of literature of the Renaissance is not monolithic: the royal court, the universities, the general public, the \\"noblesse de robe\\", the provincial noble, and the humanist all encountered different influences and developed different tastes. Humanist theater would come slowly to the general public; the old warrior class discovered court etiquette and polished manners only over time; and the extravagance of the Italian-inspired court was frequently criticized by detractors. Literacy itself is an important issue in the dissemination of the texts of the Renaissance: the culture of the 16th century remains profoundly oral, and the short story, the chivalric novel and Rabelais's works make this orality a central part of their style. Finally, the Renaissance book was a physical and economic object of great scarcity and ‚Äì depending on its size and illustrations ‚Äì of great prestige. A library such as Montaigne's was a rare occurrence for people other than lawyers and members of parliament who had had an elite education in the universities; for the public, the broadsheet or penny press (with woodcut illustrations) sold door to door by colporters would have been their only access to the written word. Poetry Poetry in the first years of the 16th century is characterised by the elaborate sonorous and graphic experimentation and skillful word games of a number of Northern poets (such as Jean Lemaire de Belges and Jean Molinet), generally called \\"les Grands Rh√©toriqueurs\\" who continued to develop poetic techniques from the previous century. Soon however, the impact of Petrarch (the sonnet cycle addressed to an idealised lover, the use of amorous paradoxes), Italian poets in the French court (like Luigi Alamanni), Italian Neoplatonism and humanism, and the rediscovery of certain Greek poets (such as Pindar and Anacreon) would profoundly modify the French tradition. In this respect, the French poets Cl√©ment Marot and Mellin de Saint-Gelais are transitional figures: they are credited with some of the first sonnets in French, but their poems continue to employ many of the traditional forms. Pierre de Ronsard The new direction of poetry is fully apparent in the work of the humanist Jacques Peletier du Mans. In 1541, he published the first French translation of Horace's Ars poetica and in 1547 he published a collection poems ≈íuvres po√©tiques, which included translations from the first two cantos of Homer's Odyssey and the first book of Virgil's Georgics, twelve Petrarchan sonnets, three Horacian odes and a Martial-like epigram; this poetry collection also included the first published poems of Joachim Du Bellay and Pierre de Ronsard. Around Ronsard, Du Bellay and Jean Antoine de Ba√Øf there formed a group of radical young noble poets of the court (generally known today as La Pl√©iade, although use of this term is debated). The character of their literary program was given in Du Bellay's manifesto, the \\"Defense and Illustration of the French Language\\" (1549) which maintained that French (like the Tuscan of Petrarch and Dante) was a worthy language for literary expression and which promulgated a program of linguistic and literary production (including the imitation of Latin and Greek genres) and purification. For some of the members of the Pl√©iade, the act of the poetry itself was seen as a form of divine inspiration (see Pontus de Tyard for example), a possession by the muses akin to romantic passion, prophetic fervor or alcoholic delirium. The forms that dominate the poetic production of the period are the Petrarchan sonnet (developed around an amorous encounter or an idealized woman) and the Horace/Anacreon ode (especially of the carpe diem ‚Äì life is short, seize the day ‚Äì variety). Ronsard also tried early on to adapt the Pindaric ode into French. Throughout the period, the use of mythology is frequent, but so too is a depiction of the natural world (woods, rivers). Other genres include the paradoxical encomium (such as Remy Belleau's poem praising the oyster), the \\"blason\\" of the female body (a poetic description of a body part), and propagandistic verse. Du Bellay's greatest poems were written during his long stay in Rome; his discovery of the ruined city, dismay at the corruption of the Papal court and loneliness gave rise to a sonnet cycle of remarkable sadness and severity (partially inspired by Ovid's Tristia). Although Ronsard attempted a long epic poem of the origins of the French monarchy entitled La Franciade (modeled on Virgil and Homer), this experiment was largely judged a failure, and he remains most remembered today for his various collections of Amours (or love poems), Odes and Hymnes. Jacques Pelletier du Mans later encyclopedic collection L'Amour des amours, consisting of a sonnet cycle and a series of poems describing meteors, planets and the heavens, would influence the poets Jean Antoine de Ba√Øf and Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas (whose Semaine is a Baroque description of the creation of the world). Agrippa d'Aubign√© Several poets of the period ‚Äì Jean Antoine de Ba√Øf (who founded an \\"Acad√©mie de musique et de po√©sie\\" in 1570), Blaise de Vigen√®re and others ‚Äì attempted to adapt into French the Latin, Greek or Hebrew poetic meters; these experiments were called \\"vers mesur√©s\\" and \\"prose mesur√©\\" (for more, see the article \\"musique mesur√©e\\"). Although the royal court was the center of much of the century's poetry, Lyon, the second-largest city in France in the Renaissance, also had its poets and humanists, most notably Maurice Sc√®ve, Louise Lab√©, Olivier de Magny, and Pontus de Tyard. Sc√®ve's D√©lie, objet de plus haulte vertu, composed of 449 ten-syllable ten- line poems (dizains) and published with numerous engraved emblems, is exemplary in its use of amorous paradoxes and (often obscure) allegory to describe the suffering of a lover. Similarly, Madeleine Des Roches and her daughter Catherine Des Roches were the center of a literary circle based in Poitiers between 1570 and 1587, and which included the poets Sc√©vole de Sainte-Marthe, Barnab√© Brisson, Ren√© Chopin, Antoine Loisel, Claude Binet, Nicolas Rapin and Odet de Turn√®be.Simonin, 351. Poetry at the end of the century was profoundly marked by the civil wars: pessimism, dourness and a call for retreat from the world predominate (as in Jean de Sponde). However, the horrors of the war were also to inspire one Protestant poet, Agrippa d'Aubign√©, to write a brilliant poem on the conflict:Les Tragiques.

From 1540 on however, the genre was dominated by foreign productions, most notably the Hispano- Portuguese multi-volume adventure novels Amadis de Gaule, Palmerin d'Olive, Primal√©on de Gr√®ce and others like them. The first of these, Amadis of Gaul ‚Äì in its celebrated French translation/adaptation by Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts ‚Äì became the de facto code of conduct of the French court from Francis I through Henry IV and was emulated in jousts and in manners. Of similar tone and content (albeit in verse), the Italian epic poems Roland amoureux (Orlando Innamorato) by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Roland furieux (Orlando furioso) by Ludovico Ariosto (and, at the end of the century, Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered) were also enormous successes (French translations of these works were often in prose). Finally, the Italian Luigi Pulci's Morgant le g√©ant, a comic version of the chivalric novel, was an important model for Rabelais's giants. Fran√ßois Rabelais The most notable French novels of the first half of the century are Fran√ßois Rabelais‚Äôs masterpieces Pantagruel, Gargantua and their sequels. Rabelais‚Äôs works blend both humanism (Erasmus, Thomas More) and medieval farce (giants, heroic battles, scatological humor) in a manner that is grotesquely extravagant (the language and humor were often viewed as coarse by later centuries), but along with the buffoonery there is a keen satire of religious hypocrisy, political injustice and human doubt. Alongside the chivalric, French literary tastes of the period were drawn to the amorous and pathetic, especially as depicted in the novels of Spaniards Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, themselves inspired by Boccaccio's Lady Fiammeta and its psychologically insightful portrayal of a woman spurned. This sentimental vein would find admirable expression in parts of H√©lisenne de Crenne‚Äôs Les Angoisses douloureuses qui proc√®dent d‚Äôamours which blends sentimental and chivalric elements, humanist scholarship, orality and eloquence. The foreign adventure novel would start to face competition from domestic French production in the second half of the century in the long works of authors B√©roalde de Verville and Nicolas de Montreux. These authors (largely unread today) ‚Äì like the authors of the later volumes of the Amadis cycle ‚Äì abandoned many of the traditional chivalric modes, replacing them with techniques and incidents borrowed from two new sources of inspiration: the ancient Greek novel (Heliodorus, Longus and Achilles Tatius) and the mixed-form (prose and verse) pastoral novel from Italy and Spain (Jacopo Sannazaro and Jorge de Montemayor). The novelty and inventiveness of the last years of the century are best seen in the anonymous La Mariane du Filomene (1596) which mixes the frame-tale, amorous sentiment, dreams, and pastoral elements to tell the story of a man wandering through the Parisian countryside trying to forget the woman who betrayed him. Notable works of long prose fiction, including translations (preceded by an --) published in France in the 16th century: * Jean Lemaire de Belges Les Illustrations de Gaule (1510) * -- Diego de San Pedro La Prison d‚ÄôAmour laquelle traite l‚Äôamour de Leriano et Laureole (13 editions between 1526‚Äì1604) * -- Juan de Flores Le Judgement d‚ÄôAmour or Histoire d‚ÄôAurelio et d‚ÄôIsabelle (1530) * Fran√ßois Rabelais Pantagruel (1532) * -- Boccaccio Complainte des tristes amours de Fiammette (1532) * Fran√ßois Rabelais Gargantua (1534) * -- Juan de Flores La D√©plourable fin de Flam√®te (translation by Maurice Sc√®ve, 1535) * -- Baldassare Castiglione Le Courtesan (1535) * H√©lisenne de Crenne (Marguerite Briet) Les Angoysses douloureuses qui procedent d‚Äôamours (1538) * -- Diego de San Pedro Les Amours d‚ÄôArnalte et de Lucenda or L‚Äôamant mal traict√© de s‚Äôamye (14 editions from 1539‚Äì1582) * -- Garci Rodr√≠guez de Montalvo Amadis de Gaule (first books translated by Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts, starting from 1540; for more on its sequels and translations, see the article on \\"Amadis of Gaul\\") * -- Jacopo Sannazaro Arcadia (1544) * -- Ariosto Roland furieux (prose translation, 1544) * Fran√ßois Rabelais Le tiers livre (1546) * -- Francesco Colonna Songe de Poliphile (with engravings attributed to Jean Goujon, 1546) * -- L‚Äôhistoire de Palmerin d‚ÄôOlive (translated by Jean Maugin, 1546) * -- Heliodorus of Emesa L‚Äôhistoire aethiopique (translated by Jacques Amyot, 1547) * Fran√ßois Rabelais Le quart livre (1552) * \\"Th√©odose Valentinian\\" L‚ÄôHistoire de l‚Äôamant resuscit√© par la mort d‚Äôamour (partly inspired by Diego de San Pedro, 1555) * -- Longus Les Amours pastorales de Daphnis et de Chlo√© (translated by Jacques Amyot, 1559) * Fran√ßois Rabelais (attributed) Le cinqui√®me livre (1564) * -- Achilles Tatius Les Amours de Clitophon et de Leucippe (translated by Fran√ßois de Belleforest, 1568) * Fran√ßois de Belleforest La Pyr√©n√©e (or La Pastorale amoureuse) (1571) * -- Jorge de Montemayor La Diane (1578) * Nicolas de Montreux Les Bergeries de Juliette (1585‚Äì98) * -- Tasso J√©rusalem d√©livr√©e (prose translation, 1587) * B√©roalde de Verville Les Avantures de Floride (1593‚Äì1596) * Nicolas de Montreux Les chastes et delectables Jardins d‚ÄôAmour (1594) * Nicolas de Montreux L‚Äô≈íuvre de la Chastet√© (1595-9) * (Anon) La Mariane du Filomene (1596) * (Anon) Les chastes amours d‚ÄôHelene de Marthe(1597) * Nicolas de Montreux Les Amours de Cleandre et Domiphille (1597) * B√©roalde de Verville Le Restablissement de Troye (1597) The short story The French Renaissance is dominated by the short story (under various names: \\"conte\\", a tale; \\"nouvelle\\", a short story like the Italian novella; \\"devis\\" and \\"propos\\", a spoken discussion; \\"histoire\\", a story). For the period, part of the attraction of the dialogued short story and the frame tale (with its fictional speakers discussing each other's stories) lies in their \\"performability\\" by someone reading out loud to a non-literate public and in their grab-bag and (frequently) digressive structure: these tales are capable of taking on all kinds of material, both sophisticated and vulgar. The Decameron, the short story collection by the Italian author Boccaccio, with its frame tale of nobles fleeing the plague and telling each other stories, had an enormous impact on French writers. The sister of Francis I, Marguerite of Navarre, who was the center of a progressive literary circle, undertook her own version (the Heptam√©ron) which, although incomplete, is one of the masterpieces of the century. Other important writers of short stories include No√´l du Fail and Bonaventure des P√©riers. As the century progressed, the use of oral discourse, multiple voices and table talk led to a dialogued form which often seems revolutionary and chaotic to modern ears. The French reading public was also fascinated by the dark tragic novellas (\\"histoires tragiques\\") of Bandello which were avidly adapted and emulated into the beginning of the seventeenth century (Jacques Yver, V√©rit√© Habanc, B√©nigne Poissenot, Fran√ßois de Rosset, Jean-Pierre Camus).

For the first decades of the century, public theater remained largely tied to its long medieval heritage of mystery plays, morality plays, farces, and soties, although the miracle play was no longer in vogue. Public performances were tightly controlled by a guild system. The guild \\"les Confr√®res de la Passion\\" had exclusive rights to theatrical productions of mystery plays in Paris; in 1548, fear of violence or blasphemy resulting from the growing religious rift in France forced the Paris Parliament to prohibit performances of the mysteries in the capital, although they continued to be performed in other places. Another guild, the \\"Enfants Sans-Souci\\" were in charge of farces and soties, as too the \\"Clercs de la Basoche\\" who also performed morality plays. Like the \\"Confr√®res de la Passion\\", \\"la Basoche\\" came under political scrutiny (plays had to be authorized by a review board; masks or characters depicting living persons were not permitted), and they were finally suppressed in 1582. By the end of the century, only the \\"Confr√®res de la Passion\\" remained with exclusive control over public theatrical productions in Paris, and they rented out their theater at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne to theatrical troupes for a high price. In 1599, they abandoned this privilege. It is of note that, alongside the numerous writers of these traditional works (such as the farce writers Pierre Gringore, Nicolas de La Chesnaye and Andr√© de la Vigne), Marguerite of Navarre also wrote a number of plays close to the traditional mystery and morality play. As early as 1503 however, original language versions of Sophocles, Seneca, Euripides, Aristophanes, Terence and Plautus were all available in Europe and the next forty years would see humanists and poets both translating these classics and adapting them. In the 1540s, the French university setting (and especially -- from 1553 on -- the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theater (in Latin) written by professors such as George Buchanan and Marc Antoine Muret which would leave a profound mark on the members of La Pl√©iade. From 1550 on, one finds humanist theater written in French. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in humanist tragedy. His plays -- which were essentially chamber plays meant to be read for their lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory -- brought to many humanist tragedies a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action. Humanist tragedy took two distinct directions: * Biblical tragedy : plots taken from the bible -- although close in inspiration to the medieval mystery plays, the humanist biblical tragedy reconceived the biblical characters along classical lines, suppressing both comic elements and the presence of God on the stage. The plots often had clear parallels to contemporary political and religious matters and one finds both Protestant and Catholic playwrights. * Ancient tragedy : plots taken from mythology or history -- they often had clear parallels to contemporary political and religious matters During the height of the civil wars (1570‚Äì1580), a third category of militant theater appeared: * Contemporary tragedy : plots taken from recent events Along with their work as translators and adaptors of plays, the humanists also investigated classical theories of dramatic structure, plot, and characterization. Horace was translated in the 1540s, but had been available throughout the Middle Ages. A complete version of Aristotle's Poetics appeared later (first in 1570 in an Italian version), but his ideas had circulated (in an extremely truncated form) as early as the 13th century in Hermann the German's Latin translation of Averroes' Arabic gloss, and other translations of the Poetics had appeared in the first half of the 16th century; also of importance were the commentaries on Aristotle's poetics by Julius Caesar Scaliger which appeared in the 1560s. The fourth century grammarians Diomedes and Aelius Donatus were also a source of classical theory. The 16th-century Italians played a central role in the publishing and interpretation of classical dramatic theory, and their works had a major effect on French theater. Lodovico Castelvetro's Aristote-based Art of Poetry (1570) was one of the first enunciations of the three unities; this work would inform Jean de la Taille's Art de la tragedie (1572). Italian theater (like the tragedy of Gian Giorgio Trissino) and debates on decorum (like those provoked by Sperone Speroni's play Canace and Giovanni Battista Giraldi's play Orbecche) would also influence the French tradition. In the same spirit of imitation -- and adaptation -- of classical sources that had informed the poetic compositions of La Pl√©iade, French humanist writers recommended that tragedy should be in five acts and have three main characters of noble rank; the play should begin in the middle of the action (in medias res), use noble language and not show scenes of horror on the stage. Some writers (like Lazare de Ba√Øf and Thomas S√©billet) attempted to link the medieval tradition of morality plays and farces to classical theater, but Joachim du Bellay rejected this claim and elevated classical tragedy and comedy to a higher dignity. Of greater difficulty for the theorists was the incorporation of Aristotle's notion of \\"catharsis\\" or the purgation of emotions with Renaissance theater, which remained profoundly attached to both pleasing the audience and to the rhetorical aim of showing moral examples (exemplum). √âtienne Jodelle's Cl√©op√¢tre captive (1553) -- which tells the impassioned fears and doubts of Cleopatra contemplating suicide -- has the distinction of being the first original French play to follow Horace's classical precepts on structure (the play is in five acts and respects more or less the unities of time, place and action) and is extremely close to the ancient model: the prologue is introduced by a shade, there is a classical chorus which comments on the action and talks directly to the characters, and the tragic ending is described by a messenger. Mellin de Saint-Gelais's translation of Gian Giorgio Trissino's La Sophonisbe -- the first modern regular tragedy based on ancient models which tells the story of the noble Sophonisba's suicide (rather than be taken as captive by Rome) -- was an enormous success at the court when performed in 1556.

Alongside tragedy, European humanists also adapted the ancient comedic tradition and as early as the 15th century, Renaissance Italy had developed a form of humanist Latin comedy. Although the ancients had been less theoretical about the comedic form, the humanists used the precepts of Aelius Donatus (4th century A.D.), Horace, Aristotle and the works of Terence to elaborate a set of rules: comedy should seek to correct vice by showing the truth; there should be a happy ending; comedy uses a lower style of language than tragedy; comedy does not paint the great events of states and leaders, but the private lives of people, and its principal subject is love. Although some French authors kept close to the ancient models (Pierre de Ronsard translated a part of Aristophanes's \\"Plutus\\" at college), on the whole the French comedic tradition shows a great deal of borrowing from all sources: medieval farce (which continued to be immensely popular throughout the century), the short story, Italian humanist comedies and \\"La Celestina\\" (by Fernando de Rojas). The most prolific of the French Renaissance comedic authors, Pierre de Larivey, adapted Italian comedies of intrigue by the authors Ludovico Dolce, Niccol√≤ Buonaparte, Lorenzino de' Medici, Antonio Francesco Grazzini, Vincenzo Gabbiani, Girolano Razzi, Luigi Pasqualigo, and Nicol·Ω∏ Secchi.

The most famous of these is Robert Garnier's Bradamante (1580), adapted from Ariosto's Orlando furioso. * the Pastoral -- modeled on Giambattista Guarini's \\"Pastor fido\\" (\\"Faithful Shepard\\"), Tasso's \\"Aminta\\" and Antonio Ongaro \\"Alceo\\" (themselves inspired by Jacopo Sannazaro and Jorge de Montemayor). The first French pastorals were short plays performed before a tragedy, but were eventually expanded into five acts. Nicolas de Montreux wrote three pastorals: Athlette (1585), Diane (1592) Arim√®ne ou le berger d√©sesp√©r√© (1597). * the Ballet de cour -- an allegorical and fantastic mixture of dance and theater. The most famous of these is the \\"Ballet comique de la reine\\" (1581). By the end of the century, the most influential French playwright -- by the range of his styles and by his mastery of the new forms -- would be Robert Garnier. All of these eclectic traditions would continue to evolve in the \\"baroque\\" theater of the early 17th century, before French \\"classicism\\" would finally impose itself. Other literary forms Michel de Montaigne The French Renaissance was rich in a whole body of moral, literary, philological and philosophical writing. Michel de Montaigne was the first essayist of modern times (The Essays) and a remarkable writer on the human condition. √âtienne Pasquier's Recherches de la France was another monumental compendium of historical, political and cultural observations. Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant√¥me wrote biographical sketches of the men and women of the court. Jean Bodin wrote a number of important works on political science. Henri Estienne and his son Robert Estienne were among the most important printers in France in the 16th century, and Robert Estienne's edition of the Bible was the first to use chapter and verse divisions. The Catholic/Huguenot and civil/political conflicts of the last half of the century‚Äîthe French Wars of Religion‚Äîgenerated a great deal of political, religious and satirical writing, including the Monarchomachs' libels. The Satire M√©nipp√©e (1593/1594) written by Nicolas Rapin, Jean Passerat and Florent Chrestien, and edited/revised by Pierre Pithou was a political and satirical work in prose and verse which criticized the excesses of the Catholic League during the Wars of Religion.

Wetware computers composed of neurons are different than conventional computers because they are thought to be capable in a way of \\"thinking for themselves\\", because of the dynamic nature of neurons. While wetware is still largely conceptual, there has been limited success with construction and prototyping, which has acted as a proof of the concept's realistic application to computing in the future. The most notable prototypes have stemmed from the research completed by biological engineer William Ditto during his time at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His work constructing a simple neurocomputer capable of basic addition from leech neurons in 1999 was a significant discovery for the concept. This research acted as a primary example driving interest in the creation of these artificially constructed, but still organic brains.  Overview  The concept of wetware is an application of specific interest to the field of computer manufacturing. Moore‚Äôs law, which states that the number of transistors which can be placed on a silicon chip is doubled roughly every two years, has acted as a goal for the industry for decades, but as the size of computers continues to decrease, the ability to meet this goal has become more difficult, threatening to reach a plateau. Due to the difficulty in reducing the size of computers because of size limitations of transistors and integrated circuits, wetware provides an unconventional alternative. A wetware computer composed of neurons is an ideal concept because, unlike conventional materials which operate in binary (on/off), a neuron can shift between thousands of states, constantly altering its chemical conformation, and redirecting electrical pulses through over 200,000 channels in any of its many synaptic connections. Because of this large difference in the possible settings for any one neuron, compared to the binary limitations of conventional computers, the space limitations are far fewer.  Background  The concept of wetware is distinct and unconventional, and draws slight resonance with both hardware and software from conventional computers. While hardware is understood as the physical architecture of traditional computational devices, built from electrical circuitry and silicone plates, software represents the encoded architecture of storage and instructions. Wetware is a separate concept which utilizes the formation of organic molecules, mostly complex cellular structures (such as neurons), to create a computational device such as a computer. In wetware the ideas of hardware and software are intertwined and interdependent. The molecular and chemical composition of the organic or biological structure would represent not only the physical structure of the wetware but also the software, being continually reprogrammed by the discrete shifts in electrical pulses and chemical concentration gradients as the molecules change their structures to communicate signals. The responsiveness of a cell, proteins, and molecules to changing conformations, both within their own structures and around them, tie the idea of internal programming and external structure together in a way which is alien to the current model of conventional computer architecture. The structure of wetware represents a model where the external structure and internal programming are interdependent and unified; meaning that changes to the programming or internal communication between molecules of the device would represent a physical change in the structure. The dynamic nature of wetware borrows from the function of complex cellular structures in biological organisms. The combination of ‚Äúhardware‚Äù and ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù into one dynamic, and interdependent system which utilizes organic molecules and complexes to create an unconventional model for computational devices is a specific example of applied biorobotics. = The cell as a model of wetware = Cells in many ways can be seen as their own form of naturally occurring wetware, similar to the concept that the human brain is the preexisting model system for complex wetware. In his book Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell (2009) Dennis Bray explains his theory that cells, which are the most basic form of life, are just a highly complex computational structure, like a computer. To simplify one of his arguments a cell can be seen as a type of computer, utilizing its own structured architecture. In this architecture, much like a traditional computer, many smaller components operate in tandem to receive input, process the information, and compute an output. In an overly simplified, non-technical analysis, cellular function can be broken into the following components: Information and instructions for execution are stored as DNA in the cell, RNA acts as a source for distinctly encoded input, processed by ribosomes and other transcription factors to access and process the DNA and to output a protein. Bray's argument in favor of viewing cells and cellular structures as models of natural computational devices is important when considering the more applied theories of wetware in relation to biorobotics. = Biorobotics = Wetware and biorobotics are closely related concepts, which both borrow from similar overall principles. A biorobotic structure can be defined as a system modeled from a preexisting organic complex or model such as cells (neurons) or more complex structures like organs (brain) or whole organisms. Unlike wetware the concept of biorobotics is not always a system composed of organic molecules, but instead could be composed of conventional material which is designed and assembled in a structure similar or derived from a biological model. Biorobotics have many applications, and are used to address the challenges of conventional computer architecture. Conceptually, designing a program, robot, or computational device after a preexisting biological model such as a cell, or even a whole organism, provides the engineer or programmer the benefits of incorporating into the structure the evolutionary advantages of the model.  Applications and goals  = Basic neurocomputer composed of leech neurons = In 1999 William Ditto and his team of researchers at Georgia Institute of technology and Emory University created a basic form of a wetware computer capable of simple addition by harnessing leech neurons. Leeches were used as a model organism due to the large size of their neuron, and the ease associated with their collection and manipulation. The computer was able to complete basic addition through electrical probes inserted into the neuron. The manipulation of electrical currents through neurons was not a trivial accomplishment, however. Unlike conventional computer architecture, which is based on the binary on/off states, neurons are capable of existing in thousands of states and communicate with each other through synaptic connections which each contain over 200,000 channels. Each can be dynamically shifted in a process called self- organization to constantly form and reform new connections. A conventional computer program called the dynamic clamp was written by Eve Marder, a neurobiologist at Brandeis University that was capable of reading the electrical pulses from the neurons in real times, and interpreting them. This program was used to manipulate the electrical signals being input into the neurons to represent numbers, and to communicate with each other to return the sum. While this computer is a very basic example of a wetware structure it represents a small example with fewer neurons than found in a more complex organ. It is thought by Ditto that by increasing the amount of neurons present the chaotic signals sent between them will self-organize into a more structured pattern, such as the regulation of heart neurons into a constant heartbeat found in humans and other living organisms. = Biological models for conventional computing = After his work creating a basic computer from leech neurons, Ditto continued to work not only with organic molecules and wetware, but also on the concept of applying the chaotic nature of biological systems and organic molecules to conventional material and logic gates. Chaotic systems have advantages for generating patterns and computing higher order functions like memory, arithmetic logic, and input/output operations. In his article Construction of a Chaotic Computer Chip Ditto discusses the advantages in programming of using chaotic systems, with their greater sensitivity to respond and reconfigure logic gates in his conceptual chaotic chip. The main difference between a chaotic computer chip and a conventional computer chip is the reconfigurability of the chaotic system. Unlike a traditional computer chip, where a programmable gate array element must be reconfigured through the switching of many single-purpose logic gates, a chaotic chip is able to reconfigure all logic gates through the control of the pattern generated by the non-linear chaotic element. = Impact of wetware in cognitive biology = Cognitive biology evaluates cognition as a basic biological function. W. Tecumseh Fitch, a professor of cognitive biology at the University of Vienna, is a leading theorist on ideas of cellular intentionality. The idea is that not only do whole organisms have a sense of \\"aboutness\\" of intentionality, but that single cells also carry a sense of intentionality through cells' ability to adapt and reorganize in response to certain stimuli. Fitch discusses the idea of nano-intentionality, specifically in regards to neurons, in their ability to adjust rearrangements in order to create neural networks. He discusses the ability of cells such as neurons to respond independently to stimuli such as damage to be what he considers \\"intrinsic intentionality\\" in cells, explaining that \\"[w]hile at a vastly simpler level than intentionality at the human cognitive level, I propose that this basic capacity of living things [response to stimuli] provides the necessary building blocks for cognition, and higher-order intentionality.\\" Fitch describes the value of his research to specific areas of computer science such as artificial intelligence and computer architecture. He states that \\"[I]f a researcher aims to make a conscious machine, doing it with rigid switches (whether vacuum tubes or static silicon chips) is barking up the wrong tree.\\" Fitch believes that an important aspect of the development of areas such as artificial intelligence is wetware with nano-intentionalility, and autonomous ability to adapt and restructure itself. In a review of the above-mentioned research conducted by Fitch, Daniel Dennett, a professor at Tufts University, discusses the importance of the distinction between the concept of hardware and software when evaluating the idea of wetware and organic material such as neurons. Dennett discusses the value of observing the human brain as a preexisting example of wetware. He sees the brain as having \\"the competence of a silicon computer to take on an unlimited variety of temporary cognitive roles.\\" Dennett disagrees with Fitch on certain areas, such as the relationship of software/hardware versus wetware, and what a machine with wetware might be capable of. Dennett highlights the importance of additional research into human cognition to better understand the intrinsic mechanism by which the human brain can operate, in order to better create an organic computer. = Future applications = The subfield of organic computers and wetware is still largely hypothetical and in a preliminary stage. While there has yet to be major developments in the creation of an organic computer since the neuron based calculator developed by Ditto in the 1990s, research continues to push the field forward. Projects such as the modeling of chaotic pathways in silicon chips by Ditto have made new discoveries in ways of organizing traditional silicon chips, and structuring computer architecture to be more efficient and better structured. Ideas emerging from the field of cognitive biology also help to continue to push discoveries in ways of structuring systems for artificial intelligence, to better imitate preexisting systems in humans. In a proposed fungal computer using Basidiomycetes, information is represented by spikes of electrical activity, a computation is implemented in a mycelium network, and an interface is realized via fruit bodies.

Tom√°s studied humanities at Burgos, and at the age of fifteen took the habit of the Augustinians at Valladolid, where he finished his theology and was appointed professor in the college. His activity was inexhaustible, and among the many works which he accomplished during his episcopate were the foundation in Salamanca of the Colegio de Calatrava for the promotion of ecclesiastical courses, the erection of a handsome church to San Juan de Sahag√∫n, patron of the city, and of six smaller churches in other cities. Bishop C√°mara was primarily a polemicist and orator. His great learning, extraordinary talents, varied interests, and untiring activity made him one of the most prominent figures of the Spanish episcopate during the 19th century. No great work was undertaken for the Catholic Church in which he did not figure in the foremost rank, in posts of danger and enterprises of the greatest importance, making him beloved by the Catholics and feared by the enemies of the Church. In congresses, assemblies, the Senate, the press, and in every situation where noble and sacred interests were to be safeguarded, he was to be found.

The interchange is located at exit 57 on the Capital Beltway, exit 170 on I-95, and exit 1 on I-395. Some people, including many Washington-area media sources, refer to this interchange as the \\"Mixing Bowl\\" because, prior to the reconstruction, local and long distance travelers shared the same lanes and travelers had to merge to the right or left to reach the correct lanes for their destination. The last of this weaving and merging was eliminated on April 21, 2007. History Aerial view in 2018 The interchange was originally built in the 1960s as a simple interchange between I-95 and the Capital Beltway. At the time, I-95 was expected to go through the District of Columbia. After community opposition prevented its construction through the city in 1977, I-95 was shifted to the eastern portion of the Beltway, between Springfield and College Park, Maryland, eliminating the I-495 designation there (although that designation was reinstated in 1989). Because of this route change, all traffic continuing on I-95 through the Washington area was exiting at Springfield through an interchange not designed for that purpose. By early 1970, there were 150,000 vehicles per day traveling through the intersection. Thirty years later, that number had more than doubled, with the effect that vehicles \\"traveling along the East Coast's main north-south artery [had to] be funneled through the ordinary exit ramps at Springfield, routinely causing backups several miles long.\\" A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration determined the interchange to be the site of 179 crashes between 1993 and 1994‚Äîmore than any other spot on I-95‚Äîand found that the number of ramp accidents was more than double that of any other Beltway interchange. Major reconstruction (1999‚Äì2007) In March 1999, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) began an eight-year, seven-phase reconstruction project, which also involved the reconstruction of the I-95/Route 644 interchange. The project was one of the largest highway construction projects in the U.S., costing $676 million. Springfield Interchange in 2006.

Since 2012, commuters can access the I-95 Express Lanes directly from the Beltway. =Phase 1= Completed 1999 * Add another lane to southbound Interstate 95. =Phases 2 and 3= Completed November 2001 * Reconstruct the I-95/Route 644 interchange. * Make the I-95 Northbound entry ramp from eastbound Route 644 enter on the right. * Reconstruct the Commerce Street bridge. * Improve the Amherst Street bridge. * Construct a flyover from westbound Route 644 onto I-95 south and therefore demolish the original cloverleaf that served this purpose * Add an express bridge for Route 644 * Make the I-95 North ramp onto Exit 169 separate from I-95 * Add a cloverleaf ramp from I-95 North onto Route 644 westbound * Construct a bridge from eastbound Route 644 onto the I-95 Express Lanes (northbound only). * Reconstruct the I-95 Express Lane ramp (southbound only) onto Route 644 westbound. =Phase 4= Completed October 2004 * Relocate the Outer Loop, eastbound I-495, of Interstate 495 where it crosses I-395, this time making it a higher bridge. * Add a two-lane flyover bridge from I-495 West/I-95 South/Capital Beltway Inner Loop, back to I-95 South (even this bridge is sometimes congested during afternoon hours). =Phase 5= Completed May 2004 * Reconstruct the ramp from I-395 Southbound onto I-495 North/Capital Beltway Inner Loop * Widen a small portion of the Capital Beltway northwest of I-395 =Phases 6 and 7= Completed July 2007 * Construct a one-lane flyover connecting I-395 South onto I-95 North/I-495 Outer Loop, opened on October 2, 2005. * Construct a flyover connecting I-395 South and I-495 Outer Loop onto the Route 644 exit, opened on October 5, 2005. * Construct a two-lane flyover for I-95 North express travelers onto I-495 Outer Loop, opened on January 19, 2006. * Construct a three-lane flyover connecting I-95 North onto I-495 Inner Loop and therefore demolish the old cloverleaf ramp serving this purpose, opened on August 24, 2006. * Construct a new two-lane bridge, exiting the Beltway from the right lane as opposed to the old ramp that exited on the left, connecting I-495 Outer Loop with I-395 North, opened on March 15, 2007.New Beltway Outer Loop Ramp to I-395 North Opens Thursday Morning * Separate travelers heading onto I-395 North/I-495/I-95 North from Route 644 westbound by giving them their own lanes and reconstructing the original ramp connecting I-95 North with the Outer Loop. The new ramp allowing these maneuvers opened on April 21, 2007. The ramp to I-395 now joins the main northbound lanes to the north of the previous merge after passing under the Outer Loop; the advantage of this design is that it eliminates the need for traffic taking this route to merge left onto I-395 at the same spot where traffic exiting I-95 onto the flyover ramp to the Inner Loop is required to move right. On the same date that this new ramp opened, the northbound lanes of I-395 were shifted slightly to the right (east) onto a new overpass over the Inner Loop, eliminating a sharp left-right movement over a potholed stretch of pavement that had existed for several years during the construction. * Separate travelers from I-495 and I-395 South heading onto Route 644 by giving their own lanes, completed in mid-2007. The two-lane ramp from the Outer Loop (I-495 East) to I-95 South opened on December 15, 2006. Workers planned to open the ramp on December 6, but between December 6 and 15, the 5:00-9:00 temperature was below 45 ¬∞F (about 7 ¬∞C),New Ramp Opening: I-495 East (Outer Loop) to I-95 South preventing the lane markings from sticking. The original ramp from the Outer Loop to I-95 South was temporarily closed when this new ramp opened to allow for sound wall work. The old ramp reopened in late May 2007 and is signed to carry traffic from the Outer Loop to westbound Route 644 (Old Keene Mill Road). Signs direct Outer Loop traffic heading to eastbound Route 644 (Franconia Road) to use the new ramp opened in 2006. The remaining lanes on the ramps to Route 644 from the Inner Loop and from southbound I-395 opened at the same time as the reopening of the original Outer Loop ramp (now signed as Exit 169B). Contrary to original indications, no barrier separates westbound and eastbound traffic; rather, the design is intended to eliminate the need for drivers to change lanes to reach the proper ramps for their destination. Upon completion, The Washington Post noted: \\"The project began in 1994 with a budget of $241 million. By 2002, it had nearly tripled, to $676 million, and a federal audit found that VDOT had underestimated costs and mismanaged funds. As recently as [2005], the project was months behind schedule, and managers predicted that it would not be completed on time. But VDOT officials pressured the primary contractor, including issuing a formal default letter, and work was put back on schedule without adding costs.\\" The project was completed on time in July 2007. The new interchange has 50 ramps and bridges, is 24 lanes at its widest point, and has a capacity of 500,000 vehicles per day. =Phase 8= Phase 8 involved the construction of ramps connecting Shirley Highway's reversible center carriageway (HOV lanes) to the Capital Beltway. It was originally planned to be part of the Springfield Interchange Project but, due to cost overruns, was moved to the future Capital Beltway widening project, which was to include HOV lanes on the Capital Beltway. Phase 8 was subsequently deferred when the Beltway widening was delayed. Phase 8 was eventually constructed as part of the I-495 Express Lanes (high-occupancy/toll lanes) project and the Phase 8 ramps opened to traffic on November 17, 2012. =Other improvements= To aid commuters during construction, VDOT added 5,000 park-and-ride spaces, created a vanpool program, increased safety patrols to clear breakdowns, created a project web site, and distributed notifications of lane closures via an email list. VDOT also maintained a storefront office in the Springfield Mall.  Earlier uses of the \\"Mixing Bowl\\" name  The term \\"Mixing Bowl\\" was previously used to refer to the interchange between I-395 and State Route 27 in Arlington, near the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery; this interchange, like the Springfield one, contains a large number of lanes and ramps. However, most news reports on the Springfield Interchange refer to it as the \\"Mixing Bowl\\", and the term has become generally accepted. The other interchange is now known as the Pentagon road network.

Commemorative medal for the Battle of White Mountain with portrait of Emperor Ferdinand II by Giovanni Pietro de Pomis A medalist (or medallist) is an artist who designs medals, plaquettes, badges, coins and similar small works in relief in metal. Historically medalists were typically also involved in producing their designs, and were usually either sculptors or goldsmiths by background. In modern times medalists are mostly primarily sculptors of larger works, but in the past the number of medals and coins produced were sufficient to allow specialists who spent most of their career producing them. From the 19th century the education of a medalist often began with as an engraver, or a formal education in an academy, particularly modeling and portraiture. On coins a mark or symbol signifying the medalist as the original designer was often included in a hidden location on the coin and is not to be mistaken for the symbol of the mint master. Artistic medals and plaquettes are often signed prominently by the artist. Background Medieval tornesel coin die from Frankfurt am Main Artistic medals have been produced since the late Renaissance period, and, after some classical precedents and Late Medieval revivals, the form was essentially invented by Pisanello, who is credited with the first portrait medal, which has remained a very popular type. He cast them like bronze sculptures, rather than minting them like coins. Medalists are also often confusingly referred to as \\"engravers\\" in reference works, referring to the \\"engraving\\" of dies, although this is often in fact not the technique used; however many also worked in engraving, the technique in printmaking. The production of coins is accomplished through the use of either a die for minting coins by hammering or, in modern times, milling or, mostly in prehistoric times and also in Asia, a mold for casting the desired object. Artistic medals and plaquettes have mostly been produced by lost wax casting. The design for the coin faces were originally engraved into the coin dies. It was necessary to use a burin to engrave the designs directly into the die inverted (i.e. raised areas of finished coin were hollowed out on the die) and as a mirror image so that the finished coin appeared correct. This resulted in the early medalists being called steel-chiselers. Medalists who were contracted by the state to produce the coins and medallions for the mint were often given official state titles. In addition to their state contracts, medalists were also allowed to earn income through private commissions for medals.

Whitehead was born in Colney Hatch Lane, Muswell Hill, Middlesex to Jeffery Whitehead, a stockbroker, and his wife Jane Ashton Tinker. After education at Elstree, Hertfordshire and the Edinburgh Institution he faced health problems and was sent to recuperate to Engadine in Switzerland in 1881 and then to warm Corsica in 1882 where he discovered a bird new to science, the Corsican nuthatch.

Biography Born to Joseph and Martha Peck in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, Mary married John Butterworth, son of a British captain in 1710. Mary allegedly started her counterfeiting operation around 1716. According to those who would later testify against her, she used starched cotton cloths to produce counterfeit bills, rather than the metal plates used more commonly in counterfeiting. Using a slightly dampened piece of starched cloth she was able to lift ink from a genuine bill. With a hot iron, she transferred a pattern from the cloth to a blank paper bill, then inked the pattern by hand with quill pens. The original cotton cloth was easily disposed of through burning, leaving no hard evidence of a crime. Butterworth allegedly organized her counterfeiting operation into a cottage industry, sternly overseeing the work of the entire family. At the height of her operation, she was reportedly selling counterfeit bills at half their face value. Colonial authorities knew of an extensive counterfeiting ring operating somewhere in the Rhode Island area throughout the later half of the 1710s, and felt it was beginning to have a damaging impact on the entire colonial economy. In 1722 colonial authorities became suspicious of Mary Butterworth after her husband John purchased a large, expensive new home for the family. On August 14, 1723 a trial was held in Newport, Rhode Island. One Nicholas Campe testified he passed two counterfeit Rhode Island bills he obtained through Butterworth. Two of Butterworth's associates (her brother and his wife) turned state's evidence and also testified against her. Ultimately though, the court dismissed all charges against her for lack of hard evidence. Under the legal code of 1710 in colonial Rhode Island if any of the Butterworth family had been convicted of the crime of counterfeiting they would have faced severe punishment. > [The offender] was to suffer the pains of having their ears cropped, to be > whipped or fined at discretion and imprisoned as the nature of the offense > requires, and to pay double damage to the persons defrauded. In case the > offender had no estate, he should be set at work, or sold for any term of > years which the discretion of the judges considered satisfactory. After the trial, Mrs. Butterworth reportedly gave up counterfeiting. She died in 1775 in Bristol County, Massachusetts, aged 88.

Prior to his election as archbishop, Carroll served as Bishop of Wagga Wagga between 1968 and 1983. Carroll served as president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference between 2000 and 2006. Early career Carroll was born in Ganmain, New South Wales, the second of seven children of Patrick and Rose Carroll. He was ordained a priest in 1954 in St Brendan's Church, Ganmain. After service in Griffith and Albury, Carroll was appointed to the role of Assistant Diocesan Inspector of Schools and became Director of Catholic Education for the Diocese of Wagga Wagga in 1965. Episcopate In 1968 he was appointed Bishop of Wagga Wagga by Paul VI. He has been a spiritual director to the Cursillo movement and was a member of the first National Catholic Education Commission (from 1969 to 1971). In 1974, he was appointed to the International Catechetical Commission, an appointment he held for 18 years. He was the Australian representative at the Synod of Bishops on Catechesis in 1977 and was the first chairperson of the National Catholic Education Commission from 1974 to 1978, remaining a member until 1988. In 1983 he was appointed Archbishop of CanberraGoulburn with his seat at St Christopher's Cathedral, Manuka, Australian Capital Territory. In 1986, he welcomed John Paul II on his arrival in Australia. Popularly known as \\"Father Francis\\", he served the church in Canberra for 23 years. The development of Catholic schools in the archdiocese is a significant part of his legacy, in addition to his role in helping to bring about government aid to private schools in Australia. He was also the first Australian bishop to call a diocesan synod since the Second Vatican Council. It was held in Canberra during 1989 with a subsequent synod in 2004. The synod's recommendations accepted by the archbishop were the formation of a commission for women, a commitment to resource and support the Catholic youth ministry team for a period of five years, the embracing of the concept of encouraging parishes to implement family-based sacramental programs and calling on parishes to consider the employment of pastoral associates possibly in conjunction with neighbouring parishes. However, the synod's proposals were not without their detractors. In 2001, Carroll signed a decree that reduced the holy days of obligation to Christmas, the Assumption and every Sunday as the days on which Catholics in Australia are obliged to attend Mass. As president of the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference he sought to find ways to meet the church's challenge of a decline in priestly vocations, including considering married priests: He also advocated for the extension of Australian visas for asylum seekers, particularly from Timor Leste. For over ten years, Carroll sought the creation of a special visa category for the East Timorese asylum seekers, most of whom are active members of the Catholic community and have lived in Australia. While this request was not approved by the Howard government, it triggered the personal intervention of the Minister for Immigration to grant permanent residency status to the asylum seekers where appropriate. In August 2005, prior to attaining 75 years of age, Carroll submitted his resignation to Benedict XVI, which was accepted the following month, but he continued in the role until his replacement, Mark Coleridge, was appointed in June 2006. Honours He was awarded the Centenary Medal on 1 January 2001 for \\"Service to Australian Society through the Roman Catholic Church\\". In February 2006, as a result if a public appeal, a scholarship was established to help students attend the Canberra campus of the Australian Catholic University. The Francis Carroll Scholarship provides financial support to students who relocate from rural or regional areas of the Archdiocese of CanberraGoulburn or the Diocese of Wagga Wagga to undertake an Education course at the Canberra campus. In May 2006, Carroll was awarded the Doctor of the University (Univ.D), honoris causa, the highest honour from the Australian Catholic University. The award recognised Carroll's contribution to Catholic education.

Location and influence The Belgrade Arena is situated in New Belgrade. Arena's parking is limited in spaces, though nearby residential areas provide enough room for vehicles. It is a 10-minute walk from Novi Beograd railway station, which offers international train services from Austria, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia, domestic train services (fast and regional trains) to and from Novi Sad, Subotica and ≈†id and urban rail services BG Voz. It takes a 15-minute drive from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to the arena. Ride from downtown Belgrade would take the same amount of time, unless in rush-hour, when it could take up to 30 minutes to get to central Novi Beograd, where the arena is located. The construction of the arena has caused a substantial increase in prices for apartments in the surrounding area, which are mostly new. A new modern business district is scheduled to be constructed across the Belgrade Arena. Hotel IN was the first new hotel to be built near the arena however the venue is also within walking distance from Hyatt Regency Belgrade and Crowne Plaza Belgrade.

Yet, when the construction of the arena was finished in 2004, it was given the official name Beogradska Arena (Belgrade Arena). In February 2007, Serbian basketball coach Bo≈æidar Maljkoviƒá started an initiative to name the Arena after another renowned Serbian basketball coach, Aleksandar Nikoliƒá.

During UEFA Futsal Euro 2016, which has been held in February 2016, the Arena has been renamed from Kombank Arena to Belgrade Arena, for sponsorship reasons. In October 2017, the arena was once again renamed, this time to ≈†tark Arena, following the signing of a five-year sponsorship deal with ≈†tark, a food manufacturing company. History =Design and construction= In 1989, The City of Belgrade was chosen to host the Basketball World Championship of 1994.24sec.net - Basketball News - Diamond Ball preview! However, there was a condition for the city to build an all-new basketball arena. In the competition for the design of a new arena with seat capacity of at least 20,000, the winner was the design submitted by Belgrade architect Vlada Slavica from Energoprojekt. In 1991 a location for the project was chosen ‚Äì Blok 25 in New Belgrade. The project was carried out amid significant difficulties. For starters, the construction of such a mega structure had to meet a very tight deadline, since it was only 3 years to the World Championships. A team of 126 companies was formed to be part of the arena committee, with Energoprojekt Visokogradnja and GP Napred as main contractors. Two architects were chosen to design the arena's roof. In 1992 construction started as the arena committee formed a partnership with American company HOK, experienced in building sporting venues. However, tough times were ahead. As the disintegration of Yugoslavia started, the United Nations imposed sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and HOK stopped all co-operation with the arena committee. Even with this setback, work on the Belgrade Arena continued. In 1993, Belgrade suffered one of its worst economic years in modern history. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia experienced record inflation rates, and as a result of the sanctions and the conflicts in Yugoslavia, Belgrade lost the right to host the 1994 Basketball World Championships.Novosti  Vecernje novosti  Sport Following the formal announcement by FIBA, the arena's construction still continued for some time, though at a considerably slower pace due to the lack of material. However, sometime in 1995 the construction completely stopped. Work on the arena re- commenced in 1998 as the city was chosen to host the 1999 World Table Tennis Championships to be held in the Belgrade Arena. By this time the roof was already taking shape towards completion, part of the fa√ßade was done and the interior was half complete. Once again, Yugoslavia lost the privilege to host the competition as the city was bombed by NATO forces the year the competition was supposed to be held. The first public event held in the Arena (which was still under construction at the time) was the final Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá (president of Yugoslavia at the time) 2000 presidential election campaign rally, which was held on 20 September 2000. This was the last time Milo≈°eviƒá has held a public speech. =Completion= After a change of government in Yugoslavia in 2000 and the lifting of all sanctions imposed on the country, the Arena, under new management, was completed in 2004 in time for the FIBA Diamond Ball tournament and Belgrade finally got the right to host The 2005 European Basketball Championship. Temporary licenses for public use expired in early 2006, following a series of sport events and concerts in 2005. Works on an automated fire prevention system and installation of elevators to meet European standards were completed by November 2006, while no events were held in the Arena in the meantime. The Belgrade Arena received its permanent public use license on 4 November 2006 and re-opened its doors as a result. Events Serbia - Brazil FIVB World League 2009 final, 22,680 spectators The List of events held in ≈†tark Arena lists both past and upcoming events. The first event held in the Belgrade Arena was a Socialist Party of Serbia and Yugoslav Left final election campaign rally, held on 20 September 2000 before the 2000 Yugoslavian general election. The construction of the Arena wasn't finished at that time. The official opening came nearly four years later, on 31 July 2004, when the FIBA Diamond Ball basketball tournament was held. Since Arena had only temporary license, only several events were held during the next two and a half years. The first event held after getting permanent license was the 50 Cent concert, on 6 November 2006. One of the biggest events to take place in the Arena was the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. In the final night of the contest an audience of over 20,000 was present. Other big events held in the Arena include numerous sporting events, notably the European championships in basketball (EuroBasket 2005), volleyball (2005 Men's European Volleyball Championship), table tennis (2007 European Table Tennis Championships), and judo (2007 European Judo Championships). The Belgrade Arena was also one of the 69 venues to take part in the 2009 Summer Universiade Games, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the basketball competition. Arena was the host venue for the concerts of the most significant artists of Serbia and former Yugoslavia, as well as major international stars, including 50 Cent, Anastacia, Backstreet Boys, Beyonc√©, Andrea Bocelli, Deep Purple, Montserrat Caball√©, Nick Cave, The Chemical Brothers, Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood, Joe Cocker, Leonard Cohen, Phil Collins, The Cult, Bob Dylan, Fatboy Slim, Peter Gabriel, Guano Apes, Guns N' Roses, Hurts, Il Divo, Iron Maiden, Jean-Michel Jarre, Elton John, Tom Jones, Judas Priest, Alicia Keys, Mark Knopfler, Lenny Kravitz, Massive Attack, Nicole Scherzinger and The Pussycat Dolls, Queen + Paul Rodgers, Eros Ramazzotti, Jennifer Lopez, Rammstein, Chris Rea, RBD, Rihanna, Sade, Simple Minds, Shakira, Slash, Slayer, Slipknot, Sting, Whitesnake, Roger Waters, Zaz, ZZ Top, OneRepublic, To≈°e Proeski and many others.

The boxset was also released on iTunes.  Reception  The Times wrote in its review of Downside Up: \\"Standouts include the spiky Drop Dead/Celebration, the sinister Eve White/Eve Black and the chopped up industrial funk of Tattoo\\".

Murray Chalmers commented: \\"'Drop Dead/Celebration' is still a wonderful explosion of bile aimed at their absconded guitarist and drummer, while Slap Dash Snap is prototype techno.\\" He underlined the diversity of the material: \\"on more reflective tracks like Sea Of Light and Let Go you feel that here is a group who could go anywhere\\". He stated that \\"By CD2 they are firing on all cylinders, a pop group thrillingly ahead of the pack, CD3 is immaculate\\", and considered the four tracks from The Thorn that end the box set as an \\"orchestrated EP of ferocious intensity\\".

The album, written largely by lead singer Ricky Ross, was released in the United Kingdom on 1 May 1987. It proved a commercial success and has to date sold around a million copies, peaking in the UK Albums Chart at no. 14 and remaining in the charts for a year and a half. The album, widely praised as Deacon Blue's finest work, has the overtones of a concept album relating to the struggles of urban life in the inner city. The city being unmistakably Glasgow, referenced by the roots of the band and by the images by photographer Oscar Marzaroli on the cover of the album: the view of a rainy day over Glasgow's West End (with the Finnieston Crane featuring prominently). Background The short intro, \\"Born in a Storm\\", melodic and interspersed with an unmistakably gloomy atmosphere created by the name, launches into the title track \\"Raintown\\", a natural extension of this plot. The weather remains a feature of the atmosphere of the album, reflecting the epitome of the Scots word dreich. Played out in the course of the album is the struggle with money (\\"Loaded\\"), unemployment, dreams of something better (\\"Dignity\\", \\"The Very Thing\\"), culminating in an angry attack upon urban life (\\"Town to Be Blamed\\"). The album does feature lighter experiences though, with the love songs (\\"Chocolate Girl\\") and \\"Love's Great Fears\\" - a track that Ross has often cited as his all-time favourite, featuring a slide guitar outro by Chris Rea. In an interview given to the Daily Record in 2012, songwriter Ricky Ross explained the rationale and reasoning behind the writing of all of the songs on the album. Legacy On 27 February 2006, Raintown was reissued as part of Columbia's Legacy Edition series. The re-issue was expanded to 2 CDs. The first CD featured the original 11-track album. The second CD featured alternate cuts of all 11 album tracks, as well as the two original CD bonus tracks \\"Riches\\" and \\"Kings of the Western World\\". The new edition did not include the varied bonus cuts (remixes and b-sides) that were found on the singles from the album. Another reissue was released on 22 October 2012 by Edsel Records as part of a catalogue reissue program for the band's first five studio albums. This set contained all of the B-sides and remixes associated with the album, as well as also including the Legacy Edition bonus disc.

Throughout his television career he remained freelance. Early life West was born in Cranbrook, Kent, an only child. His father, the son of a tobacconist, had made some money in the City after the First World War, and in 1924 set himself up as a poultry farmer in Cranbrook. Education He was educated at Cranbrook School as were his fellow commentators Barry Davies and Brian Moore. At school he was in the cricket XI for five years, and captain for the last three. He played rugby and hockey for the school for four years, captaining both games for his last two seasons, and, in rugby, leading an undefeated side. He ended his Cranbrook career as head of the school. War service After school he went to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment, 33rd of Foot, which had the reputation of being the best rugby regiment in the Army. At Sandhurst he became an instructor but after being diagnosed with spondylitis was invalided out of the Army in 1944. Career Facing a post war world with no qualifications, West secured a job as assistant to the Controller of SSAFA, a retired Air Vice-Marshal but was sacked after a run-in with his boss. By 1947 he was stuck in a dead-end job transmitting sports results via telegraph ticker tape. However, one day, when sitting next to the legendary test cricketer and journalist C B Fry in the press box at Taunton he was able to transmit Fry‚Äôs report after the telephonist failed to turn up. Fry recommended West to the head of the BBC outside broadcasting and West was signed up as a cricket commentator. He remained a cricket commentator, both on radio and television, until 1986. In addition, from 1955 to 1982 he played second fiddle to Dan Maskell in the BBC's television coverage of Wimbledon. He reported the Olympics from 1948 to 1972, missing only 1952 and 1956. West was the editor of Playfair Cricket Annual from its inception in 1948 until 1954. He joined the BBC in 1947 on the recommendation of C.B. Fry, following a chance meeting.Playfair Cricket Annual 2004: obituary. He worked for the BBC for nearly 40 years until retiring in 1986. He presented many BBC programmes not connected with sport, including the original version of Come Dancing (1957‚Äì72), What's My Line?, and Get Ahead (1958‚Äì62), about business entrepreneurs. He was a cricket and rugby correspondent for both The Times and The Daily Telegraph. During interviews with sportsmen, West was in the habit of using words that were unfamiliar to his interlocutors. On one occasion, speaking to Viv Richards, he said \\"Viv, your genius transcends parochialism.\\" In 1984, after Jimmy White had won the Masters, he asked White to comment upon the \\"wonderful ethos which had permeated the final\\". When White said he was glad he won, West continued to press him about the ethos. Eventually, Terry Griffiths, White's opponent, stepped in and rescued him. When interviewing Arthur Ashe after his famously deft victory over the belligerent Jimmy Connors in the Wimbledon final of 1975, he congratulated Ashe on \\"manifesting a superb tactical acumen\\". \\"If you say so Peter!\\" rejoined a bemused Ashe. Personal life He married Pauline Pike in 1946, the woman he met in his first job, the one-time secretary to the irascible SSAFA Air Vice Marshal. They lived in Cheltenham and had a daughter, Jacqueline, and two sons, Simon and Stephen. He died, aged 83, in Bath, Somerset. See also * Flannelled Fool and Muddied Oaf, autobiography, 1986.

It has VR services to Helsinki and towards Joensuu (most terminate in Tampere or Pieks√§m√§ki). The station serves approximately a million passengers annually. The railway station was opened in 1876, together with the newly built railway between Turku and Tampere, in a celebration attended by the future Tsar Alexander III of Russia. Services were at first only to Tampere and Toijala, and the significance of railways was rather minor. In 1899, a new railway to Helsinki was opened, and subsequently rail traffic to and from Turku became more frequent. The older station was demolished in 1938, and a new, more modern, one was built in its place. The current building, completed in 1940, was designed by Finnish architects V√§in√∂ V√§h√§kallio and Martti V√§likangas.http://www.mfa.fi/pressrelease?lid=20265650 In addition to the two main railway lines to Helsinki and Joensuu, the station has handled passenger traffic to Naantali and Uusikaupunki. These local lines have been discontinued due to lack of use, but are still used by goods traffic. In addition, there is talk of re-establishing the line to Naantali in the near future, either as a museum railway line or a form of local public transport. Unlike the Helsinki Central railway station, which stands out as a prominent landmark of downtown Helsinki, the Turku Central railway station blends in among the scenery and is hidden behind other buildings when viewed from the city centre. Because of this, it can be difficult for non-Turkuans to get their bearings around the railway station. On 7 June 2010, the Turku Central railway station was officially renamed - (Turku main railway station, or Turku central railway station) in Finnish and Swedish, replacing the previous official name - (Turku railway station). The Finnish transport bureau use \\"Turku C\\" as a shorthand, and there were erroneous news reports that this shorthand would also be taken into official use. The Helsinki Central railway station was renamed in a similar manner.Helsingin rautatieasemasta ei tulekaan Helsinki C, Helsingin Sanomat online edition, 3 June 2010. Accessed 3 June 2010.

An alumnus of Boston Latin School, he is most widely known for his work as chairman of the building committee of Boston's Trinity Church in Copley Square, for his leadership of 19th century Boston philanthropists, for his summer home in Waltham, Massachusetts, and for his experiments in building housing for low-and middle-income workers. Paine's brick row-house development on Greenwich and Sussex streets in Roxbury, Massachusetts is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Frederick Douglass Square Historic District. Another of his housing experiments, an 1890s 100-house subdivision between Round Hill and Sunnyside streets in Jamaica Plain, has been deemed eligible for nomination to the National Register.

'First eleven' is a reference to the fact that they are the first eleven players selected to play for the team - many sports state that clubs must have squads of no fewer than x number of players, and this number is often higher than 11.

The term \\"stay-at-home\\" or \\"shelter-in-place\\" is often used for lockdowns that affect an area, rather than specific locations. Widespread lockdowns were issued in the COVID-19 pandemic. The term is used for a prison protocol that usually prevents people, information or objects from leaving an area. The protocol can usually only be initiated by someone in a position of authority. A lockdown can also be used to protect people inside a facility or, for example, a computing system, from a threat or other external event. In buildings doors leading outside are usually locked so that no person may enter or exit. A full lockdown usually means that people must stay where they are and may not enter or exit a building or rooms within it, needing to go to the nearest place designated safe if not already in such a place. A drill lockdown may be held in the absence of a threat, to familiarise people with what they must do. Barricaded streets during the lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak in Bhopal, India Types Procedures for using both emergency and preventive lockdowns must be planned.Why Schools Need 2 Types of Lockdowns, campussafetymagazine.com, June 14, 2012. =Preventive lockdown= A preventive lockdown is a preemptive action plan implemented to address an unusual scenario or a weakness in system to preempt any danger to ensure the safety and security of people, organisation and system. The focus for preventive actions is to avoid dangers and risks arising from the nonconformances to the normal circumstances, but also commonly includes improvements in efficiency. Preventive lockdowns are preemptive lockdowns to mitigate risk. Most organisations plan for the emergency lockdowns but fail to plan for other situations that might quickly degrade to dangerous levels. These protocols must be based on the type of threat, and should be kept simple and short for quick learning and implementation, and flexible enough to handle several scenarios. This allows administrators more options to choose from which are easier to use in various scenarios. For example, in case of a loud scene by a parent or an unarmed petty thief being chased by the police through the school playground, this flexible procedure allows school administrators the flexibility to implement a more limited lockdown while teaching in school continues, thus eliminating need for complete emergency lockdown, disruption and delays in resumption of teaching, etc. The consequences of not having procedures to implement such lockdowns is that the situation might quickly escalate where there could be loss of human lives. =Emergency lockdown= Emergency lockdowns are implemented when there is imminent threat to the lives or risk of injury to humans, for example, a school's emergency lockdown procedures must be kept short and simple to make them easier to use under real life crisis conditions. Simple procedures can be easily taught with periodic lockdown drills instead of lengthy training. = In epidemics and pandemics = Police conversing with people during a lockdown in Benidorm, Spain Lockdowns can limit movements or activities in a community while allowing most organizations to function normally, or limit movements or activities such that only organizations supplying basic needs and services can function normally. COVID-19 pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, the term lockdown was used for actions related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders. By early April 2020, 3.9 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown‚Äîmore than half the world's population. By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America. Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India. The lockdown in the Philippines started on 14 March 2020 and is one of the longest and strictest lockdowns with varying levels of Community Quarantine being imposed on all major islands and cities. Similarly the lockdown in South Africa started on 27 March 2020 and progressed through various levels. It is also one of the strictest lockdowns in the world with cigarettes and alcohol banned throughout. Typical scenarios = Schools = Lockdown procedures vary by site and country. Generally, a lockdown means that interior and exterior doors are locked, and all students and staff must remain in their location from the time the lockdown is announced. In some locations, windows are covered, and students stand at the back of the classroom or away from windows. Since the Columbine shooting in 1999, lockdown procedures in schools have been changing. Some schools direct teachers to continue with standard procedures while remaining quiet, while some recommend an active approach against threats. =Prisons= In corrections units, the term lockdown can be defined as a course of action to control the movement of inmates. Confining all prisoners, except workers, to their cells until the end of the day is an example of a \\"lockdown period\\" in a corrections schedule. However a \\"full lockdown\\" is used when all prisoners are locked in their cells to prevent prison riots or unrest from spreading or during an emergency.Spiegel, Sarah. \\"Prison Race Rights: An Easy Case for Segregation.\\" Calif.

Retrieved December 2012Lockdown Policy at Iroquois Healthcare Alliance. Retrieved December 2012 Occasions for preventing both entry and exit from a hospital may include: external contamination, civil disturbance and abduction of an infant or child. =Lean manufacturing process= In manufacturing, the term lockdown event refers to a continuous improvement initiative in which manufacturing in a specific area (typically a cell or specific piece of machinery) is halted in order to contain, and determine, what are the issues that are preventing the manufacture of goods from meeting quality specifications. During the lockdown event a multi-disciplinary team reviews the specific area's manufacturing processes, tooling and machine condition, to find the root cause(s) of the problem(s). Once changes to the process, or machine repairs that may include adjustments or replacement are effected, a sample run is initiated and evaluated. If the results of the validation are within the required specifications, the area lockdown is lifted and production is resumed. Follow- up sampling is conducted subsequently to ensure continuity of the lockdown results.  Historical events  In the wake of the September 11 attacks (2001), a three-day lockdown of American civilian airspace was initiated. At the University of British Columbia (UBC) on January 30, 2008, an unknown threat was made, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) issued a lockdown order on one of the buildings on campus for six hours, cordoning off the area. A campus alert was sent via email to everyone affiliated with UBC, while those in the building remained locked in it.\\"Police increase presence at UBC following lockdown\\" On April 10, 2008, two Canadian secondary schools were locked down due to suspected firearm threats.

A few artifacts have been unearthed by archeological excavations. It was part of the princely state of Travancore during the colonial times prior to India's independence; four of the eight tehsils of Thiruvananthapuram district were separated from the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom to form the new district of Kanyakumari, and they were made the part of Madras Presidency under recommendations from the States Reorganisation Commission in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 38 districts of Tamil Nadu state. Many historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate sages such as Vyasa, Agastya, Tolkappiyar, Avvaiyar and Thiruvalluvar to the district. The district is also the birthplace of Ayyavazhi. History The area that comprises the current Kanyakumari district was a part of the old Ay kingdom of the first and second Sangham ages. Following the decline of the Ay kingdoms, the area became Venad, with its capital Padmanabhapuram located North, North West of Nagercoil. The wealth of the Nanjilnadu beckoned many invaded kings including the Nayaks and later an Islamist army during the reign of Umayamma Rani. The Venad region was in anarchy before Marthanda Varma ascended the throne in 1729 AD. Under their rule anarchy was dominant in Kanyakumari region. However, Marthanda Varma brought a sense of disorder under control by annexing the nearby territories, putting down the feudal lords and establishing the strong state of Travancore. He had also bought some portions of Kanyakumari from the then viceroy making it the southern boundary. Under his rule, the district improved in a social context as well as economically. The famous battle of Colachel took place in the district. Later, the Maharajas of Travancore built the forts at Aramboly (Aralvaimozhy) to prevent any invasion from the Carnatic Kings. Key elements of Velu Thampi Dalawa's revolt occurred in the area and the English East India company's army under Col. Leger broke through the fortifications and entered Travancore in 1810. In the year 1949, the area became a part of the reestablished Travancore Cochin state. The people of Agasteeswarem, Thovalai, Kalkulam and Vilavancode taluks, which formed the southern divisions of the former district of Trivandrum, were predominantly Tamil speaking people. An extreme agitation by Tamil speaking residents under the leadership of Marshal Nesamony took place for including Kanyakumari within Tamil Nadu. Eventually the merger happened in 1956 based on language reorganization of states. Historically, Nanjilnadu (Agastheeswaram and Thovalai taluks) and Eda Nadu (Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks) which comprises the present Kanyakumari district. The district were ruled by various dynasties: Venad Kingdom, Travancore Kingdom, the Cheras, the Cholas, the Ays and the Nayaks. A few artifacts were unearthed by archeological excavations in parts of the district. The district was part of the princely state of Travancore during the colonial times prior to India's independence; four of the eight tehsils of Thiruvananthapuram district were separated to form the new district of Kanyakumari in 1956 following the demands of reunion made by the Tamil speaking majority people (about 70% of the population), who feels that their feelings were suppressed by the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom which has Malayalam majority population. The four taluks were made the part of then Madras Presidency under recommendations from the States Reorganisation Commission in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969 and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of Tamil Nadu state. The district is the birthplace of Ayyavazhi, the henotheistic belief initiated by Hari Gopalan Seedar, one among the 5 prime disciples of Ayya Vaikundar. The social, religious and cultural history of the 19th century Kanyakumari district is intrinsically inter-twined with those of Ayyavazhi.

During the British colonial era, English was the sole official language until 1978 but has remained a strong second language in Hong Kong. As the majority of the population in Hong Kong are descendants of migrants from China's Canton Province, the vast majority speak standard Cantonese or other Yue Chinese varieties as a first language, with smaller numbers of speakers of Hakka Language or the Teochew dialect of Southern Min. In addition, immigrants and expatriates from the West and other Asian countries have contributed much to Hong Kong's linguistic and demographic diversity. The geographical element of this diversity can be seen in the Hong Kong Language Maps. Statistics for the 27 self-reported spoken languages/dialects reported in the 2011 Census, can be found in the report: Language Use, Proficiency and Attitudes in Hong Kong Official languages Chinese and English are both official languages of Hong Kong under the Hong Kong Basic Law (article 9) and the Official Languages Ordinance (chapter 5 of the Laws of Hong Kong). No law stipulates choice of spoken Chinese dialect. English was the sole official language of Hong Kong from 1883 to 1974. Only after demonstrations and petitions from Hong Kong people demanding equal status for Chinese did the language become official in Hong Kong from 1974 onward. Annex I of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration provided that English may be used in addition to Chinese for official purposes in the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In March 1987, the Official Languages Ordinance was amended to require all new legislation to be enacted bilingually in both English and Chinese. In 1990, the Hong Kong Basic Law affirmed English's co-official language status with Chinese after the 1997 handover.  Chinese languages  As a result of immigration into Hong Kong from Canton Province, Cantonese is the dominant Chinese variant spoken in the territory with smaller numbers of speakers of other dialects. There are also numerous Chinese languages spoken by the native peoples of the New Territories, many of which are mutually unintelligible. There is also a written language based on the vocabulary and grammar of spoken Cantonese known as written Cantonese. Although the \\"biliterate and trilingual\\" policy implies an absence of support for written Cantonese, it has gained popularity in news media where entertainment and local news are related. Written Cantonese is unintelligible to non-Cantonese speakers and is considered nonstandard by some educators despite its widespread usage in Hong Kong. Some have also credited written Cantonese for solving the challenges that standard written Chinese had faced in popular culture. Traditional Chinese characters are widely used, and are the de facto writing standard in Hong Kong. Simplified Chinese is seen in some posters, leaflets, flyers and signs in the tourist areas. = Cantonese = The principal language of Hong Kong is standard Cantonese (Á≤µË™û, Âª£Â∑ûË©±, Âª£Êù±Ë©±, Âª£Â∫úË©±, ÁôΩË©±, Êú¨Âú∞Ë©±), spoken by 88.9% of the population at home daily. As an official language, it is used in education, broadcasting, government administration, legislation and judiciary, as well as for daily communication. As a result of its predominance throughout the community, Cantonese is virtually the exclusive language of official discourse at all levels of the executive, legislature and courts of Hong Kong. KCR East Tsim Sha Tsui Station. (From the top: French, Japanese, Spanish and Korean). Road signs in Hong Kong are written in both Chinese and English. =Native Yue dialects= A few closely related dialects to standard Cantonese continue to be spoken in Hong Kong. Most notable is the Weitou dialect (ÂúçÈ†≠Ë©±), which is mostly spoken by the older generation living in walled villages in New Territories. Additionally, the Tanka people (ËúëÂÆ∂‰∫∫/ÁñçÂÆ∂‰∫∫/Ê∞¥‰∏ä‰∫∫) from the fishing villages on outlying islands speak their own variant of Cantonese. However, this dialect is now largely limited to those middle aged and above. =Hakka= Hakka is indigenous to many villages in the New Territories and within Hakka communities in Hong Kong. Nowadays, outside these rural villages and older populations, younger Hakka Chinese populations communicate primarily in Cantonese.http://www.hkilang.org (in Chinese Traditional)http://podcast.rthk.hk/podcast/item_epi.php?pid=315‚ü®=zh- CN&id;=16160 RTHK„ÄäÊº´ÈÅäÁôæÁßë - Ep. 17„Äã(in Cantonese) =Minnan Chinese= Teochew, Hokkien, and Taiwanese are the Minnan (Southern Min) Chinese dialects commonly found in Hong Kong. However, their usage is largely limited to recent migrants from Taiwan or Fujian and middle aged descendants of immigrants from native Chinese regions of these variants. =Varieties of Chinese in the region=  Taishanese  Taishanese originates from migrants from Taishan County in Mainland China. The variant can still be found in some areas in Hong Kong where migrants concentrated, such as Sai Wan.  Shanghainese  Shanghainese is commonly spoken by migrants who escaped Shanghai after the communist takeover of China in 1949. Their descendants seldom speak the language nowadays. Mandarin When Hong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom, Mandarin Chinese (ÊôÆÈÄöË©±/Áèæ‰ª£Ê®ôÊ∫ñÊº¢Ë™û/ÂúãË™û/ÂåóÊñπË©±) was not widely used in Hong Kong. Since the 1997 Handover, the huge increase in inbound tourism from the mainland has led to much more widespread use of Mandarin, particularly in tourism-related commerce, though little impact has been seen in locally based commerce or public services. In addition, the large number of soeng1 fei1 (ÈõôÈùû) children (children born in Hong Kong whose parents are both from the Mainland) has increased the number of Mandarin-speaking people, particularly in districts close to the border, such that Mandarin-speaking children make up large proportions or even the majority of primary-school students in those districts, causing the beginnings of a language shift in those areas. English A bilingual sale banner hung in front of a shop in Causeway Bay. English is a major working language in Hong Kong, and is widely used in commercial activities and legal matters. Although the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC by the United Kingdom in 1997, English remains one of the official languages of Hong Kong as enshrined in the Basic Law. =Code- switching between Cantonese and English= Many Hong Kong people use both Cantonese and English, or \\"code-switch\\", in the same sentence when speaking. For example, \\" make sense!\\" (\\"Wow, it does not make sense!\\"). The code- switching can freely mix English words and Chinese grammar, for instance \\" un understand?\\" (\\"Do you understand?\\") which follows the Chinese grammar syntax 'verb - not - verb' to ask \\"Do you (verb)?\\". Some code-switched words are used so often that they have become loanwords in Cantonese,Chan, Mimi and Helen Kwok (1982). A Study of Lexical Borrowing from English in Hong Kong Cantonese.

Other European languages =French= In Hong Kong, French is the second most studied foreign language after Japanese. Many institutions in Hong Kong, like Alliance fran√ßaise, provide French courses. Local universities, such as the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Baptist University, offer programmes which aim at developing proficiency in French language and culture. The language was included as a subject in the HKCEE, but not in HKALE, the two former public exams that Hong Kong high school students take, with accordance to British International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) standards. The IGCSE French syllabus used by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES) is adopted in the examination. The only French book store, Librairie Parentheses, in Hong Kong is located on Wellington Street, Central. Librairie Parentheses, \\"only French bookstore\\" Real estate developers in Hong Kong sometimes name their buildings in French, such as Bel-Air, Les Saisons and Belle Mer. This kind of foreign branding is also used in boutiques and restaurants. An example is Yucca de Lac in Ma Liu Shui. Sometimes only French elements such as articles and prepositions are added to the name, as in the case of the restaurant chain Caf√© de Coral. Similar mixing of English and French can be seen on the menu of D√©lifrance, a French-style restaurant chain in Hong Kong. =German= The number of German speakers in Hong Kong is about 5000, significant enough for the establishment of the German Swiss International School (Deutsch-Schweizerische Internationale Schule), which claims to number more than 1,000 students, at The Peak of Hong Kong Island. Many institutions in Hong Kong provide German courses. The most well-known one is the Goethe-Institut, which is located in Wan Chai. After spending a certain period in learning German, students can take the German Test as a Foreign Language (Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache; TestDaF for short) and Start German A1-C2. There are currently two test centres for TestDaF in Hong Kong: the Goethe-Institut and the Hong Kong Baptist University(HKBU). The latter one also offers a European Studies degree course of German Stream, Bachelor of Social Science in European Studies (German Stream), in parallel with the French stream. A minor programme of German is offered at the Language Centre of HKBU. The Hong Kong University offers a Major in German. The Chinese University of Hong Kong offers a Minor in German and popular summer courses. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology offers German for science and technology. Other East Asian languages =Japanese= There are over 25,000 Japanese people in Hong Kong, so it is not uncommon to hear Japanese conversations.

In addition, the Companies Registry also permits the hiragana ‚Äòno‚Äô in Chinese business names that are registered in Hong Kong.\\"Business\\" Required to be Registered and Application for Business Registration: Business Name , Inland Revenue Department The hiragana „ÅÆ is usually used in place of the Chinese character (zi1) and is read as such in Hong Kong. In fact, Aji Ichiban has adopted „ÅÆ in their company name (). There are also borrowings from Japanese shinjitai kanji ‚Äòeki‚Äô to substitute (Jyutping: zaam6;)(both Á´ô and ÈßÖ mean \\"station\\" in their respective languages), as in Nu Front (), a shopping mall for Hong Kong youngsters in Causeway Bay. There are also some private estates named with the kanji . These loanwords are pronounced by Hong Kong people as if they were their Chinese counterparts (i.e. as , and as ). The Japanese is the shinjitai of the hanzi (Jyutping: jik6;). However, È©õ has fallen out of usage to in modern Cantonese and become obsolete. Therefore, it is not uncommon to mispronounce as its phonetic compound (Jyutping: cek3;)). =Korean= Koreans in Hong Kong only make up a small minority while Korean culture has gained popularity since the early 2000s. Korean pop music was the first Korean media to enter Hong Kong's market. Since then, several Korean TV series such as Dae Jang Geum have been broadcast to numerous audiences.\\"Â≠∏ÁøíÈüìË™ûÁßòÊäÄÂÇçË∫´\\" , Centaline Human Resources Consultants Limited, 2005-03-03.

Roughly 3,000 people have taken the Test of Proficiency in Korean since its introduction to Hong Kong in 2003. Surveys and statistics from course enrolments have shown that nine-tenths of the students studying Korean in Hong Kong are female. Southeast Asian languages =Filipino= Filipino and other Philippine languages are used by Filipinos in Hong Kong, most of whom are employed as foreign domestic workers. Newspapers and magazines in Filipino can also be easily found in Central, Hong Kong. There are also a small number of churches in Hong Kong that have masses or services in Filipino, for example the afternoon masses provided by the St. John's Cathedral in Central. =Indonesian= Indonesian is the common language for the significant number of Indonesians working in Hong Kong, though Javanese is also widely spoken. Most are domestic workers; On their days off, they often gather at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay where Indonesian languages can be heard. =Thai= Thai prevails among the Thai population in Hong Kong, who mostly work as domestic workers. The Thai language is found in many shops and restaurants owned by Thais in Kowloon City. A number of Thai movies have been imported since the early 2000s, such as The Wheel in the medley Three, Jan Dara, the Iron Ladies, My Little Girl, and Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior and Tom-Yum-Goong starring Tony Jaa. =Vietnamese= Vietnamese is used in Hong Kong among the ethnic Chinese from Vietnam who had initially settled in Vietnam and returned to Hong Kong. The language is also used by Vietnamese refugees who left their home during the Vietnam War. South Asian languages In 2006, there were at least 44,744 persons of South Asian descent living in Hong Kong. Signboards written in Hindi or Urdu can be seen, and conversation in South Asian languages including Nepali, Sindhi and Punjabi, as well as Urdu, Hindi and Tamil can be heard. Hong Kong has two Nepalese newspapers, The Everest and the Sunrise Weekly Hong Kong. In 2004, the Home Affairs Bureau and Metro Plus AM 1044 jointly launched radio shows Hong Kong-Pak Tonight in Urdu and Hamro Sagarmatha in Nepalese. =Hindi= The history of Indians in Hong Kong can be traced back to the early days of British Hong Kong. When the Union flag of the United Kingdom was hoisted on 26 January 1841, there were around 2,700 Indian troops that participated, and they played an important role in the development of Hong Kong in the early days. The most prominent contributions were the founding of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and the Star Ferry. Although nearly all of the Indian people who live in Hong Kong speak and write Indian English, some have maintained the usage of Hindi as a second language. Middle Eastern languages =Arabic= Arabic is used frequently among members of Muslim communities in Hong Kong. Some Islamic organisations do teach the language as well, but the current status can best be described as developing.

It is often honored for excellence; in the late 1980s it was ranked the ninth best high school in New York State, the Washington Post in 2004 said it is \\"regarded as one of the nation's most intellectually demanding\\" schools. The Wilson Commons as well as Wilson Boulevard at the University of Rochester river campus are also named after Joe Wilson. The Wilson family continues Joseph Wilson's tradition of philanthropy in the Rochester area mainly through the Marie C. and Joseph C. Wilson Foundation. Wilson was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1980. The Joseph C. Wilson papers were made available in May 2019 through the University of Rochester Rare Books, Special Collections, and Preservation library and were gifted to the University by Marie C. Wilson. This collection consists of correspondence, minutes, reports, speeches, and clippings from Wilson's participation in numerous business and community organizations. The bulk of the collection is dated 1959-1971, a period of growth for Xerox as well as the city and University of Rochester. References Further reading * External links *The Joseph C.

He has also performed with such bands as The Pavers and Goodbye Harry.  Time with ALL  Reynolds was pop-punk band ALL's second lead singer, replacing Dave Smalley in 1989. He recorded and toured with the group extensively from 1989 - 1993. His songwriting contributions with All were notable; his Dot off 1993's Percolater was the group's first single not written by drummer Bill Stevenson. Reynolds left ALL in 1993 reportedly due to differences in the band regarding touring schedules. All formed in suburban Los Angeles in 1987 when Milo Aukerman, the lead singer of The Descendents, left to pursue a graduate degree in biochemistry, forcing the band into a hiatus. The remaining members, guitarist Stephen Egerton, bassist Karl Alvarez, and drummer Bill Stevenson decided to carry on as a band, adopting the title of the Descendents‚Äô last studio album, All, as their official moniker. Enlisting former Dag Nasty and DYS singer Dave Smalley on vocals, All released their first two albums in 1988: Allroy Sez and the EP Allroy for Prez (both distributed by Cruz Records) to critical acclaim. In 1989, Smalley left the band, and new vocalist Scott Reynolds joined. With Reynolds, All released four more albums: 1989 Allroy's Revenge (which included the single She's My Ex), 1990 Allroy Saves, 1992 Percolater, and the 1990 live album Trailblazer.  Post ALL  After ALL, he started the short-lived band Three Car Pile-Up followed by Goodbye Harry. Goodbye Harry put out two albums. In the mid-1990s Reynolds moved from Missouri (then ALL headquarters), to Buffalo, NY. During this time he is purported to have held a variety of jobs with music as a hobby. At some point in the late 1990s he formed the pop-punk band The Pavers. The Pavers released two albums, two EPs, a live radio cd, and a variety of split EPs. In the early 2000s, frustrated with major label non- response to music that was lauded by fans and critics, he moved from Buffalo, NY to Austin, TX. He is currently fronting the metal punk band Bonesaw Romance, has recorded an album of more acoustic, lounge-type songs under the moniker Scott Reynolds and the Steaming Beast, and is working with former All band-mate, guitarist Stephen Egerton on another project, 40Engine. Between October 2009 and February 2010, Scott produced and sang back up vocals on the album \\"Second to All\\" for local Austin punk band The Butts.The Butts Myspace Site, Myspace.com, retrieved 2010-04-09 The album was mastered by former All band-mate, guitarist Stephen Egerton and was released in early 2011. As of 2017, Reynolds regularly tours the US with his solo acoustic music and his trusty pet chihuahua JB (short for Justin Bieber). =Reunion= On January 26, 2008, Egerton, Stevenson, and Alvarez reunited with Scott Reynolds to play a set of All songs as an opening act for Drag the River at the Aggie in Fort Collins. In mid-April of that year, the band announced that they would be reuniting once again with Reynolds for Chicago, Illinois's 'Riot Fest' on October 12. They performed at the Congress Theater in Chicago, playing for over an hour before Chicago police shut down the show. Additionally, ALL performed two warm up shows; one in Japan in July 2008 and the other at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado on August 29, 2008. The DNC show was cut short and the band completed an additional set that evening at the Three Kings Bar in downtown Denver, CO. In an interview with RiotFest.org, Scott Reynolds does not rule out the possibility of writing new material but sets three conditions that need to be present: People want to hear new music, he feels the need to create, and the \\"bro\\" factor between the bandmates needs to be there.

History President Atat√ºrk and his colleagues leaving the building of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (1930). Until the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, √áankaya was a hillside of orchards and gardens to the south of the city, which had grown up in time, surrounding the Ankara Castle (Kale) on the opposite hill. Everything changed in the 1920s when Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk came to stay in one of the garden houses. Atat√ºrk selected Ankara as capital of the new republic and in the 1920s and 30s the city quickly grew, especially in the direction of √áankaya. In 1934 the writer Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoƒülu described the area as \\"a wooden bridge, a dirt road, and when you come round the hill you see a hillside, green in gentle contours. That's √áankaya.\\" √áankaya eventually developed into one of the largest central districts of Ankara in later years. Climate The climate in √áankaya is cold and temperate. The winter months are much rainier than the summer months in √áankaya. The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification is Dsa. The average annual temperature in √áankaya is 11.5 ¬∞C.

The district is home to a great number of museums, theatres, cinemas, cultural associations, booksellers, publishers and libraries, including the National Library in a new building. Many of the streets in the district are named after poets, writers and thinkers. Most of Ankara's best-known high schools and a great number of university buildings are in the district, including the large campuses of METU, Bilkent University and (most of) Hacettepe University. √áankaya University, a private institution owned by businessman Sƒ±tkƒ± Alp, was opened in a number of former school buildings in 1997.

It stars Peter Sarsgaard as a dot-com millionaire who hires a drummer/stripper (Molly Parker) to stay with him in Las Vegas for three days for US$10,000. The film was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Plot A couple checks into a suite in Las Vegas. In flashbacks we see that he's a computer whiz on the verge of becoming a dot-com millionaire (Peter Sarsgaard). She's a lap dancer at a club (Molly Parker). He's depressed, withdrawing from work, missing meetings with investors. He wants a connection, so he offers her $10,000 to spend three nights with him in Vegas. She accepts with conditions: four hours per night of erotic play, and no penetration. During the days in Vegas, they get to know each other, have fun, and meet a friend of hers, casino dealer Jerri (Carla Gugino). After the first night, things get complicated. When the three days are over, the stripper makes it clear that she was only there for the money and that the man she spent the time with was just a client. Upset that his feelings aren't reciprocated, he rapes her; she makes no attempt to stop him. She then masturbates for him, achieving orgasm, saying \\"you want to see real? I'll show you real.\\" The next day he returns home heartbroken. The movie ends with his return to the strip club to see the woman he fell in love with again. She greets him fondly but interacts with him the way she had when they first met: as a stripper and a client ordering a lap dance. Because the film is shown in a non-linear format, it is left to the viewer to interpret the ending. One could believe that the film ends with the meeting at the strip club and a chance for the two characters to have a real relationship together, or one could believe that the strip club meeting occurred earlier in time and the film ends with the characters going their separate ways in life.

Reception The film opened to mixed reviews, and has been compared to movies with similar \\"hooker in love\\" storylines such as Exotica and Pretty Woman. The Center of the World is more explicit than those films, containing both female and male full frontal nudity, as well as a penetration shot of a lollipop in a vagina, performed by pornographic actress Alisha Klass. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a positive rating of 35% based on 81 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.78/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"For all its tease, the movie doesn't have more to say than money can't buy you love\\". Critic Roger Ebert gave the film a score of 3.5/4 stars. The film's title may be an allusion to Courbet's L'Origine du monde.http://www.chronicart.com/cinema/le- centre-du-monde-the-center-of-the-world/ Censorship controversy A Cincinnati theater owner attracted media attention after allegedly ordering a member of his staff to edit a five-second scene from the film a day before its release. According to Cincinnati CityBeat, Esquire Theater owner Gary Goldman instructed his theater manager and projectionist to cut the scene in which a female stripper (portrayed by pornographic actress Alisha Klass) inserts a lollipop into her vagina.

The story, which explores the romance theme of love after grief, is set in the mid-late 1990s, then-contemporary Wilmington, North Carolina. The 1999 film Message in a Bottle produced by and starring Kevin Costner, is based on this novel.  Plot summary  Divorced and disillusioned about romantic relationships, Theresa Osborne is jogging when she finds a bottle on the beach. Inside is a letter of love and belonging to \\"Catherine,\\" signed simply \\"Garrett.\\" Challenged by the mystery and pulled by emotions she doesn't fully understand, Theresa begins a search for this man that will change her life. What happens to her is unexpected, perhaps miraculous-an encounter that embraces all our hopes for finding someone special, for having a true and strong love that is timeless and everlasting. The letter reads, September 25, 1995 Dear Catherine, A month has passed since I have written, but it has seemed to pass much more slowly. Life passes by now like the scenery outside a car window. I breathe and eat and sleep as I always did, but there seems to be no great purpose in my life that requires active participation on my part. I simply drift along like the messages I write you. I do not know where I am going or when I will get there. Even work does not take the pain away. I may be diving for my own pleasure or showing others how to do so, but when I return to the shop, it seems empty without you. I stock and order as I always did, but even now, I sometimes glance over my shoulder without thinking and call for you. As I write this note to you, I wonder when, or if, things like that will ever stop. Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face‚ÄîI know it is an impossibility, but I cannot help myself. My search for you is a never-ending quest that is doomed to fail. You and I had talked about what would happen if we were forced apart by circumstance, but I cannot keep the promise I made to you that night. I am sorry, I am truly sorry, my darling, but there will never be another to replace you. The words I whispered to you were folly, and I should have realized it then. You‚Äîand you alone‚Äîhave always been the only thing I wanted, and now that you are gone, I have no desire to find another. Till death do us part, we whispered in the church, and I have come to believe that the words will ring true until the day finally comes when I, too, am taken from this world. Garrett Touched by the warmth of the words in the letter Theresa embarked on a mission that would change her life forever. Upon discovering and reading the other two letters from other people who had found a letter each, written by the same author and for the same receipient, Theresa goes to Wilmington to find this mysterious writer after much convincing from Deanna, a close friend. It doesn't take long for her to find Garrett, the mysterious writer. A chemistry gradually grows between the two as they started a highly steamed affair, which however continues to be curtailed by Garrett's continued grief for Catherine. With the passage of time the two are confronted with the reality of one of them having to change his/her life in order for them to be together. A confrontation of this issue between them doesn't end well one night, which is further strained by Garrett's discovery of his letters in Theresa's drawer which she had found earlier but never thought it possible to talk to him about them. Angry at what he deemed as deception and an affair founded o pure lies, Garrett storms out of Theresa's apartment that very night, taking with him his letters. Back at Wilmington he tries to get over the issue by sharing with his father Jeb who, instead thinks Garrett could have mishandled the whole situation. Jeb receives a visitor that same day, a young woman whom he believes to be Theresa. Leaving the two alone, the encounter leads to an ironic steamy occasion with Theresa giving up the relationship afterwards citing that she could never compete with Catherine who still has a huge impact on Garrett. Leaving later that day with a gutted Garrett looking on in a rainy driveway unable to do much about it, a grieving Theresa heads back to Boston to move on with life. Few days later a surprise call comes from Jeb in Wilmington telling her to come right away to which she did. The heartbreak of Garrett's death confronted her in Wilmington. On the fateful day Garrett had set sailing on the prized asset Hapenstance and a storm which was difficult to handle occurs. Having dropped the latest message in a bottle on the sea he has trouble with the storm which led to the sinking of Happenstance and his eventual death.

Alongside William H. Ashley, Henry was the co-owner of the highly successful Rocky Mountain Fur Company, otherwise known as \\"Ashley's Hundred\\", for the famous mountain men working for their firm from 1822 to 1832. National Park Service: Andrew Henry. Henry appears in the narrative poem, the Song of Hugh Glass, which is part of the Neihardt's Cycle of the West. He is portrayed by John Huston in the 1971 film Man in the Wilderness and by Domhnall Gleeson in the 2015 film The Revenant, both of which depict Glass's bear attack and journey. Early life and lead mining in Upper Louisiana Andrew Henry was born in or around 1775 in Fayette County, in the Province of Pennsylvania, and was tall and slender, with dark hair, blue eyes, and a reputation for honesty. Henry went to Nashville, Tennessee, in his twenties, but moved on to Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory in 1800 (before the Louisiana Purchase), to the lead mines near present-day Potosi, Missouri, and in 1806, he bought a share of a lead mine.Lindsley, Margaret Hawkes. 1990. Andrew Henry: Mine and Mountain Major. Jelm Mountain Publications. 374 pp. Exploration of Rocky Mountain frontier, army life, and return to lead mining In 1809, he joined with Manuel Lisa, Jean Pierre Chouteau, and William Clark to found the Missouri Fur Company. He soon led an expedition to the Three Forks of the Missouri River near present-day Three Forks, Montana, where he built \\"Fort Henry\\". In 1811 Henry explored the Missouri-Idaho wilderness and discovered Henry's Lake. During the same expedition, he built a post also, named \\"Fort Henry\\" on Henry's Fork of the Snake River, near present-day Saint Anthony, Idaho. W. Raymond Wood. First Post in the Far West: (November 1807 ‚Äì March 1813). Discovering Lewis & Clark. (See Figure 6) After many difficulties, especially with the Blackfoot Indians, Henry returned to Saint Louis, Missouri in January, 1812. When the War of 1812 was declared Henry enrolled in the army, rising to the rank of major. In 1818, Henry married Mary Flemming, daughter of one of the owners of the lead mine. Mary Flemming was of French birth and considerably younger than Henry; the marriage was a happy one for them both and produced four children. Henry returned to lead mining. Entry into the fur trade with Ashley, bullet making, lead mining, and death In 1822, he started what would become the Rocky Mountain Fur Company with William H. Ashley. The new company sent three keelboats up the Missouri River, three different times. Henry led an expedition of 21 men, 60 horses and one keelboat to the mouth of the Yellowstone River and built a post that came to be known as Fort Henry. The next boat, under the command of Daniel Moore, sank, along with ten thousand dollars' worth of provisions. Ashley equipped a third boat, piloted it himself, and was able to get through to Henry at the Yellowstone. Ashley then immediately returned to Saint Louis to make preparations for the following season. In 1824, after a profitable season and many harrowing adventures, Andrew Henry retired from the company and returned, once more, to lead mining. He died in Washington County, Missouri on January 10, 1832. The actor Tris Coffin played Henry in the 1966 episode, \\"Hugh Glass Meets the Bear\\", on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days. John Alderson was cast as the rugged trail guide Hugh Glass, the trapper who was mauled by a bear, left for dead, but survived by crawling two hundred miles to safety. Others in the episode were Morgan Woodward as trapper Thomas Fitzpatrick and Victor French as Louis Baptiste.

Background  Yel√º Deguang was born in 902, before the founding of the Khitan empire (which would later become known as Liao dynasty). His father was the Yel√º clan chieftain Yel√º Abaoji, and his mother was Yel√º Abaoji's wife Shul√º Ping; he was their second son. As a young adult, he was described by the History of Liao as serious in his appearance and kind in his disposition, and often participating in his parents' governance of the state.History of Liao, vol. 3. In 922, by which time Yel√º Abaoji was the emperor of the Khitan Empire (as its Emperor Taizu), Yel√º Deguang was given the title of Generalissimo of All Forces (Â§©‰∏ãÂÖµÈ¶¨Â§ßÂÖÉÂ∏•, Tianxia Bingma Da Yuanshuai), and he was put in charge of commanding incursions into the territory of Khitan's southern neighbor Jin. In 923, under him, the Khitan forces captured Jin's Ping Prefecture (Âπ≥Â∑û, in modern Qinhuangdao, Hebei), and also defeated the Huxun Tribe (ËÉ°ÈÅú) of the Xi. It was said that he later followed Emperor Taizu in defeating the Khitan Jueli Tribes (Âé•Èáå), forcing the submission of the Dangxiang tribes in the Ordos Loop region, conquering the garrisons of the Hexi Corridor region, capturing the capital of the Gansu Uyghur Kingdom, defeating Balhae, and destroying the Dalugu Tribes (ÈÅîÁõßÈ™®). In 926, Emperor Taizu decided to conquer Balhae. In a campaign, he captured the important Balhae city Fuyu (Â§´È§ò, in modern Siping, Jilin).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. (This appeared to have ended the Balhae state, even though Emperor Taizu did not at this time capture Balhae's capital Longquan.)Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 68 [926]. Emperor Taizu set up a Dongdan Kingdom over the old Balhae territory, with its capital at Fuyu, and made Yel√º Deguang's older brother Yel√º Bei its king, with the title of \\"Imperial King of Man\\" (‰∫∫ÁöáÁéã, Ren Huangwang), echoing the titles used by himself (\\"Imperial Emperor of Heaven,\\" Â§©ÁöáÂ∏ù, Tian Huangdi) and his wife (Yel√º Bei's mother) Empress Shul√º (\\"Imperial Empress of Earth,\\" Âú∞ÁöáÂêé, Di Huanghou). He gave Yel√º Deguang the title of \\"Generalissimo Crown Prince\\" and made Yel√º Deguang in charge of the Khitan capital Linhuang (Ëá®ÊΩ¢, in modern Chifeng, Inner Mongolia), which Yel√º Bei had previously been in charge of. Shortly after conquering Fuyu, however, Emperor Taizu fell ill and died while still at Fuyu. Empress Shul√º took over effective leadership of the Khitan, and she and Yel√º Bei began the trek of escorting Emperor Taizu's casket back to Linhuang, leaving one of Emperor Taizu's younger brother Yel√º Anduan (ËÄ∂ÂæãÂÆâÁ´Ø) temporarily in charge at Dongdan. Once then returned to Linhuang, she wanted to divert the succession away from Yel√º Bei, as she had favored Yel√º Deguang. However, formally, she called an assembly of the chieftains, along with Yel√º Bei and Yel√º Deguang, and stated to them, \\"I love both of my sons, and I do not know which one to make emperor. You can decide which one you wish to support by holding his rein.\\" The chieftains, knowing that she favored Yel√º Deguang, rushed to him and held to his rein. She thereafter declared him emperor (as Emperor Taizong). Yel√º Bei, angry over this turn of events, took several hundred soldiers and wanted to flee to Later Tang (Jin's successor state), but was intercepted by Khitan border guards. Empress Shul√º did not punish him, but sent him to Dongdan.The History of Liao gave an account where it was Yel√º Bei who voluntarily yielded the throne to Emperor Taizong, but that would appear to be inconsistent with his subsequent actions. See History of Liao, vol. 72.  Initial years of reign  Emperor Taizong honored his mother Empress Shul√º as empress dowager, and created his wife Lady Xiao Wen, who was a niece of Empress Shul√º's, empress. It was said that he was filially pious toward his mother, such that if the empress dowager were ill and unable to eat, he would also not eat, and that if his mother were displeased at him, he would not dare to meet her until her temper had been soothed. In 930, Emperor Taizong created his younger brother Yel√º Lihu crown prince. Later in the year, apparently in reaction to being bypassed again, Yel√º Bei fled from Dongdan to Khitan's southern neighbor Later Tang (Jin's successor state).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. In 935, Empress Xiao, after giving birth to her and Emperor Taizong's second son Yel√º Yanchege (ËÄ∂ÂæãÁΩ®Êí§Ëëõ), fell ill and died. There would not be another empress during the rest of Emperor Taizong's reign.History of Liao, vol. 71.  Overlordship over Later Jin  = During Later Jin's establishment = As of 936, Later Tang was embroiled in internal strife, as then-emperor Li Congke was suspicious that his brother- in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), would rebel against him. At the advice of the imperial scholars Li Song and L√º Qi (ÂëÇÁê¶), Li Congke considered entering an alliance with the Khitan to ward off the possibility that Shi would seek aid from Khitan. However, when another imperial scholar, Xue Wenyu (ËñõÊñáÈÅá), argued against it by predicting that Emperor Taizong would demand a marriage alliance, Li Congke changed his mind and never made the alliance proposal.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Not long after, in summer 936, Li Congke, under Xue's suggestion, issued an edict moving Shi from Hedong to Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). This caused Shi to fear that he would be executed if he left Hedong, and so he rebelled. With Li Congke then sending an army, commanded by Zhang Jingda, to attack Hedong, Shi sent emissaries to Khitan to request aid, promising that, if Emperor Taizong would support him as the emperor of China, to serve Emperor Taizong as a father and to cede Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) and Hedong's prefectures north of the Yanmen Pass to Khitan. When Shi's emissaries arrived at the Khitan court, Emperor Taizong was pleased, and he stated to Empress Dowager Shul√º, \\"Your son had dreamt that Master Shi would be sending messengers here. Now it has happened. This was the will of heaven.\\" He sent a reply that he would lead his entire empire's forces to aid Shi in the fall. Meanwhile, Zhang put Hedong's capital Taiyuan under siege. Taiyuan was running low on food supplies, but its defenses held. In late fall, Emperor Taizong himself commanded 50,000 cavalry soldiers (but claimed publicly that it was 300,000) and headed for Taiyuan. When he arrived at Taiyuan's outskirts, Shi urged caution and not immediate engagement, but Emperor Taizong did not listen. Rather, he engaged Zhang's army immediately, crushing it and lifting the siege on Taiyuan. The remnants of Zhang's army took up position at Jin'an Base (ÊôâÂÆâÂØ®), near Taiyuan, but the combined Khitan/Hedong forces then put it under siege. While continuing to siege the Later Tang forces at Jin'an, Emperor Taizong created Shi emperor, having his state known as Jin (referred to by later historians as Later Jin. As part of Shi's enthronement announcement, he announced the agreement to cede Lulong and parts of Hedong, for a total of 16 prefectures, to Khitan, as well as to submit a large amount of silk each year as tribute. Li Congke ordered Zhao Dejun the military governor of Lulong to command another army to rescue Zhang at Jin'an, but Zhao himself wanted Emperor Taizong's support to be emperor of China, and therefore halted some distance away at Tuanbo Valley (ÂúòÊüèË∞∑, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), while he sent secret emissaries to Emperor Taizong's camp, negotiating with him. Zhao, who submitted bribes of gold and silk to Emperor Taizong, promised the terms of being fraternal states with Khitan and that Shi would be allowed to retain Hedong. As Zhao's army was still a strong one, Emperor Taizong was enticed. Shi, hearing of this, sent his close advisor Sang Weihan to plead with Emperor Taizong, arguing that the Khitan/Later Jin forces would prevail and that he should not turn his back on Shi. Emperor Taizong, after consideration, agreed with Sang and rejected Zhao's overture. After Jin'an had been under siege for three months and ran out of supplies, Zhang's deputy Yang Guangyuan assassinated Zhang and surrendered the remaining Later Tang army, which Emperor Taizong turned over to Shi. Then they began to march toward the Later Tang capital Luoyang. With Yang having surrendered, Zhao's army lost its morale and also collapsed, and Zhao surrendered. At that time, Li Congke, who had himself led another Later Tang relief force northward, decided to return to Luoyang, but once he returned to Luoyang saw that the morale was crumbling and that many more generals were already surrendering to the combined Khitan/Later Jin forces. Emperor Taizong escorted Shi to Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), and then, citing his belief that the Han Chinese would panic if Khitan forces actually arrived at Luoyang, stayed at Lu while Shi approached Luoyang. Li Congke, finding the situation hopeless, committed suicide with his family. Prior to the suicide, he had Emperor Taizong's older brother Yel√º Bei executed. Shi entered Luoyang and established his authority there. He had Yel√º Bei's casket escorted with honor back to Khitan. = After Later Jin's takeover of central China = Emperor Taizong returned to Khitan proper with a number of Later Tang generals that he had detained. He also established Lulong's capital You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û) as the southern capital, to facilitate the governance of the newly received 16 prefectures. He respected the captured official Zhang Li and listened to much of Zhang's advice.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. In 937, Xu Gao, the regent of Later Jin's southeastern neighbor Wu sent an emissary to Khitan to try to establish friendly relations. Emperor Taizong also sent an emissary to Wu in return. Later in the year, Emperor Taizong changed the name of his state from Khitan to Liao. He modeled his government after Chinese states', and made Zhao Dejun's son Zhao Yanshou a chief of staff (Shumishi) and chancellor. Later, after Xu seized the Wu throne and established Southern Tang as its emperor, he continued friendly relations with Liao, but on one occasion decided to assassinate the Liao emissary once the Liao emissary crossed into Later Jin territory, hoping to blame Later Jin for the assassination and disrupt Liao and Later Jin relations. Meanwhile, Shi Jingtang, as Later Jin's emperor, continued to be very submissive to Liao. In 938, he offered honorific titles to Emperor Taizong and Empress Dowager Shul√º, and sent his senior officials Feng Dao and Liu Xu to the Liao court to officially present the titles. During Shi's reign as Later Jin's emperor, he referred to himself as \\"subject\\" and \\"son,\\" while referring to Emperor Taizong as \\"father emperor.\\" Whenever Emperor Taizong issued edicts to him, he would receive them in a side hall rather than his own imperial hall, to show respect. Whenever at the Liao emperor's and empress dowager's birthdays or the deaths of key Liao officials, he would often present gifts, including also to Empress Dowager Shul√º, Yel√º Lihu, Yel√º Anduan, the two chancellors in charge of Liao's southern and northern branches of government, and key Han officials such as Zhao Yanshou and Han Yanhui. Further, even when Emperor Taizong sent arrogantly-worded edicts, Shi would respond meekly. Therefore, throughout Shi's reign, there would be no disputes between Liao and Later Jin. In late 938, Shi, fearing that Yang Guangyuan, then the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), would be difficult to control, and therefore divided Tianxiong and moved Yang to be the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Luoyang, Henan) and the defender of Luoyang. It was said that after this movement, Yang began to be resentful of the Later Jin imperial government and entered into secret communications with the Liao court. In 939, fearing that An Chongrong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) would rebel, Shi moved An's potential ally Huangfu Yu (ÁöáÁî´ÈÅá) the military governor of the neighboring Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) to Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered at Lu Prefecture). Emperor Taizong tried to use this opportunity to inject himself into the commissioning of Yiwu's military governor, proposing that the Liao official Wang Wei (ÁéãÂ®Å), whose father Wang Chuzhi had previously ruled Yiwu in alliance with Later Tang's predecessor state Jin, be made Yiwu's military governor. When Shi refused (based on the rationale that Wang needed to go through several layers of promotions to qualify (from prefect to military prefect to defender to military governor), Emperor Taizong sent back the angry response of, \\"How many layers of promotion did you go through from being military governor to be the Son of Heaven?\\" Shi, in fear, sent a rich tribute and promised to make Wang Chuzhi's grandnephew Wang Tingyin (ÁéãÂª∑ËÉ§) Yiwu's military governor. That somewhat placated Emperor Taizong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. An Chongrong, in addition to considering a rebellion against Later Jin, was particularly hostile to Liao. Whenever Liao emissaries passed through Chengde, he would curse them and sometimes even kill them. In 940, he seized a Liao emissary, and then submitted an arrogantly-worded petition to Shi, demanding that he terminate his submissiveness to Liao and turn against Liao for its mistreatment of the Chinese people. Sang secretly pointed out to Shi that turning against Liao could not yield any benefit ‚Äî and, in his evaluation of Emperor Taizong, referred to Emperor Taizong as being \\"more intelligent and brave than other people.\\" Shi listened to Sang, and instead tried to persuade An against provocative behaviors against Liao. He also sent Yang Yanxun (Ê•äÂΩ•Ë©¢) the military governor of Anguo Circuit (ÂÆâÂúã, headquartered in modern Xingtai, Hebei) as an emissary to Liao, to explain to Emperor Taizong, who was angry over An's killing of Liao emissaries, to explain that An's provocative behavior did not reflect a chance in Later Jin's overall submission. In winter 941, An Chongrong's ally, An Congjin the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) rebelled against Later Jin. Shortly after, An Chongrong, hearing of An Congjin's rise, also did so. The Later Jin army against An Chongrong, commanded by Shi's brother-in-law Du Chongwei, quickly defeated An Chongrong, and An Chongrong was killed by his own officers. Shi had An Chongrong's head delivered to Liao. (An Congjin, however, would not be destroyed until shortly after Shi's own death.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. Despite An Chongrong's defeat, Emperor Taizong continued to send emissaries to Later Jin, rebuking Shi for the fact that Tuyuhun tribesmen, whose grazing lands were part of the territory ceded by Later Jin to Liao, were often defecting from Liao back to Later Jin. It was said that this caused Shi much fear and caused him to fall ill. In summer 942, he died. After a discussion between Feng Dao and the Later Jin imperial guard general Jing Yanguang, they decided that the state needed an older emperor, so instead of supporting Shi's youngest and only surviving son Shi Chongrui (Áü≥ÈáçÁùø) as Later Jin's emperor, they supported his adoptive son and biological nephew Shi Chonggui, who was an adult, as Later Jin's emperor.  Conflict with Later Jin  = Initial deterioration of relations = Shortly after Shi Chonggui's succession to the Later Jin throne, the tone of the Liao-Later Jin relationship began to chance, as Shi Chonggui, at Jing Yanguang's advice and against Li Song's, did not submit a petition but rather sent a letter to the Liao court to announce his succession, essentially declaring the states equal. Moreover, in the letter, he did not refer to himself as \\"subject\\" but only as \\"grandson.\\" This caused Emperor Taizong to be angry and respond, \\"How do you dare not to first report to me before taking the throne?\\" Jing authored an insolent response on Shi's behalf. Thereafter, Zhao Yanshou, who was then Liao's military governor of Lulong, began to advocate that Emperor Taizong attack Later Jin, hoping that Emperor Taizong would replace Shi with Zhao himself. Emperor Taizong began to be enticed. Meanwhile, Jing upped the hostility by arresting Qiao Rong (Âñ¨Ê¶Æ), the Liao commerce officer stationed at Later Jin's capital Kaifeng, and seizing Liao's commercial assets. Further, the Liao merchants were arrested and killed. When Qiao was released later in the year and allowed to return to Liao, Jing gave him an arrogant speech: As Qiao feared that Emperor Taizong would blame him for the loss of the Liao wealth, he flattered Jing and requested that Jing write his words down on paper. Jing had his secretary write down the words and give them to Qiao. When Qiao presented them to Emperor Taizong, Emperor Taizong was incensed, and therefore became resolute that he would attack Later Jin. He had the Later Jin emissaries detained at You Prefecture and refused to see them himself. Even though Sang Weihan repeatedly suggested that Shi Chonggui revert to subservience to Liao to avoid a war, Jing repeatedly stopped Shi from doing so. By winter 943, Yang Guangyuan, who was then Later Jin's military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), was in a mutually-suspicious relationship with the Later Jin imperial government, and, while he had not yet rebelled, was in communication with Emperor Taizong, urging him to attack Later Jin due to Shi's defiant behavior. Emperor Taizong thereafter gave Zhao 50,000 soldiers from Lulong and Datong (Â§ßÂêå, headquartered in modern Datong, Shanxi) Circuits, asking him to manage the campaign to capture central China, stating to him, \\"If you gained it, I will make you emperor.\\" He also often stated to the Han people in pointing to Zhao, \\"This is your Lord.\\" = Liao incursions into Later Jin territory = In spring 944, Emperor Taizong made a major incursion into Later Jin territory, using Zhao Yanshou and Zhao Yanzhao (Ë∂ôÂª∂ÁÖß) as his forward commanders. The Liao forces first captured Bei Prefecture (Ë≤ùÂ∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), and then grouped near Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, capital of the former Tianxiong Circuit). Shi Chonggui tried to respond diplomatically, but his emissaries could not get through the Liao army and reach Emperor Taizong to deliver his letters. He also sent a number of generals to respond, with Jing Yanguang in effective command of the overall operations, but also himself went to the frontline. The second Liao thrust, led by Yel√º Andu toward Hedong, however, was repelled by Hedong's military governor Liu Zhiyuan. Later Jin's prefect of Bo Prefecture (ÂçöÂ∑û, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong), Zhou Ru (Âë®ÂÑí), who was in secret communications with Yang Guangyuan, surrendered Bo to Liao forces, and encouraged them to cross the Yellow River at Majiakou (È¶¨ÂÆ∂Âè£, in modern Liaocheng), to join forces with Yang. Jing was convinced by Yan Kan (È°èË°é) the acting military governor of Tianping that if Liao forces were able to cross the river, disaster would ensue, so the Later Jin imperial forces concentrated on battling Liao forces at Majiakou to prevent them from successfully crossing, and were able to do so. In anger, Liao forces slaughtered Han civilians that they had captured, which led to fiercer resistance from the populace. Later in spring 944, the armies commanded by the two emperors confronted each other near Yedu, but did not engage each other. Eventually, the Liao forces withdrew, pillaging as it went along over Later Jin's territory north of the Yellow River. Yang led his own troops west from Pinglu's capital Qing Prefecture (ÈùíÂ∑û), and tried to meet the Liao forces at the Yellow River, but by the time he reached there, Liao forces had already left. Shi then sent the imperial guard general Li Shouzhen to attack Yang, and in winter 944, Yang's son Yang Chengxun (Ê•äÊâøÂã≥) put his father under house arrest and surrendered. (Yang Guangyuan was later secretly killed on Shi's orders.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. In winter 944, Emperor Taizong again made a major incursion into Later Jin territory, using Zhao Yanshou as his forward commander. Shi was initially going to lead the Later Jin army himself, but fell ill at that time. He sent a number of generals to try to cut off the Liao army movement, but then, in fear of the Liao army's strengths, pulled back to the Yedu region, allowing the Liao army to advance unimpeded to Yedu, pillaging the Later Jin territory as it went along. However, the Liao army then withdrew in spring 945. As the Liao army withdrew, Shi sent Du Wei (i.e., Du Chongwei, who changed his name to observe naming taboo for Shi) and Li in command of an army to give chase. They crossed into Liao territory and captured Qi (Á•ÅÂ∑û) and Tai (Ê≥∞Â∑û) (both in modern Baoding), but soon received news that the Liao army had turned around and was heading for them. They tried to withdraw, but became surrounded near Yangcheng (ÈôΩÂüé, in modern Baoding). Du panicked and was reluctant to engage the Liao army, but at Fu Yanqing's advocacy, Fu, Zhang Yanze, Yao Yuanfu (Ëó•ÂÖÉÁ¶è), and Huangfu Yu (ÁöáÁî´ÈÅá), attacked the Liao army fiercely, causing the Liao army to panic and flee. After Emperor Taizong was able to regroup at You, he caned each of the chieftains who were part of the operation several hundred times, with only Zhao Yanshou escaping punishment. It was described that, by this point, the incessant Liao incursions were rendering Later Jin's imperial army fatigued and its border regions desolate. Liao itself had also suffered many casualties to its soldiers and animals, and the Khitan people tired of the campaigns. Empress Dowager Shul√º tried to urge Emperor Taizong into a more conciliatory posture with Later Jin. Meanwhile, Sang Weihan, who had taken over much of the military responsibility from Jing by this point, also was urging Shi to take a reconciliatory approach. In summer 945, Shi sent the emissary Zhang Hui (ÂºµÊöâ) to the Liao court, apologizing and begging forgiveness. Emperor Taizong responded, \\"Send Sang Weihan and Jing Yanguang to come see us, and cede the two circuits of Zhen (ÈéÆÂ∑û, i.e., Chengde, as Zhen was the capital of Chengde, now renamed Shunguo (È†ÜÂúã)) and Ding (ÂÆöÂ∑û, i.e., Yiwu, as Ding was the capital of Yiwu) to us, then there will be peace.\\" Shi found the response insulting, and cut off further communications. He considered an alliance with Goryeo's King Taejo against Liao, but then found out that Goryeo lacked the strength to attack Liao, and so abandoned the idea.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. = Liao's destruction of Later Jin = In 946, there were rumors that Zhao Yanshou was planning on defecting to Later Jin. This rumor was believed by the Later Jin chiefs of staff Li Song and Feng Yu. They had Du Wei write a letter to Zhao, encouraging him to do so, with the officer Zhao Xingshi (Ë∂ôË°åÂØ¶), who had previously served under Zhao Yanshou, delivering the letter. Zhao Yanshou wrote back (to try to lead Later Jin forces into a trap), stating, \\"I have long been in a foreign land, and I want to return to China. Please launch a major army to support me, so that I can pull myself out and return with it.\\" Subsequently, under Emperor Taizong's orders, Liao's prefect of Ying Prefecture (ÁÄõÂ∑û, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), Liu Yanzuo (ÂäâÂª∂Á•ö), also offered to defect to Later Jin. Shi thus put Du and Li Shouzhen in command of an army to attack north, with the stated objectives being to first recapture the prefectures previously ceded to Liao, and then to destroy Liao. When Du and Li advanced, though, they were met by a large army that Emperor Taizong personally commanded. The Liao army eventually surrounded the Later Jin army at Zhongdu Bridge (‰∏≠Â∫¶Ê©ã, in modern Baoding). After Emperor Taizong made the promise to Du to make him emperor if he surrendered, Du and Li surrendered their army. Emperor Taizong had Zhao comfort the Later Jin soldiers and told him that the Later Jin army was now his, and then prepared to advance south. With virtually the entire Later Jin army having been given to Du and Li for this northern campaign, then-Later Jin capital Daliang was left essentially defenseless, and Shi Chonggui felt compelled to surrender, ending Later Jin. Emperor Taizong subsequently entered Daliang.  Temporary rule over central China  Emperor Taizong declared himself the emperor of China as well, reneging on his promises to Zhao Yanshou and Du Chongwei. He gave Shi Chonggui the title of Marquess of Fuyi (i.e., \\"marquess who turned against righteousness) and moved Shi and Shi's family to a desolate part of Liao proper, away from Shi's old realm. Nearly all of Later Jin's officials and military governors submitted petitions to him, acknowledging him as emperor, except for two circuits on the western periphery, whose military governors Shi Kuangwei (Âè≤Âå°Â®Å) and He Chongjian (‰ΩïÈáçÂª∫) refused to accept Liao rule. Fearing of the strength that the old Later Jin imperial army still possessed, he considered slaughtering the soldiers, but as Zhao pointed out that doing so would merely open the Later Jin realms open to attack and occupation by Later Jin's southwestern neighbor Later Shu and southeastern neighbor Southern Tang, he decided against the idea. He kept the Later Jin military governors who came to Daliang to pay him homage at Daliang, while commissioning a number of Liao generals (of both Khitan and Han ethnicities) to take over the circuits. Believing that his rule was firm, he spent much time feasting, and he stated to the former Later Jin officials, \\"We know everything there is to know about China, but you know nothing about our land.\\" To congratulate him for this great victory, Empress Dowager Shul√º sent wine, delicacies, and fruits from Khitan lands to Daliang. Whenever he drank the wine that she sent, he stood up and stated, \\"This was bestowed by the Empress Dowager. I do not dare to drink it sitting down.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. However, in this jubilation, Emperor Taizong then carried out acts that alienated the people of the land that he just conquered. When Zhao pointed out that tax revenues needed to be collected to supply the Liao soldiers that came with Emperor Taizong, Emperor Taizong responded, \\"Our land has no such customs.\\" Rather, he sent out the Liao soldiers into the countryside to pillage it, referring to it as \\"threshing the grass seeds\\" (ÊâìËçâÁ©Ä). This caused many deaths of Han adults, and the Han young and old were forced to hide themselves in trenches to avoid the same fate. It was said that all civilian wealth and animals in a region that included Daliang and Luoyang, and Zheng (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), Hua (ÊªëÂ∑û, in modern Anyang, Henan), Cao (ÊõπÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong), and Pu (ÊøÆÂ∑û, in modern Puyang, Henan) were all destroyed. He also ordered that all in the capital, as well as in prefectures that he sent emissaries to, force the populace to turn over their wealths so that they could be (ostensibly) rewarded to the Liao soldiers, but in reality he planned to transport back to Liao proper. This led to resentment among the Han, and growing sentiment to expel the Liao forces. One of the leading Later Jin military governors who, while submitting to Liao, did not go to Daliang to pay homage to him, was Liu Zhiyuan the military governor of Hedong, who made excuses to stay at Taiyuan but who also did not immediately declare resistance to Liao. Emperor Taizong tried to get him to commit by sending emissaries to him to award him a cane (which was only matched by what Emperor Taizong awarded to Yel√º Anduan, as the emperor's uncle) and also having the emissaries state to him, \\"You did not serve the southern dynasty [(i.e., Later Jin, as Liu, while outwardly a vassal of Shi Chonggui's, made no attempt to save him)], and now you are not serving the northern dynasty [(i.e., Liao)]. What are you intending?\\" Meanwhile, Gao Conghui, the ruler of the semi-independent state of Jingnan, submitted tributes to Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Taizong sent awards of horses in return, but Gao also sent emissaries to Liu, encouraging him to declare himself emperor in resistance to Liao. Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing also sent emissaries to Emperor Taizong, congratulating him on destroying Later Jin, and requesting permission to send construction workers to repair the tombs of Tang emperors (as Li Jing claimed to be the legitimate successor to Tang). Emperor Taizong refused, but still sent emissaries to Southern Tang in response. Meanwhile, with the original Later Jin-commissioned military governors no longer at their circuits, many circuits began to raise in rebellion against Liao, starting with Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), whose officers assassinated the Liao-commissioned deputy military governor Liu Yuan (ÂäâÈ°ò) and supported one of their own, Zhao Hui (Ë∂ôÊöâ), in rebellion against Liao. Not long after, Liu Zhiyuan declared himself emperor at Hedong (initially without a new name for his state, but later known as Later Han. After Liu's declaration of himself as emperor, many of the circuits resisting Liao pledged allegiance to him. This included many agrarian rebels, causing Emperor Taizong to lament, \\"I did not know that the Chinese people are this difficult to rule.\\" He sent some of the military governors back to their circuits with Liao soldiers escorting them, but was unable to stem these rebellions. In late spring, tired of dealing with these rebellions, Emperor Taizong convened the officials at Daliang, stating to them, \\"It is soon to be summer. It is not easy for me to remain. Let me return to the greater empire [(i.e., Liao proper)] for me to pay homage to the Empress Dowager. I will leave a trusted person here to be the military governor.\\" He prepared to take the entire Later Jin imperial administration's officials with him, but there were those who advised him that doing that may cause the situation at Daliang to go out of control, so he took only the highly honored officials with him, while leaving the rest at Daliang. He commissioned his brother-in-law (Empress Xiao Wen's brother) Xiao Han as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered at Daliang), and left Xiao in charge of Daliang, while withdrawing from Daliang himself.  Attempt to return to Liao proper and Death  As Emperor Taizong withdrew, as he crossed the Yellow River, he lamented, \\"When I was at the greater empire, I was pleased to shoot and hunt. I am, instead, saddened here without so. Now as I am returning to the greater empire, I would not regret it even if I died.\\" As he travelled past cities laid desolate by his army, he lamented, \\"The fact that I did all this to China was the fault of the Prince of Yan [(i.e., Zhao Yanshou)].\\" He also commented that it was also the contributions of his official Zhang Li. Emperor Taizong's departure from Daliang, however, only continued to embolden the Han rebels, and soon, the key Yellow River ford of Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, in modern Luoyang) fell. When he heard of Heyang's fall, he lamented: Meanwhile, when Emperor Taizong's train arrived at Lincheng (Ëá®Âüé, in modern Xingtai, he began to become ill. By the time that he reached Luancheng (Ê¨íÂüé, in modern Shijiazhuang), his illness became worse, and he was running such a high fever such that he had ice stacked on his chest, abdomen, and limbs, and was chewing the ice, to try to relieve the fever. Shortly after, he died. The Khitan generals cut open his abdomen and stuffed it with salt, to allow continued transport north. The Han sarcastically referred to him as \\"dried emperor.\\" The Khitan chieftains supported his nephew (Yel√º Bei's son) Yel√º Ruan to succeed him as emperor (as Emperor Shizong), and Emperor Shizong was able to take over the throne after fighting off challenges, first leveled by Zhao Yanshou, and then leveled by Empress Dowager Shul√º and Yel√º Lihu. However, Liao was unable to retain the lands that Emperor Taizong seized from Later Jin, which eventually all became part of Liu Zhiyuan's Later Han state.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287.

He also helped organize and would subsequently participate in the 1963 March on Washington. Life and career Eugene Carson Blake was born in St. Louis, Missouri on November 7, 1906, the son of Lulu and Orville Prescott Blake. He graduated from Princeton University in 1928 with a Bachelor of Arts and the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1932 with a Bachelor of Theology. He would also attend classes at the University of Edinburgh. From 1928 to 1929, he taught at the Forman Christian College in Lahore; from 1935 to 1951, he was the minister of Presbyterian churches in America, holding pastorates at churches in New York City and Albany, as well as serving as the Senior Minister of Pasadena Presbyterian Church in Pasadena for eleven years. From 1951 to 1958, he was stated clerk of the General Assembly of the PCUSA, and of the United Presbyterian Church until 1966. He served as the president of the National Council of Churches from 1954‚Äì1957 and the General Secretary of the World Council of Churches in 1966. Blake retired from the World Council of Churches in 1972.Finding Aid for Eugene Carson Blake Papers. http://www.history.pcusa.org/collections/findingaids/fa.cfm?record_id=3. Blake became a trustee of Princeton Seminary in 1954. Although an experienced and talented administrator, Eugene Carson Blake is best known for his forthright stand against racial segregation as well for his progressive stance on a number of issues affecting Protestant church denominations. In 1960, he preached a sermon calling for the unification of a number of major Protestant denominations into one separate church. This sermon is considered to be the impetus for the 40-year Consultation on Church Union ecumenical effort to unite ten mainline denominations. In 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., Eugene Carson Blake, and eight other civil rights leaders called for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. Dr. King, Dr. Blake, and the other organizers met with President John F. Kennedy at the White House before the March, and subsequently participated in the demonstration, marching down Constitution Avenue with linked arms. At the Lincoln Memorial after the March, Dr. Blake spoke following A. Philip Randolph and before John Lewis. Martin Luther King gave his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech a few minutes later. Death Blake died in 1985. He is buried in Stamford's Long Ridge Union Cemetery.

It is part of the Alabama Community College System. Accreditation Jefferson State is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the associate degree. Individual academic programs are nationally accredited by 10 different professional evaluating organizations Huntingdon College offers a bachelor's degree program that has classes at two of Jeff State's campuses. The courses are accelerated so that students can attend class one night a week and complete their bachelor's degree in a traditional time frame. Classes last 5 weeks and students can receive financial aid through Huntingdon for this program. History Jefferson State Junior College was established on May 3, 1963, by an act of the State Legislature. The first students enrolled at Jeff State in September 1965. The Alabama State Board of Education officially changed the name of the school to Jefferson State Community College on February 23, 1989. The original campus is located on in Center Point, Alabama. The thirteen buildings that make up the campus are named for community benefactors (H.Y. and Ruby Carson, John B. Bethune, Harvey DeRamus, and Eugene Fitzgerald), elected officials (James B. Allen, George C. Wallace, Lurleen B. Wallace, and Harold C. Martin), and former Jeff State presidents (Leroy Brown and George L. Layton). The college opened an extension center in Shelby County, Alabama in January 1993. In June 1996, the center was designated a branch campus by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. The Shelby Campus in Hoover, Alabama has buildings on and is adding a manufacturing center in late 2020. In 2003, the Alabama State Board of Education revised the college's service area to include the western part of St. Clair County, Alabama. Classes began meeting at the St. Clair Center in Moody, Alabama in Fall 2003. On April 22, 2004, the board approved another instructional site for St. Clair County in Pell City, Alabama, and classes started meeting there in Fall 2004. With deeded to the school by the St. Clair Economic Development Council, Jeff State constructed a new center in Pell City. The college offered classes in that three-story facility in Fall 2006. In 2007, the Board again revised the college's service area to include Chilton County, Alabama and approved construction for a multipurpose instructional facility in Clanton, Alabama. The new center was completed and classes began in Fall 2008. Jeff State has had four presidents: Dr. Leroy Brown (1964-1971), Dr. George L. Layton (1971-1979), Dr. Judy M.

Biography As a child, Edwards was fascinated by the wildlife he found in his local area, and by the age of 12 was accomplished enough at imitating many of them that this became his \\"party piece\\". In 1930 he debuted on the BBC radio series Vaudeville, the start of a career that would last the best part of 60 years. During World War II, Edwards worked at Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies in Ipswich. Edwards became a household name after his animal imitations in the radio shows Ray's a Laugh with Ted Ray, and playing Psyche the dog in the radio series A Life of Bliss. It was said that at the height of his career he could accurately imitate over 600 birds, as well as many other animals. Among other things, he provided the voices for the killer whales in Orca (1977), the Reindeer in Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), sheep and bird sounds on Kate Bush's song The Dreaming, and the alien in the film of the same name. Edwards appeared occasionally on BBC TV's pre-school series Play School as a storyteller, in 1967 and from 1973 through 1980. One of his last stage appearances was in the Grand Order of Water Rats centenary show at the London Palladium in 1989. Edwards was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1993 for services to ornithology and entertainment. Although he always referred to himself as an entertainer, Edwards was a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and a respected and published ornithologist. In 2009, Sir David Attenborough presented a special BBC radio panel game, The Percy Edwards Showdown, dedicated to Edwards's life and career.

The condition is excruciatingly painful because the loss of these cells results in the exposure of sensitive corneal nerves. This condition can often leave patients with temporary blindness due to extreme light sensitivity (photophobia). Signs and symptoms Symptoms include recurring attacks of severe acute ocular pain, foreign-body sensation, photophobia (i.e. sensitivity to bright lights), and tearing often at the time of awakening or during sleep when the eyelids are rubbed or opened. Signs of the condition include corneal abrasion or localized roughening of the corneal epithelium, sometimes with map-like lines, epithelial dots or microcysts, or fingerprint patterns. An epithelial defect may be present, usually in the inferior interpalpebral zone. Cause Most cases of recurrent corneal erosion are acquired. There is often a history of recent corneal injury (corneal abrasion or ulcer), but also may be due to corneal dystrophy or corneal disease. In other words, one may suffer from corneal erosions as a result of another disorder, such as map-dot fingerprint dystrophy.Review of Ophthalmology, Friedman NJ, Kaiser PK, Trattler WB, Elsevier Saunders, 2005, p. 221 Familial corneal erosions occur in dominantly inherited recurrent corneal erosion dystrophy (ERED) in which COL17A1 gene is mutated. Diagnosis The erosion may be seen by an eye doctor using the magnification of a biomicroscope or slit lamp. Usually fluorescein stain must be applied first and a cobalt blue-light used, but may not be necessary if the area of the epithelial defect is large. Optometrists and ophthalmologists have access to the slit lamp microscopes that allow for this more-thorough evaluation under the higher magnification. Mis-diagnosis of a scratched cornea is fairly common, especially in younger patients. Prevention Given that episodes tend to occur on awakening and managed by use of good 'wetting agents', approaches to be taken to help prevent episodes include: ; Environmental: * ensuring that the air is humidified rather than dry, not overheated and without excessive airflow over the face. Also avoiding irritants such as cigarette smoke.Verma A, Ehrenhaus M (August 25, 2005) * use of protective glasses especially when gardening or playing with children. ;General personal measures: * maintaining general hydration levels with adequate fluid intake. * not sleeping-in late as the cornea tends to dry out the longer the eyelids are closed. ;Pre-bed routine: * routine use of long- lasting eye ointments applied before going to bed. * occasional use of the anti-inflammatory eyedrop FML (prescribed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist) before going to bed if the affected eye feels inflamed, dry or gritty * use of a hyperosmotic (hypertonic) ointment before bed reduces the amount of water in the epithelium, strengthening its structure * use the pressure patch as mentioned above. * use surgical tape to keep the eye closed (if Nocturnal Lagophthalmos is a factor) ;Waking options: *learn to wake with eyes closed and still and keeping artificial tear drops within reach so that they may be squirted under the inner corner of the eyelids if the eyes feel uncomfortable upon waking. *It has also been suggested that the eyelids should be rubbed gently, or pulled slowly open with your fingers, before trying to open them, or keeping the affected eye closed while \\"looking\\" left and right to help spread lubricating tears. If the patient's eyelids feel stuck to the cornea on waking and no intense pain is present, use a fingertip to press firmly on the eyelid to push the eye's natural lubricants onto the affected area. This procedure frees the eyelid from the cornea and prevents tearing of the cornea. Treatment With the eye generally profusely watering, the type of tears being produced have little adhesive property. Water or saline eye drops tend therefore to be ineffective. Rather a 'better quality' of tear is required with higher 'wetting ability' (i.e. greater amount of glycoproteins) and so artificial tears (e.g. viscotears) are applied frequently. Also recommended is Muro 128 5% Ointment (Sodium Chloride Hypertonicity Ophthalmic Ointment, 5%) which is a great relief overnight, it lasts longer than most regular tears and provides protection for those with severe cases. Nocturnal Lagophthalmos (where one‚Äôs eyelids don‚Äôt close enough to cover the eye completely during sleep) may be an exacerbating factor, in which case using surgical tape to keep the eye closed at night can help. Whilst individual episodes may settle within a few hours or days, additional episodes (as the name suggests) will recur at intervals. Where episodes frequently occur, or there is an underlying disorder, one medical, or three types of surgical curative procedures may be attempted: use of therapeutic contact lens, controlled puncturing of the surface layer of the eye (Anterior Stromal Puncture) and laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). These all essentially try to allow the surface epithelium to reestablish with normal binding to the underlying basement membrane, the method chosen depends upon the location & size of the erosion. =Surgical= A punctal plug may be inserted into the tear duct by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, decreasing the removal of natural tears from the affected eye. The use of contact lenses may help prevent the abrasion during blinking lifting off the surface layer and uses thin lenses that are gas permeable to minimise reduced oxygenation. However they need to be used for between 8‚Äì26 weeks and such persistent use both incurs frequent follow-up visits and may increase the risk of infections. Alternatively, under local anaesthetic, the corneal layer may be gently removed with a fine needle, cauterised (heat or laser) or 'spot welding' attempted (again with lasers). The procedures are not guaranteed to work, and in a minority may exacerbate the problem. Anterior Stromal Puncture with a 20-25 gauge needle is an effective and simple treatment. An option for minimally invasive and long-term effective therapy is laser phototherapeutic keratectomy. Laser PTK involves the surgical laser treatment of the cornea to selectively ablate cells on the surface layer of the cornea. It is thought that the natural regrowth of cells in the following days are better able to attach to the basement membrane to prevent recurrence of the condition. Laser PTK has been found to be most effective after epithelial debridement for the partial ablation of Bowman's lamella, which performed prior to PTK in the surgical procedure. This is meant to smoothen out the corneal area that the laser PTK will then treat. In some cases, small-spot PTK, which only treats certain areas of the cornea may also be an acceptable alternative. =Medical= People with recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions often show increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the basement membrane and fibrils of the hemidesmosomes, which can lead to the separation of the epithelial layer. Treatment with oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as doxycycline or oxytetracycline) together with a topical corticosteroid (such as prednisolone), reduce MMP activity and may rapidly resolve and prevent further episodes in cases unresponsive to conventional therapies. Some have now proposed this as the first line therapy after lubricants have failed. There is a lack of good quality evidence to guide treatment choices. A recently updated Cochrane Review concluded that \\"Studies included in this review have been of insufficient size and quality to provide firm evidence to inform the development of management guidelines.\\" See also *Corneal ulcers in dogs Footnotes  External links  *Facts About the Cornea and Corneal Disease The National Eye Institute (NEI) Category:Diseases of the eye and adnexa Category:Disorders of sclera and cornea ","title":"Recurrent corneal erosion"},{"id":"2530467","title":"Vince Young"},{"id":"2530468","text":"Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site commemorates the Battle of Brices Crossroads, in which the Confederate army, under Major-General Nathan Bedford Forrest, defeated a much larger Union force on June 10, 1864, to ultimately secure supply lines between Nashville and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

The site features a memorial erected soon after the battlefield was designated as a historic site in 1929. In addition, on June 11, 2005, a second memorial was dedicated to Confederate Capt. John W. Morton, Chief of Artillery, and his battery. Brices Cross Roads is the only component of the National Park System designated a \\"battlefield site\\". The modern Bethany Presbyterian Church is located on the southeast side of the crossroads. At the time of the battle, this congregation's meeting house was located further south along the Baldwyn Road. The Old Bethany Cemetery, adjacent to the battlefield site, predates the Civil War. Many of the area's earliest settlers are buried here. The graves of more than 90 Confederate soldiers killed in the battle are also located in this cemetery. Union dead from the battle were buried in common graves on the battlefield, but were later reinterred in the Memphis National Cemetery at Memphis, Tennessee. The Brices Cross Roads Visitor Center, located in Baldwyn, is owned and operated by a public commission. Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Commission, Inc., formed in 1994 by concerned local citizens, is also involved in protecting the greater battlefield, which is considered one of the most beautiful preserved battlefields of the American Civil War. With assistance from the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and the support of federal, state, and local governments, the commission has purchased for preservation of the original battlefield. American Battlefield Trust \\"Saved Land\\" webpage. Accessed May 23, 2018. Administrative history The site was established February 21, 1929, and transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. The battlefield was automatically listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It is administered under the Natchez Trace Parkway.

First usage and context The phrase, which Perot coined during the 1992 US presidential campaign, referred to the sound of US jobs heading south for Mexico should the free-trade agreement go into effect. In the second 1992 Presidential Debate, Ross Perot argued: > We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're > paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your > factory South of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, ... have no > health care‚Äîthat's the most expensive single element in making a car‚Äî have > no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you > don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking > sound going south. > ... when [Mexico's] jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars > an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled > again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of > deals. Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported NAFTA, which went into effect on January 1, 1994. Legacy The phrase has since come into general use to describe any situation involving loss of jobs, or fear of a loss of jobs, particularly by one nation to a rival. Examples include: * A European Union representative spoke of worrying \\"about the giant sucking sound from Eastern Europe;\\"Landler, Mark (2004), Hungary Eager and Uneasy Over New Status , The New York Times, March 5, 2004, Business, p. 1 * Thomas Friedman opined that \\"the Mexicans ... are hearing 'the giant sucking sound' in stereo these days‚Äîfrom China in one ear and India in the other.Friedman, Thomas L (2004), What's That Sound?, The New York Times, April 1, 2004, editorial section, p. 23 * Columnist Joe Sharkey used the phrase \\"That Giant Sucking Sound\\" to introduce a comment about a 34% slump in employment in the US airline industry. * US Congressman Steve LaTourette (R-OH 14) invoked the catchphrase while criticizing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009: \\"Well, today there's another sucking sound going on in Washington, D.C.

Merriam-webster.com. Accessed August 2011. Common types A side dish of macaroni and cheese A side dish of Greek salad Side dishes such as salad, potatoes and bread are commonly used with main courses throughout many countries of the western world. Rice and couscous, have grown to be quite popular throughout Europe, especially at formal occasions (with couscous appearing more commonly at dinner parties with Middle Eastern dishes). When used as an adjective qualifying the name of a dish, the term \\"side\\" usually refers to a smaller portion served as a side dish, rather than a larger, main dish-sized serving. For example, a \\"side salad\\" usually served in a small bowl or salad plate, in contrast to a large dinner-plate- sized entr√©e salad. A typical American meal with a meat-based main dish might include one vegetable side dish, sometimes in the form of a salad, and one starch side dish, such as bread, potatoes, rice, or pasta.

In contrast, sometimes side dishes are ordered separately from an a la carte menu. The term may or may not imply that the dish can only be ordered with other food. French fries are a common side dish served at fast-food restaurants and other American cuisine restaurants. In response to criticism about the high fat and calorie content of French fries, some fast-food chains offer other side dishes, such as salads, as substitutes for the standard French fries with their combination meals. \\"On the side\\" The related phrase on the side may be synonymous with \\"side dish\\" ‚Äì as in \\"French fries on the side\\" ‚Äì or may refer to a complimentary sauce or condiment served in a separate dish.

There are two sorts, the one where the horse part sits rigidly attached to a pair of curved rockers that are in contact with the ground, and a second sort, where the horse hangs on a rigid frame by iron straps the horse moves only relative to the frame, which does not move. Predecessors of the rocking horse may be seen in the rocking cradle, the tilting seats used during the Middle Ages for jousting practice as well as the wheeled hobby horse. The toy in its current form did not appear before the 17th century,Toy Horses (from the V&A; Museum of Childhood website) though some conflicting sources note medieval manuscripts including references to carved rocking horses, presumably of the toy kind. From the 19th century onward, rocking horses became more commonly considered as child's toy. Mostly built by hobby woodcrafters, and ranging from relatively crude to finely ornamented and the toys of future kings, it was not until the late 19th century that the production became industrialised. In 2006, the Guinness Book of World Records certified Katlinel and Les Hartness of California as having the largest hand-carved wooden rocking horse on record. This rocking horse was built in 2000 and is 7 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. It can be seen at renaissance faires, faerie festivals, and at private parties and events where up to 3 adults or 4-5 children can ride it together at one time. According to Les and Katlinel, the youngest rider has been six weeks old and the oldest, 94 years.

Like all of The Federalist papers, it was published under the pseudonym Publius. Titled \\"The Judiciary Department\\", Federalist No. 78 was published May 28, 1788 and first appeared in a newspaper on June 14 of the same year. It was written to explicate and justify the structure of the judiciary under the proposed Constitution of the United States; it is the first of six essays by Hamilton on this issue. In particular, it addresses concerns by the Anti-Federalists over the scope and power of the federal judiciary, which would have comprised unelected, politically insulated judges that would be appointed for life. The Federalist Papers, as a foundation text of constitutional interpretation, are frequently cited by U.S. jurists, but are not law. Of all the essays, No. 78 is the most cited by the justices of the United States Supreme Court. In Federalist No. 78, Hamilton said that the Judiciary branch of the proposed government would be the weakest of the three branches because it had \\"no influence over either the sword or the purse, ...It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment.\\" Federalist No. 78 quotes Montesquieu: \\"Of the three powers [...], the judiciary is next to nothing.\\" There was little concern that the judiciary might be able to overpower the political branches; since Congress controlled the flow of money and the President the military, courts did not have nearly the same power from a constitutional design standpoint. The Judiciary would depend on the political branches to uphold its judgments. Legal academics often argue over Hamilton's description of the judiciary as the \\"least dangerous\\" branch. Hamilton also explains how federal judges should retain life terms as long as those judges exhibit good behavior. Federalist No. 78 discusses the power of judicial review. It argues that the federal courts have the job of determining whether acts of Congress are constitutional and what must be done if government is faced with the things that are done on the contrary of the Constitution. Controls on judicial conduct The fundamental debate that Hamilton and his Anti-Federalist rival \\"Brutus\\" addressed was over the degree of independence to be granted to federal judges, and the level of accountability to be imposed upon them. In England, a judge can be removed from office \\"upon the address of both Houses of Parliament.\\" Moreover, as the Act of Settlement 1701 was a mere law, the judicial independence it provided could be abrogated wholesale by an act of Parliament. Similarly, English judges were beholden to Parliament, in the sense that their judgments can be overturned by that body. Brutus took the position that the Constitution should adopt the English system in toto (with minor modifications); Hamilton defended the present system. =Good behavior tenure= In England, although most agents of the Crown served \\"at the pleasure of the King,\\" public officials were often granted a life tenure in their offices. Lesser lords were given the authority to bestow life tenure, which created an effective multi-tiered political patronage system where everyone from paymasters to judges to parish clerks enjoyed job security. Without some kind of effective control upon their conduct, this would engender intolerable injustice, as the King's ministers would be free to 'vent their spleen' upon defenseless subjects with impunity. The English solution to this problem was to condition the holding of office upon good behavior, as enforced by the people through the writ of scire facias. Although it was technically a writ of the sovereign, this power concerned only the interests of his subjects; as the King exercised it only as parens patriae, he was bound by law to allow the use of it to any subject interested. Sir William Blackstone explains in his landmark treatise on the common law, Commentaries on the Laws of England: > WHERE the crown hath unadvisedly granted any thing by letters patent, which > ought not to be granted, or where the patentee hath done an act that amounts > to a forfeiture of the grant, the remedy to repeal the patent is by writ of > scire facias in chancery. This may be brought either on the part of the > king, in order to resume the thing granted; or, if the grant be injurious to > a subject, the king is bound of right to permit him (upon his petition) to > use his royal name for repealing the patent in a scire facias. Violations of good behavior tenure at common law included \\"abuse of office, nonuse of office, and refusal to exercise an office,\\" and the \\"oppression and tyrannical partiality of judges, justices, and other magistrates, in the administration and under the colour of their office, [which could be prosecuted] by information in the court of king's bench.\\" As the remedy of the writ of scire facias was available in every one of the colonies, its efficacy as a deterrent against abuse of judicial office was assumed rather than debated. =Legislative review of judicial decisions= The primary point of contention between Hamilton and Brutus was in the concern that judges would substitute their will for the plain text of the Constitution, as exemplified by the Supreme Court's de facto revision of the Eleventh Amendment. Hamilton conceded that no federal judge had the legal authority to impose his or her will on the people in defiance of the Constitution: Brutus pointed out that the Constitution did not provide an effective mechanism for controlling judicial caprice: > There is no power above them, to control any of their decisions. There is no > authority that can remove them, and they cannot be controlled by the laws of > the legislature. In short, they are independent of the people, of the > legislature, and of every power under heaven. Men placed in this situation > will generally soon feel themselves independent of heaven itself. Hamilton viewed this apparent flaw in constitutional design as more of a virtue than a vice: > But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that the > independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects > of occasional ill humors in the society. These sometimes extend no farther > than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens, > by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial > magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining > the operation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the immediate > mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates as a check > upon the legislative body in passing them; who, perceiving that obstacles to > the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of > the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very motives of the injustice > they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circumstance calculated > to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few > may be aware of. It appears that Hamilton is relying on the efficacy of the writ of scire facias, coupled with a presumption that other branches of government will ignore unconstitutional judicial decisions, as a control upon judicial misconduct. Judicial review Federalist No. 78 describes the process of judicial review, in which the federal courts review statutes to determine whether they are consistent with the Constitution and its statutes. Federalist No. 78 indicates that under the Constitution, the legislature is not the judge of the constitutionality of its own actions. Rather, it is the responsibility of the federal courts to protect the people by restraining the legislature from acting inconsistently with the Constitution: > If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional > judges of their own powers, and that the construction they put upon them is > conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered, that this cannot > be the natural presumption, where it is not to be collected from any > particular provisions in the Constitution. It is not otherwise to be > supposed, that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives > of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents. It is > far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be an > intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among > other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their > authority. Federalist No. 78 views the judicial branch as inherently weak because of its inability to control either the money or the military of the country. The only power of the judicial branch is the power of judgment: > The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the > community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the > rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. > The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or > the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the > society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to > have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend > upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments. Because of the courts' weakness, Federalist No. 78 sees the possibility of corruption using judicial review as a non-issue. The people will never be in danger if the structure of the government written up in the Constitution remains. It also asserts that judgment needs to be removed from the groups that make the legislation and rule: > It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then > proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can > never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary > remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive. For I > agree, that \\"there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated > from the legislative and executive powers. Federalist No. 78 views Supreme Court Justices as an embodiment of the Constitution, a last group to protect the foundation laws set up in the Constitution. This coincides with the view above that the judicial branch is the branch of judgment: > The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the > courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a > fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as > well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative > body. According to Federalist No. 78, the federal courts have a duty to interpret and apply the Constitution, and to disregard any statute that is inconsistent with the Constitution: > If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, > that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be > preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the > statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents. . . . Federalist No. 78 argues that the power of judicial review should be used by the judicial branch to protect the liberties guaranteed to the people by the Constitution and to provide a check on the power of the legislature: Federalist No. 78 therefore indicates that the federal judiciary has the power to determine whether statutes are constitutional, and to find them invalid if in conflict with the Constitution. This principle of judicial review was affirmed by the Supreme Court in the case of Marbury v. Madison (1803). References # \\"Fifteen Curious Facts about The Federalist Papers\\" by Dan T.

It is praised as \\"The Godfather of the East\\" and spawned two sequels, two remakes, and a film adaptation. The theme song, which shares the same Chinese title as the series and was performed by Frances Yip, also became a memorable Cantopop hit. Plot The series is set in China in the 1920s. Hui Man-keung is a Yenching University graduate who served three years in prison for participating in the May Fourth Movement. He decides to make a fresh start in Shanghai, where he meets and befriends Ting Lik, a fruit vendor. He invites Ting to be his partner after seizing an important position in a small-time gang. He also builds up a good relationship with Fung King-yiu, a wealthy tycoon and gang boss, after saving Fung's daughter, Ching-ching, who had been taken hostage. Fung wants Hui to work for him but Hui refuses. Ching-ching falls in love with Hui. After Ting kills a rival in a personal dispute over a woman, other gangs attack Hui and Ting and destroy their small-time gang. Hui and Ting then join Fung's bigger gang for protection. Later, Hui discovers that Fung is collaborating with secret agents from the Japanese right-wing Black Dragon Society to destroy the Ching-mou School, a Chinese martial arts school committed to defending China from foreign aggression. He enters a dilemma on whether to side with Ching-mou School or turn against Fung. Hui eventually decides to help the Ching-mou School and he kills a Japanese spy, Yamaguchi Kaoriko, in a gunfight. Furious upon learning of Hui's betrayal, Fung sends his men to hunt down and kill Hui. On account of their friendship, Ting secretly helps Hui escape from Shanghai. Hui fakes his death to evade Fung's men and settles in Hong Kong, where he marries So Wong-tai, starts a new life with her family, and opens a small restaurant. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, Ching-ching is unable to accept the news of Hui's death so she visits Hong Kong when she hears rumours that Hui is still alive there. She meets Hui there but refuses to believe him when he tells her he is already married. Hui then brings her home to show her his family. Unknown to them, Fung's men had secretly followed them and they kill Hui's family while he was out. After learning that Fung's men had murdered his family, Hui swears vengeance on Fung and returns to Shanghai to take his revenge. Hui becomes an adviser to Nip Yan-wong, Fung's main rival. Through many successful manoeuvres, Hui assists Nip in crippling Fung financially and politically. He also tells Ching-ching that they can never be together. During Hui's absence, Ting begins to court Ching-ching. After Ting is seriously injured on one occasion, Ching-ching agrees to marry him. Hui suffers an emotional breakdown due to the loss of his family, and after seeing that his ex-lover is about to marry his best friend. His depression ignites the anger in him and increases his thirst for revenge. Hui wants to kill Fung and asks Ting to help him. Ting sets them up for a game of Russian roulette in which Hui emerges victorious. Ching-ching is unable to forgive Hui for killing her father and she leaves China for France. Hui and Ting cooperate and manage to form the most powerful gang in the Shanghai underworld. However, Hui is not interested in gang affairs as he is eager to find Ching-ching and patch up with her. On the night before he is due to leave for France, Hui is gunned down outside a restaurant by unknown assailants.

Chow Yun-fat's character had died at the end of The Bund so he did not return for the sequel, The Bund II, except for a brief flashback cameo appearance. Ray Lui continued portraying his character in The Bund II and The Bund III.

The plot of the 1996 Hong Kong film Shanghai Grand, directed by Poon Man-kit and produced by Tsui Hark, is similar to that of The Bund. Leslie Cheung and Andy Lau starred as Hui Man-keung and Ting Lik respectively. The Bund was remade again in 2007 into a mainland Chinese television series, Shanghai Bund, directed by Gao Xixi. Huang Xiaoming, Susan Sun, Li Xuejian and Huang Haibo starred as the original characters. In 2016, it was announced that The Bund would be adapted into a mainland Chinese film under the title The Game Changer, which would be directed by Gao Xixi (who also directed the 2007 remake), and starring Huang Zitao and Peter Ho.

A rendering of the Latin phrase \\"mimi numinum niuium minimi munium nimium uini muniminum imminui uiui minimum uolunt\\" in a Gothic hand. In palaeography, a minim is a short, vertical stroke used in handwriting. The word is derived from the Latin minimum, meaning least or smallest. A minim is the basic stroke for the letters i, m, n, and u in uncial script and later scripts deriving from it. Parts of other letters are based on minims as well: when a minim is extended above the line, it becomes an ascender, as in the letters d and b, and when it is extended below the line, it becomes a descender, as in the letters p and q. It is a stem when it forms only part of a letter, such as r. Minims often have a connecting stroke which makes it clear that they form an m, n, etc.; however, in Gothic scripts, also known as textualis especially in late examples, minims may connect to each other with only a hair line stroke making it difficult for modern readers to tell what letter is meant. A 14th- century example of this is: mimi numinum niuium minimi munium nimium uini muniminum imminui uiui minimum uolunt (\\"the smallest mimes of the gods of snow do not wish at all in their life that the great duty of the defences of the wine be diminished\\"). In Gothic script this would look almost like a series of single strokes (this problem eventually led to a dotted i and separate letters j and v). Middle English scribes adopted a practice of replacing u before m, n, or v with o in order to break up the sequence of minims. The resulting spellings have persisted into modern times in words such as come, honey, and love, where an o stands for a short ≈≠. This is the reason Richard Coates gave, in his 1998 article, for 'LOndon' changing its spelling from 'LUnden'. Gothic minims may have various decorations (essentially serifs), from a simple initial headstroke, to large diamond-shaped finials at the top and bottom, such as in textualis quadrata, the most decorated form of Gothic. Textualis sine pedibus, literally \\"textualis without feet\\", has minims with no finials at all, while textualis rotunda has round finials.

He was also chief of staff and biographer to Stonewall Jackson. His biography of Jackson remains in print today. Dabney and James Henley Thornwell were two of Southern Presbyterianism's most influential scholars. They were both Calvinist, Old School Presbyterians, and social conservatives. Some conservative Presbyterians, particularly within the Presbyterian Church in America and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, still value their theological writings, although both these churches have repudiated Dabney's and Thornwell's beliefs on race and support of antebellum slavery. Dabney denounced public schools, which were rare in the South prior to Reconstruction, in often-racially-charged terms. His criticisms of public education became highly influential within the American conservative movement, as well as among theonomists such as Rousas John Rushdoony, who largely sympathized with the Confederacy. Biography =Early life= Robert Lewis Dabney was born on March 5, 1820. He was the sixth child (third son) of Charles William Dabney (1786‚Äì1833) and Elizabeth Randolph Price Dabney, and a descendant of Cornelius d'Aubign√© from an extended d'Aubign√© (Dabney) Huguenot family that settled in Virginia and Massachusetts in the 17th century.Dabney Smedes, Susan.

He graduated from Hampden-Sydney College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1837, and received a master's degree from the University of Virginia in 1842. He graduated from Union Theological Seminary in 1846.Johnson, Thomas C. (1909). \\"Robert L. Dabney,\\" The Kaleidoscope, Vol. VII, p. 27. =Career= He served as a missionary in Louisa County, Virginia, from 1846 to 1847 and pastor at Tinkling Spring Presbyterian Church from 1847 to 1853, being also head master of a classical school for a portion of this time. He is considered a distinguished son of Providence Presbyterian Church. It was at Tinkling Spring that he met Margaret Lavinia Morrison. They were married on March 28, 1848. They had six sons together, three of whom died in childhood from diphtheria (two in 1855, the other in 1862). From 1853 to 1859, he was professor of ecclesiastical history and polity and from 1859 to 1869 adjunct professor of systematic theology in Union Theological Seminary, where he later became full professor of systematics. In 1883, he was appointed professor of mental and moral philosophy in the University of Texas. Dabney defended the biblical \\"righteousness\\" of slavery and opposed public schools. In the 1870s, he wrote that it was unjust to tax \\"oppressed\\" white people to provide \\"pretended education to the brats of black paupers\\". He rejected \\"the Yankee theory of popular state education\\" and democratic government itself, which interfered with the liberty of the South.What the ‚ÄòGovernment Schools‚Äô Critics Really Mean, By KATHERINE STEWART, New York Times, JULY 31, 2017 By 1894, failing health compelled him to retire from active life, although he still lectured occasionally. He was co-pastor, with his brother-in-law B. M. Smith, of the Hampden-Sydney College Church 1858 to 1874, also serving Hampden-Sydney College in a professorial capacity on occasions of vacancies in its faculty. Dabney, whose wife was a third cousin to Stonewall Jackson's wife, participated in the American Civil War: during the summer of 1861 he was chaplain of the 18th Virginia Infantry in the Confederate army, and in the following year was chief of staff to Jackson during the Valley Campaign and the Seven Days Battles.

The book was originally published in a censored form in 1966 in the Russian language. Career in the USSR Kuznetsov was born to a Russian father and a Ukrainian mother, his passport stated that he was Russian. He grew up in the Kyiv district of Kurenivka, in his own words \\"a stone's throw from a vast ravine, whose name, Babi Yar, was once known only to locals.\\" At the age fourteen, Kuznetsov began recording in a notebook everything he saw as a witness and heard about the Babi Yar massacre. Once his mother discovered and read his notes. She cried and advised him to save them for a book he might write someday. Before becoming a writer, Kuznetsov \\"studied ballet and acting, tried painting and music, worked as a carpenter, road builder, concrete worker, helped build the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant on the Dniper river, and worked on the Irkutsk and Bratsk hydroelectric power plants in Siberia.\\" In 1955, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Eventually, he began \\"studying to become a writer\\" and enrolled at the Moscow Gorky Literary Institute. In 1957, literary magazine Yunost featured his novella entitled Sequel to a Legend. Kuznetsov described his first experience with publishers as follows: > I wrote the novella 'Sequel to a Legend' and offered it to Yunost magazine. > It tells the story of a young man, who came to work in Siberia with a solid > youthful belief in something better, in some ultimate good, despite all the > hardships and poverty. The Yunost editors liked the novella very much but > said they couldn't publish it: the censors wouldn't allow it, the magazine > would be closed, and I would be arrested or, in the worst case, barred from > literature for life. Above all, Western propagandists might pick up this > story and run with it: 'See, this is proof of how terrible life in the > Soviet Union really is!' Experienced writers told me that the novella could > be saved, that at least a part of it must be brought to the readers' > attention, that they would know what came from the heart and what I had to > write for form's sake, and that I should add some optimistic episodes. For a > long time my novella gathered dust without any hope of being published, but > eventually I forced myself to add some optimistic episodes, which contrasted > so sharply with the overall style and were so outrageously cheerful that no > reader would take them seriously. The novella was turned down, but eventually was published in a heavily censored form and without author's approval. It was this version that earned him a countrywide fame. He graduated in 1960 and was admitted to the USSR Union of Writers and, by extension, to the State Literary Fund. In the 1960s he became famous as one of the country's most talented and progressive writers, the father of the genre of confessional prose. He married Iryna Marchenko and was preparing to become a father. Soon he and his pregnant wife moved to Tula.

The novel included the previously unknown materials about the execution of 33,771 Jews in the course of two days, September 29‚Äì30, 1941, in the Kyiv ravine Babi Yar. The uncensored work included materials highly critical of the Soviet regime. Working on it was not easy. Kuznetsov recalled: \\"For a whole month in Kyiv I had nightmares, which wore me out so much that I had to leave without finishing my work and temporarily switch to other tasks in order to regain my senses.\\" In a letter to the Israeli journalist, writer, and translator Shlomo Even-Shoshan dated May 17, 1965, Kuznetsov commented on the Babi Yar tragedy: > Before September 29, 1941, Jews were slowly being murdered in camps behind a > veneer of legitimacy. Treblinka, Auschwitz, etc. came later. Since Babyn Yar > murder became commonplace. I trust you know how they did this. They > published an order for all the Jews in the city to gather in the vicinity of > the freight yard with their belongings and valuables. Then they surrounded > them and began shooting them.

A shortened version of the novel was republished in 1967 in Russian by \\"Moloda Gvardiya\\" publishing house in shortened form without the author's permission. After defection Soon after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Kuznetsov defected from the USSR to the United Kingdom. His pretext for travelling abroad was to do research for his new book on Lenin's stay in Britain.A Soviet Author Flight to the Free World TIME magazine. August 08, 1969. Subscribers only He managed to smuggle 35-mm photographic film containing the uncensored manuscript. Memorial sign to Anatoly Kuznetsov as the young hero of his Babi Yar novel. Kyiv, Kurenivka He arrived in London on a two-week visa, accompanied by Georgy Andjaparidze, a suspected KGB \\"mamka\\", a secret police agent. Kuznetsov managed to trick Andjaparidze by saying he wanted to find a prostitute and instead ran for the nearest British government office. There he was connected over the phone with David Floyd, a Russian- speaking journalist and the Daily Telegraph's Soviet expert. Risking being caught, Kuznetsov returned to the hotel to pick up his manuscripts, his favourite typewriter and Cuban cigars. Home Secretary James Callaghan and Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to grant Kuznetsov an unlimited residence visa in the UK. Shortly after the public announcement of the British decision, Soviet Ambassador Mikhail Smirnovsky demanded the author's return, but Callaghan refused. Two days later, Smirnovsky called on Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart and asked that Soviet diplomats be allowed to see Kuznetsov, but Kuznetsov refused to meet with his countrymen. Instead, he wrote a declaration of his reasons for leaving and three letters: one to the Soviet government, another to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and a third to the USSR Union of Writers. The Sunday Telegraph published David Floyd's interview with Kuznetsov, who spoke about his ties with the KGB, how he was recruited, and how he had formally agreed to cooperate in order to be allowed to leave abroad. Babi Yar was published in the USA in 1970 under pseudonym A. Anatoli. In that edition, the censored Soviet version was put in regular type, the content cut by censors in heavier type and newly added material was in brackets. In the foreword to the edition by the New York-based publishing house Posev, Kuznetsov wrote: > In the summer of 1969 I escaped from the USSR with photographic films, > including films containing the unabridged text of Babi Yar. I am publishing > it as my first book free of all political censorship, and I am asking you to > consider this edition of Babi Yar as the only authentic text. It contains > the text published originally, everything that was expurgated by the > censors, and what I wrote after the publication, including the final > stylistic polish. Finally, this is what I wrote. During Kuznetsov's emigr√© years, he worked for Radio Liberty, travelled a great deal, but did not write anything for ten years. Kuznetzov died in London in 1979 from his third heart attack. See also * List of Eastern Bloc defectors References Publications * A. Anatoli, Babi Yar: A Document in the Form of a Novel, Trans.

Campbell rose to prominence at age nineteen as a member of the Scottish indie pop band Belle & Sebastian, but left the group to pursue a solo career, first as The Gentle Waves, and later under her own name. She later collaborated with singer Mark Lanegan on three albums. Her latest studio album 'There Is No Other' was released via Cooking Vinyl on February 7th 2020. Campbell's music has been described as either indie pop, chamber pop or singer-songwriter. Regardless of genre, Campbell makes gentle and sombre music, often using classical instruments and her bright, slightly nasal voice with bittersweet and ironic songwriting. Biography =1996‚Äì2002: Belle & Sebastian= Belle & Sebastian was formed in 1996 by Stuart Murdoch and Stuart David; Campbell had met Murdoch at a New Year's Eve party at age nineteen, and then participated in a recording session with Murdoch and David sponsored by Stow College's Music Business Administration curriculum. They named themselves Belle & Sebastian after a children's book of the same name. Murdoch was the lead singer on the first two albums, with Campbell playing cello, percussion and singing backing vocals. A classically trained cellist, Campbell also played keyboards. She also took lead vocals on a few songs from the band, and co-wrote their top-20 UK single \\"Legal Man\\". Their follow-up was The Boy with the Arab Strap which contained the track \\"Is It Wicked Not to Care?\\" where for the first time Campbell sang lead vocals. The band's next album was Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant. The album introduced many stylistic changes, such as a larger string section and more of the members singing lead vocals; Campbell sings on \\"Family Tree\\", and performs a duet with Stevie Jackson on \\"Beyond the Sunrise\\". Most of 2002 was spent on touring and recording a soundtrack album, Storytelling (for Storytelling by Todd Solondz). Campbell left the band in spring of 2002, in the middle of their North American tour. =1998: Collaboration with Snow Patrol= On Snow Patrol‚Äôs 1998 debut album Songs For Polarbears, Campbell provides vocals on the song ‚ÄòNYC‚Äô. https://www.discogs.com/Snow-Patrol-Songs-For-Polarbears/release/610806 =2003‚Äì2006: Solo work= In 1999, Campbell released her first solo album, The Green Fields of Foreverland, on the same label as Belle & Sebastian, Jeepster Records, under the name The Gentle Waves. The follow-up to The Green Fields of Foreverland would become Swansong for You released on 6 November 2000. This album would be the last release by Campbell as The Gentle Waves. In 2002, she collaborated with Scottish jazz musician Bill Wells on Ghost of Yesterday, a collection of Billie Holiday songs released by Creeping Bent. In 2003 she released a new album Amorino under her own name. Bill Wells was featured here again, along with other jazz musicians. Her next album, 2006's Ballad of the Broken Seas, was a collaboration with former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan and was well received by critics. Her fourth studio album was released on 23 October 2006 entitled Milkwhite Sheets. It brings traditional songs from United Kingdom and songs written by Campbell. Campbell has stated that album was inspired by the works of Jean Ritchie, Anne Briggs and Shirley Collins. =2007‚Äì2013: Collaboration with Mark Lanegan= Campbell performing with Mark Lanegan in Barcelona, 2010 In April 2004, Campell released an EP with former Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age singer Mark Lanegan, titled Time Is Just the Same. They would later release a single entitled \\"Ramblin' Man\\" for their collaboration album Ballad of the Broken Seas. Campbell wrote and recorded the majority of the album's tracks in Glasgow, with Lanegan adding vocals in Los Angeles. The album was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize. Lanegan and Campbell played four UK concerts in January 2007, with the London date being moved to a larger venue as a result of high demand for tickets. In 2007, the duo recorded a second album together, entitled Sunday at Devil Dirt, which was released on 5 May 2008. Three singles from the album were released: \\"Who Built the Road\\"(7\\"), \\"Come On Over (Turn Me On)\\" (7\\") and \\"Keep me in mind sweetheart\\"(Cd, 12\\"). The five new tracks of the \\"Keep me in mind sweetheart\\" EP were later added as bonus tracks to Sunday at Devil Dirt. A third collaborative album with Lanegan was released on 16 August 2010 entitled Hawk. The pair toured to promote the album, including a set at All Tomorrow's Parties, 10‚Äì12 December 2010 (Bowlie 2) curated by Belle & Sebastian. In July 2013, it was announced that Campbell and Lanegan had officially ended their musical partnership. In February 2020, Isobel released her most recent solo studio album titled 'There Is No Other' which was named Rough Trade's album of the week, via new label Cooking Vinyl.

Intended as an ongoing series, the show only received one pilot episode and aired on WPIX channel 11 in New York City and 88 markets around the country, to good Nielsen ratings. Graffiti Rock resembled a hip hop version of the popular television dance shows at the time such as Soul Train and American Bandstand. The show was created and hosted by Michael Holman, who was the manager of the popular break-dancing crew, the New York City Breakers. The episode features Run-D.M.C., Shannon, The New York City Breakers DJ Jimmie Jazz, Kool Moe Dee and Special K of the Treacherous Three. The New York City Breakers, who were fresh off of their success from the movie Beat Street, made a showcase appearance. The episode also features television and film actress, Debi Mazar and actor/director Vincent Gallo (who identified as \\"Prince Vince\\") as dancers on the show. A segment of the show was sampled on The Beastie Boys' LP Ill Communication. \\"[...] alright, you're scratchin it right now, cut the record back and forth against the needle, back and forth, back and forth, makin' it scratch, but let me tell you something: don't try this at home with your dad's stereo, only under hip-hop supervision, alright?\\" The show has since become an important 'must-see' for hip-hop enthusiasts, alongside such titles as Wild Style and Beat Street. In the video for the Non Phixion and Arsonists song \\"14 Years Of Rap\\", a set very similar to the one on Graffiti Rock was used. In the beginning of the video the words \\"Graffiti Rock\\" can be seen and also heard in the sample. Graffiti Rock was parodied by Gnarls Barkley in the music video for their 2008 single \\"Run (I'm a Natural Disaster),\\" from the album The Odd Couple. Holman was inspired to use the title Graffiti Rock, by a live, hip hop event in the Lower East Side of New York City, created by Henry Chalfant years earlier, also called Graffiti Rock.

History The territory of the municipality was already settled very early. There are remains of a Bronze Age foundry. The first documentation dates from 1141 under the name of Charlens. Later forms of the name include Challeins, Escharlens (1177), Eschallens (1228), and Eschalleins (1279). The present form of the name first appears in 1315. The name comes from the personal name Charles. The site belonged originally to the Bishop of Lausanne. At the end of the 12th century, the Burgundian Lords of Montfaucon established the territory of √âchallens and built a castle there in the 13th century. In 1317, the rights of the house of Savoy were recognized. In 1350, √âchallens was encircled by a wall and received city rights in 1351. From then until the 16th century, a weekly market was held. In 1410, the government of √âchallens passed to the house of Chalon, which originated in Burgundy. For this reason, the Eidgenossen took over after the Burgundian Wars and put it under the administration of Fribourg and Bern in 1476. Because of the common administration of Catholic Fribourg and Protestant Bern, the Reformation did not gain ground in Echallen, and it remained Catholic.Catholiques et Protestants dans le pays de Vaud Olivier Blanc - 1986 p191 \\"Cossonay, √âchallens, Oron et Lavaux sont notamment dans ce cas.

It lasted for about two hundred years until it was absorbed into the Shangqing and Zhengyi currents during the Tang Dynasty. The Lingbao School is a synthesis of religious ideas based on Shangqing texts, the rituals of the Celestial Masters, and Buddhist practices. The Lingbao School borrowed many concepts from Buddhism, including the concept of reincarnation, and also some cosmological elements. Although reincarnation was an important concept in the Lingbao School, the earlier Daoist belief in attaining immortality remained. The school's pantheon is similar to Shangqing and Celestial Master Daoism, with one of its most important gods being the deified form of Laozi. Other gods also existed, some of whom were in charge of preparing spirits for reincarnation. Lingbao ritual was initially in individual practice, but later went through a transformation that put more emphasis on collective rites. The most important scripture in the Lingbao School is known as the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was compiled by Ge Chaofu and based on Ge Hong's earlier alchemical works. Although Lingbao no longer exists as a distinct movement, it has left influences on all subsequent branches of Taoism. The \\"yinyang masters\\" popular in contemporary northern China are defined as Zhengyi Taoist priests following the Lingbao scriptural tradition.Jones (2005), 5. History The Lingbao School began in around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were revealed to Ge Chaofu, the grandnephew of Ge Hong. Ge Chaofu claimed that the scriptures came to him in a line of transmission going back to Ge Hong's great-uncle, Ge Xuan (164-244).Bokenkamp (1997), 374. Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity.Bokenkamp (1997), 377. In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled a catalogue of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and standardizing Lingbao ritual. This organization of texts and ritual provided a solid foundation on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries.Yamada (2000), 232. During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.Fowler (2005), 151. Beliefs Some early Lingbao scriptures borrowed so many Buddhist terminological, stylistic and conceptual elements that Z√ºrcher describes them as \\"Buddho-Taoist hybrids\\".Z√ºrcher (1980), 85. =Rebirth= talisman from the Lingbao scriptures Many Lingbao beliefs are borrowed from Buddhism. The names of the many different deities and heavens were often given titles based on phonetic transcriptions of Sanskrit.Z√ºrcher (1980), 109. Many Sanskrit terms were borrowed phonetically, but given completely different meanings. One significant concept borrowed from Buddhism was that of reincarnation.Robinet (1997), 153. Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School share the idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a celestial being.Bokenkamp (1989), 7. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south.Bokenkamp (1989), 11. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace.Bokenkamp (1989), 15. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.Bokenkamp (1989), 16. =Cosmology= Lingbao cosmology also borrows heavily from Buddhism. Unlike previous Daoist cosmological systems which were divided into four to nine regions, Lingbao cosmology supposed that there were ten regions, an idea borrowed from Buddhism. In addition to the cosmological regions, there were 32 heavens divided into four sectors, each with eight heavens that were placed horizontally on the periphery of the celestial disc. Each of the four sectors was ruled by an emperor and populated by denizens of an earlier cosmic age (kalpa). Like Buddhism, the heavens were divided into the \\"three worlds\\" of desire, form, and formlessness.Robinet (1997), 158-159. Lingbao cosmology deviated from Buddhist beliefs by proposing that the heavens rotated around a huge mountain known as the Jade Capital, which was the residence of the Celestial Worthy, the Daoist version of the Buddha, and the primordial deity.Bokenkamp (2008), 666.Bokenkamp (1997), 375. Certain traditional Daoist ideas were retained in Lingbao cosmology, such as the idea that the world originated from a type of primordial qi known as yuanqi, and then was divided into heaven and earth. Furthermore, the yuanqi is subdivided into three types of qi that correspond to three deities: the lords of the Celestial Treasure, of the Sacred Treasure and of the Divine Treasure. These three deities later introduced the teachings of the Dongzhen (Perfect Grotto), the Dongxuan (Mysterious Grotto), and of the Dongshen (Divine Grotto). These three teachings form the basis for the later classification of texts in the Daozang.Robinet (1997), 159. Apocalyptic notions that appeared in Shangqing Daoism were first developed fully by the Lingbao School. Lingbao cosmology supposed that time was divided into cosmic cycles, which correlated with the Five Phases. At the end of a cosmic era, the god of the colour associated with that era would descend onto earth and reveal a teaching that would save a fixed number of people from death. There were two types of cosmic eras, short ones that were characterized by an excess of yin energy, and long ones that were characterized by an excess of yang energy. At the end of a short cosmic era, the moon was prophesied to produce a flood that would erode the mountains, renew the qi of the universe, and change the rankings of the members of the celestial bureaucracy. At the end of a long cosmic era, evil creatures were unleashed, heaven and earth were turned upside down, and metals and stones melted together. The people who followed the correct teaching revealed by the god of the colour would be gathered up by the Queen Mother of the West and transported to a \\"land of bliss\\" that would not be affected by the apocalypse.Robinet (1997), 161. =Pantheon= In addition to borrowing deities from the Celestial Masters and the Shangqing School, the Lingbao School also developed its own gods. The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists is known as the Yuanshi Tianzun or the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified Laozi in the Celestial Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of kalpa cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging at the beginning of the Kaihuang period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of Laozi, who was the Celestial Worthy's chief disciple.Bokenkamp (1997), 381. Below these two main gods in the celestial hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath him was the Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled Fengdu, the city of the dead.Bokenkamp (1997), 382. Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the Dragon Kings, and the Demon Kings.Robinet (1997), 158. Deities were present not only in the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were responsible for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.Bokenkamp (1997), 384-385. Practices =Immortality techniques= Despite a belief in reincarnation, the Lingbao School maintained the traditional Daoist idea that certain techniques could allow an adherent to achieve immortality. One technique was to ingest the essence of the sun and the moon. Practitioners would expose themselves to the celestial bodies at certain times of the month. Closing their eyes, they would visualize that the essences would solidify and enter their bodies. Once in the body, the sun's essence was matched to the heart and visualized as red, while the moon's was matched with the kidneys and seen as black. Besides interior meditation practices, immortality could be achieved through the ingestion of potions or talismans.Yamada (2000), 248. =Rituals= Early Lingbao ritual was mostly done on an individual basis, either in a meditation chamber, or the courtyard of a house. Early practitioners were not professional priests, but rather 'students of the Dao'. Later on, as the Lingbao movement developed religious institutions and an established clergy, ritual practice became more of a communal rite.Bokenkamp (1997), 389. Lingbao ritual shares a great deal with ritual in other Daoist traditions. Like other traditions, Lingbao rituals had a theatrical quality that involved accompanying music, dances, and chants. Lingbao Daoism also shared the multidimensional aspect of Daoist ritual, meaning that it was carried on at several different levels simultaneously. For example, while a ritual was being performed, the priest would repeat the ritual within himself through interior meditation.Robinet (1997), 167. There are three categories of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first is known as the heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.Robinet (1997), 167-168. Canon A page from the Baopuzi, on which the Lingbao scriptures are based Lingbao scriptures arose as a direct result of the success of earlier Shangqing texts. Lingbao scriptures are all based on a text known as the Text of the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was compiled by Ge Chaofu between 397 and 402 and borrowed from the work of Ge Hong, his great uncle. Being the most ancient Lingbao text, the Five Talismans provided the framework of the remainder of the Lingbao canon, which was based on the five directions. Because all Lingbao texts descended from the Five Talismans, it was believed that they had been revealed to Ge Xuan, presumably the original owner of the Five Talismans. Ge Xuan is purported to have transmitted the Lingbao texts first to his disciple Zheng Siyuan, who then transmitted it to Ge's grandnephew Ge Hong (284-364), who is well known for his alchemical innovations. The claim that the Lingbao texts derive from Ge Xuan, however, was likely a way of legitimizing them through the exaggeration of their antiquity. In reality, they were likely assembled by Ge Chaofu himself. Within a few years of the texts' dissemination, they had become extremely popular.Robinet (1997), 150. The canon itself is a mix of previous Daoist traditions, combining features from the Shangqing School and the Celestial Masters, along with other ancient texts and even some Buddhist ideas. The two most important texts of the canon besides the Wufujing are the Red Book of Five Writings (Chi shu wupian) and the Scripture of Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation (Wuliang Duren Shangpin).Robinet (1997), 151. According to Lu Xiujing, who edited the Lingbao Canon, there were a total of 34 texts in the canon, of which three have been lost. Legacy While the Lingbao school did not survive as a distinct entity, its ritual apparatus did, and it forms the basis for present-day Daoist ritual practice. In addition, many of the innovations introduced by the Lingbao School have survived to the present, including its division of the Daozang into three sections corresponding to different teachings, with the Dongzhen corresponding to the Shangqing School, the Dongxuan to the Lingbao School, and the Dongshen to the Sanhuang teaching.Bokenkamp (2001), 181-182. The integration of Buddhism within Lingbao practices and beliefs ensured that Buddhist elements would remain an important aspect of later Daoism, and also aided in integrating Buddhism into all levels of society in China.Bokenkamp (2008), 663-664.

It is comparable to wildfowling, the practice of catching birds for food or sport. The term is perhaps better known in the Fens of eastern England than elsewhere, but was certainly not confined to the Fens. The land margins of the north produced down feathers from eider duck for eiderdowns and quilted jackets without necessarily killing the birds. In the Western Isles of Scotland, seabirds were taken from their nests on cliffs. In The Fens and other similar places, a decoy was part of a landowner's well- equipped estate. The epitome of fowling was, however, the punt gunner. He had what amounted to a long, small-bore muzzle-loaded cannon. It was mounted along the centre-line of the forward half of a specially designed boat which slightly resembled a heavy wooden kayak in form. The fowler lay in the after half with paddle blades strapped to his forearms. The skill was to stalk a raft of duck until within the rather short range required and to fire the gun from which small shot scattered. It remained to gather up the harvest and get it to market. In the winter, the punt gun might be mounted on a sled and the procedure repeated on the same principles. References =Notes= =Bibliography= Sly, R.

He was a millionaire and a collector of vintage steam locomotives and rail cars. He founded Steamtown, USA, which was operated by the non-profit corporation Steamtown Foundation.Adair, James R. \\"The Man From Steamtown: The Story of F. Nelson Blount\\" (1967, Moody Press). Steamtown was a train museum that ran steam locomotive excursions out of Bellows Falls, Vermont from the 1960s to 1984. Air quality regulations in Vermont forced the collection to be relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania in the mid-1980s. The Steamtown Foundation declared bankruptcy in the mid-1980s and was acquired by the National Park Service. Some of Blount's collection is still on display at what is now Steamtown National Historic Site. Blount died at the age of 49 on August 31, 1967 in a small aircraft accident.  Biography  Blount's family had been involved in the shellfish industry since the 1880s. The 1938 hurricane devastated the oyster business in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, so Blount helped introduce the bay quahog (a hard-shell clam) as a source of protein during the Second World War. In 1946, he consolidated several smaller shellfish firms to found Blount Seafood Corporation, which provided chopped clams to soup manufacturers throughout the United States, including Campbell Soup. His family still owns and controls the company.  Railroads  Blount used some of the money that he made in the seafood industry to purchase the narrow gauge Edaville Railroad in South Carver, Massachusetts in the mid-1950s. The Edaville Railroad had narrow gauge engines from Maine, but Blount soon began acquiring standard gauge steam locomotives and cars, in part to save a vanishing technological heritage. Some locomotives were initially displayed at Engine City, a part of Pleasure Island amusement park near Wakefield, Massachusetts. Space constraints soon forced Blount to look for a new home for his collection, and he purchased an engine house and railroad yard in 1959 from the Boston and Maine Railroad in North Walpole, New Hampshire, with equipment arriving there in late 1960. Blount called his collection and museum Steamtown, and the first train ran in 1961. Problems with leasing railroad track and federal regulators led to Steamtown trains running out of Keene, New Hampshire in 1962. Promised support for Steamtown from the state of New Hampshire never materialized, leading to yet another move back to North Walpole in 1963. This was the first year that the collection was open to the public (as opposed to just train rides), and soon the North Walpole site was seen to be too small for the many visitors who came. In 1964, Steamtown began the move to Bellows Falls, Vermont to a site recently abandoned by the Rutland Railroad. Work was more or less complete there by 1966, but the next summer Blount died in an aircraft crash. Without his funds, Steamtown fell on hard times, and the harsh winters helped speed deterioration of much of the collection. It moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania in 1984 but did not do well there, either. In 1986, the federal government stepped in and established the Steamtown National Historic Site, which officially opened in 1995.  Religion  In the 1960s, Blount became a devoted evangelical Christian. A biography entitled The Man from Steamtown was written by James R. Adair in 1967 which focuses heavily on his spiritual life.Adair, James R. \\"The Man From Steamtown: The Story of F. Nelson Blount\\" (1967, Moody Press). Blount sought to preserve an evangelical Christian legacy by donating his Dublin, New Hampshire homestead and its surrounding farm buildings, pastures, and forest to a group of committed Christian educators in 1964, headed by Mel Moody, who worked together to develop Staghead Farm (as it was then called) into Dublin Christian Academy, a combined elementary school and secondary boarding school.

She is the namesake of Royal Caribbean's Freedom class, and can accommodate 3,634 passengers and 1,300 crew on fifteen passenger decks. The vessel also has 4 crew decks below the waterline. Freedom of the Seas was the largest passenger ship ever built (by gross tonnage) from 2006 until construction of her sister ship, Liberty of the Seas in 2007. Construction Freedom of the Seas under construction at Turku Shipyard in Turku, Finland on February 23, 2006 Freedom of the Seas was built at the Aker Yards Turku Shipyard, Finland, which built the ships of the Voyager class as well as the other ships of the Freedom class. Upon her completion in 2006, she became the largest passenger ship ever built, taking that honor from , an ocean liner. Freedom of the Seas is narrower than QM2 at the waterline, shorter, has less draft, is less tall and slower. Freedom however is the larger ship in terms of gross tonnage.

The ship has four bow thrusters. When at sea Freedom of the Seas consumes approximately 12,800 kg (28,000 pounds) of fuel per hour. Incidents =Fire= On July 22, 2015, a fire started in a mechanical area of the ship around 9:15 AM when the ship was en route from Cape Canaveral, Florida to Falmouth, Jamaica. All passengers were sent to their muster stations, and one crew member sustained first degree burns. The fire was extinguished after an hour and a half, and the ship was able to continue on its planned itinerary. =Death of Chloe Wiegand= On July 7, 2019, 18-month-old Chloe Wiegand died after falling through an open window on the 11th deck while the ship was docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her 51-year- old grandfather, Salvatore Anello, had placed her on a railing and lost his grip while holding her. Anello claimed that he was colorblind and didn't notice that the window was open, but the cruise line released security camera footage that they claim shows Anello leaning out the window shortly before lifting the toddler up to it. On December 11, 2019, Chloe's parents sued Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. over the death of their daughter, alleging that the company was negligent for not properly securing the windows. Anello pled guilty to a charge of negligent homicide on February 25, and will be placed on probation. Facilities The ship has an interior promenade long called the \\"Royal Promenade\\". The ship has three swimming areas: an interactive water park, a dedicated adult pool, and the main pool. The 13th deck has a sports area with a rock climbing wall, the FlowRider surf simulator, a miniature golf course and a full size basketball court. Other items include an ice skating rink, a casino and a three-deck-high broadway-style theater. Many of the ship's interiors were extensively decorated by muralist Clarissa Parish.www.clarissaparish.com Retrieved January 2012 Service history The ship docked at Blohm und Voss in Hamburg, Germany on 17 April 2006 to repair a damaged bearing in one of the three Azipod propulsion units and some minor modifications prior to her official handover to Royal Caribbean International on 24 April 2006. She then visited Oslo, Norway before sailing for Southampton, England. The ship sailed on its first transatlantic crossing on 3 May 2006. Freedom of the Seas arrived in New York Harbor USA for her official naming ceremony on 12 May 2006 which was broadcast live on NBC's The Today Show from Cape Liberty Cruise Port in Bayonne, New Jersey (the ship's official New York berth), and thereafter traveled to Boston for the weekend of May 19‚Äì22.

On 4 May 2009, Freedom of the Seas moved her home port from the Port of Miami-Dade to Port Canaveral. The ship underwent her first dry dock refurbishment in late March 2011. In January 2015, the ship underwent another 24-day dry dock. During the dry dock some new interior passenger cabins were added. In winter 2016, Freedom of the Seas repositioned to Port Everglades, from where she undertook cruises in the Caribbean. After homeporting in Barcelona in the spring and summer of 2017, Freedom of the Seas returned to Port Everglades.

She first appeared in 1996 on Superman: The Animated Series as the personal assistant and bodyguard of Lex Luthor. She has since crossed over into comic books published by DC Comics. The character was portrayed by Tao Okamoto in the 2016 DC Extended Universe film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. She was played by Rhona Mitra in the fourth season of the television series Supergirl. Mercy Graves also appeared in the second season of the DC Universe series Titans, played by Natalie Gumede. DC animated universe Mercy Graves from Superman: The Animated Series =Superman: The Animated Series= Mercy Graves was created for Superman: The Animated Series (voiced by Lisa Edelstein) as a tough young woman with a checkered past. Mercy serves as Lex Luthor's personal bodyguard and chauffeur. Originally the leader of a gang of female thieves, Mercy once daringly swiped Luthor's briefcase from under the billionaire's nose. She did not get far before Luthor's men hunted her down. However, rather than take revenge, Luthor, impressed by her mixture of ruthlessness and street savvy, offered her a job. He took her in, cleaned her up, and made her his right-hand woman. Trained in unarmed combat, she was entrusted with his personal security and also to carry out his dirty work. Her demeanor reveals a sardonic wit and her habitual dress is a chauffeur's uniform with a very short skirt, a chauffeur's cap, nylons, and short, high heeled boots. Mercy is loyal and respectful to Luthor, and she claims to be \\"the only one in Luthor's entire company who can get away with calling him Lex\\". In the episode \\"Brave New Metropolis\\" Lois Lane travels to an alternate reality of Metropolis. Mercy Graves is the commander of Lex Luthor's law- enforcement group. She and her soldiers raid the hideout of the revolutionaries led by Jimmy Olsen where they arrest the revolutionaries, confiscate the stolen Kryptonite, send the adults to prison, and send any children of the revolutionaries to the LexCorp Orphanage. When she hears Jimmy call out to Lois, Mercy had her brought before Lex Luthor after the DNA tests prove that she is Lois Lane. Lex Luthor decided that in order to keep Superman at bay, it would be best to dispose of Lois. He sent Mercy to kill her in the city. On their way, they came across Angela Chen, who managed to distract the commander. Lois stole Mercy's gun and before she could react, Angela had bitten her leg. Lois made her getaway. Lois and the alternate Superman met where he learned what Lex Luthor has been doing behind his back. In the LexCorp building, Mercy was present when Lois and Superman confronted Luthor. Mercy fought Lois, but ultimately lost when Lois planted a jaw-breaking left hook. Rebels stormed into the room and poured onto the hated Mercy while Superman pursued Lex Luthor. In the episode \\"Ghost in the Machine,\\" Mercy teams up with Superman to find a missing Lex Luthor. Superman tries to convince Mercy that Luthor does not actually care for her; Mercy tries to prove him wrong. However, after a battle with Brainiac, Mercy is pinned under a pile of fallen machinery while the room caves in. Although Luthor could have saved her, he flees instead causing Superman to save her. During the \\"World's Finest\\" crossover arc, Mercy develops an intense rivalry with Harley Quinn, the Joker's henchwoman and on again/off again girlfriend. During the arc's climactic episode, Harley duct tapes Mercy's mouth shut and ties her to a killer android that attacks Batman and Superman. She is saved by the two, and is later seen watching television and laughing to herself as Harley is publicly arrested. =Justice League= Mercy Graves later reappears in the Justice League episode \\"Tabula Rasa\\". The nature of her relationship with Luthor becomes more clear. Mercy has agreed to take over LexCorp while Luthor is in prison and is hesitant to return it to him because she feels their former relationship was not an equal one. She also states that while she was the CEO of LexCorp, she brought the stock up 38% and removed certain departments in the science division finding them useless or in order to save money. Lex Luthor exacerbates the situation by verbally and physically abusing her. It is repeatedly implied that their relationship was not solely platonic. Mercy grudgingly assists Luthor's escape from the Justice League. However, his deceitful manipulation of another devoted servant causes Mercy to see their years together in a different light. After his capture, Mercy hangs up on Lex Luthor during his single phone call when he requests help in obtaining a lawyer and doctors to treat his Kryptonite-caused cancer. =Justice League Unlimited= Mercy Graves reappears in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Clash\\". She was seen at Lex Luthor's side again.  Comics  Mercy Graves first appeared in Detective Comics #735 (August 1999), during the \\"No Man's Land\\" storyline in the Batman titles. This version of Mercy has blonde hair and does not wear a chauffeur's uniform. She is sometimes seen wearing a suit and tie. She is later joined by another female bodyguard in Luthor's employ, Hope. It is suggested that the two may be Amazons, as they have exchanged blows with Superman. This possibility is referenced in the President Luthor: Secret Files and Origins comic when the sorceress Circe appears at the White House demanding to meet with Lex. Hope and Mercy inform Circe that they can always recognize her, no matter what disguise or form she might take, suggesting some previous familiarity. After temporarily changing them into birds Circe tells Lex that he will need to hire new Amazon bodyguards. Although Hope's time as a LexCorp employee has passed, Mercy can be seen with the fugitive Lex Luthor after he is driven from the Presidency. Despite her loyalty to Luthor, she has still shown some humanity even while in his employ; when Superman was searching for Lois Lane after she was abducted and impersonated by the Parasite, Mercy saw him during his search, and, in that moment, saw him not as an alien, but as a man who had lost everything. A Mercy-Harley Quinn fight is featured in Action Comics #765 (May 2000). In the series 52, Mercy is seen alongside Luthor at the unveiling of his \\"Be Your Own Hero\\" program, and is injured when she fires several gunshots at Steel, which he deflects and sends back at her, hitting her in the right hand. She is later shown in Luthor's employ in 52 Week 40. Mercy has appeared in the Infinity, Inc. series, apparently wanting to atone for her past deeds. In #8, she takes on the moniker \\"Vanilla\\" and wears a costume equipped with a special mask that will keep her identity hidden from the likes of Superman and Lex Luthor. In #10, she almost beats a man to death. She leaves the team soon after, accepting the fact that she is not \\"hero\\" material. Mercy's Amazon heritage is confirmed in Justice League: Cry for Justice, when the supervillain Prometheus nearly kills Supergirl with god-forged bullets he claimed he bought from Mercy.Justice League: Cry for Justice #1-7 (Sept. 2009 ‚Äì April 2010) In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Mercy Graves is reintroduced as an Asian American. She works as Lex Luthor's personal assistant and manages LexCorp during his absence.Justice League #31 (June 2014)  In other media  = Television =  Animated  * In The Batman episode \\"The Batman/Superman Story, Part One\\", Mercy Graves (voiced by Gwendoline Yeo) appears again as Lex Luthor's right hand, only this time she appears to be of Eurasian descent, gunslinging skills, and possessing a pair of twin laser guns. * Mercy Graves appears in Young Justice. She appears as Lex Luthor's main bodyguard and is depicted as a woman with a cybernetic right arm concealing powerful weapons, but does not speak. In the episode \\"Targets\\", when assassins Cheshire and Sportsmaster attempt to kill him and two Asian diplomats, Mercy uses her mechanical arm that contains projectile weapons to stop them. The diplomats, grateful and impressed by the weaponry within Mercy, make a deal with Luthor. She returns in \\"Usual Suspects,\\" where she acts as Luthor's bodyguard during the battle at Santa Prisca. She blasts Aqualad when he attempts to arrest Luthor, and the two escape by helicopter. She reappears alongside Luthor in \\"Satisfaction\\", helping him escape a vengeful Roy Harper who bombs his office before they find Harper inside a parking garage blowing up Luthor's car. Mercy and Roy engage in a duel across the garage, with Roy using various weapons (like a crossbow and bombs) and techniques to avoid or knock out Mercy, most of which fail him. He eventually succeeds in blowing off her cybernetic arm and knocking her into a car windshield. Later, Roy shows Green Arrow and his Cadmus clone Red Arrow a cybernetic arm more powerful than Mercy's, and declares Speedy \\"dead\\", preferring the sound of \\"Arsenal\\". * Mercy Graves appears in the Harley Quinn episode \\"Bachelorette\\".  Live-action  * A character loosely based on Mercy Graves appears in Smallville as Tess Mercer, who is a composite of Mercy, Eve Teschmacher and Lena Luthor, portrayed by Cassidy Freeman. Tess was nicknamed \\"Mercy\\" by Oliver Queen. * Mercy Graves appears in The CW series Supergirl, portrayed by Rhona Mitra. This version is a former Project Cadmus agent alongside her brother Otis Graves. Similar to her Superman: The Animated Series counterpart, Mercy was also head of security for what was then known as Luthor-Corp under Lex Luthor's reign. In the episode \\"Fallout,\\" Mercy and Otis are apprehended by the DEO following Mercy's fight with Lena Luthor at L-Corp. They persuade a DEO agent named Jensen to release them as they use Lena Luthor's lead-dispersion device to spread Kryptonite into the air which weakened Supergirl. In the episode \\"Ahimsa,\\" Agent Jensen assists Mercy Graves and Otis into furthering their anti-alien goals by releasing a Hellgrammite and an unnamed Kopy from the DEO custody where they cause havoc at a carnival. After the Kryptonite in the air is gone and the Kopy is defeated, Mercy and Otis are killed by the Hellgrammite who surrendered to the DEO, though Otis is resurrected. * Natalie Gumede portrays Mercy Graves in the second season of Titans. She is described as ‚Äúthe ruthless, cunning, right hand and bodyguard to the notorious Lex Luthor ‚Äì serving her boss with unquestioned loyalty.

Early years Neil Ardley was born in Wallington, Surrey. He attended Wallington County Grammar School and at the age of thirteen started to learn the piano and later the saxophone. He read Chemistry at Bristol University, where he also played both piano and saxophone in jazz groups, and from which he graduated in 1959 with a BSc. Career =Music= Ardley moved to London and studied arranging and composing with Ray Premru and Bill Russo from 1960 to 1961. He joined the John Williams Big Band as pianist, writing both arrangements and new compositions, and from 1964 to 1970 was the director of the newly formed New Jazz Orchestra, which employed some of the best young musicians in London, including Ian Carr, Jon Hiseman, Barbara Thompson, Dave Gelly, Mike Gibbs, Don Rendell, and Trevor Tomkins. In the late 1960s, encouraged by record producer and impresario Denis Preston, Ardley began composing in earnest, combining classical and jazz methods. His rich orchestrations were augmented in the 1970s by the addition of synthesisers. His contemporary jazz album Kaleidoscope Of Rainbows was number 22 in the New Musical Express top 24 albums of 1976. However, as he began work on an all-electronic album in 1980, Ardley's recording contract was suddenly terminated, and he fell back on his writing and publishing career. He continued to play and compose, especially with Zyklus, the electronic jazz group he formed with composer (and former student) John L. Walters, Derbyshire musician Warren Greveson and Ian Carr. Singing in local choirs in the later 1990s led Ardley to start composing choral music, and this occupied most of his musical attention until his death. At the time of his death, Ardley had begun to gig and record again with a slimmed down Zyklus consisting of himself, Warren Greaveson, and Nick Robinson. =Writing= Ardley joined the editorial staff of the World Book Encyclopedia in 1962, when the London branch of the American publisher was producing an international edition. This took four years, during which time he developed the skill of editing and writing introductory material for the young. After a brief period working for Hamlyn, he became a freelance editor in 1968 (which enabled him to continue with his musical career). In the 1970s, he moved into writing introductory books, mostly for children, on natural history (especially birds), science and technology, and music, such as What Is It?. Just as his composing and performance had been moved forward by the introduction and development of technology, so too with his publishing career, as computers began to become more and more important. In 1984 Ardley began to write mainly for Dorling Kindersley, producing a series of books which included the best-selling (over three million copies worldwide) and award- winning The Way Things Work, illustrated by David Macaulay. When he retired in 2000 Ardley had written 101 books, with total sales of about ten million. Personal life In 1960, Ardley married Bridget Gantley, and the couple had one daughter. In 2003 he married Vivian Wilson. He died in Milford, Derbyshire.

It's served as dessert or as a light lunch. Kaiserschmarrn is a popular meal or dessert in Austria, Bavaria, and many parts of the former Austro-Hungarian empire, e.g. Hungary, Slovenia, and northern Croatia, which usually use the name as a loan word or translations of it. In Slovenia, it is called \\"cesarski pra≈æenec\\" or \\"≈°morn\\". Its Hungarian name is \\"cs√°sz√°rmorzsa\\";June Meyers Authentic Hungarian Heirloom Recipes Cookbook its Czech name is \\"(C√≠sa≈ôsk√Ω) trhanec\\" or \\"kajzr≈°morn\\".  Etymology  The name Kaiserschmarren is a compound of the words Kaiser (emperor) and Schmarren (a scrambled or shredded dish). Schmarren is also a colloquialism used in Austrian and Bavarian to mean trifle, mishmash, mess, rubbish, or nonsense. The word \\"Schmarren\\" is related to scharren (to scrape) and schmieren (to smear [see schmear]).  Description  Kaiserschmarrn, original size bits Kaiserschmarrn with lingonberry sauce Kaiserschmarren is a light, caramelized pancake made from a sweet batter using flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and milk, baked in butter. Kaiserschmarren can be prepared in different ways. When making Kaiserschmarren the egg whites are usually separated from the yolk and beaten until stiff; then the flour and the yolks are mixed with sugar, and the other ingredients are added, including: nuts, cherries, plums, apple jam, or small pieces of apple, or caramelized raisins and slivered almonds. The last mentioned ingredients (nuts, cherries, plums, apple jam, or small pieces of apple, or caramelized raisins and chopped almonds) aren't in the original recipe and just additions made by some cooks based on their personal preferences. In the original recipe there are only raisins (which, before cooking, are soaked in rum). The pancake is split with two forks into pieces while frying and usually sprinkled with powdered sugar, then served hot with apple or plum sauce or various fruit compotes, including plum, lingonberry, strawberry, or apple. Kaiserschmarren is eaten like a dessert, or it can also be eaten for lunch at tourist places like mountainside restaurants and taverns in the Austrian Alps, as a quite filling meal. Traditionally, Kaiserschmarren is accompanied with Zwetschgenr√∂ster, a fruit compote made out of plums.  Varieties  Like the closely related dish Sterz the Schmarrn derived from the simple but hearty cuisine of the alpine regions, there are different versions like Erd√§pfelschmarrn (with potatoes), √Ñpfelschmarrn (with apples) or Kirschschmarren (with cherries), usually prepared on an open fireplace of a so-called Rauchkuchl. The Kaiserschmarrn is simply a more refined and richer version of this former staple food, which sometimes consisted of only flour and lard.  History  Franz Joseph I. of Austria-Hungary It is generally agreed that the dish was first prepared for the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I (1830‚Äì1916). There are several stories. One apocryphal story involves the Emperor and his wife, Elisabeth of Bavaria, of the House of Wittelsbach. Obsessed with maintaining a minimal waistline, the Empress Elisabeth directed the royal chef to prepare only light desserts for her, much to the consternation and annoyance of her notoriously austere husband. Upon being presented with the chef's confection, she found it too rich and refused to eat it. The exasperated Francis Joseph quipped, ‚ÄúNow let me see what 'Schmarren' our chef has cooked up.‚Äù It apparently met his approval as he finished his and even his wife's serving.Meehan, Monica; von Baich, Maria: Tante Hertha's Viennese Kitchen; New Holland Publishers (UK) Ltd.; London, Cape Town, Sydney, Auckland; 2011; page 148 (Kaiserschmarren) Another story is that Francis Joseph and his wife were traveling the Alps and stopped by a farmer's home for lunch. The farmer was so nervous that he threw all the fanciest ingredients he had into a pan to make a delicious pancake; worse yet, due to his nervousness and shaky hands he scrambled the pancake. Hoping to cover up the mess he then covered it with plum jam. Luckily, the Kaiser thought it was scrumptious. Another popular tale is that his wife was a poor cook and couldn't flip a pancake efficiently. She decided to play to her strengths and shred the pancakes altogether and would serve them up to the Kaiser on a regular basis with jam. He liked them with jam. It was his favourite dessert.

Some Cubans trace Jewish ancestry to Marranos (forced converts to Christianity) who came as colonists, though few of these practice Judaism today. More than 24,000 Jews lived in Cuba in 1924, and more immigrated to the country in the 1930s. But during and after the 1959 communist revolution, 94% of the Jews left for the United States and other countries. In 2007 an estimated 1,500 known Jewish Cubans remained in the country, overwhelmingly located in Havana, occasionally called Jubans as a portmanteau of the English word \\"Jew\\" and Cuban. Several hundred have since emigrated to Israel. History Grave of a Jewish girl at the Jewish Cemetery of Havana Cuban Jewish history possibly begins in 1492 with the arrival of the second expedition of Christopher Columbus to the Americas. Columbus was accompanied on that voyage by interpreter Luis de Torres, who may have been a Jewish converso. Some Jews fleeing Portuguese-ruled Brazil in the 17th century settled in Cuba and despite inquisitions and persecutions, Jewish merchants based in Cuba engaged in flourishing international trade in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, the contemporary Jewish community does not represent a line of continuity with Jews who settled in Cuba in the 17th and 18th centuries. It began to form after Cuba gained independence from Spain following the Spanish-American War of 1898. At the end of the 19th century, American Jewish businessmen and war veterans began to settle on the island. They engaged in import and export as well as sugar and tobacco farming. In 1904, they founded Union Hebrew Congregation and in 1906 a Jewish cemetery was established. In the early 20th century, Sephardi Jewish immigrants from the Ottoman Empire began to arrive and in 1914, they established their own community organization, Union Hebrea Shevet Achim. Most of the Sephardi immigrants arrived poor and turned to peddling or managed to build small businesses. In 1920, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe began arriving. By 1924 there were 24,000 Jews in Cuba, with many working in its garment industry. For most Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, Cuba was merely a transit point on their way to the United States. Most of those who arrived between 1920 and 1923 had left by 1925. However, the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which severely curtailed Jewish immigration to the United States, left thousands of Jewish immigrants now unable to proceed to the United States, and as a result they settled permanently in Cuba. Throughout the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, thousands of Jewish immigrants continued to enter Cuba from Europe, largely as a result of Nazi and fascist persecution (see also MS St. Louis). The Jewish immigrants from Europe came during an economic downtown and found it difficult to integrate into a country lacking industry and inundated with cheap labor from Haiti and many turned to peddling to make ends meet. Jewish refugees from Antwerp introduced the diamond polishing industry to Cuba during World War II, establishing 24 plants in one year. With the growth of the Jewish community, various Jewish communal organizations emerged. The main communal body of the Eastern European Jewish immigrants was the Centro Israelita, and during the 1920s it came to offer a range of activities and services from welfare assistance, a clinic, a library, a language school, a student center, and a drama club. The Cuban Jewish community split into three sectors: Americans, Sephardim, and Ashkenazim, each with its own cemetery and communal activities. The Jews' economic situation gradually improved and by 1959 the Jewish working class had nearly disappeared. In 1959 before the Revolution, an estimated 15,000 Jews lived in Havana, where they had five synagogues. More Jewish Cubans lived outside the capital. Many Jews were sympathetic to the Cuban Revolution of 1959 under Fidel Castro. The Communist government did not adopt antisemitic attitudes and for the first time in Cuban history, a Jew, Enrique Oltuski, was appointed a minister. However, the new government's economic policies ruined the economic stability of the majority of Cuban Jews. As part of the middle class, some Jews were made to serve in forced labor camps in the 1960s, but they were not targeted as an ethnic group by Castro's government. In the aftermath of the revolution, nearly 95% of the Jewish population left Cuba for the United States, many settling in Miami. Additionally, between the years 1948 and 1997, 661 Cuban Jews immigrated to Israel. In 1967 the number of Jews living in Cuba had shrunk to about 1,500. In 1999 about 400 Cuban Jews immigrated to Israel. Several Jews played prominent roles in the revolution under Castro including Fabio Grobart, Manuel (Stolik) Novigrod, and Enrique Oltuski. Since the late 20th century, a large Jewish Cuban-American community has developed in South Florida. Modern Cuba has some new communities of Middle Eastern descent, including Jewish and Lebanese populations. The Cuban Coordinating Commission, the official governmental unit for the Jewish Community, recognized 1,201 people as Jewish in 2001 for the purpose of distributing Passover food. In February 2007 The New York Times estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Cuba, most of them (about 1,100) living in Havana. Cuba has one kosher butcher shop on the entire island. For a time it had no rabbi, but by 2007, one was based in a Havana synagogue. He often encourages visiting Jewish peoples to give tzedakah (charity) for the Jewish Cubans and for Israel. Alan Gross traveled to Cuba to help the small Jewish community, but he was detained in Cuba from 2009 to 2014. Some Jewish Americans originally from Cuba are also fierce critics of the Cuban regime, such as Representative Ileana Ros- Lehtinen. Israel also continues to have an embargo against Cuba. Adath Israel is the only nominally Orthodox synagogue remaining in Cuba. There are two other synagogues in Havana, in addition to a few other Cuban cites. In December 2006, the Cuban Jewish community celebrated its 100th anniversary.\\"Cuba\\", Jewish Virtual Library In 1999, actor and playwright Frank Speiser debuted his one-man play Jewbano about growing up half-Jewish and half-Cuban in Brooklyn.\\"One-man Show Celebrates Creator's Cuban-Jewish Roots\\", The Palm Beach Post (November 22, 2002), p. 40. Although primarily used in a positive sense, some confusion has arisen in the past where \\"Jewban\\" has been misinterpreted as an ethnic slur, or as a political statement (i.e. suggesting the \\"ban\\" of Jews). In 2003 the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles attempted to withdraw a \\"JEWBAN\\" vanity plate which had previously been issued to Tabares Gomer, a Jewish Cuban, arguing that the plate could be considered anti-semitic. The department later relented and permitted Gomer to keep the license plate.\\"State Lets Cuban Jew Keep 'Jewban' License Plate\\", The Orlando Sentinel (March 15, 2003), p. B5.

The siege, laid by Ilkhanate Mongol forces and allied troops, involved the investment, capture, and sack of Baghdad, which was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate at that time. The Mongols were under the command of Hulagu Khan, brother of the khagan M√∂ngke Khan, who had intended to further extend his rule into Mesopotamia but not to directly overthrow the Caliphate. M√∂ngke, however, had instructed Hulagu to attack Baghdad if the Caliph Al-Musta'sim refused Mongol demands for his continued submission to the khagan and the payment of tribute in the form of military support for Mongol forces in Persia. Hulagu began his campaign in Persia against the strongholds of Nizari Ismailis, who lost their stronghold of Alamut. He then marched on Baghdad, demanding that Al-Musta'sim accede to the terms imposed by M√∂ngke on the Abbasids. Although the Abbasids had failed to prepare for the invasion, the Caliph believed that Baghdad could not fall to invading forces and refused to surrender. Hulagu subsequently besieged the city, which surrendered after 12 days.Matthew E. Falagas, Effie A. Zarkadoulia, George Samonis (2006). \\"Arab science in the golden age (750‚Äì1258 C.E.) and today\\", The FASEB Journal 20, pp. 1581‚Äì1586. During the next week, the Mongols sacked Baghdad, committing numerous atrocities; there is debate among historians about the level of destruction of library books and the Abbasids' vast libraries. The Mongols executed Al-Musta'sim and massacred many residents of the city, which was left greatly depopulated. The siege is considered to mark the end of the Islamic Golden Age, during which the caliphs had extended their rule from the Iberian Peninsula to Sindh, and which was also marked by many cultural achievements in diverse fields.Matthew E. Falagas, Effie A. Zarkadoulia, George Samonis (2006). \\"Arab science in the golden age (750‚Äì1258 C.E.) and today\\", The FASEB Journal 20, pp. 1581‚Äì1586. Background Baghdad had for centuries been the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third caliphate, whose rulers were descendants of Abbas, an uncle of Muhammad. In 751, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads and moved the Caliph's seat from Damascus to Baghdad. At the city's peak, it was populated by approximately one million people and was defended by an army of 60,000 soldiers. By the middle of the 13th century the power of the Abbasids had declined and Turkic and Mamluk warlords often held power over the Caliphs.Jack Weatherford Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world, p.135 Baghdad still retained much symbolic significance, and it remained a rich and cultured city. The Caliphs of the 12th and 13th centuries had begun to develop links with the expanding Mongol Empire in the east. Caliph an-Nasir li-dini'llah, who reigned from 1180‚Äì1225, may have attempted an alliance with Genghis Khan when Muhammad II of Khwarezm threatened to attack the Abbasids.Jack Weatherford Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world, p.135 It has been rumored that some Crusader captives were sent as tribute to the Mongol khagan.Jack Weatherford Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world, p.136 According to The Secret History of the Mongols, Genghis and his successor, √ñgedei Khan, ordered their general Chormaqan to attack Baghdad.Sh.Gaadamba Mongoliin nuuts tovchoo (1990), p.233 In 1236, Chormaqan led a division of the Mongol army to Irbil,Timothy May Chormaqan Noyan, p.62 which remained under Abbasid rule. Further raids on Irbil and other regions of the caliphate became nearly annual occurrences.Al-Sa'idi,., op. cit., pp. 83, 84, from Ibn al- Fuwati Some raids were alleged to have reached Baghdad itself,C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.2 but these Mongol incursions were not always successful, with Abbasid forces defeating the invaders in 1238Spuler, op. cit., from Ibn al-'Athir, vol. 12, p. 272. and 1245. Despite their successes, the Abbasids hoped to come to terms with the Mongols and by 1241 had adopted the practice of sending an annual tribute to the court of the khagan. Envoys from the Caliph were present at the coronation of G√ºy√ºk Khan as khagan in 1246Giovanni, da Pian del Carpine (translated by Erik Hildinger) The story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars (1996), p. 108 and that of M√∂ngke Khan in 1251. During his brief reign, G√ºy√ºk insisted that the Caliph Al-Musta'sim fully submit to Mongol rule and come personally to Karakorum. Blame for the Caliph's refusal and for other resistance offered by the Abbasids to increased attempts by the Mongols to extend their power was placed by the khagans on Chormaqan's lieutenant and successor, Baiju. Hulagu's expedition =Planning= In 1257, M√∂ngke resolved to establish firm authority over Mesopotamia, Syria, and Persia. The khagan gave his brother, Hulagu, authority over a subordinate khanate and army, the Ilkhanate, and instructions to compel the submission of various Muslim states, including the caliphate. Though not seeking the overthrow of Al-Musta'sim, M√∂ngke ordered Hulagu to destroy Baghdad if the Caliph refused his demands of personal submission to Hulagu and the payment of tribute in the form of a military detachment, which would reinforce Hulagu's army during its campaigns against Persian Ismaili states. In preparation for his invasion, Hulagu raised a large expeditionary force, conscripting one out of every ten military-age males in the entirety of the Mongol Empire, assembling what may have been the most numerous Mongol army to have existed and, by one estimate, 150,000 strong. Generals of the army included the Oirat administrator Arghun Agha, Baiju, Buqa Tem√ºr, Guo Kan, and Kitbuqa, as well as Hulagu's brother Sunitai and various other warlords.Rashiddudin, Histoire des Mongols de la Perse, E. Quatrieme ed. and trans. (Paris, 1836), p. 352. The force was also supplemented by Christian forces, including the King of Armenia and his army, a Frankish contingent from the Principality of Antioch,Demurger, 80-81; Demurger 284 and a Georgian force, seeking revenge on the Muslim Abbasids for the sacking of their capital, Tiflis, decades earlier by the Khwarazm- Shahs.Khanbaghi, 60 About 1,000 Chinese artillery experts accompanied the army, as did Persian and Turkic auxiliaries, according to Ata-Malik Juvayni, a contemporary Persian observer. =Early campaigns= Hulagu led his army first to Persia, where he successfully campaigned against the Lurs, the Bukhara, and the remnants of the Khwarezm-Shah dynasty. After subduing them, Hulagu directed his attention toward the Nizari Ismailis and their Grand Master, Imam 'Ala al-Din Muhammad, who had attempted the murder of both M√∂ngke and Hulagu's friend and subordinate, Kitbuqa. Though Assassins failed in both attempts, Hulagu marched his army to their stronghold of Alamut, which he captured. The Mongols later executed the Assassins' Grand Master, Imam Rukn al-Dun Khurshah, who had briefly succeeded 'Ala al-Din Muhammad from 1255-1256. Capture of Baghdad =Hulagu's march to Baghdad= After defeating the Assassins, Hulagu sent word to Al-Musta'sim, demanding his acquiescence to the terms imposed by M√∂ngke. Al-Musta'sim refused, in large part due to the influence of his advisor and grand vizier, Ibn al-Alkami. Historians have ascribed various motives to al-Alkami's opposition to submission, including treachery and incompetence, and it appears that he lied to the Caliph about the severity of the invasion, assuring Al-Musta'sim that, if the capital of the caliphate was endangered by a Mongol army, the Islamic world would rush to its aid. Although he replied to Hulagu's demands in a manner that the Mongol commander found menacing and offensive enough to break off further negotiation,Nicolle Al- Musta'sim neglected to summon armies to reinforce the troops at his disposal in Baghdad. Nor did he strengthen the city's walls. By January 11 the Mongols were close to the city, establishing themselves on both banks of the Tigris River so as to form a pincer around the city. Al-Musta'sim finally decided to do battle with them and sent out a force of 20,000 cavalry to attack the Mongols. The cavalry were decisively defeated by the Mongols, whose sappers breached dikes along the Tigris River and flooded the ground behind the Abbasid forces, trapping them. =Siege of the city= Persian painting (14th century) of H√ºleg√º's army besieging a city. Note use of the siege engine The Abbasid caliphate could supposedly call upon 50,000 soldiers for the defense of their capital, including the 20,000 cavalry under al-Musta'sim. However, these troops were assembled hastily, making them poorly equipped and disciplined. Although the caliph technically had the authority to summon soldiers from other Muslim empires to defend his realm, he either neglected to do so or lacked the ability to. His taunting opposition had lost him the loyalty of the Mamluks, and the Syrian emirs, whom he supported, were busy preparing their own defenses.James Chambers, \\"The Devil's Horsemen,\\" p. 144. On January 29, the Mongol army began its siege of Baghdad, constructing a palisade and a ditch around the city. Employing siege engines and catapults, the Mongols attempted to breach the city's walls, and, by February 5, had seized a significant portion of the defenses. Realizing that his forces had little chance of retaking the walls, Al-Musta'sim attempted to open negotiations with Hulagu, who rebuffed the Caliph. Around 3,000 of Baghdad's notables also tried to negotiate with Hulagu but were murdered. Five days later, on February 10, the city surrendered, but the Mongols did not enter the city until the 13th, beginning a week of massacre and destruction. Destruction Hulagu (left) imprisons Caliph Al-Musta'sim among his treasures to starve him to death. Medieval depiction from Le livre des merveilles, 15th century Many historical accounts detailed the cruelties of the Mongol conquerors.

Priceless books from Baghdad's thirty-six public libraries were torn apart, the looters using their leather covers as sandals.Murray, S.A.P. (2012). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, pp. 54. Grand buildings that had been the work of generations were burned to the ground. The House of Wisdom (the Grand Library of Baghdad), containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Claims have been made that the Tigris ran red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed.Frazier, I., \\"Invaders: Destroying Baghdad,\\" New Yorker Magazine, [Special edition: Annals of History], April 25, 2005, Online Issue Tales of the destruction of books - tossed into the Tigris such that the water turned black from the ink - seem to originate from the 14th century.James Raven, Introduction: The Resonances of Loss, in Lost Libraries: The Destruction of Great Book Collections since Antiquity, ed.

Citizens attempted to flee, but were intercepted by Mongol soldiers who killed in abundance, sparing neither women nor children. Martin Sicker writes that close to 90,000 people may have died.(Sicker 2000, p. 111)Rene Grousset, The Empire of the Steppes, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, √ß1970 p.356 Other estimates go much higher, but are almost certainly exaggerated.Peter Jackson, The Mongols and the Islamic World-from Conquest to Conversion, Yale University Press, New Haven, √ß2017, p.171-172 The caliph Al-Musta'sim was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, as they believed that the earth would be offended if it were touched by royal blood. All but one of Al-Musta'sim's sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia, where Mongolian historians report he married and fathered children, but played no role in Islam thereafter (see The end of the Abbasid dynasty). Hulagu had to move his camp upwind of the city, due to the stench of decay from the ruined city.Henry Howorth, History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century, Part I, Burt Franklin, New York, √ß1876, p.127 The historian David Morgan has quoted Wassaf describing the destruction: \\"They swept through the city like hungry falcons attacking a flight of doves, or like raging wolves attacking sheep, with loose reins and shameless faces, murdering and spreading terror...beds and cushions made of gold and encrusted with jewels were cut to pieces with knives and torn to shreds. Those hiding behind the veils of the great Harem were dragged...through the streets and alleys, each of them becoming a plaything...as the population died at the hands of the invaders.\\" Some modern historians have cast some doubt on the vehemently anti-Mongol medieval sources.Michal Biran, The Mongols‚Äô Middle East, ed. De Nicola & Melville, Brill, Boston, √ß2016 p.140-141 George Lane (SOAS), for example, doubts the Grand Library was destroyed as the learned members of the Mongol command such as Nasir al-Din Tusi would not have allowed it, and that disease was the major cause of death.George Lane (Society of Ancient Sources), Iran After the Mongols: The Idea of Iran, Vol.8, ed. S. Babaie, I.B. Tauris, London, √ß2019, p.17-18 Primary sources state that Tusi saved thousands of volumes and installed them into a building in MarƒÅgheh.Ibn Taymiyyah, Majm≈´‚Äô al-FatƒÅwa (DƒÅr al-WafƒÅ‚Äô, 2005), p. 13:111.Kh·∫°lƒ´l b.

Canals were cut as a military tactic and never repaired. So many people died or fled that neither the labour nor the organization were sufficient to maintain the canal system. It broke down or silted up. This theory was advanced (not for the first time) by historian Svatopluk Souƒçek in his 2000 book, A History of Inner Asia. Other historians point to soil salination as the primary cause for the decline in agriculture. Aftermath Hulagu left 3,000 Mongol soldiers behind to rebuild Baghdad. Ata-Malik Juvayni was later appointed governor of Baghdad, Lower Mesopotamia, and Khuzistan after Guo Kan went back to Yuan dynasty to assist Kublai conquest over the Song dynasty. The Mongol Hulagu's Nestorian Christian wife, Dokuz Khatun successfully interceded to spare the lives of Baghdad's Christian inhabitants.Maalouf, 243Runciman, 306 Hulagu offered the royal palace to the Nestorian Catholicos Mar Makikha, and ordered a cathedral to be built for him.Foltz, 123 Initially, the fall of Baghdad came as a shock to the whole Muslim world; after many years of utter devastation, the city became an economic center where international trade, the minting of coins and religious affairs flourished under the Ilkhans. The chief Mongol darughachi was thereafter stationed in the city.

He arrived at the prison on December 5, 2002, and was declared dead 5 days later. His death was declared a homicide and was the subject of a major investigation by the US Army of abuses at the prison. It was prosecuted in the Bagram torture and prisoner abuse trials. American award-winning documentary Taxi to the Dark Side (2007) focuses on the murder of Dilawar.  Background  Dilawar was a 22-year-old Pashtun taxi driver and farmer from the small village of Yakubi in the Khost Province of Afghanistan. He was tall and weighed . Dilawar was transporting three passengers in his taxi when he was stopped at a checkpoint by Pakistani militia and arrested along with his passengers. The four men were detained and turned over to American soldiers, who transferred them to the Bagram Theater Internment Facility. Two of his passengers, Abdul Rahim and Zakim Shah, were reported to have suffered treatment similar to that of Dilawar. They survived Bagram and were later flown to the Guantanamo Bay detention camps at the US base in Cuba. At Bagram, Dilawar was chained to the ceiling of his cell, and suspended by his wrists for four days. His arms became dislocated from their sockets, and flapped around limply whenever guards collected him for interrogation. During his detention, Dilawar's legs were beaten to a pulp. They would have had to have been amputated because damage was so severe. He died on December 10, 2002. He is survived by his wife and their daughter, Bibi Rashida. = Arrest = The New York Times reported on May 20, 2005 that:  Torture  A sketch by Thomas V. Curtis, a former Reserve M.P. sergeant, showing how Dilawar was chained to the ceiling of his cell The various accounts of torture have been detailed as follows: * A black hood pulled over his head limiting his ability to breathe * Knee strikes to the abdomen * Over 100 peroneal strikes (a nerve behind the kneecap) * Shoved against a wall * Pulled by his beard * His bare feet stepped on * Kicks to the groin * Chained to the ceiling for extended hours, depriving him of sleep * Slammed his chest into a table front The New York Times reported that: > On the day of his death, Dilawar had been chained by the wrists to the top > of his cell for much of the previous four days.

It would be many months before Army investigators learned that most > of the interrogators had in fact believed Mr. Dilawar to be an innocent man > who simply drove his taxi past the American base at the wrong time.  Death  The findings of Mr. Dilawar's autopsy were succinct. Leaked internal United States Army documentation in the form of a death certificate dated 12 December 2002, ruled that his death was due to a direct result of assaults and attacks he sustained at the hands of interrogators of the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion during his stay at Bagram. The document was signed by Lt. Col. Elizabeth A. Rouse of the U.S. Air Force, a pathologist with the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington DC, and listed as its finding that the \\"mode of death\\" was \\"homicide,\\" and not \\"natural,\\" \\"accident\\" or \\"suicide\\" and that the cause of death was \\"blunt-force injuries to lower extremities complicating coronary artery disease\\". A subsequent autopsy revealed that his legs had been \\"pulpified,\\" and that even if Dilawar had survived, it would have been necessary to amputate his legs. According to the death certificate shown in the documentary Taxi to the Dark Side, the box marked Homicide had been checked as the ultimate cause of death. However, the military had so far publicly claimed that Dilawar had died from natural causes. It was only by accident that the death certificate was leaked when New York Times reporter Carlotta Gall managed to track down Dilawar's family in Yakubi where Dilawar's brother, Shahpoor, showed her a folded paper he had received with Dilawar's body which he could not read because it was in English; it was the death certificate.  Culpability  In August 2005, lead interrogator Specialist Glendale C. Walls of the U.S. Army pleaded guilty at a military court to pushing Dilawar against a wall and doing nothing to prevent other soldiers from abusing him. Wells was subsequently sentenced to two months in a military prison. Two other soldiers convicted in connection with the case escaped custodial sentences. The sentences were criticized by Human Rights Watch. Forensic photo of Dilawar's pulpified legs In March 2006, the CBS News program, \\"60 Minutes\\" investigated the deaths of two Afghan prisoners, including Dilawar, revealing that authorization for the abuse came from the \\"very top of the United States government\\". 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed retired Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who was appointed chief of staff by Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2002, during George W. Bush's first administration. Willie V. Brand, one of the soldiers convicted of assault and maiming in the deaths of the two prisoners, and Brand's commanding officer, Capt. Christopher Beiring, were also featured in the program. Wilkerson told \\"60 Minutes\\" that he could \\"smell\\" a cover-up and was asked by Powell to investigate how American soldiers had come to use torture and stated; \\"I was developing the picture as to how this all got started in the first place, and that alarmed me as much as the abuse itself because it looked like authorization for the abuse went to the very top of the United States government\\". Brand and Beiring confirmed that several of their leaders had witnessed and knew about the abuse and torture of the prisoners.CBS‚Äô \\"60 Minutes\\" expose on killings in Afghanistan: Former aide to Powell: authorization for torture came from \\"the very top\\" Beiring and Brand showed no remorse when recounting the torture. Beiring was charged with dereliction of duty, a charge that was later dropped. Brand was convicted at his court martial, but rather than the 16 years in prison he was facing from the charges brought against him, he was given a reduction in rank. In August 2005, Sgt. Selena M. Salcedo, an interrogator with the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion, admitted to mistreating Dilawar. In a military court Salcedo pleaded guilty to dereliction of duty and assault, admitting she kicked the prisoner, grabbed his head and forced him against a wall several times. Two related charges were dropped and she was reduced in rank to corporal or specialist, given a letter of reprimand and docked $250 a month in pay for four months. She could have received a year in prison, loss of a year's pay, reduction in rank to private, and a bad-conduct discharge. 2007 inquiry in civil court In July 2007, a Federal grand jury opened a civil inquiry into the Bagram abuse. Alicia A. Caldwell, writing in the Huffington Post, quoted a former military defense lawyer, named Michael Waddington, who said: Duane M. Grubb, Darin Broady, Christopher Greatorex and Christopher Beiring, four of the soldiers in who served at the center at the time of the deaths, acknowledge that they had been called before the grand jury. They were reported to have waived immunity.

A number of serious attempts, by various means, to create such a union took place between 1574 and 1658, and even as late as the latter part of the 18th century, but it has never materialized due to incompatible demands from both sides. The proposed union is known in Polish historiography as the Triple Union (unia troista) and has also been called the Polish‚ÄìRussian Union (unia polsko-rosyjska) or Polish‚ÄìMuscovite Union (unia polsko-moskiewska). Rationale Proponents of such a union among the Polish nobility, included the then influential secular thinkers Jan Zamoyski and Lew Sapieha, had listed several arguments in its favor: peace on the turbulent eastern border, a powerful military ally and relatively sparsely populated territories (compared to the Polish Crown) for colonization and serfdom. The idea was also supported by the Jesuits and other papal emissaries who never ceased to entertain the idea of bringing Orthodox Russia into the Catholic fold. Some of the Russian boyars found the proposal attractive (like Boris Godunov, a supporter of Tsar Feodor's I candidacy) for various reasons, among them the fact that the Golden Freedoms of the Commonwealth, if applied in Russia, would weaken tsar's power and thus grant the Russian nobility a much higher status than they had enjoyed previously. The proposals of that time revolved around introducing a personal union between the Commonwealth and Russia, and various economic and political agreements (elimination of trade barriers, free movement of people, etc.), up to the creation of one country, using the framework of that led to the creation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the first place (Union of Lublin of 1569). However all proposals presented by the Polish side were rejected by the Russian tsar. The most promising negotiations took place during 1600, when a Polish diplomatic mission led by Lew Sapieha arrived in Moscow. Sapieha presented to Boris Godunov an elaborated idea of a union between Poland‚ÄìLithuania and Russia. The subjects of both rulers were to be free to serve the other ruler, travel to his country, contract marriages with the other ruler's subjects, own land and go to study in the other ruler's country.Andrzej Nowak, Between Imperial Temptation and Anti-Imperial Function in Eastern European Politics: Poland from the Eighteenth to Twenty-First Century, Slavic Euroasian Studies, Hokkaido University, online Although the Moscow side was willing to agree to some parts of the proposed treaties (like extradition of the crime suspects), it was strictly opposed to points about religious tolerance (non-Orthodox religions, especially Catholicism, were persecuted in Russia, unlike in Commonwealth, which allowed all faith to be preached) and free movement of people (according to Polish scholars). To transform the Russian tsardom into a republic modeled on the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth has proven to be a too ambitious project. Many Russians were afraid of polonization, as was already happening with Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility, and a growing danger stemming from the increasing number of peasant and even noble refugees escaping the Russian Empire,Jerzy Czajewski, \\"Zbiegostwo ludno≈õci Rosji w granice Rzeczypospolitej\\" (Russian population exodus into the Rzeczpospolita), Promemoria journal, October 2004 nr. (5/15), , Table of Content online , Polish languageAndrzej Nowak, The Russo-Polish Historical Confrontation, Sarmatian Review, January 1997, online to which Russian tsar Ivan responded with the policy of violent repressions, the so- called oprichnina. Union of Brest of 1596 was a further argument for the Orthodox opponents of the closer ties between Russia and the Commonwealth, who argued that it was the prelude to Catholicization of Russia. Poland-Lithuania- Ruthenia Commonwealth History =Polish succession= Ivan IV of Russia was a candidate for the Polish throne The idea was first broached in the 16th century after the death of the last Polish king of the Jagiellon dynasty, Sigismund II Augustus. Tsar Ivan IV of Russia (\\"the Terrible\\") became a popular candidate among the Polish nobility. He had substantial support in Poland, especially among the lesser and middle nobility, who saw in him an opportunity to limit the growing power of the Polish-Lithuanian magnates. During the interregnum, two diplomatic missions (led by Micha≈Ç Harraburda, pisarz litewski, and Jƒôdrzej Taranowski) were sent from Poland to Moscow to hold discussions. The negotiations failed, due to hostilities resulting from the Livonian War, territorial demands by Ivan (who wanted former territories of Kievan Rus', then under control of Lithuania), and decision by Ivan that Russian side will not 'lower itself to the level of other European monarchies and send a diplomatic mission to Poland begging for him to become a king'. During the second interregnum, in 1574, candidature of Ivan IV was even highly regarded in Poland, however the Moscow diplomatic mission that arrived in Poland had no orders nor prerogatives to negotiate this matter. Eventually the disappointed pro-Ivan faction, represented by Jan Sierakowski, issued a statement in Sejm: ...Great Prince of Muscovy would be the best choice for king, but due to his silence we are forced to forget him and should not mention him again.Jerzy Malec, Szkice z dziej√≥w federalizmu i my≈õli federalistycznych w czasach nowo≈ºytnych, \\"Unia Troista\\", Wydawnictwo UJ, 1999, Krak√≥w, . =Russian succession= W≈Çadys≈Çaw Vasa of Poland claimed the Russian throne The mixed circle of the proponents of this idea saw an opportunity in Russia after Ivan the Terrible, the last Russian ruler of that time whose legitimacy was never questioned, died. The proposal was revived soon after Ivan's death, through the reigns of Stefan Batory in Poland and Feodor I in Russia. After Batory's death in 1587, Feodor I became quite interested in acquiring the Polish throne, and sent a diplomatic mission to Poland. His support among the Lithuanians was high, but Poles issued several demands, among them requiring Fedors's conversion to Catholicism, an absolutely unthinkable event. Eventually Sigismund III Vasa was elected the king of Poland. Death of Feodor prompted Sigismund to propose his candidacy for the Moscow throne, however by the time Polish diplomatic mission arrived in Moscow, Boris Godunov was elected the new tsar. With the legitimacy issues clouding the entire period of the rule of Boris Godunov, Russia submerged into even greater chaos upon his death, the Russian Time of Troubles, which was accompanied by a decisive Polish armed intervention, or the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì1618), commonly referred to in Russia as the Polish intervention in the end-17th century. In the course of the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War, the Polish prince (later king) W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa was briefly elected a Russian Tsar among other such strange developments like enthronement and short reign of False Dmitriy I, an impostor of tsar Ivan's son. However, Wladyslaw was never officially enthroned and his quick election remained in history as one of the fluke events of Russia's Time of Troubles. The idea was again proposed in 1656‚Äì1658, when Moscow suggested that one of the points of negotiations would be the election of the Russian tsar for the Polish throne. This time it was the Polish side which presented demands (conversion to Catholicism, territorial changes) that eventually discouraged Russians from pursuing this project. =Proposal of the last Polish king= Finally, the idea returned in the 18th century, when the last Polish king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski attempted to save the Polish state by proposing a marriage between himself and Russian Empress, Catherine the Great. The very possibility that such an idea could have been seriously considered by the Polish side early on was likely based on the spirit of the 1573 Warsaw Confederation (Warsaw Compact), that guaranteed, at least formally, an equality for non-Catholic nobles in the Commonwealth. However, while the adopted convention was an unprecedentedly liberal act for its time, such full equality was never achieved in reality even within the Commonwealth itself. Taking into account that the most divisions of that time, if not dynastic, were the religious divisions and the relationship between the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox branches of Christianities were strained at best, it remains surprising that such an idea was seriously considered at all. It remains equally unlikely, that such an idea could have been accepted by the Russian side because the view towards Catholicism in the Russian Empire was highly negative. Thus, while the idea of a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite Commonwealth was supported early on by some progressive and secular Polish diplomats, in the end the efforts of the few could not overcome Russian opposition to Catholicism and the fear that such a union would spell Catholic domination over the Orthodox religion.

It introduced audiences in Europe, including the UK, to leading blues performers of the day such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, John Lee Hooker and Sonny Boy Williamson, most of whom had never previously performed outside the US. The tours attracted substantial media coverage, including TV shows, and contributed to the growth of the audience for blues music in Europe. Background German jazz publicist Joachim-Ernst Berendt first had the idea of bringing original African-American blues performers to Europe. Jazz and rock and roll had become very popular, and both genres drew influences directly back to the blues. Berendt thought that European audiences would flock to concert halls to see them in person. Promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau brought this idea to reality. By contacting Willie Dixon, an influential blues composer and bassist from Chicago, they were given access to the blues culture of the southern United States. The first festival was held in 1962, and they continued almost annually until 1972, after an eight-year hiatus reviving the festival in 1980 until its final performance in 1985. Performances and audiences The concerts featured some of the leading blues artists of the 1960s, such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Willie Dixon, John Lee Hooker and Sonny Boy Williamson, some playing in unique combinations such as T-Bone Walker playing guitar for pianist Memphis Slim, Otis Rush with Junior Wells, Sonny Boy Williamson with Muddy Waters. The Festival DVDs include the only known footage of Little Walter, and rare recordings of John Lee Hooker playing harmonica. T-Bone Walker 1972 The audience at Manchester in 1962, the first venue for the festival in Britain, included Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones and Jimmy Page. Subsequent attendees at the first London festivals are believed to have also included such influential musicians as Eric Burdon, Eric Clapton, and Steve Winwood. Collectively these were the primary movers in the blues explosion that would lead to the British Invasion. Sonny Boy Williamson's visit to London with the 1963 festival led to him spending a year in Europe including recording the Sonny Boy Williamson and The Yardbirds album, (first released on Star-Club Records in 1965), and recording with The Animals. =Blues and Gospel Train= On 7 May 1964, Granada Television broadcast Blues and Gospel Train, a programme directed by John Hamp featuring Muddy Waters, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Rev. Gary Davis, Cousin Joe and Otis Spann. For filming, the company transformed the disused Wilbraham Road railway station into \\"Chorltonville\\", giving it the supposed appearance of a southern U.S.-style station. About 200 fans were brought by train to the platform opposite the performers.

A maxim is often pedagogical and motivates specific actions. The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy defines it as: Deontological ethics In deontological ethics, mainly in Kantian ethics, maxims are understood as subjective principles of action. A maxim is thought to be part of an agent's thought process for every rational action, indicating in its standard form: (1) the action, or type of action; (2) the conditions under which it is to be done; and (3) the end or purpose to be achieved by the action, or the motive. The maxim of an action is often referred to as the agent's intention. In Kantian ethics, the categorical imperative provides a test on maxims for determining whether the actions they refer to are right, wrong, or permissible. The categorical imperative is stated canonically as: \\"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\\" In his Critique of Practical Reason, Immanuel Kant provided the following example of a maxim and of how to apply the test of the categorical imperative: > I have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by any safe > means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has died and > left no record of it. . . . I therefore apply the maxim to the present case > and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and consequently > whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such a law as this: > that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been made. I at > once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate itself > since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all. Also, an action is said to have \\"moral worth\\" if the maxim upon which the agent acts cites the purpose of conforming to a moral requirement. That is, a person's action has moral worth when he does his duty purely for the sake of duty, or does the right thing for the right reason. Kant himself believed that it is impossible to know whether anyone's action has ever had moral worth. It might appear to someone that he has acted entirely \\"from duty\\", but this could always be an illusion of self-interest: of wanting to see oneself in the best, most noble light. This indicates that agents are not always the best judges of their own maxims or motives. Personal knowledge Michael Polanyi in his account of tacit knowledge stressed the importance of the maxim in focusing both explicit and implicit modes of understanding. ‚ÄúMaxims are rules, the correct application of which is part of the art they govern....Maxims can only function within a framework of personal (i.e., experiential) knowledge‚Äù.Quoted in Guy Claxton, Live and learn (1992) p. 116  See also  * Adage * Aphorism * Brocard * Ethics * Legal maxim * Morality * Paremiology * Principle  References   External links  * Locksley Hall - Alfred Lord Tennyson * Online works of Immanuel Kant at Gutenberg * Maxims of Action Category:Concepts in ethics Category:Kantianism Category:Statements ","title":"Maxim (philosophy)"},{"id":"2530833","text":"In electromagnetics, the antenna factor (units: m‚àí1, reciprocal meter) is defined as the ratio of the electric field E (units: V/m or ŒºV/m) to the voltage V (units: V or ŒºV) induced across the terminals of an antenna.

The system is used to allow the government to handle epidemic statistics and define who receives US government assistance. In adults and adolescents This classification system is how the United States agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies HIV disease and infection. This is to allow the government to handle epidemic statistics and define who receives US government assistance. In 1993, the CDC added pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, and invasive cervical cancer to the list of clinical conditions in the AIDS surveillance case definition published in 1987 and expanded the AIDS surveillance case definition to include all HIV-infected persons with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of less than 200 cells/uL or a CD4+ percentage of less than 14. Considerable variation exists in the relative risk of death following different AIDS defining clinical conditions. According to the US CDC definition, one has AIDS if he/she is infected with HIV and present with one of the following: * A CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/Œºl (or a CD4+ T-cell percentage of total lymphocytes of less than 14%) OR * he/she has one of the following defining illnesses: **Candidiasis of bronchi, trachea, or lungs **Candidiasis esophageal **Cervical cancer (invasive) **Coccidioidomycosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary **Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary **Cryptosporidiosis, chronic intestinal for longer than 1 month **Cytomegalovirus disease (other than liver, spleen or lymph nodes) **Encephalopathy (HIV-related) **Herpes simplex: chronic (for more than 1 month); or bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis **Histoplasmosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary **Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal (for more than 1 month) **Kaposi's sarcoma **Lymphoma Burkitt's, immunoblastic or primary brain **Mycobacterium avium complex **Mycobacterium, other species, disseminated or extrapulmonary **Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia **Pneumonia (recurrent) **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy **Salmonella sepsis (recurrent) **Toxoplasmosis of the brain **Tuberculosis **Wasting syndrome due to HIV People who are not infected with HIV may also develop these conditions; this does not mean they have AIDS. However, when an individual presents laboratory evidence against HIV infection, a diagnosis of AIDS is ruled out unless the patient has: * undergone high-dose corticoid therapy or other immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy in the three months before the onset of the indicator disease * OR been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, or any cancer of lymphoreticular or histiocytic tissue, or angioimmunoblastic lymphoadenopathy * OR a genetic immunodeficiency syndrome atypical of HIV infection, such as one involving hypogamma globulinemia AND * the individual has had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia * OR one of the above defining illnesses AND a CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/Œºl (or a CD4+ T-cell percentage of total lymphocytes of less than 14%). In children Due to the additional knowledge of the progression of HIV disease among children, a revised classification system for HIV infection in children was developed in 1994 that replaced the pediatric HIV classification system that was published in 1987. A child for the purposes of the CDC is an individual of less than 13 years of age. Standard anti-HIV IgG antibody tests cannot be used to reliably indicate a child's infection status before 18 months of age, so viral antigen tests are used. In the new system, HIV-infected children are classified into mutually exclusive categories according to three parameters: :a) infection status :b) clinical status :c) immunologic status This classification system reflects the stage of the child's disease, establishes mutually exclusive classification categories, and balances simplicity and medical accuracy in the classification process. This document also describes revised pediatric definitions for two acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining conditions. When an infant is born to an HIV-infected mother, diagnosis of an HIV infection is complicated by the presence of maternal anti-HIV IgG antibody, which crosses the placenta to the fetus. Indeed, virtually all children born to HIV-infected mothers are HIV- antibody positive at birth, although only 15%-30% are actually infected. =Category N: Not symptomatic= Children who have no signs or symptoms considered to be the result of HIV infection or who have only one of the conditions listed in Category A. =Category A: Mildly symptomatic= Children with two or more of the conditions listed below but none of the conditions listed in Categories B and C. *Lymphadenopathy (>=0.5 cm at more than two sites; bilateral = one site) *Hepatomegaly *Splenomegaly *Dermatitis *Parotitis *Recurrent or persistent upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, or otitis media =Category B: Moderately symptomatic= Children who have symptomatic conditions other than those listed for Category A or C that are attributed to HIV infection.

It is also present in parts of Tanzania, where it is considered an invasive species. It can be recognized by its smooth brown bark covered in many dark, pointed spines which have led to its being nicknamed monkey no-climb. Description Sandbox trees can grow to , and its large ovate leaves grow to wide. They are monoecious, with red, un-petaled flowers. Male flowers grow on long spikes, while female flowers grow alone in axils. The sandbox tree's fruiting bodies are large capsules which can explode when ripe, splitting into segments and launching seeds at . One source states that ripe capsules catapult their seeds as far as . Another source states that seeds are thrown as far as from a tree, averaging about . The sandbox tree's explosive fruit has led to an additional nickname: the dynamite tree. Its fruits are pumpkin-shaped capsules, 1.4‚Äì2 inches (3‚Äì5 cm) long, 2‚Äì3.2 inches (5‚Äì8 cm) diameter, with 16 carpels arranged radially. Its seeds are flattened and about 0.8 inches (2 cm) diameter. Habitat This tree prefers wet soil, and partial shade or partial to full sun. It is often cultivated for shade. Uses Fishermen have been said to use the milky, caustic sap from this tree to poison fish. The Caribs made arrow poison from its sap. The wood is used for furniture under the name \\"hura\\". Before more modern forms of pens were invented, the trees' unripe seed capsules were sawn in half to make decorative pen sandboxes (also called pounce pots), hence the name 'sandbox tree'.

Annual autumn leaf drop in temperate zones is caused by the abscission of the mature leaves from the growth season in response to the approach of cold winter weather. Abscission (from Latin ab, \\"away\\", and scindere, \\"to cut'\\") is the shedding of various parts of an organism, such as a plant dropping a leaf, fruit, flower, or seed. In zoology, abscission is the intentional shedding of a body part, such as the shedding of a claw, husk, or the autotomy of a tail to evade a predator. In mycology, it is the liberation of a fungal spore. In cell biology, abscission refers to the separation of two daughter cells at the completion of cytokinesis. In plants = Function = Abscission of the hypanthium during development of a nectarine fruit A plant will abscise a part either to discard a member that is no longer necessary, such as a leaf during autumn, or a flower following fertilisation, or for the purposes of reproduction. Most deciduous plants drop their leaves by abscission before winter, whereas evergreen plants continuously abscise their leaves. Another form of abscission is fruit drop, when a plant abscises fruit while still immature, in order to conserve resources needed to bring the remaining fruit to maturity. If a leaf is damaged, a plant may also abscise it to conserve water or photosynthetic efficiency, depending on the 'costs' to the plant as a whole. The abscission layer is a greenish-grayish color. Abscission can also occur in premature leaves as a means of plant defense. Premature leaf abscission has been shown to occur in response to infestation by gall aphids. By abscising leaves that have been made host to aphid galls, plants have been shown to massively diminish the pest population, as 98% of aphids in abscised galls died. The abscission is selective, and the chance of dropping leaves increases as the number of galls increase. A leaf with three or more galls was four times more likely to abscise than a leaf with one, and 20 times as likely to be dropped as a leaf without any galls.Williams, A.G., & T.G. Whitham (1986). Premature leaf abscission: an induced plant defense against gall aphids. Ecology, 67(6), 1619-1627. =Process= Abscission occurs in a series of three events: 1) resorption, 2) protective layer formation, and 3) detachment.Addicott, F.T. 1982. Abscission. University of California Press, London, England. Steps 2 and 3 may occur in either order depending on the species. Resorption Resorption involves degrading chlorophyll to extract the majority of its nutrients.Keskitalo, J., G. Bergguist, P. Gardestrom, and S. Jansson. 2005. A Cellular Timetable of Autumn Senescence. Plant Phys. 139 : 1635-1648. Nitrogen is found in chlorophyll and is often a limiting nutrient for plants because plants need large quantities of N to form amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins, and certain plant hormones.Hopkins, W.G. and N.P.A. Huner. 2009. Introduction to Plant Physiology. Fourth edition. Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ. Once nitrogen and other nutrients have been extracted from chlorophyll, the nutrients will travel to other tissues of the plant. Resorption is what causes leaves in the fall to change colors. Carotenoids in the leaves are slower to degrade than chlorophyll, so autumn leaves appear yellow and orange. Protective layer formation Cells under the abscission zone divide and form a layer of cork cells.Kozlowski, T.T. 1973. Shedding of Plant Parts. Academic Press, New York, NY. Situated on both sides of the abscission zone are layers of parenchyma cells, which produce and inject suberin and lignin under the abscission zone into the new layer of cork cells. Suberin and lignin create a durable and waterproof layer for the plant once the organ is detached. Detachment This step can occur in a variety of ways depending on the species but always occurs at the abscission zone.Solomon, E.P., L.R. Berg., and D.W. Martin. 2011. Biology. Ninth edition, Brooks/Cole, Belmont, CA. Detachment can occur when layers of parenchyma cells secrete cell wall enzymes to self-digest the middle lamella, which holds the cell walls together at the abscission zone. This causes the cells of the abscission zone to break apart and the leaf or other plant part to fall off. Another way detachment occurs is through imbibition of water. The plant cells at the abscission zone will take in a large amount of water, swell, and eventually burst, making the organ fall off. Once detached, the protective layer of cork will be exposed. = Mechanisms = Structural In deciduous trees, an abscission zone, also called a separation zone, is formed at the base of the petiole. It is composed of a top layer that has cells with weak walls, and a bottom layer that expands in the autumn, breaking the weak walls of the cells in the top layer. This allows the leaf to be shed.  Lack of chlorophyll as a trigger  Streptocarpus leaf showing abscission line in response to reduced day length The reduction of chlorophyll production in leaves due to decreased sunlight in the autumn explains why some leaves turn yellow. However, the yellow color can attract aphids, so some trees turn the leaves red instead by injecting a bright pigment. The loss of chlorophyll may also contribute to the abscission process.  Chemical  A variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by plants during times of stress (biotic and abiotic) including UV light, cool temperatures, excessive light, pathogens, parasites, and high salinity. The presence and continuous production of these ROS causes disruption in the homeostasis of the cellular components, leading to metabolic dysfunction and expression of cell wall- degrading enzymes (WDEs).Sakamoto, M., I. Munemura, R. Tomita, & K. Kobayashi (2008). Reactive oxygen species in leaf abscission signaling. Plant Signal Behavior, 3(11), 1014-1015.  Hormonal  While researchers originally believed abscisic acid to be the hormone that stimulates abscission (for which the hormone was named), it was later proven that it does not play a primary role. In fact, auxin, a plant hormone, and ethylene have been implicated as prominent regulators of abscission signaling. The two compounds work in a synergistic fashion: As the auxin levels decrease, the flux of auxin to the abscission zone is reduced. Exhaustion of auxin makes the abscission zone sensitive to ethylene. When the plant is then exposed to ethylene, gene expression of cell wall-degrading enzymes such as cellulase and polygalacturonase are activated. However, this is not to say that ethylene directly activates WDE gene expression, because the elements responsible for detecting ethylene have not been found in the gene's promoter region. Dwindling auxin levels have also been implicated in autumn-leaf color change.

Heinlein in several of his science fiction novels and short stories to describe fictional rocket ships that can maintain high accelerations indefinitely, thus approaching the speed of light. The term has subsequently been used by other authors to describe similar kinds of fictional spaceships. Heinlein's use of the term Cover art for Heinlein's Time for the Stars showing artist Clifford N. Geary's conception of a torchship. In his 1950 novel Farmer in the Sky, Heinlein describes a \\"mass-conversion ship\\" that derives its motive power from the complete conversion of mass to energy. The narrator of the novel, who is traveling to Jupiter in a mass-conversion ship called the Mayflower, describes it as follows: > The Mayflower was shaped like a ball with a cone on one side -- top-shaped. > The point of the cone was her jet -- although Chief Engineer Ortega, who > showed us around, called it her \\"torch.\\" Later in the novel, Ortega is quoted as saying: > \\"The latest development is the mass-conversion ship, such as the Mayflower, > and it may be the final development -- a mass-conversion ship is > theoretically capable of approaching the speed of light.\\" The scientific advance that permits this efficient conversion of mass to energy is called the \\"Kilgore equations.\\" In later novels and stories, including \\"Sky Lift\\" (1953), Time for the Stars (1956), and Double Star (1957), Heinlein refers to mass-conversion ships as \\"torchships\\" and to their pilots as \\"torchship pilots.\\" Exposition in Tunnel in the Sky (1955), states \\"Ortega's torch ships could reach the stars,\\" but explains the need for Gates to move surplus population off-planet, as it would be impossible to build/crew enough ships to carry a significant fraction of the human race. In Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958), the protagonists are kidnapped by hostile aliens and taken to Pluto aboard a space ship that accelerates at more than one gravity for days at a time, although the ship is never explicitly referred to as a \\"torchship.\\" The \\"torch\\" is said to work with any matter as fuel; in Time for the Stars, the ship refuels by landing in water, or in one case liquid ammonia. Use of the term by other authors The term \\"torchship\\" was adopted by a number of other science fiction authors, including * Norman Spinrad in Riding the Torch (1975) * Dan Simmons in Hyperion Cantos (1983-1999) * David Brin and Gregory Benford in Heart of the Comet (1986) * Pierce Brown in his trilogy \\"Red Rising\\" (2014-2016) * Ben Bova and his Grand Saga.

The most common evaporative-pattern material used is polystyrene foam.. The two major evaporative-pattern casting processes are: *Lost-foam casting *Full-mold casting The main difference is that lost-foam casting uses an unbonded sand and full-mold casting uses a bonded sand (or green sand). Because this difference is quite small there is much overlap in the terminology. Non-proprietary terms that have been used to describe these processes include: cavityless casting,. evaporative foam casting, foam vaporization casting, lost pattern casting, the castral process, and expanded polystyrene molding... Proprietary terms included Styro-cast,. Foam Cast,. Replicast,. Policast. and Lost Foam Sintered Shell (LFSS) History The first patent for an evaporative-pattern casting process was filed in April 1956, by Harold F. Shroyer. He patented the use of foam patterns embedded in traditional green sand for metal casting. In his patent, a pattern was machined from a block of expanded polystyrene (EPS), and supported by bonded sand during pouring. This process is now known as the full mold process. In 1964, M.C. Flemmings used unbonded sand for the process. The first North American foundry to use evaporative-pattern casting was the Robinson Foundry at Alexander City, Alabama. General Motors' first product using these processes was the 4.3 L, V-6 diesel cylinder head, which were made in 1981 at Massena, New York. A study found in 1997 that evaporative-pattern casting processes accounted for approximately 140,000 tons of aluminium casting in the United States.

Bauman wrestled in many independent promotions, but is known for his time in Combat Zone Wrestling, where he was a CZW World Tag Team Champion. On August 18, 2005, Bauman was killed in a motorcycle accident. Professional wrestling career =2001= Bauman began working for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in 2001, after being trained at their training academy by Jon Dahmer. He made his debut, as \\"Chri$ Ca$h\\", at September Slam on September 8, 2001, in a three-way dance with GQ and Ian Knoxx, which Knoxx won. At They Said It Couldn't Be Done... Again on September 22, the three wrestlers were involved in a rematch, which Ca$h won. In another rematch a week later at Enough is Enough, GQ won. At And Justice For All in October, Ca$h teamed with GQ to defeat Knoxx and Chris Stylez in a tag team match. He began regularly teaming with GQ as \\"The New School\\", including an appearance at Cage of Death III when they competed in a three-way tag team match, which also included Knoxx and Stylez, and was won by VD (Jon Dahmer and Eddie Valentine). =2002= The start of 2002, however, saw Ca$h and GQ engage in a scripted rivalry, trading victories. Their third match at Out With Old In With The New in March went to a no contest, and afterwards, neither Ca$h nor GQ appeared for CZW for over four months. When they returned on July 13 at Deja Vu, it was as a team, defeating the teams of VD, Ian Knoxx and A.J. Styles, and Hurricane Kid and Towel Boy to earn a match for the CZW World Tag Team Championship later that night, which they lost to the defending champions, H8 Club. They continued teaming over the next few months, facing teams including Sonjay Dutt and Derek Frazier, The Backseat Boyz, and the Softcore Connection. On September 28 at Sanctioned in Blood, Ca$h defeated Ruckus and Sonjay Dutt in a ladder match. This signalled Ca$h's first major foray into singles competition, taking on Ruckus, Dutt and Jody Fleisch in both singles and three-way matches. At the end of 2002, Ca$h won the CZW award for finishing move of the year. =2003= In 2003, Ca$h began challenging for the CZW World Junior Heavyweight Championship, losing to Dutt in a number one contenders match in January. In Dutt's match for the championship against Ruckus, however, Ca$h was the special referee, and he attacked both wrestlers, before declaring the match a no contest. A match Ca$h then had with Ruckus then ended in a double disqualification, before he competed in the Best of the Best 3 tournament, where he was eliminated in the first round. On May 10, Ca$h unsuccessfully challenged Ruckus for the Junior Heavyweight Championship, before returning to his feud with GQ, that saw Ca$h lose a singles match to GQ, before eliminating him from a gauntlet match. On October 4 at Pain in the Rain 2, Ca$h attempted to help Nick Gage, who was being attacked by Nate Hatred and Trent Acid, but ended up being powerbombed over the ring ropes through a table to the floor. Ca$h then took a hiatus from CZW, returning at Cage of Death V in December, to face Joker in a ladder match, which he lost. The match, which was originally supposed to be a tag team match also involving Deranged and Azriael but was changed as Deranged and Azireal were not at the arena in time, was later described as \\"absolutely psychotic\\", and it was the match that began to get Ca$h mainstream attention. =2004-2005= In 2004 began with a loss for Ca$h in a four-way tables and ladders match at the Street Fight 2K4 show, which was won by Sabian, and in which Joker and Ruckus also participated. After the match, Sabian and Ruckus attacked Ca$h and Joker, setting up a tag team match for the next show. Ca$h and Joker lost the match after Joker turned on Ca$h and attacked him until Jimmy Jacobs and Dutt saved him. This resulted in a six-man tag team elimination tables match at Overdrive in March, which Ruckus, Joker and Sabian won after eliminating all the members of the other team, Ca$h, Jacobs and Dutt. Ca$h continued competing for CZW during the summer, alternately teaming with or facing GQ. He also competed in the Best of the Best IV tournament, but was eliminated in the first round. At Tournament of Death Ca$h competed in his first deathmatch, losing to JC Bailey. In September, Ca$h won a match allowing him to pick the members of a team for Cage of Death VI. This was followed by CZW owner John Zandig that Ca$h would be the captain of one of the team in the Cage of Death match, and Ca$h chose Bailey as his first team member. At the following show, Breaking Point: Let the Kaos Begin, Ca$h and Bailey won a CZW World Tag Team Championship match against The Blackout after winning a tag team gauntlet match. They originally won the match, but the decision was reversed once it was determined that Ca$h, who had made the pin, was not the legal man. At Cage of Death VI, Team Ca$h, consisting of Ca$h, Bailey, Nate Webb, and SeXXXy Eddy, defeated Team Blackout, which consisted of Ruckus, Sabian, Eddie Kingston, and Jack Evans, to win CZW World Tag Team Championship. The match contained a number of spots which were later described as \\"the psychotic daredevil spots for which Cash was known throughout his all- too-short career\\", including a spot where Ca$h performed his finishing move on Sabian off of the scaffolding surrounding the cage through four tables to land in the second row of the audience. After a successful title defense against Excalibur and Super Dragon, Team Ca$h, consisting of Ca$h and Nate Webb, lost the championship to the H8 Club (Nick Gage and Justice Pain) at Only the Strong: Scarred for Life in February. This championship loss was his last match in CZW, as he had been scheduled to wrestle JC Bailey for the CZW Ultraviolent Underground Championship in March, but was forced to pull out of the match after an automobile accident. He did not make his return to CZW before his death in August. Death On August 18, 2005, Bauman was killed as the result of a motorcycle accident near his home. He had been the passenger on a motorcycle driven by his cousin, 27-year-old Jeremy Bauman of Franklinville, New Jersey. A Ford Taurus turned in front of the motorcycle, causing it to strike the car on the driver's side of the vehicle, which was driven by Daisy Gwin of Glassboro, New Jersey. Bauman and his cousin both died at the scene. Gwin died en route to Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Washington Township, NJ.

He is a superhero appearing as the counterpart of the superhero Iron Man in the (then) future year of 2020 set in the multiverse world of Earth-8410. Publication history Iron Man 2020 first appeared in the second issue of the Machine Man limited series (1984) and was created by Tom DeFalco and Herb Trimpe. Fictional character biography Arno is Tony Stark's future first cousin once removed, and the unscrupulous Morgan Stark's son. Arno inherited the company Stark Industries. Rather than use the armor for heroic deeds, he prefers to act as a hired mercenary or commit acts of corporate espionage to cripple his competitors for industrialist gain.Machine Man 2020 #2. Marvel Comics. In his original appearance, the Iron Man of 2020 was employed by Sunset Bain (as an old woman) to destroy Machine Man who had been accidentally discovered and subsequently reactivated by the Midnight Wreckers, rebellious youths who scavenged discarded technology. Despite ostensibly superior power, Iron Man was defeated by the furious Machine Man who went on to claim \\"I'm a better man than you.\\"Machine Man 2020 #3. Marvel Comics. In another story, Arno's factory is infiltrated by Robert Saunders, a heavily scarred man who starts a countdown on a powerful bomb of Stark's design, threatening Stark's wife and son (trapped in the factory) and the surrounding city. The only way to deactivate the device is with a retinal scan of Saunders, but Saunders is killed and his body destroyed while trying to escape. To get the scan data, Stark travels back in time to the \\"present\\" (i.e. 1986, when the story was publishedAmazing Spider-Man Annual #20. Marvel Comics.) to find Saunders as a child. He is soon mistaken for the \\"current\\" Iron Man (Tony Stark) and attacked by one of Tony's enemies Blizzard (Gregor Shapanka). Arno, knowing his time in the 20th century is limited, kills Blizzard and continues his search for the young Saunders. This draws the attention of Spider-Man who also mistakes Arno for Tony and further mistakes Arno's attempts to get a retinal scan from Saunders as an attack on the boy. While protecting Saunders, Spider-Man evades various attempts by Arno to get hold of the boy, while Arno becomes increasingly desperate as his time in the 20th century nears its end. One of Arno's attacks seriously injures Saunders; the scars Arno inflicted would eventually lead Saunders's vengeance-minded future self to sabotage Arno's factory, thus Arno unwittingly creates the situation he traveled back in time to resolve and Spider-Man is sufficiently angered to directly attack the much more powerful Arno. Surprised by the assault and overwhelmed by Spider-Man's far greater speed, Arno's armor is significantly damaged. When he is pulled back to his own time, he finds himself standing in the center of a huge crater, having returned too late to prevent the bomb's detonation and the destruction of his family, factory and city. A later appearance has Iron Man 2020 fight the time- traveling cyborg Death's Head.Death's Head #10. Marvel Comics. Iron Man 2020 also had his own one-shot in June 1994, in which he faces off against an industrial rival who seeks to use him to destroy all his competitors all at once, sacrificing his own daughter in the process. At the end of the story, Arno and the girl Melodi get together, suggesting an evolution towards a more heroic role again. Meanwhile, the background character Howard is revealed (if only to the reader) to be the aged Tony himself who intends to guide his young cousin.Iron Man 2020 graphic novel. Marvel Comics.

Powers and abilities Iron Man 2020 wears a suit of highly sophisticated armor, similar in appearance to the classic Iron Man armor (circa Model 5), with the exception of the faceplate and shoulders. Beam weapons are fitted in the gauntlets of the suit, as well as the chest beam and shoulder epaulets. The user no longer requires a cybernetic link in the helmet to control the armor; the helmet can also be hidden via cloaking technology, which was presumably developed based on the Chameleon mode of the Silver Centurion armor. Iron Man 2020's systems are built for warfare, not super heroics like the original Iron Man. Iron Man 2020's repulsors (and an arsenal of other weapons) always fire at maximum power for the most lethal effects. Curiously, Iron Man 2020 also has the original Iron Man's 1970s-era rollerskates (updated to a \\"roller blade\\" style (see ASM Annual #20)) built into the boots of the suit.

Patch testing helps identify which substances may be causing a delayed-type allergic reaction in a patient, and may identify allergens not identified by blood testing or skin prick testing. It is intended to produce a local allergic reaction on a small area of the patient's back, where the diluted chemicals were planted. The chemicals included in the patch test kit are the offenders in approximately 85‚Äì90 percent of contact allergic eczema, and include chemicals present in metals (e.g., nickel), rubber, leather, formaldehyde, lanolin, fragrance, toiletries, hair dyes, medicine, pharmaceutical items, food, drink, preservative, and other additives.  Mechanism  A patch test relies on the principle of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The first step in becoming allergic is sensitization. When skin is exposed to an allergen, the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) ‚Äì also known as Langerhans cell or Dermal Dendritic Cell ‚Äì phagocytize the substance, break it down to smaller components and present them on their surface bound major histocompatibility complex type two (MHC-II) molecules. The APC then travels to a lymph node, where it presents the displayed allergen to a CD4+ T-cell, or T-helper cell. The T-cell undergoes clonal expansion and some clones of the newly formed antigen specific sensitized T-cells travel back to the site of antigen exposure. When the skin is again exposed to the antigen, the memory t-cells in the skin recognize the antigen and produce cytokines (chemical signals), which cause more T-cells to migrate from blood vessels. This starts a complex immune cascade leading to skin inflammation, itching, and the typical rash of contact dermatitis.In general, it takes 2‚Äì4 days for a response in patch testing to develop. The patch test is just induction of a contact dermatitis in a small area. Process Application of the patch tests takes about half an hour, though many times the overall appointment time is longer as the provider will take an extensive history. Tiny quantities of 25 to ~150 materials (allergens) in individual square plastic or round aluminium chambers are applied to the upper back. They are kept in place with special hypoallergenic adhesive tape. The patches stay in place undisturbed for at least 48 hours. Vigorous exercise or stretching may disrupt the test.At the second appointment, usually 48 hours later, the patches are removed. Sometimes additional patches are applied. The back is marked with an indelible black felt tip pen or other suitable marker to identify the test sites, and a preliminary reading is done. These marks must be visible at the third appointment, usually 24‚Äì48 hours later (72‚Äì96 hours after application). In some cases, a reading at 7 days may be requested, especially if a special metal series is tested.  Interpretation of results  The dermatologist or allergist will complete a record form at the second and third appointments (usually 48 and 72/96 hour readings). The result for each test site is recorded. One system used is as follows: Weak positive Strong positive * Negative (-) * Irritant reaction (IR) * Equivocal / uncertain (+/-) * Weak positive (+) * Strong positive (++) * Extreme reaction (+++) Irritant reactions include miliaria (sweat rash), follicular pustules, and burn-like reactions. Uncertain reactions refer to a pink area under the test chamber. Weak positives are slightly elevated pink or red plaques, usually with mild vesiculation. Strong positives are ‚Äòpapulovesicles‚Äô and extreme reactions have spreading redness, severe itching, and blisters or ulcers. Relevance is determined by exposure to the positive allergen(s), and is rated as definite, probable, possible, past, or unknown. For an allergen to have definite relevance, the product the patient is exposed to must be tested and also be positive in addition to the test allergen. Probable would be used to describe a positive allergen ingredient which is in a product the patient uses (i.e., quaternium-15 listed in a moisturizing cream used on the sites of dermatitis). Interpretation of the results requires considerable experience and training. A positive patch test might not explain the present skin problem, since the test only indicates that the individual became allergic during encounters with that chemical at some point in their life. Relevance, therefore, has to be established by determining the causal relationship between the positive test and the eczema. The confirmation of relevance will occur after the patient has avoided exposure to the chemical and after he has noticed that the improvement or clearance of his dermatitis is directly related to this avoidance. This outcome usually occurs within four to six weeks after stopping the exposure to the chemical. If all patch tests are negative, the allergic reaction is probably not due to an allergic reaction to a contactant. It is possible, however, that the patient was not tested for other chemicals that can produce allergic reactions on rare occasions. If the suspicion is high in spite of negative patch testing, further investigation might be required.  Common allergens  The top allergens from 2005‚Äì06 were: nickel sulfate (19.0%), Myroxylon pereirae (Balsam of Peru, 11.9%), fragrance mix I (11.5%), quaternium-15 (10.3%), neomycin (10.0%), bacitracin (9.2%), formaldehyde (9.0%), cobalt chloride (8.4%), methyldibromoglutaronitrile/phenoxyethanol (5.8%), p-phenylenediamine (5.0%), potassium dichromate (4.8%), carba mix (3.9%), thiuram mix (3.9%), diazolidinyl urea (3.7%), and 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol (3.4%).Zug KA, Warshaw EM, Fowler JF Jr, Maibach HI, Belsito DL, Pratt MD, Sasseville D, Storrs FJ, Taylor JS, Mathias CG, Deleo VA, Rietschel RL, Marks J. Patch-test results of the North American Contact Dermatitis Group 2005‚Äì2006. Dermatitis. 2009 May‚ÄìJun;20(3):149-60. The most frequent allergen recorded in many research studies around the world is nickel. Nickel allergy is more prevalent in young women, and is especially associated with ear piercing or any nickel- containing watch, belt, zipper, or jewelry. Other common allergens are surveyed in North America by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG).  Food allergy  Dermatologists may refer a patient with a suspected food allergy for patch testing. Foods identified by blood testing or skin prick testing may or may not overlap with foods identified by patch testing. Certain food additives and flavorings can cause allergic reactions around and in the mouth, around the anus and vulva as food allergens pass out of the body, or cause a widespread rash on the skin. Allergens such as nickel, Balsam of Peru, parabens, sodium benzoate, or cinnamic aldehyde may worsen or cause skin rashes. Foods that cause urticaria (hives) or anaphylaxis (such as peanuts) cause a type I hypersensitivity reaction whereby the part of the food molecule is directly recognized by cells close to the skin, called mast cells. Mast cells have antibodies on their surface called immunoglobulin E (IgE). These act as receptors, and if they recognize the allergen, they release their contents, causing an immediate allergic reaction. Type I reactions like anaphylaxis are immediate and do not take 2 to 4 days to appear. In a study of patients with chronic hives who were patch tested, those who were found allergic and avoided all contact with their allergen, including dietary intake, stopped having hives. Those who started eating their allergen again had recurrence of their hives.Guerra L, Rogkakou A, Massacane P, Gamalero C, Compalati E, Zanella C, Scordamaglia A, Canonica WG, Passalacqua G.

Its original western terminus was located near downtown Russellville, and its eastern terminus was originally located about west of Burkesville on KY 90. It originally went through unincorporated small communities such as Leslie and Arat. However, at some time between 1945 and 1958, KY 100's final few miles and its eastern terminus were both rerouted to its current location with another intersection with KY 90 at Waterview, further west of Burkesville. KY 1205 and most of KY 691 are the current designations for the original KY 100 ending. The remaining parts of the original alignment in western Cumberland County are either no longer existing (especially the originally unpaved section) or it still does, but is now maintained by the Cumberland County Road Department. In 2015, KY 100's western terminus was re-located to end at the crossroads intersection with U.S. Route 68 and US 68 Business on the east side of Russellville. This was done to reduce car accidents at the original west terminus, which was also where US 79's northern terminus was originally located.

She was the lead vocalist of the proto-punk rock bands Destroy All Monsters (DAM) and Dark Carnival. Her painting derives principally from the Lowbrow art movement. Career At the University of Michigan, Niagara founded Destroy All Monsters in 1974 with fellow art students Mike Kelley and Jim Shaw and Filmmaker Cary Loren. DAM remained active until 1985, with former members of The Stooges and the MC5 on board. Niagara soon after fronted the group Dark Carnival (with guitarist Ron Asheton and drummer Scott Asheton‚Äîboth recruited from The Stooges). In 2004, Classic Rock and Rock & Folk magazines named Niagara one of the \\"100 Greatest Front Men.\\"Great Female Artists of Detroit, Suzanne Bilek, The History Press, 2012, p. 106, She was also one of two centrefolds for Punk Magazine along with Debbie Harry. In 2014, Niagara was the inspiration for a project in March 2014 British Vogue, Cause C√©l√®bre, produced by Kate Moss in which model Daria Werbowy stands in for Niagara. Visual Art \\"Pills That Mother Gives You Don't Do Anything At All\\", acrylic on canvas Niagara paints with acrylic on canvas. With her use of bright colors, caricature portrayal of figures, and comic strip inclusion of words spoken by the figures, Niagara's style can loosely be described as Pop Art. The cartoon and comic panel style was famously utilized by painter Roy Lichtenstein, also a touchstone for her work. Her early 1970s work with collage, Xerox prints, and promotional materials for Destroy All Monsters influenced her later painting style; the bold, figurative images are evidence of that. The \\"lowbrow\\" aesthetic epitomized by the painter Robert Williams, which evolved in Southern California in the 1970s, also influenced her. Aside from overt Pop Art stylistic tropes, Niagara also incorporates influences of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, which with some friction honored both Romanticism and Realism and depicted strong if not tragic women such as the famous Ophelia by Millais, or The Blue Bower by Rossetti. She also took cues from the Decadent movement, which was in turn influenced by Gothic fiction. Art Nouveau imprints her work with its swirling, floral-inspired, whiplash lines and the belle √©poque women of Toulouse-Lautrec. As a child, Niagara was enamored of John R. Neill who illustrated works by L. Frank Baum and others. Niagara told Swindle magazine, > The first art style that I identified with was Art Nouveau. Then I > discovered Decadent Art (1850s-era England), the Pre-Raphaelite movement: > haunted, pale, druggy women. I read constantly. I was deep into Dostoyevsky > and Dickens. Colette. The best are the writers that can turn a phrase > devastatingly funny. The witticisms and bon mots of Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, > Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Dorothy Parker. Andy Warhol was a riot. > That's probably why I have captions in my paintings. I want the women in my > paintings to speak. Music =Destroy All Monsters= With Destroy All Monsters, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, spring 1982 Destroy All Monsters was a band started in 1974 by University of Michigan art students Niagara on vocals; Mike Kelley on drums and vocals; Jim Shaw on vocals and squeeze toys; and Cary Loren on guitar and vocals. This proto-noise-band was the first pure noise-band according to music historian and Sonic Youth band member, Thurston Moore, who said, \\"I can find no earlier example of such primitive playing with the use of non-instruments.\\" In 1994, drawing from early rehearsal and performance tapes, Moore released a three disc box set of these seminal basement recordings, \\"DAM 1974-1976\\" on his music label Ecstatic Peace. Ron Asheton with Niagara The original line up of musicians was not around long. In 1977, Niagara met ex-Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton, and he became her paramour. Ron thought the band's music had potential. To realize that potential, he recruited Michael Davis (ex-MC5 bassist), a real powerhouse crucial for rock bottom percussive bass. Davis, recently released from prison, was available and agreed to be part of the band. Next hired was Rob King on drums. King's drums were precise, fast and powerful, an unusual combination. Next the Miller brothers were added, Ben on saxophone, and Larry on guitar, both accomplished musicians with a punk-jazz pedigree. Destroy All Monsters band poster Niagara with snake The local media, including the Detroit Free Press, and The Detroit News attended early shows and gave prominent coverage to the \\"events,\\" as the press referred to them. Lester Bangs wrote about \\"Destroy All Monsters\\" affectionately in CREEM magazine . Even Rolling Stone took notice with articles and interviews about the new punk phenomenon, \\"Niagara is strange on stage, almost like she was awakened from a deep slumber and is surprised to find herself on stage.\\" Spin Magazine described Niagara's stage presence as, \\"A thrift store Nico in a bloody gown.\\" Accounts of Niagara falling off stage were numerous. Yet, Niagara seemed blessed with nine lives, and someone always caught her, including the MC5's Rob Tyner at the Kramer Theater, \\"I saved Niagara's life!\\" After a brief European tour four singles were produced in this early Punk era: \\"Bored,\\" \\"You're Gonna Die,\\" \\"What Do I Get?\\" and \\"Nobody Knows.\\" The Monsters soon hooked up with the Ramones and The Dead Boys. The band members became fast friends and touring buddies. When in New York, The Dead Boys or Ramones would open, In Cleveland or Detroit, DAM got top billing. This led to many famous pairings with shows at Max's Kansas City and CBGB's in New York, The Agora Ballroom in Cleveland, Bookies in Detroit and Second Chance in Ann Arbor. The punk incarnation of the band lasted from 1977 to 1985. =Dark Carnival= Dark Carnival band poster featuring Niagara In 1984, Niagara met Detroit music promoter and impresario Colonel Galaxy. The Colonel's ambitious project, Dark Carnival, had the original concept of a performance art troop that borrowed heavily from the Stooges, MC5, Velvet Underground blueprint. The Colonel found that with one player from each of a dozen Detroit punk bands he could create a \\"super group\\" and control them, (much like Colonel Tom Parker did with Elvis, hence his moniker, \\"The Colonel\\"). Bootsey X from the Lovemasters was the first member signed, then Mark Norton from the RamRods, Gary Adams from The Cubes, Mike McFeaters from What Jane Shared, Jerry Vile from The Boners, Sarana VerLin from Natasha, Greasy Carlisi from Motor City Bad Boys, Robert Gordon and Art Lyzak from The Mutants, Joe Hayden from Bugs Bedow, Pete Bankert from Weapons, Larry Steel from The Cult Heroes. Later Dark Carnival saw some turnover, with the \\"big\\" names signing on: Niagara from Destroy All Monsters, Ron and Scott Asheton from the Stooges, Cheetah Chrome from the Dead Boys, Jim Carroll even came in from New York. Niagara fell for the Colonel and they got married in 1986. The revolving Vaudeville-like assembly evolved into a battle-hardened, proto-punk outfit, which included Niagara, Ron Asheton, Scott Asheton, and Greasy Carlisi. This band toured the US, Canada, and Australia twice between the years 1984-2000. John Holmstrom of Punk Magazine says, \\"Dark Carnival produced some of the best pure Punk music I've ever heard and did it longer than anyone, Niagara's been singing for 20 years and still looks exactly the same!\\" =The Hitmen= Niagara and the Hitmen Australian tour 2012 with Chris Masuak (Radio Birdman) and Brad Davis (Hoodoo Gurus) on guitars When Niagara and Dark Carnival toured Australia in 1991 she befriended members of Dark Carnival's infamous opening band, The Hitmen. Based in Sydney Australia, The Hitmen were fixtures of the Australian musical landscape. Their elite membership read like a Who's Who in the Australian punk rock community. With members such as Deniz Tek from Radio Birdman, The New Christs, and Screaming Tribesmen, The Hitmen knew well the elusive Detroit sound Niagara was after. Other members of The Hitmen included world-famous guitarist Chris Masuak, Tony Jukic on rhythm guitar, Tony Robertson on bass, and Murray Shepherd on drums. Murray's brother Brad Shepherd, lead guitarist of the Hoodoo Gurus, also played on the tour's final show. Later, when Niagara decided to form a band and tour Australia, nobody was better than The Hitmen to back her, since these music veterans really knew how to rally an audience with their unique mixture of high-octane punk and \\"airborne Oz\\" guitar playing. Two tours resulted from this pairing. Twenty shows were played in 2008 and 2010. The CD \\"Saint Valentine's Day Massacre,\\" on Steel Cage Records is a powerhouse recording of these sessions. At present, The Hitmen are planning a European tour in 2014, now that guitarist Chris Masuak has relocated to Madrid and is more centrally located for a European onslaught. Art career \\"This Is For Your Bad Manners\\", acrylic on canvas, Niagara Niagara applied her art school experience to create album and promotional art for early Destroy All Monsters performances. Combining an illustrator's hand with some collage and pop iconography Niagara collaborated with the others using a then cutting-edge Xerox printer to create the first Proto-Punk gig flyers. These flyers utilized found image collage with ironic and humorous intent. Niagara's style began to take shape in earnest during the later DAM incarnation with Ron Asheton, creating flyers and album art and by the early 1990s she began to show paintings in small exhibits and cafes around the Detroit area. In 1996, Niagara teamed up with the Royal Oak, Michigan art space ¬©POP Gallery. Her first exhibits All Men Are Cremated Equal (1996) and Faster Niagara, Kill ... Kill (1997) were breakout shows, which garnered her regional praise. Soon art periodicals such as Juxtapoz heralded her as \\"The Queen Of Detroit\\" and many successful exhibits would follow in other cities like Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris, Manchester UK, and Tokyo. In 2004, ¬©POP invited her to curate a show entitled The Funhouse Art Show, which featured work by her music business associates Iggy Pop, Ron and Scott Asheton, Lou Reed, and others. That same year, she published Beyond the Pale, an autobiographical review of her career. In 2006 Niagara had her first UK exhibition at Richard Goodall Gallery in Manchester England. Niagara premiered a full clothing line with the avant-garde couturier Hysteric Glamour to coincide with her opening in Tokyo in 2007. Also unveiled in 2008 was Niagara's collaboration with Vans. The result was Vans Vault series that featured seven unique styles of popular urban footwear based on Niagara designs which debuted in Paris 2008. Niagara returned to Richard Goodall Gallery in 2008 for The Good, The Bad, & The Beautiful. Outr√© Gallery in Australia also produced a set of Niagara silk-screened limited edition prints to coincide with Niagara's sold out shows in Sydney and Melbourne in 2008. In 2009 Niagara took the stage full-time with Dark Carnival tours in Australia, Europe, and United States. In 2007, Rick Manore, co-founder of ¬©POP, said of Niagara, \\"She's as big as Bill Murray in Japan right now. Thousands of goth Lolitas in Tokyo alone are wearing her face, artwork and photos all over themselves, thanks to her deal with the fashion house, Hysteric Glamour. Last year, she circumnavigated the Pacific rim with exhibits in San Francisco and Sydney.\\" Return of the Repressed: Destroy All Monsters 1973-1977, a retrospective DAM exhibition curated by Mike Kelley and Dan Nadel, featured the singular and collaborative work of Mike Kelley, Jim Shaw, Carey Loren and Niagara. The show opened at PRISM in Los Angeles on November 19, 2011 and ran through January 7, 2012. A catalog published by PRISM and PictureBox, edited by Mike Kelley and Dan Nadel with an essay by Nicole Rudick accompanied the exhibition. In July 2012, Niagara exhibited her first Detroit show in 6 years, War Paint at Re:View Contemporary Gallery. \\"Blast Off Nurse\\", acrylic on canvas, \\"War Paint\\" series, Niagara, 2012 \\"Treat 'Em Rough Boys\\", acrylic on canvas, \\"War Paint\\" series, Niagara, 2012 In 2014 Niagara was the inspiration for a project in March 2014 British Vogue, Cause C√©l√®bre, produced by Kate Moss in which model Daria Werbowy stands in for Niagara.

Biography Francisco Javier Mina was born in Otao, Navarre, to Juan Mina, a wealthy farmer, and Maria Larrea. Mina studied Latin, mathematics, and humanities at the local seminary, while living in Pamplona with his uncle and aunt, Clemente and Simona Espoz. At the age of 18, he left Otao to continue his education in Zaragoza, where he began studying law at the university. During the Peninsular War in early 1808, Spain was under occupation by French troops, prompting Mina to flee to the hills and forests of his native region. There he formed a guerrilla force of ten men. Under his leadership, the force grew to over 200 men. Mina launched raids on the French and succeeded in capturing arms, ammunition, and horses. These additional resources allowed Mina to expand his small army to over 1,200 men and 150 mounted cavalry. Finding new strength in these numbers, he began to engage in full-scale military actions. Mina was captured in March 1810 and sent to Vincennes prison in France. He was finally released in April 1814, concurrent with the collapse of Napoleon's government. On returning to Spain he was made a colonel of the Navarre Hussars by King Ferdinand VII. However, Mina didn't sympathize with the King, because he had abolished the democratic government created under the Constitution of 1812. After a planned coup against the King failed, Mina fled to France; from Bayona he traveled to England where he met Servando Teresa de Mier. Servando Teresa de Mier recruited him to fight the absolute monarchy of Ferdinand VII in his colonies. [The article about de Mier says that Mina was the one doing the convincing.] A few English lords made Mina's voyage to America possible. In May 1816, 20 Spanish officers and an Italian and English crew left Liverpool. After arriving in Baltimore in the United States, Mina met with a group of Spanish American agents there to organize the expedition. Manuel Torres, Miguel Santamaria and Jos√© Rafael Revenga helped organize funding from a group of Baltimore merchants, while Pedro Gual acted as his press agent. In September Mina sailed on two ships. First, Mina and his crew sailed from Baltimore to Puerto Principe, Haiti, and from Puerto Principe to Galveston, Nueva Espa√±a, where they arrived November 24. He then moved to what is now the nation of Mexico. In April 1817, Mina took a force of about 250 men southward in ships provided by the French privateer, Louis-Michel Aury. They arrived at Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas. His plan was to join the southern Mexican revolutionaries led by Guadalupe Victoria and others. Mina fully engaged in the struggle for Mexican independence. On May 24, 1817, Mina left his base with 300 men, moving to several villages on his way to Fuerte del Sombrero, a fortification defended by Pedro Moreno. Mina published a letter stating that he was fighting the King's tyranny and not the Spanish empire. On August 1, marshal Pascual Li√±√°n arrived at the fort with a powerful army. Mina escaped to Fuerte de los Remedios to help Jos√© Antonio Torres. In October 1817, Mina was captured and Pedro Moreno was killed, at El Venadito ranch. The prisoner was presented to Colonel Orrantia who took him to Silao. Eventually, Mina was sent to the marshal Pascual Li√±√°n. On November 11, 1817, Mina was executed by a firing squad on a hill close to the Fuerte de los Remedios region of the Sierra de P√©njamo, by the Zaragoza battalion. He was 28 years old. Legacy Mart√≠n Francisco Javier Mina y Larrea should not be confused with his successor and distant relative Francisco Espoz Ilund√°in, generally known at the time as Francisco Espoz y Mina, a nom de guerre that he took in an effort to associate himself with the triumphs of his predecessor. Mina, a municipality of the northeastern Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n, formerly named San Francisco de Ca√±as, was renamed on 31 March 1851 in honor of Francisco Javier Mina. In the 1830s, a town in colonial Texas was renamed Mina; but a few years later (after the Texas Revolution), the name was changed back to Bastrop. General Francisco Javier Mina International Airport or (IATA: TAM, ICAO: MMTM) is an international airport named after him, located at Tampico.

Career: Writer \\" Life Joan Marshall was born 12 April 1907, at London, England, daughter of John Frederick Marshall and Blanche Emily Hughes. Joan Marshall's father, a wealthy man, was of dual US-British nationality‚Äîa prizewinning tennis player who at one point won his place in the semi-finals of the World Championship for each country, and thus needed to play against himself. A serious amateur entomologist, he also carried out at his own expense valuable pioneering work on the Anopheles mosquito for which purpose he had installed a full research unit on Hayling Island.Far Memory. Grant, Joan. Ariel Press. 1956/2002 Joan Marshall spent her early years on Hayling Island in Hampshire. She remembered being a lively, determined girl. She was trained in ballet, until an injury ended the pursuit. She learned tennis, and as a young woman won the Hampshire Ladies Golf finals, claiming she had never before played golf. She also described herself as an excellent, and risk- taking, horsewoman.Far Memory. Grant, Joan. Ariel Press. 1956/2002 Joan said that she learned aspects of science by assisting her father with his entomological research. H.G. Wells was a friend of Joan's father whom Joan remembered as an admirer and sometime mentor. Joan described her mother as having had second-sight visions. Joan herself said she experienced parapsychological phenomena from young girlhood, which sensitivity was recognized not only by herself but by friends, who often told her it was eerie.Far Memory. Grant, Joan. Ariel Press. 1956/2002 Though raised in genteel circumstances, Joan considered herself plucky and resourceful enough in her adult years to admirably adapt and live through some harsh periods of deprivation and patches of genuine calamity in Iraq.Far Memory. Grant, Joan. Ariel Press. 1956/2002 She married Leslie Grant on 30 November 1927. Leslie Grant had studied for a career in law, but became excited by the adventitious opportunity to join an archaeological dig as a photographer documenting the uncovering of Ancient Egyptian structures and artifacts in Iraq. Joan joined him there, later remembering temperature extremes and violent dust storms and under remote and starkly primitive conditions.Far Memory. Grant, Joan. Ariel Press. 1956/2002 Joan married Charles Beatty, 14 March 1940 (however, she retained the name \\"Joan Grant\\" as her nom de plume). Beatty was also a writer, first manager of the Montague Motor Museum in Beaulieu and one of the first announcers on Radio Luxembourg. He transcribed some of Joan Grant's earlier books from a wire voice recorder. Joan married Denys Kelsey on 1 September 1960. Denys Kelsey had had a career as a practising psychiatrist. In the course of his work Kelsey had come to believe in a human soul. He used hypnosis when working with patients. Joan apparently convinced him to believe in Reincarnation and in her psychic abilities. Apparently he would sometimes ask her to use her paranormal gifts to help in the analysis of especially challenging psychological and psychosomatic clients. Novels Her first and most famous novel was Winged Pharaoh (1937). Grant shot to unexpected fame upon publication. The New York Times hailed it as \\"A book of fine idealism, deep compassion and a spiritual quality pure and bright as flame\\", a sentiment echoed in reviews published elsewhere in the world. What her readers did not officially know, for almost another twenty years, was that Joan claimed to have recalled the events in Winged Pharaoh while in a hypnotic or trance-like state, dictating piecemeal the lifetime that she believed herself to have lived. The book is still considered a cult classic in so-called New Age literature. It was followed by other historical fantasies, or as Grant called them, \\"Far Memory books,\\" or \\"previous life autobiographies\\". Winged Pharaoh was initially accepted as a novel. Grant was consciously aware of many details of Egyptian history, having accompanied her first husband on his Egyptian expeditions. Occultists embraced it as an autobiography of a previous existence. Historians claimed that the calendar used in the book had never existed and also that there was no evidence whatsoever for the existence of an \\"avenue of trees\\" referred to in the book. Supposedly, after World War II a text was found which, when translated, proved to be the calendar referred to by Grant in the 1937 book. Reincarnationism Grant believed she had been reincarnated at least forty times and that her far memory of past lives provided her the base material for her historical novels. She strove to disabuse herself and her readers of preconceptions, to eschew what she called 'group-think'. She was not interested in blind faith and blind belief, but in what could be perceived as true by the five senses. She claimed to have an unusual gift of \\"far memory\\" ‚Äì the ability to remember previous lives, and something she referred to as \\"sensory awareness\\". She said that she experienced many realities that are not available to most people. A collection of previously unknown writings by Grant was published as Speaking from the Heart: Ethics, Reincarnation & What it Means to Be Human in 2007 by Overlook Press in the United States and Duckworth Press in the UK. It was edited by her granddaughter Nicola Bennett, with anthologist Jane Lahr and Joan's closest friend Sophia Rosoff. The book contains poetry, essays and a series of lectures she gave at Edgar Cayce's Association for Research and Enlightenment in Virginia Beach. She had a reputation for talking and writing with clear certainty about her belief in other realities, past lives, and death. She said that for her, the veil between the \\"worlds\\" simply did not exist. With her third husband, Denys Kelsey, she wrote Many Lifetimes, in which she explained how she supposedly remembered her own and others' past lives. She also wrote several children's books which contain stories she claimed she was told in past lives. Some of her books were published under the names Joan M. Grant and Joan Marshall Grant. Her books have been translated and published in many languages.

The album features a cleaner and more technical sound with a more psychedelic rock feel, in contrast to the sloppy punk approach of their first album (1982), while continuing with the mystical, poetic lyrics and country- inflected songwriting of Meat Puppets II (1984). Background Brothers Curt and Cris Kirkwood were interested in psychedelic rock. The pair often indulged in recreational drug use with Derrick Bostrom, who came from an affluent, politically liberal family in Arizona and who introduced them to punk rock. During a trip to Los Angeles the group got into the underground post-punk scene there. Joe Carducci invited the group to join SST Records, a record label associated with the early hardcore punk scene and home to Black Flag. The Meat Puppets first EP In a Car (1981) and first seven albums appeared through SST. Meat Puppets (1981) featured fast-paced thrash punk mixed with psychedelic rock and country laden with guitar feedback and Curt screamed vocals. The group soon tired of hardcore; Meat Puppets II was slower and more emotional with psychedelic guitar effects and mystical, poetic lyrics by Curt. The release of Meat Puppets II was delayed until 1984, a peak year for SST which also saw the release of H√ºsker D√º's Zen Arcade, Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime, and numerous albums by Black Flag who due to legal issues had not been able to release an album since 1981's Damaged. The Meat Puppets supported Meat Puppets II with a tour along with Black Flag and The Nig-Heist, where the band's long hair and jam-band approach displeased audiences. Recording and release As with the band's previous album, recording took place at Total Access Studios in Redondo Beach, California, with production by SST's house engineer Spot. They recorded from January 26 to 28, 1985, and SST released the album that March. The lyrics were printed with the liner notes, unbroken into the songs' stanzas. Curt Kirkwood used a Rockman amplifier to produce a clean guitar sound. Curt made the painting for the cover: a mug with a picture of a marijuana plant on it. Rykodisc brought the Up on the Sun back into print in 1999, along with the Meat Puppets's six other SST albums. Bonus tracks on the rerelease include a version of \\"Hot Pink\\" that incorporates a lengthy improvised jam. Reception and legacy To reviewer Fayette Hickox the Meat Puppets \\"deserve a legion\\" like the Deadheads‚Äîthe faithful Grateful Dead fans‚Äîand the album \\"incorporate[s] ... seeming contradictions The band's hardcore past rattles beneath the surface of an almost folksy ingenuousness.\\" In his Consumer Guide in The Village Voice Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and wrote, \\"Curt Kirkwood is the David Thomas of endearing sloppiness. ... Curt's guitars not so much chim[e] as chatter in a nonchalantly unstylish take on neofolk lyricism. ... the music's charms are a little too flaccid to hold up the most unabashedly lysergic worldview yet to emerge from postpunk\\". Gregg Turner in a review in Creem denigrated Curt's vocals as \\"like a sick dog begging for food\\" and the production for failing to capture the quality of the band's live sound. He judged the material was \\"not all that riveting\\". A People review called Curt's guitarwork \\"strikingly inventive and mellifluous\\" while finding his vocals and the production unimpressive and found the band an acquired taste. The band toured in support of the album throughout most of 1985, after which they followed up with a six-track EP titled Out My Way in 1986. Suzanne McElfresh gave the 1999 rerelease a positive review, calling it \\"more fully realized\\" than Meat Puppets II. Mark Deming at AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote: \\"The album has an air of carefree drift, but it doesn't meander, and the performances are remarkably tight, full of energy and purpose even when the songs are redolent of goofing off. ... the band rarely sounded as joyous or played with the same fire and accuracy as they demonstrated here, and it's arguably their most purely pleasurable work\\", though he considered \\"it lacks a song as memorable as 'Lake of Fire'\\". Birdsong Brewing named a beer \\"Up on the Sun Saison\\" after the Meat Puppets song. The Meat Puppets performed Up on the Sun in its entirety at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they curated in May 2011. Analysis The group members have been open about their fondness for recreational drug use, in particular of LSD, and though the lyrics make no direct references to drugs, Curt Kirkwood has called Up on the Sun the group's \\"beer and pot\\" album. A psychedelic approach permeates the music and lyrics. Curt had recently become the father of twins and the theme of fatherhood recurs in the lyrics, as in lines such as \\"You are my daughter\\" in the lead track. The lyrics to \\"Swimming Ground\\" are more realistic and idyllic than the psychedelic fantasies that precede it; the escape is toward the local swimming ground on hot summer days and the clouds overhead fail to let loose the rain. The scene recalls the desert summers of the Kirkwoods' Arizona youth. \\"Enchanted Pork Fist\\" is a mostly instrumental track with nonsense lyrics; the opening line \\"pistachios turn your fingers red\\" refers to the red with which manufacturers often dye the shells of commercial pistachios. Matthew Smith- Lahrman interprets this line as suggesting the lasting effects of a drug on the singer. Curt uses flowing water in \\"Two Rivers\\" as a metaphor for different aspects of life, such as relationships and the life's ever- changingness, and how different waters‚Äîand aspects of life‚Äîconstantly flow into each other. The album closes with \\"Creator\\", in which Curt takes a cynical view of religion: \\"some say openly 'I don't know' / others build elevators / to take the chosen few / who can afford the scenic view\\".

Anchors of the mall are Boscov's, Macy's, JCPenney, Old Navy, Dick's Sporting Goods, and a 14-screen AMC Classic. It is a one-level, enclosed regional mall that is managed by Simon Property Group, who owns 68.1% of it. At , it is the third biggest mall in Delaware, boasting 83 shops and a food court. Location The Dover Mall is located along U.S. Route 13 (North Dupont Highway) in the northern part of the city of Dover in Kent County, Delaware, and serves as the only enclosed mall in the Dover area. The mall is situated in a retail corridor and is located just northwest of Dover International Speedway and Dover Downs and across the street from Delaware State University. The Dover Mall is located a short distance south of an interchange with Delaware Route 1. Dover Mall is served by DART First State bus routes 108, 109, and 112, which provide local bus service to points in Dover and Kent County. Description The Dover Mall is a one-level shopping mall that has a gross leasable area of and contains 79 stores. The mall is anchored by JCPenney, Macy's, Boscov's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Old Navy, and a vacant anchor spot last occupied by Sears. The Dover Mall also has a food court and a 14-screen AMC Classic. The Dover Mall complex also includes a strip mall called Dover Commons. The Dover Mall offers tax-free shopping and has a trade area that covers the city of Dover and much of Kent County, while also attracting tourists who visit the Dover area.  History  Dover Mall near JCPenney Built in 1982, the Dover Mall was the second climate-controlled enclosed mall in Dover, following the Blue Hen Mall (now the Blue Hen Corporate Center) a few miles south on Bay Road. The Dover Mall was built as a second mall for the Dover area for Sears and other department stores after Sears was unable to come to an agreement to build a store at the Blue Hen Mall. The opening of the Dover Mall led to the subsequent decline of the Blue Hen Mall. The mall was originally anchored by Boscov's, Leggett, and Sears. The Boscov's store at Dover Mall was the first Boscov's location outside of Pennsylvania. The mall was renovated in 1992. JCPenney became the mall's fourth department store when it opened in August 1993, relocating from the Blue Hen Mall. Later that year, the Dover Mall became the first shopping mall in the state to ban smoking. Leggett closed its store at the mall on March 15, 1997. It was replaced by Strawbridge's, which opened on November 21, 1997. During the same time period, Boscov's underwent a substantial renovation and expansion, and Sears completed an interior renovation. In 1999, Carmike Cinemas expanded from six screens to fourteen, and the mall food court was enlarged and renovated. Carmike Cinemas was converted to AMC Classic in 2017. The Mills Corporation acquired the mall in 2003 from Cadillac Fairview. At the time of the purchase, the Mills Corporation announced a preliminary proposal to add approximately . of new stores and entertainment venues. The mall's Strawbridge's store was converted to Macy's on September 9, 2006 after Federated Department Stores purchased May Department Stores, the owner of Strawbridge's. In April 2007, Simon Property Group acquired the mall along with the other Mills Corp. malls. It is Simon's only Delaware property and at least the third owner since 2000. In 2013, the Dover Mall added several new stores, including a new Dick's Sporting Goods that opened on November 10, 2013. On May 3, 2018, it was announced that the Sears at Dover Mall would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. Liquidation sales began on May 18, 2018 and the store closed in August 2018. The Sears Auto Center closed by the end of 2018. On October 15, 2020, Macy's parent company, Macy's, Inc., announced that they will convert the Southwest Plaza in Littleton, Colorado and the Dover Mall Macy's stores into fulfillment centers. It is unknown when, but in-store shopping will be discontinued at these two locations.

He is a graduate of Hamilton College and completed a master's in philosophy at Harvard University. Since 1982 Moses has developed the nationwide Algebra Project in the United States. He has received a MacArthur Fellowship and other awards for this work, which emphasizes teaching algebra skills to minority students based on broad-based community organizing and collaboration with parents, teachers and students. Life and career Robert Parris Moses graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1952 and received his B.A. from Hamilton College in 1956. He earned an M.A. in philosophy at Harvard; in 1958 he began teaching at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx of New York City. Also in 1958, he was private tutor to singer Frankie Lymon, of The Teenagers, and credits his experience visiting Black sections of numerous towns with the doo-wop group for his recognition of the emergence of a distinct urban Black culture scattered across the nation. Moses became one of the influential black leaders of the civil rights struggle, and he had a vision of grassroots and community-based leadership. Although Moses‚Äô leadership style was different from Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs, King appreciated the contributions that Moses made to the movement, claiming they were inspiring. Moses initiated and organized voter registration drives in the South, sit-ins, and Freedom Schools for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He currently runs the Algebra Project, which is a continued effort to improve math education in poor communities with the goal of sending more students to the workforce. Starting as a civil rights leader and transitioning into an advocate for the poor through his work with the Algebra Project, Moses has revolutionized the ideal of equal opportunity and has played a vital role in making it a reality. =Civil rights movement= Moses began working with civil rights activists in 1960, becoming field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). As director of the SNCC's Mississippi Project in 1961, Moses traveled to Pike County and Amite County to try to register black voters. Comprising a majority in both counties, despite many people leaving in the Great Migration in the first half of the century, they had been utterly closed out of the political process since 1890. He pushed for the SNCC to engage in a \\"tactical nonviolence,\\" a matter he discussed in an interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?. White Democrats had disfranchised Mississippi's blacks in their 1890 constitution, which required poll taxes, and other barriers, such as residency requirements, and subjective literacy tests. It was nearly impossible for blacks to register and vote. After decades of violence and repression under Jim Crow, by the 1960s most blacks did not bother trying to register. In 1965, only one African American among 5500 in Amite County was registered to vote. Moses faced nearly relentless violence and official intimidation, and was beaten and arrested in Amite County. He was the first African American to challenge white violence, and filed assault charges against his attacker. The all-white jury acquitted the man, and the judge told Moses he could not protect him, providing him an escort to the county line. The next month in September 1961, E.H. Hurst, a white state legislator, killed Herbert Lee, a 56-year-old married local farmer in Liberty, Mississippi, who had been in a voter registration class. Hurst murdered him in front of a dozen witnesses and was cleared at the inquest that day, claiming self-defense; the courtroom was filled with armed white men. Witness Louis Allen was murdered in early 1964 after being boycotted and harassed for discussing the Lee murder with federal officials. Moses and other organizers had asked for federal protection from the John F. Kennedy administration but the Justice Department did not then provide it. By 1964 Moses had become co-director of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), an umbrella organization for the major civil rights groups working in Mississippi. A major leader with SNCC, he was the main organizer of COFO's Freedom Summer project, which was intended to achieve widespread voter registration of blacks in Mississippi, and ultimately, end racial disfranchisement. They planned education and organizing, and a simplified registration system, to demonstrate African- American desire to vote. Moses was one of the calm leaders who kept the group focused. On June 21, as many of the new volunteers were getting settled and trained in nonviolent resistance, three were reported missing. They were James Chaney, a local African American, and his two Jewish co-leaders Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, both from New York City. These three young men had gone to investigate a church bombing near Philadelphia, Mississippi. They were arrested on alleged traffic violations and released that night. After an FBI investigation, their decomposed bodies were found six weeks later, buried in an earthen dam. The volunteers were frightened. Moses gathered them together to discuss it; he told the group this was the risk they faced. He said that now that they had seen first-hand what could happen, they had every right to go home. He assured volunteers that no one would blame them for leaving. Everyone stayed. This was not the first murder of activists in Mississippi or the South, but the Civil Rights Movement had attracted increasing notice from the national media. Many African-American volunteers were angered that publicity appeared to be based on two of the victims being white Northerners. Moses helped ease tensions. The volunteers struggled with the idea of nonviolence, of blacks and whites working together, and related issues. These tensions were enormous, but arguably, Moses's leadership was a major cohesive factor for a number of volunteers staying. Moses was instrumental in the organizing of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, a group that challenged the all-white regular Democratic Party delegates from the state at the party's 1964 convention. Because the Democratic Regulars had for decades excluded African Americans from the political process in Mississippi, the MFDP wanted their elected delegates seated at the convention. Their challenge received national media coverage and highlighted the civil rights struggle in the state. Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic leadership nonetheless prevented any of the MFDP delegation from voting in the convention, giving the official seats to the Jim Crow regulars. Moses and the rest of the SNCC activists were profoundly disillusioned by this decision. Moses was also disturbed by the machinations of liberal Democrats, whom he had invited into COFO, to centralize the Council's decision-making, an effort that seemed to undermine the grassroots participatory democracy of SNCC. Moses resigned from COFO in late 1964. He later commented that his role had become ‚Äò‚Äòtoo strong, too central, so that people who did not need to, began to lean on me, to use me as a crutch‚Äô‚Äô. He temporarily dropped his surname, going by his middle name, Parris, and began participating in the campaign against the Vietnam War. Speaking at the first massive anti-war demonstration on April 17, 1965, at the Washington Monument, Moses linked his opposition to the war to the civil rights struggle. As his involvement in the anti-war movement increased, he took a leave of absence from SNCC to avoid criticisms from fellow members who did not support his stance. Following a trip to Africa in 1965, Moses came to believe that blacks must work independently of whites, and by 1966 Moses had cut off all relationships with whites, even former SNCC activists. In 1976 Moses returned to the United States and Harvard, doing graduate work in the philosophy of mathematics. He taught high school math in a public high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after learning from his daughter that the school was not offering algebra. =Algebra Project= In 1982 Moses received a MacArthur Fellowship. He used the award to create the Algebra Project, devoted to improving minority education in math, starting with his daughter's classroom in a Cambridge, Massachusetts public school. Moses also taught math for a time at Lanier High School in Jackson, Mississippi. He used the Lanier classroom as a laboratory school for developing methods and approaches for the Algebra Project, enlisting the support of parents and the community in the project. In 2005 Moses was selected as one of twelve inaugural Alphonse Fletcher Sr. Fellows by the Fletcher Foundation, which awards substantial grants to scholars and activists working on civil rights issues. Since 1982, Moses expanded the Algebra Project from teaching math in one school, to supporting these methods for teaching math in over 200 schools across the country by the late 1990s. The Algebra Project's unique approach to school reform intentionally develops models that are sustainable and focused on students. This is achieved by building coalitions of stakeholders within the local communities. The historically underserved population is a big portion of these coalitions. The Algebra Project works to change common attitudes of our society that routinely promote the exclusion and regression of minorities. The goal of the Algebra Project is to take the students who score the lowest on state math tests and prepare them for college level math by the end of high school. This is done by doubling up on math courses for the four years of high school. The Algebra Project is based in research and development, school development, and community and site development. In October 2006, the Algebra Project received an award from the National Science Foundation to improve the development of materials for Algebra I. In terms of school development, the Algebra Project strives to provide culturally sensitive, context-based, and site-specific professional development opportunities to teachers. It promotes collaboration of teaching methods and knowledge. The Algebra Project partners with local higher education and research institutions to help teachers develop professionally, trains teachers on new materials, and provides them with programs to get certified. The Algebra Project collaborates with the Young People's Project to help engage students in their learning process. ‚ÄúYPP uses mathematics literacy as a tool to develop young leaders and organizers who radically change the quality of education and quality of life in their communities so that all children have the opportunity to reach their full human potential.‚Äù At its peak, the Algebra Project has provided help to roughly forty-thousand minority students each year. Contributions include curricula guides for kindergarten through high school, the training of teachers, and peer coaching. Moses believed that Algebra was a critical ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù subject because mastering it was necessary in order for middle school students to advance in math, technology, and science. Without algebra, students would not be able to meet the requirements for college. Fifty-five percent of the students following the Algebra Project's curriculum passed the state exam on their first attempt, compared to 40 percent of students following the regular curriculum. More students at junior high school sites who followed the Algebra Project curriculum scored higher on standardized tests and continued to more advanced math classes than did their schoolmates who followed standard curriculum. Thus, they could better meet requirements for college admission and future entry into good jobs. =Continued work in education= In 2006 Moses was named a Frank H. T. Rhodes Class of '56 Professor at Cornell University. As a Visiting Scholar at Princeton University, he taught an African American Studies class with Professor Tera Hunter in the Spring 2012 semester. Moses is teaching high school math in Jackson, Mississippi, and Miami, Florida. He was identified as a Teaching hero by The My Hero Project.

His work marked the high point of Danish baroque poetry. His father was a weaver of modest means; the name Kingo is a shortening of the Scottish name \\"Kinghorn\\".\\"Thomas Kingo, the grandfather of the poet, immigrated from Crail, Scotland, to Denmark about 1590, and settled at Helsingoer, Sjaelland, where he worked as a tapestry weaver. \\": Kingo‚Äôs Childhood and Youth, readcentral.com In his youth, Kingo wrote a series of poems picturing humorous scenes in village life and a pastoral love poem, Chrysillis. He studied theology at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1654, and for some time acted as private tutor. In 1661 he was appointed vicar to the pastor at Kirke Helsinge, and in 1668 he was ordained a minister at his native town, where his poetic activity began. At first he essayed patriotic poems, but later devoted himself almost entirely to writing hymns, and in 1674 the first part of his Aandelige Siunge-Koor (\\"Spiritual Song Choir\\") appeared; followed in 1681 by a second part. This work consists of a collection of beautiful hymns several of which are still popular in the Danish Church. In 1677 Kingo was appointed bishop of Funen. Charged by the government with the compilation of a new hymn-book, he edited what became known as Kingo's hymnal (Kingos Psalmebog, 1699), which contains eighty-five of his own compositions, and which is still used in various parts of Denmark and Norway. Some parts of the Danish rural population were firmly sticking to his hymns during the pietist and rationalist period contributing to their survival. The same goes for the Faroe Islands, where his hymns have been in widespread use through most of the 20th century, often sung to quite complicated folk melodies, which may, however, often be traced back to Kingo‚Äôs melody collection, or Gradual,Thomas Kingo (1699): Gradual, Odense. Facsimile edition by Erik Norman Svendsen and Henrik Glahn, with afterword by Henrik Glahn: ‚ÄúOm melodiforholdene i Kingos Graduale‚Äù, Copenhagen 1967 from 1699, as described by Marianne Clausen in her magnum opus about Faroese folk singing. Though not the first Danish hymn writer Kingo must be considered the first real important one and also among the Danish poets of the 17th century he is generally a leading figure. His hymns are born by a forceful and often Old Testamental wrath and renunciation of the world switching with Christian mildness and confidence. Both elements are thrown in relief by his private thrift and fighting nature. His worldly poems and patriotic songs are often long-winded and marked by outer effects but in short version he is unequalled, as in his both plain and worthy commemorative poem of the naval hero Niels Juel.

Dalrymple, The Anarchy, London 2019, p. 190  Etymology  The word Qizilbash is Ottoman Turkish (; modern Turkish ' 'red-head'). The expression is derived from their distinctive twelve-gored crimson headwear (tƒÅj or tark in Persian; sometimes specifically titled \\"Haydar's Crown\\" / TƒÅj-e ·∏§aydar),Note: TƒÅj, meaning crown in Persian, is also a term for hats used to delineate one's affiliation to a particular Sufi order. indicating their adherence to the Twelve Imams and to Shaykh Haydar, the spiritual leader (sheikh) of the Safavid order in accordance with the Imamate in Twelver doctrine.Moojan Momen, \\"An Introduction to Shi'i Islam\\", Yale Univ. Press, 1985, ', pp. 101‚Äì107. The name was originally a pejorative label given to them by their Sunni Ottoman foes, but soon it was adopted as a provocative mark of pride. Origins The origin of the Qizilbash can be dated from the 15th century onward, when the spiritual grandmaster of the movement, Shaykh Haydar (the head of the Safaviyya Sufi order), organized his followers into militant troops. Connections between the Qizilbash and other religious groups and secret societies, such as the Mazdaki movement in the Sasanian Empire, or its more radical offspring, the Persian Khurramites, have been suggested. Like the Qizilbash, the latter were an early Shi'i ghulat group and dressed in red, for which they were termed \\"the red ones\\" (, mu·∏•ammirah) by medieval sources.H. Anetshofer/H.T. Karateke, Traktat √ºber die Derwischm√ºtzen (riÃásƒÅle-iÃá TƒÅciyye) des M√ºstaqƒ´m-zƒÅde S√ºleymƒÅn SƒÅ ªdeddƒ´n; Brill, 2001; (German original) In this context, Turkish scholar Abd√ºlbaki G√∂lpinarli sees the Qizilbash as \\"spiritual descendants of the Khurramites\\". Organization The Qizilbash were a coalition of many different tribes of predominantly (but not exclusively) Turkic-speaking background united in their adherence to Safavi Shia Islam. As murids of the Safavi sheikhs (pirs), the Qizilbash owed implicit obedience to their leader in his capacity as their murshid-e kƒÅmil \\"supreme spiritual director\\" and, after the establishment of the kingdom, as their padishah, changing the purely religious pir ‚Äì murid relationship into a political one. As a consequence, any act of disobedience of the Qizilbash Sufis against the order of the spiritual grandmaster (Persian: nƒÅsufigari \\"conduct unbecoming of a Sufi\\") became \\"an act of treason against the king and a crime against the state\\", as was the case in 1614 when Padishah Abbas the Great put some followers to death.Roger M. Savory, \\"The office of khalifat al-khulafa under the Safawids\\", in JOAS, lxxxv, 1965, p. 501 Beliefs The Qizilbash adhered to heterodox Shi‚Äôi doctrines encouraged by the early Safavi sheikhs Haydar and his son Ismail I. They regarded their rulers as divine figures, and so were classified as ghulat \\"extremists\\" by orthodox Twelvers.Momen, 1985 When Tabriz was taken, there was not a single book on Twelverism among the Qizilbash leaders. The book of the well known Iraqi scholar al-Hilli (1250‚Äì1325) was procured in the town library to provide religious guidance to the state.Moojan Momen, \\"An Introduction to Shi'i Islam\\", Yale Univ. Press, 1985, ', p. 397 The imported Shi'i ulama did not participate in the formation of Safavid religious policies during the early formation of the state. However, ghulat doctrines were later forsaken and Arab Twelver ulama from Lebanon, Iraq, and Bahrain were imported in increasing numbers to bolster orthodox Twelver practice and belief. = Qizilbash aqidah in Anatolia = In Turkey, orthoprax Twelvers following Ja'fari jurisprudence are called Ja'faris. Although the Qizilbash are also Twelvers, their practices do not adhere to Ja'fari jurisprudence. * The Qizilbash have a unique and complex conviction tracing back to the Kaysanites and Khurramites, who are considered ghulat Shia. According to Turkish scholar Abd√ºlbaki G√∂lpinarli, the Qizilbash of the 16th century ‚Äì a religious and political movement in Iranian Azerbaijan that helped to establish the Safavid dynasty ‚Äì were \\"spiritual descendants of the Khurramites\\".Roger M. Savory (ref. Abd√ºlbaki G√∂lpƒ±narlƒ±), Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Kizil-Bash\\", Online Edition 2005 * Among the individual revered by Alevis, two figures, firstly Abu Muslim who assisted the Abbasid Caliphate to beat Umayyad Caliphate, but later eliminated and murdered by Caliph al-Mansur, and secondly Babak Khorramdin, who incited a rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate and consequently was killed by Caliph al-Mu'tasim, are highly respected. In addition, the Safavid leader Ismail I is highly regarded. * The Qizilbash aqidah is based upon a syncretic fiqh called batiniyya which incorporates some Qarmatian thoughts, originally introduced by Abu‚Äôl-KhƒÅttƒÅb Muhammad ibn Abu Zaynab al-Asadƒ´, and later developed by Maymun al-QƒÅddƒÅh and his son  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Maymun, and Mu øtazila with a strong belief in The Twelve Imams. * Not all of the members believe that the fasting in Ramadan is obligatory although some Alevi Turks perform their fasting duties partially in Ramadan. * Some beliefs of shamanism still are common among the Qizilbash in villages. * The Qizilbash are not a part of Ja'fari jurisprudence, even though they can be considered as members of different tariqa of Shia Islam all looks like sub- classes of Twelver. Their conviction includes Batiniyya-Hurufism and \\"Sevener- Qarmatians-Isma'ilism\\" sentiments.√ñzt√ºrk, Ya≈üar Nuri, En-el Hak ƒ∞syanƒ± (The Anal Haq Rebellion) ‚Äì Hall√¢c-ƒ± Mans√ªr (Daraƒüacƒ±nda Mira√ß ‚Äì Mira√ß on Gallows), Vol 1 and 2, Yeni Boyut, 2011. * They all may be considered as special groups not following the Ja'fari jurisprudence, like Alawites who are in the class of ghulat Twelver Shia Islam, but a special Batiniyya belief somewhat similar to Isma'ilism in their conviction. \\"Turk & TƒÅjƒ´k\\" Shah Ismail I, the Sheikh of the Safavi tariqa, founder of the Safavid dynasty of Iran, and the Commander-in-chief of the Qizilbash armies. Among the Qizilbash, Turcoman tribes from Eastern Anatolia and Iranian Azerbaijan who had helped Ismail I defeat the Aq Qoyunlu tribe were by far the most important in both number and influence and the name Qizilbash is usually applied exclusively to them.Minorsky, Vladimir (1943) \\"Tadhkirat al-muluk\\", London, pp. 16‚Äì18, 188 Some of these greater Turcoman tribes were subdivided into as many as eight or nine clans, including: * UstƒÅdjlu (Their origins reach back to the Begdili) * R≈´mlu * ShƒÅmlu (the most powerful clan during the reign of Shah Ismail I.) * Dulkadir (Arabic: Dhu 'l-Kadar) * AfshƒÅr * QƒÅjƒÅr * Takkalu Other tribes ‚Äì such as the Turkman, BahƒÅrlu, QaramƒÅnlu, WarsƒÅk, and BayƒÅt ‚Äì were occasionally listed among these \\"seven great uymaqs\\". Today, the remnants of the Qizilbash confederacy are found among the Afshar, the Qashqai, Turkmen, Shahsevan, and others. Some of these names consist of a place-name with the addition of the Turkish suffix -lu, such as ShƒÅmlu or BahƒÅrlu. Other names are those of old Oghuz tribes such as the AfshƒÅr, Dulghadir, or BayƒÅt, as mentioned by the medieval Uyghur historian Mahmud al-Kashgari. The non-Turkic Iranian tribes among the Qizilbash were called TƒÅjƒ´ks by the Turcomans and included: * TƒÅlish * The Lurs * SiƒÅh-Kuh (KarƒÅdja-Dagh) * certain Kurdish tribes * certain Persian families and clans The rivalry between the Turkic clans and the Persian nobles was a major problem in the Safavid kingdom. As V. Minorsky put it, friction between these two groups was inevitable, because the Turcomans \\"were no party to the national Persian tradition\\". Shah Ismail tried to solve the problem by appointing Persian wakils as commanders of Qizilbash tribes. The Turcomans considered this an insult and brought about the death of 3 of the 5 Persians appointed to this office ‚Äì an act that later inspired the deprivation of the Turcomans by Shah Abbas I. History In Jean Chardin's book. = Beginnings = In the 15th century, Ardabil was the center of an organization designed to keep the Safavi leadership in close touch with its murids in Azerbaijan, Iraq, Eastern Anatolia, and elsewhere. The organization was controlled through the office of khalƒ´fƒÅt al-khulafƒÅ'ƒ´ who appointed representatives (khalƒ´fa) in regions where Safavi propaganda was active. The khalƒ´fa, in turn, had subordinates termed pira. The Safavi presence in eastern Anatolia posed a serious threat to the Ottoman Empire because they encouraged the Shi'i population of Asia Minor to revolt against the sultan. In 1499, Ismail, the young leader of the Safavi order, left Lahijan for Ardabil to make a bid for power. By the summer of 1500, about 7,000 supporters from the local Turcoman tribes of Asia Minor (Anatolia), Syria, and the Caucasus ‚Äì collectively called \\"Qizilbash\\" by their enemies ‚Äì rallied to his support in Erzincan.Faruk S√ºmer, Safevi Devletinin Kurulu≈üu ve Geli≈ümesinde Anadolu T√ºrklerinin Rol√º, T√ºrk Tarih Kurumu Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, Ankara, 1992, p. 15. Leading his troops on a punitive campaign against the Shƒ´rvanshƒÅh (ruler of Shirvan), he sought revenge for the death of his father and his grandfather in Shƒ´rvan. After defeating the Shƒ´rvanshƒÅh Farrukh Yassar and incorporating his kingdom, he moved south into Azarbaijan, where his 7,000 Qizilbash warriors defeated a force of 30,000 Aq Qoyunlu under Alwand MirzƒÅRoger M. Savory, Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Safawids\\", Online Edition, 2005 and conquered Tabriz. This was the beginning of the Safavid state. By 1510, Ismail and his Qizilbash had conquered the whole of Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan,BBC, (Link) southern Dagestan (with its important city of Derbent), Mesopotamia, Armenia, Khorasan, Eastern Anatolia, and had made the Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti his vassals. Many of these areas were priorly under the control of the Ak Koyunlu. In 1510 Shah Ismail sent a large force of the Qizilbash to Transoxiania to fight the Uzbeks. The Qizilbash defeated the Uzbeks and secured Samarkand at the Battle of Marv. However, in 1512, an entire Qizilbash army was annihilated by the Uzbeks after Turcoman Qizilbash had mutinied against their Persian wakil and commander Najm-e Thani at the Battle of Ghazdewan.Roger M. Savory, \\"The significance of the political murder of Mirza Salman\\", in \\"Studies on the history of Safawid Iran\\", xv, pp. 186‚Äì187 This defeat put an end to Safavid expansion and influence in Transoxania and left the northeastern frontiers of the kingdom vulnerable to nomad invasions, until some decades later. =Battle of Chaldiran= Meanwhile, the Safavid dawah continued in Ottoman areas ‚Äì with great success. Even more alarming for the Ottomans was the successful conversion of Turcoman tribes in Eastern Anatolia, and the recruitment of these well experienced and feared fighters into the growing Safavid army. In order to stop the Safavid propaganda, Sultan Bayezid II deported large numbers of the Shi'i population of Asia Minor to Morea. However, in 1507, Shah Ismail and the Qizilbash overran large areas of Kurdistan, defeating regional Ottoman forces. Only two years later in Central Asia, the Qizilbash defeated the Uzbeks at Merv, killing their leader Muhammad Shaybani and destroying his dynasty. His head was sent to the Ottoman sultan as a warning. A Safavid Qizilbash cavalryman. In 1511, a pro-Safavid revolt known as the Shahkulu Uprising broke out in Teke. An imperial army that was sent to suppress it, was defeated. Shah Ismail sought to turn the chaos within the Ottoman Empire to his advantage and moved up his borders even more westwards in Asia Minor. The Qizilbash defeated a large Ottoman army under Sinan Pasha. Shocked by this heavy defeat, Sultan Selim I (the new ruler of the Empire) decided to invade Persia with a force of 200,000 Ottomans and face the Qizilbash on their own soil. In addition, he ordered the persecution of Alevis and massacre its adherents in the Ottoman Empire.H.A.R. Gibb & H. Bowen, \\"Islamic society and the West\\", i/2, Oxford, 1957, p. 189 On 20 August 1514 (1st Rajab 920 A.H.), the two armies met at Chaldiran in northwestern Iran. The Ottomans -equipped with both firearms and cannon- were reported to outnumber the Qizilbash as much as three to one. The Qizilbash were badly defeated;M.J. McCaffrey, Encyclopaedia Iranica, \\"ƒåƒÅlderƒÅn\\", v, pp. 656‚Äì8, (Link ) casualties included many high-ranking Qizilbash amirs as well as three influential ulamƒÅ. The defeat destroyed Shah Ismail's belief in his own invincibility and divine status. It also fundamentally altered the relationship between the murshid-e kƒÅmil and his murids (followers). =The deprivation of the Turcomans= Ismail I tried to reduce the power of the Turcomans by appointing Iranians to the vakil office. However, the Turcomans did not like having an Iranian to the most powerful office of the Safavid Empire and kept murdering many Iranians who were appointed to that office. After the death of Ismail, the Turkomans managed to seize power from the Iranians, they were however, defeated by Tahmasp I, the son of Ismail. For almost ten years after the Battle of Chaldiran, rival Qizilbash factions fought for control of the kingdom. In 1524, 10-year-old Shah Tahmasp I, the governor of Herat, succeeded his father Ismail. He was the ward of the powerful Qizilbash amir Ali Beg R≈´ml≈´ (titled \\"Div SoltƒÅn) who was the de facto ruler of the Safavid kingdom.Roger M. Savory in Encyclopaedia Iranica, \\"Dƒ´v SoltƒÅn\\", Online Edition, 2005, (Link) However, Tahmasp managed to reassert his authority over the state and over the Qizilbash. During the reign of Shah Tahmasp, the Qizilbash fought a series of wars on two fronts and ‚Äì with the poor resources available to them ‚Äì successfully defended their kingdom against the Uzbeks in the east, and against the arch-rivals of the Safavids ‚Äì the Ottomans ‚Äì in the west. With the Peace of Amasya (1555), peace between Safavids and Ottomans remained for the rest of Tahmasp's reign.M. K√∂hbach in Encyclopaedia Iranica, \\"Peace of Amasya\\", v, p. 928, Online Edition, (Link) During Tahmasp' reign, he carried out multiple invasions in the Caucasus which had been incorporated in the Safavid empire since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterward, and started with the trend of deporting and moving hundreds of thousands of Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to Iran's heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and several other specific posts of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society with these Caucasian elements and who would question the power and hegemony of the tribal Qizilbash. This included the formation of a military slave system,Streusand, p. 148. similar to that of the neighboring Ottoman Empire ‚Äì the janissaries. Tahmasp's successors, and most importantly Shah Abbas I (r. 1588‚Äì1629), would significantly expand this policy when during the reign of Abbas I alone some 200,000 Georgians, 300,000 Armenians and many tens of thousands of Circassians were relocated to Iran's heartlands. By this creation of a so-called \\"third layer\\" or \\"third force\\" in Iranian society composed of ethnic Caucasians, and the complete systematic disorganisation of the Qizilbash by his personal orders, Abbas I eventually fully succeeded in replacing the power of the Qizilbash, with that of the Caucasian ghulams. These new Caucasian elements (the so-called ghilman / ÿ∫ŸêŸÑŸíŸÖŸéÿßŸÜ / \\"servants\\"), almost always after conversion to Shi'ism depending on given function would be, unlike the Qizilbash, fully loyal only to the Shah. This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects continued to exist until the fall of the Qajar Dynasty. The inter-tribal rivalry of the Turcomans, the attempt of Persian nobles to end the Turcoman dominance, and constant succession conflicts went on for another 10 years after Tahmasp's death. This heavily weakened the Safavid state and made the kingdom vulnerable to external enemies: the Ottomans attacked in the west, whereas the Uzbeks attacked the east. Daud Khan Undiladze, Safavid ghulam, military commander, and the governor of Karabakh and Ganja between 1627 and 1633. In 1588, Shah Abbas I came to power. He appointed the Governor of Herat and his former guardian and tutor, Alƒ´ Quli KhƒÅn ShƒÅml≈´ (also known as HƒÅjƒ´ Alƒ´ QizilbƒÅsh MazandarƒÅnƒ´) the chief of all the armed forces. Later on, events of the past, including the role of the Turcomans in the succession struggles after the death of his father, and the counterbalancing influence of traditional IthnƒÅ ªashari Shia Sayeds, made him determined to end the dominance of the untrustworthy Turcoman chiefs in Persia which Tahmasp had already started decades before him. In order to weaken the Turcomans ‚Äì the important militant elite of the Safavid kingdom ‚Äì Shah Abbas further raised a standing army, personal guard, Queen-Mothers, Harems and full civil administration from the ranks of these ghilman who were usually ethnic Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians, both men and women, whom he and his predecessors had taken captive en masse during their wars in the Caucasus, and would systematically replace the Qizilbash from their functions with converted Circassians and Georgians. The new army and civil administration would be fully loyal to the king personally and not to the clan-chiefs anymore. The reorganisation of the army also ended the independent rule of Turcoman chiefs in the Safavid provinces, and instead centralized the administration of those provinces. Ghulams were appointed to high positions within the royal household, and by the end of Shah Abbas' reign, one-fifth of the high-ranking amirs were ghulams. By 1598 already an ethnic Georgian from Safavid-ruled Georgia, well known by his adopted Muslim name after conversion, Allahverdi Khan, had risen to the position of commander-in-chief of all Safavid armed forces.C. Fleischer, Encyclopaedia Iranica, \\"AllƒÅhverdi KhƒÅn\\", v, pp. 891‚Äì892, Online Edition, 2005, (Link) and by that became one of the most powerful men in the empire. The offices of wakil and amir al-umarƒÅ fell in disuse and were replaced by the office of a SipahsƒÅlƒÅr (, master of the army), commander-in-chief of all armed forces ‚Äì Turcoman and Non-Turcoman ‚Äì and usually held by a Persian (TƒÅdjik) noble. The Turcoman Qizilbash nevertheless remained an important part of the Safavid executive apparatus, even though ethnic Caucasians came to largely replace them. For example, even in the 1690s, when ethnic Georgians formed the mainstay of the Safavid military, the Qizilbash still played a significant role in the army. The AfshƒÅr and QƒÅjƒÅr rulers of Persia who succeeded the Safavids, stemmed from a Qizilbash background. Many other Qizilbash ‚Äì Turcoman and Non-Turcoman ‚Äì were settled in far eastern cities such as Kabul and Kandahar during the conquests of Nader Shah, and remained there as consultants to the new Afghan crown after the Shah's death. Others joined the Mughal emperors of India and became one of the most influential groups of the Mughal court until the British conquest of India. Legacy = Afghanistan = Mohammad Naib Sharif, leader of the Qizilbash group in Afghanistan during the First Anglo-Afghan War of 1839‚Äì42 Qizilbash in Afghanistan live in urban areas, such as Kabul, Herat or Mazari Sharif, as well as in certain villages in Hazarajat.

The influence of the Qizilbash in the government created resentment among the ruling Pashtun clans, especially after the Qizilbash openly allied themselves with the British during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839‚Äì1842). During Abdur Rahman Khan's massacre of the Shi'i minorities in Afghanistan, the Qizilbash were declared \\"enemies of the state and were persecuted and hunted by the government and by the Sunni majority.U.S. Library of Congress, \\"Afghanistan: The society and its environment\\", index s.v.

They are a commercially important family of azo compounds, i.e. compounds containing the linkage C-N=N-C. Azo dyes are widely used to treat textiles, leather articles, and some foods. Chemically related to azo dyes are azo pigments, which are insoluble in water and other solvents.Klaus Hunger, Peter Mischke, Wolfgang Rieper, et al.: \\"Azo Dyes\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.. Classes Many kinds of azo dyes are known, and several classification systems exist. Some classes include disperse dyes, metal-complex dyes, reactive dyes, and substantive dyes. Also called direct dyes, substantive dyes are employed for cellulose- based textiles, which includes cotton. The dyes bind to the textile by non- electrostatic forces. In another classification, azo dyes can be classified according to the number of azo groups. Trypan blue is an example of a direct dye, used for cotton. Physical properties, structure, and bonding As a consequence of –ø-delocalization, aryl azo compounds have vivid colors, especially reds, oranges, and yellows. An example is Disperse Orange 1. Some azo compounds, e.g., methyl orange, are used as acid-base indicators. Most DVD-R/+R and some CD-R discs use blue azo dye as the recording layer. phenolic diazo dyes participate in tautomeric equilibria shown here in simplified form (Ar = aryl). Azo dyes are solids. Most are salts, the colored component being the anion usually, although some cationic azo dyes are known. The anionic character of most dyes arises from the presence of 1-3 sulfonic acid groups, which are fully ionized at the pH of the dyed article: :RSO3H ‚Üí RSO3‚àí \\\\+ H+ Most proteins are cationic, thus dyeing of leather and wool corresponds to an ion exchange reaction. The anionic dye adheres to these articles through electrostatic forces. Cationic azo dyes typically contain quaternary ammonium centers. Preparation Most azo dyes are prepared by azo coupling, which entails an electrophilic substitution reaction of an aryl diazonium cation with another compound, the coupling partner. Classically coupling partners are other aromatic compounds with electron-donating groups: : + Ar‚Ä≤H ‚Üí ArN=NAr‚Ä≤ + H+ In practice, acetoacetic amide are widely used as coupling partners: : + Ar‚Ä≤NHC(O)CH2C(O)Me ‚Üí ArN=NCH(C(O)Me)(C(O)NHAr‚Ä≤) + H+ Azo dyes are also prepared by the condensation of nitroaromatics with anilines followed by reduction of the resulting azoxy intermediate: :ArNO2 \\\\+ Ar‚Ä≤NH2 ‚Üí ArN(O)=NAr‚Ä≤ + H2O :ArN(O)=NAr‚Ä≤ + C6H12O6 ‚Üí ArN=NAr‚Ä≤ + C6H10O6 \\\\+ H2O For textile dying, a typical nitro coupling partner would be disodium 4,4‚Ä≤-dinitrostilbene-2,2‚Ä≤-disulfonate. Typical aniline partners are shown below. Since anilines are prepared from nitro compounds, some azo dyes are produced by partial reduction of aromatic nitro compounds. Many azo dyes are produced by reactions from pre-existing azo compounds. Typical reactions include metal complexation and acylation.

Because they are insoluble in virtually all media, they are not readily purified, and thus require highly purified precursors. Synthesis of C.I. Pigment Yellow 12, an azo pigment (also classified as a diarylide pigment). Azo pigments are important in a variety of plastics, rubbers, and paints (including artist's paints). They have excellent coloring properties, mainly in the yellow to red range, as well as good lightfastness. The lightfastness depends not only on the properties of the organic azo compound, but also on the way they have been absorbed on the pigment carrier. Biodegradation In order for dyes to be useful, they must possess a high degree of chemical and photolytic stability. As a result of this stability, photolysis is not considered to be a degradation pathway for azo dyes. In order to prolong the lifetime of products dyed with azo dyes, it is essential to ensure stability against microbial attack, and tests have shown that azo dyes biodegrade negligibly in short term tests under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, however, discoloration may be observed as a consequence of biodegradation. Safety and regulation Many azo pigments are non-toxic, although some, such as dinitroaniline orange, ortho- nitroaniline orange, or pigment orange 1, 2, and 5 are mutagenic and carcinogenic. Azo dyes derived from benzidine are carcinogens; exposure to them has classically been associated with bladder cancer. Review. Accordingly, the production of benzidine azo dyes was discontinued in the 1980s in many western countries. =European regulation= Certain azo dyes degrade under reductive conditions to release any of a group of defined aromatic amines. Consumer goods which contain listed aromatic amines originating from azo dyes were prohibited from manufacture and sale in European Union countries in September 2003. As only a small number of dyes contained an equally small number of amines, relatively few products were affected.European Ban on Certain Azo Dyes , Dr. A. P√ºntener and Dr. C.

Career  Glanville became involved in the film industry in war service at Elstree Studios and studied art during her free time. After the Second World War she joined a puppet theatre company with which her parents were connected, Ebor Marionettes. Glanville joined AP Films in 1957 and worked on all its series, as well as the later Supermarionation presentations of Anderson's Century 21 Productions. She worked closely with fellow puppeteer Mary Turner. In addition to her primary role of lead puppet operator, Glanville was often responsible for the design and construction of the puppets themselves (Thunderbirds; 1965‚Äì66) and sculpted marionettes of Scott Tracy, Alan Tracy, and Tin-Tin Kyrano. The likeness of Mrs Appleby, a supporting character that appeared in The Secret Service (1969), was based on Glanville's mother. Others she created included Masterspy and his sidekick Zarin (Supercar), Venus (Fireball XL5), Titan, Agent X20 and Atlanta Shore (Stingray) Captain Black and the Angels (excluding Destiny) in Captain Scarlet and The Mysterons.  Family  Glanville was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, to James Fletcher and Phyllis Blatchford (maiden; 1890‚Äì1976), who were married July 1923 in Halifax, England. She moved with her parents to Ilford, Essex, as an infant. One of her 3rd great-grandparents was Domenico Corri (1746‚Äì1825), an Italian musician and publisher who, in the late 18th century, moved from Rome to Edinburgh to teach music. She was a grandniece of Robert Peel Glanville Blatchford (1851‚Äì1943), English socialist campaigner, journalist, and author. Death Glanville worked in puppetry and lived in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, until her death on 1 March 1999 at the age of 74.

It was created by James M. Ward and originally produced by TSR, the publisher of Dungeons & Dragons. It was the first science fiction role-playing game, published in July 1976. Description The original edition of the game takes place on a generation spaceship, the starship Warden that has been struck by an unknown cataclysmic event that killed many of the colonists and crew. Thus, the characters must survive their missions in this ship (which they believe to be a world) where they no longer understand the technology around them and they encounter numerous mutated creatures. Players can opt to create a human, a mutated human, a mutated plant or a mutated creature as their character. A number of articles in Dragon expanded upon these options to include clones and robot characters as well as adding rules for cybernetics. There are five common player characteristics: radiation resistance, mental resistance, dexterity, strength, and constitution. Human players added a sixth characteristic, leadership potential, while mutated humans and creatures add a random number of mutations, both physical and mental. Metamorphosis Alpha's combat rules are very similar to those used in the original edition of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;). Metamorphosis Alpha is the intellectual precursor to Gamma World (1978), also produced by TSR. Science fiction or science fantasy? Metamorphosis Alpha has an emphasis on super science and an element of science fantasy (as confirmed by creator James M. Ward in 2006). Ward has stated that the game is not \\"hard sci-fi\\". In 1980, TSR released AD&D; module S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. The module was based on the idea that a starship such as the Warden (though not the Warden itself, according to TSR founder Gary Gygax) becomes marooned in a D&D; universe. In the module's foreword, Gygax writes that the module was written to introduce Metamorphosis Alpha to the wider D&D; audience and to demonstrate how one might undertake science fiction/fantasy crossover. Inspiration Ward, the game's author, stated that the original inspiration for the game was Brian Aldiss's science fiction novel Non-Stop (also known as Starship, 1958). In the British RPG magazine White Dwarf, issue 1, Ian Livingstone wrote a review of the game and published his own additional rules for playing Metamorphosis Alpha on Aldiss's ship. However, it is often suggested that the game was inspired by Robert A. Heinlein's 1941 novel Orphans of the Sky.Articles: Cruising the Infinite: Strategies for Human Interstellar Travel, by Paul Lucas James M. Ward has stated that he was not familiar with the 1973 Canadian TV series The Starlost, a show with a similar concept, and that Metamorphosis Alpha is not based upon that series. Ownership and rights The rights to Metamorphosis Alpha are owned by James M. Ward. Ward also owns the rights to all Metamorphosis Alpha material previously published in Dragon. WardCo. (Ward's publishing business) has been granted permission by Steve Jackson Games and by Judges Guild (the estate of Bob Bledsaw Sr.) to host and republish some material. In 2008, Ward requested via public forums that sites hosting unlicensed copies of his original rules and the material previously published in Dragon magazine remove them, as they were a breach of his copyright and directly competed with products that he is selling. All permissions to host the Metamorphosis Alpha rules and the Metamorphosis Alpha articles in Dragon magazine, other than those being sold on behalf of WardCo., at sites other than at the official homepage have been rescinded. In 2010, Signal Fire Studios acquired the rights to produce a new edition of the game based upon Hasbro's 4th edition D&D.; In 2011, Ward announced that he had negotiated a deal to produce a graphic novel of Metamorphosis Alpha. Editions and supplements Metamorphosis Alpha was first published in 1976 by TSR. It was written by James M. Ward and illustrated by Dave Sutherland III. In 1981, Ward announced plans to rewrite the game as Metamorphosis Alpha to Omega, a supplement for the 1st edition Gamma World rules (Anon 1981). The Gamma World supplement was never completed, but in 1994, TSR used the title Metamorphosis Alpha to Omega for an Amazing Engine supplement () written by Slade Henson. In 2002, Ward's company, Fast Forward Entertainment, published a new version of the game, entitled Metamorphosis Alpha: 25th Anniversary Edition. It was designed by Ward himself. In 2006, Metamorphosis Alpha 4th Edition was released by Mudpuppy Games (). This edition contained original material by Ward and additional new material and photography by Craig J. Brain. The book cover and interior illustrations were painted and drawn by Jim Holloway with most of the cartography by Ryan Wolfe. In 2007, WardCo. released an official errata sheet for Metamorphosis Alpha First Edition, which is available from the official website and released a revised edition of the first-edition rules through OneBookShelf as a PDF. In 2010, WardCo. released The House On The Hill adventure module () for Metamorphosis Alpha (1st edition) as a PDF through OneBookshelf and the printed edition through Amazon. The adventure was written by Craig J. Brain, with bonus content by James M. Ward. The illustrations for the adventure were by Lee Smith and Dave Sutherland III.https://www.amazon.com/House-Hill-Adventure-Metamorphosis- Alpha/dp/145360412X/ In 2012, WardCo. released a reprint of the original edition of the game via Lulu with the addition of a new adventure and a number of corrections. In 2014, WardCo and Goodman Games. released a hardbound deluxe edition of the original 1st edition via kickstarter including new adventures and consolidated other content from magazines and new content. Reception Robert R. Taylor reviewed Metamorphosis Alpha in The Space Gamer No. 10. Taylor concluded that \\"The game is definitely first rate and quite excellent. MA is highly recommended to someone interested in buying their first role- playing game since the rules are rich with guidelines to help the player in constructing his own ship.\\" Eric Goldberg reviewed Lords of the Middle Sea in Ares Magazine #1, rating it a 3 out of 9. Goldberg commented that \\"Metamorphosis: Alpha is Dungeons and Dragons in space. Regrettably, one can only stretch a great idea so far; this offering is far too contrived to gain acceptance in the minds of most players..\\" Gary Gygax comments that \\"Metamorphosis Alpha is a game that breaks the typical level-progression reward mold but nevertheless offers a rich, if sometimes difficult to gain, array of player rewards ‚Äî from the knowledge of the environment to beneficial character mutations, learned skills to the acquisition of tech items and other equipment. Furthermore it blends fantasy with weird and super science in a unique manner that is captivating to players with imaginations suited to such a startling mixture. Metamorphosis Alpha ‚Äî in any edition ‚Äî stimulates the imagination, encourages keen thinking, and breaks the mold of typical fantasy and science fiction roleplaying games. If that doesn't make it one of the best hobby games ever, I don't know what would.\\" David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, commented that Metamorphosis Alpha was \\"notable as the first role-playing game with a science-fiction setting. The game takes place on the starship Warden, a vast spaceship built by the player characters' ancestors; in the aftermath of some unknown disaster, their progeny survive on the ship but don't understand its technology and must fight mutated creatures to ensure their survival.\\" See also *Gamma World *Non-Stop, a novel by Brian Aldiss with a similar plot *Orphans of the Sky, a novel by Robert A.

The film was directed and produced by Max Baer Jr. and stars Robby Benson and Glynnis O'Connor. Made for $1.1 million, it grossed $27 million at the box office, plus earnings in excess of $2.65 million in the foreign market, $4.75 million from television, and $2.5 million from video. However, reviews of the movie were mostly negative. Gentry's song recounts the day when Billie Joe McAllister (a fictional person) committed suicide by jumping off the Tallahatchie Bridge on Choctaw Ridge, Mississippi. When Gentry and Raucher got together to work on the screenplay, she explained she had no idea why the real person who inspired the character of Billie Joe had killed himself. Raucher thus had a free hand to pick one. His novelization of the story, published the year of the film's release as a movie tie-in, used the same rationale for the suicide. Plot Set in 1953, the film explores the budding relationship between teenagers Billy Joe McAllister (Benson) and Bobbie Lee Hartley (O'Connor) (who corresponds to the unnamed narrator of the original song), despite resistance from Hartley's family, who contend she is too young to date. One night at a jamboree, McAllister gets drunk and seems nauseated and confused when entering a makeshift brothel behind the gathering. It turns out that in his inebriated state, he had sex with another man, later revealed to be his sawmill boss, Dewey Barksdale (James Best). After his intimate encounter with Barksdale, Billy Joe disappears for several days. He then returns, and Bobbie Lee finally submits to her passions at a secluded spot near the bridge and encourages him to make love to her. Owing to his guilt, however, Billy Joe cannot consummate their relationship. He admits to Bobbie Lee that he has been with a man, and when she tries to reason that he was drunk, so maybe didn't have complete control of himself and didn't really know what was going on, he confesses that he knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong, and did it anyway because he wanted to. Tearfully, he bids her an enigmatic goodbye, and subsequently kills himself by jumping off the bridge spanning the Tallahatchie River. The local preacher, who saw Billy Joe and Bobbie Lee together, and other townsfolk spread the false story that Billy Joe committed suicide because he learned he had impregnated Bobbie Lee out of wedlock. For the sake of the family, Bobbie Lee's brother insists that she either quietly pursue an abortion or, if she insists upon having the baby, leave town. In the film, as in the novel, the object thrown from the bridge is Bobbie Lee's ragdoll, symbolizing throwing away her childhood and innocence and becoming an adult. Knowing that no one will ever believe that she and Billy Joe did not have sex and that she was never pregnant, Bobbie Lee decides to leave home. Very early one morning, with suitcase in hand, she walks to town to get a bus. On the way she meets Barksdale on the bridge, where he tells her that he is headed to her house to confess to her father and clear her name. She advises him against doing so, noting that revealing the truth would forever tarnish Billy Joe's reputation. He initially holds fast to his desire to confess, but Bobbie Lee calmly stresses that the news would further devastate Billy Joe's family and leave Barksdale himself subject to criminal prosecution. She also assures him that she does not mind her fate and then adds, \\"Oh, I'll be back before long; I'm only 15. What do I know of the world?\\" Finally agreeing with the girl's logic, he offers Bobbie Lee a ride to the bus station, which she graciously accepts. The film ends with the two of them walking across the bridge together.

Pictures for a film based on Bobbie Gentry's hit song, ‚ÄúOde To Billie Joe.‚Äù Baer offered Gentry and her publisher a large percentage of the film's receipts, and paid Herman Raucher $250,000 and a share of the profits to write the screenplay. Raucher was chosen to write the screenplay based on his script for Summer of '42. Baer had intended to cast unknown actors in the lead roles of ‚ÄúBobbie Lee Hartley‚Äù and ‚ÄúBilly Joe McAllister.‚Äù The July 2, 1975, issue of Variety announced that the locations for the film would include Gentry's hometown of Greenwood, Mississippi, along other local communities. Scenes at the old sawmill were filmed at Cross Lumber Company in Vaiden, Mississippi. The bridge featured in the film crossed the Yazoo River on County Road 512 near Sidon, Mississippi. It has since been demolished and replaced by a modern concrete span in 1987, with plaques at both the eastern and western ends commemorating the film.The plaques are at Release date The film premiered on June 2, 1976, at the Paramount Theatre in Jackson, Mississippi, as a benefit for the Mississippi Film Foundation. The premiere was attended by numerous dignitaries, including Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Gandy. In honor of Gentry being the first woman to be inducted into the Mississippi Hall of Fame, and the film's release in 550 theaters across the Southern United States, June 3, 1976 was declared \\"Billy Joe Day\\" by Mississippi Governor Cliff Finch. Gandy officiated at the placing of a bronze tablet on the Tallahatchie Bridge near Rising Sun, Mississippi. The celebration was attended by stars Robby Benson and Glynnis O‚ÄôConnor and producer Roger Camras. On the same day, a similar event was held in Los Angeles, California, to commemorate the opening of the film. Burbank Mayor Leland Ayers dedicated a -long replica of the Tallahatchie Bridge, constructed above Olive Avenue. Director Max Baer, Jr. attended the event. The film opened nationwide on June 4, 1976. Soundtrack Ode to Billy Joe (Sound Track from Max Baer's Motion Picture) is the soundtrack album to the 1976 film Ode to Billy Joe. It was released on May 10, 1976, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was issued on CD for the first time in 2017 by California-based label Kritzerland. Bobbie Gentry re-recorded her iconic hit song, \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\", for the film, with the spelling of the title character's name changed to \\"Billy\\". Gentry stated that the original spelling had been a typo, this is corroborated by her original hand-written lyrics of the song. =Commercial performance= \\"Ode to Billy Joe - Main Title\\" was issued as a single in April 1976. It peaked at No. 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Capitol Records, Gentry's label when the original 1967 recording was released, reissued it as a single in June 1976 to capitalize on the film's success. The album did not chart. The original recording, released in 1967, remained on the Billboard chart for 20 weeks and was the Number 1 song for four weeks. =Track listing= References External links * * Category:1976 films Category:1976 drama films Category:1970s coming-of-age drama films Category:1976 LGBT-related films Category:1970s teen drama films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American teen drama films Category:American teen LGBT-related films Category:English- language films Category:Films about suicide Category:Films based on songs Category:Films scored by Michel Legrand Category:Films set in 1953 Category:Films set in Mississippi Category:Films shot in Mississippi Category:Films with screenplays by Herman Raucher Category:Southern Gothic films Category:Warner Bros. films ","title":"Ode to Billy Joe (film)"},{"id":"2531049","text":"The Br√ºtsch Mopetta is an egg-shaped, single-seat, three-wheel automobile manufactured from 1956‚Äì1958 with a total production of 14.

Naming According to the brand creator, the name 'au' is based on the Japanese verbs for 'meet' (‰ºö„ÅÜ) and 'unite' (Âêà„ÅÜ) (both pronounced 'au'). However, KDDI explains that au comes from two letters which stand for few words. 'A' is for access, always and amenity, and 'U' is for unique, universal and user. There is also a phrase, 'access to u(you)' that goes along the brand name. History The network that would eventually become Au was originally set up as two networks: DDI and IDO. IDO's network was based upon the NTT Hi-cap analog cellular system, and began operations in December 1988 in the Kanto and Tokai regions. DDI's network was run by independent phone companies, and began service in 1989 using the TACS system elsewhere in Japan. Nippon Idou Tsushin (IDO) was owned by Toyota, whereas DDI was owned by Kyocera Corporation. was established in November 2000 by Kyocera as part of the DDI Cellular network. In 2001, the company was merged into KDDI (which had been formed in 2000 by the merger of DDI, KDD, and IDO), but its brand name was retained and applied to all mobile phone service under KDDI group. Au established a nationwide 3G network in 2003, replacing its previous cdmaOne service with CDMA 1X WIN (1xEV-DO Rev A) service. Au started selling the iPhone 4S from 14 October 2011.

He was the third son of Duke Bogislaw XIII by his first wife Clara of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. On the death of his father in 1606, he and his younger brother George II became joint dukes of R√ºgenwalde (Dar≈Çowo). George II died in 1617, and Bogislaw became sole ruler. In 1620 his domain was incorporated into the Duchy of Stettin, which he inherited on the death of his elder brother Francis. Early in 1625 he became ruler of all West Pomerania on the death of the last Duke of Wolgast, Philipp Julius, and on 19 February he was married to Elisabeth (24 September 1580 ‚Äì 21 December 1653), fifth daughter of John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, by his first wife, Elisabeth of Brunswick-Grubenhagen. Gustavus Adolphus and Bogislaw XIV. Despite his attempts to avoid becoming embroiled in the Thirty Years' War, Bogislaw in the Capitulation of Franzburg was forced to allow imperial troops commanded by Albrecht von Wallenstein to use his territories as a base in 1627. In turn, his lands became embroiled in the war, with all its disastrous consequences. In the 1630s, many of the local nobility tried to lessen his power, and this problem occupied Bogislaw in the early 1630s, causing a stroke which left him partially paralyzed. In 1634 he abdicated without clear succession resulting in a constitutional power struggle between his relatives and the governing council. With the constitutional issues unresolved, no recognized male issue, and virtually all of Pomerania occupied by Swedish and imperial troops, Bogislaw died in 1637. The conflicts and issues surrounding the personal and constitutional succession and general future of Pomerania as a dukedom were of such gravity and complexity that they resulted in the postponement of the burial of Bogislaw's body for almost 20 years. The succession to his lands was mainly between George William, Elector of Brandenburg, the heir under a pact between the two families in 1464, and his brother-in-law Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, who had occupied much of Pomerania on entering the Thirty Years' War in 1629. According to Bogislaw' last will, in case of no succession with the House of Pomerania, his lands were to pass to Sweden, not to Brandenburg-Prussia. Both, Sweden and Brandenburg, exploited not only their position as superior military and occupying powers but also the succession conflicts within the House of Pomerania itself. Therefore, when the allocation of territory was decided at the Peace of Westphalia which concluded the war in 1648, Pomerania was carved up and the territories were split between Sweden and Brandenburg. This meant that the Peace of Westphalia marked the end of Pomerania as an autonomous, political entity. On 25 May 1654, almost seven years after Pomerania had lost her independence and only after Bogislaw's wife Elisabeth of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg had died, could Bogislaw's body finally be put to rest in Stettin.

There are some species where population numbers have reasonably predictable patterns of change although the full reasons for population cycles is one of the major unsolved ecological problems. There are a number of factors which influence population change such as availability of food, predators, diseases and climate. Occurrence in mammal populations Olaus Magnus, the Archbishop of Uppsala in central Sweden, identified that species of northern rodents had periodic peaks in population and published two reports on the subject in the middle of the 16th century. In North America, the phenomenon was identified in populations of the snowshoe hare. In 1865, trappers with the Hudson's Bay Company were catching plenty of animals. By 1870, they were catching very few. It was finally identified that the cycle of high and low catches ran over approximately a ten-year period. The most well known example of creatures which have a population cycle is the lemming. The biologist Charles Elton first identified in 1924 that the lemming had regular cycles of population growth and decline. When their population outgrows the resources of their habitat, lemmings migrate, although contrary to popular myth, they do not jump into the sea. Other species While the phenomenon is often associated with rodents, it does occur in other species such as the ruffed grouse. There are other species which have irregular population explosions such as grasshoppers where overpopulation results in locust swarms in Africa and Australia. Relationships between predators and prey There is also an interaction between prey with periodic cycles and predators. As the population expands, there is more food available for predators. As it contracts, there is less food available for predators, putting pressure on their population numbers.

General properties and reactivity  According to tabulated linear free energy relationship constants (e.g. Hammett œÉm and œÉp), the diazonium group (N2+) is among the most strongly electron-withdrawing substituents. Thus, the Œ± position of alkanediazonium species and acidic protons on diazonio-substituted phenols and benzoic acids have greatly reduced pKa values compared to their unsubstituted counterparts. For example, the aqueous pKa of methanediazonium is estimated to be <10, while that of the phenolic proton of 4-hydroxybenzenediazonium was measured to be 3.4. In terms of reactivity, the chemistry of diazonium salts is dominated by their propensity to dediazotize via the thermodynamically (enthalpically and entropically) favorable expulsion of dinitrogen gas. The reaction (MeN2+‚Üí Me+ \\\\+ N2) has an enthalpic change of 43 kcal/mol, while (EtN2+‚Üí Et+ \\\\+ N2) has an enthalpic change of 11 kcal/mol. For secondary and tertiary alkanediazonium species, the enthalpic change is calculated to be close to zero or negative, with minimal activation barrier to expulsion of nitrogen. Hence, secondary and (especially) tertiary alkanediazonium species are either unbound, nonexistent species or, at best, extremely fleeting intermediates. 400x400px Methyldiazonium carboxylate is believed to be a fleeting intermediate in the methylation of carboxylic acids by diazomethane, and alkanediazonium species generated via diazotization of amines have been studied in physical organic chemistry studies. However, alkanediazonium salts are otherwise synthetically unimportant due to their extreme and uncontrolled SN2/SN1/E1 reactivity. In contrast, arenediazonium salts are more stable, though still dangerously explosive under certain conditions, because SN2 is geometrically impossible and does not occur, while SN1 occurs with much greater difficulty compared to alkanediazonium species due to difficulty in forming the high energy aryl cation and stronger C(sp2)‚ÄìN bond compared to the C(sp3)‚ÄìN bond in alkanediazonium compounds. Classically, the chloride salt is prepared at 5 ¬∞C from the aniline and NaNO2/aq. HCl, and ArN2+Cl‚Äì salts tend to decompose (sometimes explosively) at higher temperatures. However, the use of redox inactive and voluminous HSO4‚Äì, BF4‚Äì , or TsO‚Äì as counteranions has allowed arenediazonium salts to be stored indefinitely at 0 ¬∞C and safely handled for short periods of time at temperatures up to 50 ¬∞C. Arenediazonium salts due undergo SN1(Ar) (dissociative unimolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution) in a few cases, while the majority of their reactions take place by SRN1(Ar) (dissociative radical nucleophilic aromatic substitution) in which an initial electron transfer takes place, allowing for the formation of an aryl radical rather than cation. Arenediazonium salts are exceptionally versatile reagents for chemical synthesis. Because aryl radicals and cations are highly electrophilic and will react with virtually any nucleophile reagent, arenediazonium salts form a \\"transit hub\\" for arene chemistry from which almost any other aromatic derivative can be prepared. Moreover, this utility is accentuated by their ready availability: arenediazonium salts are easily accessible from diazotization of arylamines (anilines and heteroarylamines), which, in turn, are derived from the parent arene by electrophilic nitration followed by metal-mediated or -catalyzed reduction. After electrophilic aromatic substitution, diazonium chemistry is the most frequently applied strategy to prepare aromatic compounds. Industrially, arenediazonium salts are important intermediates in the organic synthesis of azo dyes.Chemistry of the Diazonium and Diazo Groups: Part 1. S. Patai, Ed. 1978 Wiley-Blackwell. . Chemistry of the Diazonium and Diazo Groups: Part 2. S. Patai, Ed. 1978 Wiley- Blackwell. .  Preparation  The process of forming diazonium compounds is called \\"diazotation\\", \\"diazoniation\\", or \\"diazotization\\". The reaction was first reported by Peter Griess in 1858, who subsequently discovered several reactions of this new class of compounds. Most commonly, diazonium salts are prepared by treatment of aromatic amines with nitrous acid and additional acid. Usually the nitrous acid is generated in situ (in the same flask) from sodium nitrite and the excess mineral acid (usually aqueous HCl, H2SO4, p-H3CC6H4SO3H, or HBF4): :ArNH2 + HNO2 + HX -> ArN2+X- + 2H2O Sample of benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. Aqueous solutions of diazonium chloride salts, traditionally prepared from the aniline, sodium nitrite, and hydrochloric acid, are unstable at room temperature and are classically prepared at 0 ‚Äì 5 ¬∞C. However, one can isolate diazonium compounds as tetrafluoroborate or tosylate salts, which are stable solids at room temperature. It is often preferred that the diazonium salt remain in solution, but they do tend to supersaturate. Operators have been injured or even killed by an unexpected crystallization of the salt followed by its detonation. Due to these hazards, diazonium compounds are usually not isolated. Instead they are used in situ. This approach is illustrated in the preparation of an arenesulfonyl compound: :500px Diazo coupling reactions The most widely practiced reaction of diazonium salts is azo coupling. In this process, the diazonium compound is attacked by, i.e., coupled to, electron-rich substrates. When the coupling partners are arenes such as anilines and phenols, the process is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution: :ArN+2 + Ar'H -> ArN2Ar' + H+ : 600px : 600px Another commercially important class of coupling partners are acetoacetic amides, as illustrated by the preparation of Pigment Yellow 12, a diarylide pigment.K. Hunger. W. Herbst \\"Pigments, Organic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2012. :480px The resulting azo compounds are often useful dyes and in fact are called azo dyes. The deep colors of the dyes reflects their extended conjugation. For example, the dye called aniline yellow is produced by mixing aniline and cold solution of diazonium salt and then shaking it vigorously. Aniline yellow is obtained as a yellow solid. Similarly, a cold basic solution of Naphthalen-2-ol (beta-naphthol) give the intensely orange-red precipitate. Methyl orange is an example of an azo dye that is used in the laboratory as a pH indicator. Displacement of the N2 group Arenediazonium cations undergo several reactions in which the N2 group is replaced by another group or ion. Some of the major ones are the following.March, J. ‚ÄúAdvanced Organic Chemistry‚Äù 4th Ed. J. Wiley and Sons, 1992: New York. . =Biaryl coupling= A pair of diazonium cations can be coupled to give biaryls. This conversion is illustrated by the coupling of the diazonium salt derived from anthranilic acid to give diphenic acid ((C6H4CO2H)2). In a related reaction, the same diazonium salt undergoes loss of N2 and CO2 to give benzyne. =Replacement by Halides= Sandmeyer reaction Benzenediazonium chloride heated with cuprous chloride or cuprous bromide respectively dissolved in HCl or HBr yield chlorobenzene or bromobenzene, respectively. :C6H5N+2 + CuCl -> C6H5Cl + N2 + Cu+ Gattermann reaction In the Gattermann reaction, benzenediazonium chloride is warmed with copper powder and HCl or HBr to produce chlorobenzene and bromobenzene respectively. It is named after the German chemist Ludwig Gattermann. :2Cu + 2C6H5N2+ -> 2Cu+ + H5C6-C6H5 + 2N2 (initiation) :C6H5N2+ + HX -> C6H5X + N2 + H+ (Cu+ catalysis) Replacement by iodide Iodine is not easily introduced into the benzene ring directly. However it can be introduced by treating arenediazonium cations with potassium iodide: :C6H5N2+ + KI -> C6H5I + K+ + N2 Replacement by fluoride Fluorobenzene is produced by thermal decomposition of benzenediazonium fluoroborate. The conversion is called the Balz-Schiemann reaction.. :[C6H5N+2]BF4- -> C6H5F + BF3 + N2 The traditional Balz‚ÄìSchiemann reaction has been the subject of many motivations, e.g. using hexafluorophosphates (PF6‚àí) and hexafluoroantimonate (SbF6‚àí) in place of tetrafluoroborates. The diazotization can be effected with nitrosonium salts such as [NO]SbF6. =Miscellaneous Replacements= Replacement by hydrogen Arenediazonium cations reduced by hypophosphorous acid Reinhard Bruckner, ed. Michael Harmata; Organic Mechanisms Reactions, Stereochemistry and Synthesis 3rd Ed, p.246, , ethanol or sodium stannite gives benzene: :[C6H5N2+]Cl- + H3PO2 + H2O -> C6H6 + N2 + H3PO3 + HCl :[C6H5N2+]Cl- + CH3CH2OH -> C6H6 + N2 + CH3CHO + HCl Replacement by a hydroxyl group Phenols are produced by heating aqueous solutions of arenediazonium salts: :C6H5N+2 + H2O -> C6H5OH + N2 + H+ This reaction goes by the German name Phenolverkochung (\\"cooking down to yield phenols\\"). The phenol formed may react with the diazonium salt and hence the reaction is carried in the presence of an acid which suppresses this further reaction. A Sandmeyer-type hydroxylation is also possible using Cu2O and Cu2+ in water. Replacement by a nitro group Nitrobenzene can be obtained by treating benzenediazonium fluoroborate with sodium nitrite in presence of copper. Alternatively, the diazotisation of the aniline can be conducted in presence of cuprous oxide, which generates cuprous nitrite in situ: :C6H5N+2 + CuNO2 -> C6H5NO2 + N2 + Cu+ Replacement by a cyano group The cyano group usually cannot be introduced by nucleophilic substitution of haloarenes, but such compounds can be easily prepared from diazonium salts. Illustrative is the preparation of benzonitrile using the reagent cuprous cyanide: :C6H5N+2 + CuCN -> C6H5CN + Cu+ + N2 This reaction is a special type of Sandmeyer reaction.  Replacement by a trifluoromethyl group  Two research groups reported trifluoromethylations of diazonium salts in 2013. Goossen reported the preparation of a CuCF3 complex from CuSCN, TMSCF3, and Cs2CO3. In contrast, Fu reported the trifluoromethylation using Umemoto's reagent (S-trifluoromethyldibenzothiophenium tetrafluoroborate) and Cu powder (Gattermann-type conditions). They can be described by the following equation: :C6H5N2+ + [CuCF3] -> C6H5CF3 + [Cu]+ + N2 The bracket indicates that other ligands on copper are likely present but are omitted. Replacement by a thiol group Diazonium salts can be converted to thiols in a two-step procedure. Treatment of benzenediazonium chloride with potassium ethylxanthate followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate xanthate ester gives thiophenol: :C6H5N2+ + C2H5OCS2- -> C6H5SC(S)OC2H5 :C6H5SC(S)OC2H5 + H2O -> C6H5SH + HOC(S)OC2H5 Replacement by an aryl group The aryl group can be coupled to another using arenediazonium salts. For example, treatment of benzenediazonium chloride with benzene (an aromatic compound) in the presence of sodium hydroxide gives diphenyl: :[C6H5N2+]Cl- + C6H6 -> C6H5-C6H5 + N2 + HCl This reaction is known as the Gomberg‚ÄìBachmann reaction. A similar conversion is also achieved by treating benzenediazonium chloride with ethanol and copper powder.  Replacement by boronate ester group  A Bpin (pinacolatoboron) group, of use in Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling reactions, can be installed by reaction of a diazonium salt with bis(pinacolato)diboron in the presence of benzoyl peroxide (2 mol %) as an initiator: :C6H5N2+X‚Äì \\\\+ pinB‚ÄìBpin ‚Üí C6H5Bpin + X‚ÄìBpin + N2 Meerwein reaction Benzenediazonium chloride reacts with compounds containing activated double bonds to produce phenylated products. The reaction is called the Meerwein arylation: :[C6H5N+2]Cl- + ArCH=CHCOOH -> ArC=C-C6H5 + N2 + CO2 + HCl Metal complexes In their reactions with metal complexes, diazonium cations behave similarly to NO+. For example, low-valent metal complexes add with diazonium salts. Illustrative complexes are [Fe(CO)2(PPh3)2(N2Ph)]+ and the chiral-at-metal complex Fe(CO)(NO)(PPh3)(N2Ph). Other methods for dediazotization * by organic reduction at an electrode * by mild reducing agents such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) * by gamma radiation from solvated electrons generated in water * photoinduced electron transfer * reduction by metal cations, most commonly a cuprous salt. * anion-induced dediazoniation: a counterion such as iodine gives electron transfer to the diazonium cation forming the aryl radical and an iodine radical * solvent-induced dediazoniation with solvent serving as electron donor Grafting reactions In a potential application in nanotechnology, the diazonium salts 4-chlorobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate very efficiently functionalizes single wall nanotubes. In order to exfoliate the nanotubes, they are mixed with an ionic liquid in a mortar and pestle. The diazonium salt is added together with potassium carbonate, and after grinding the mixture at room temperature the surface of the nanotubes are covered with chlorophenyl groups with an efficiency of 1 in 44 carbon atoms. These added subsituents prevent the tubes from forming intimate bundles due to large cohesive forces between them, which is a recurring problem in nanotube technology. It is also possible to functionalize silicon wafers with diazonium salts forming an aryl monolayer. In one study, the silicon surface is washed with ammonium hydrogen fluoride leaving it covered with silicon‚Äìhydrogen bonds (hydride passivation). The reaction of the surface with a solution of diazonium salt in acetonitrile for 2 hours in the dark is a spontaneous process through a free radical mechanism:Reaction sequence: silicon surface reaction with ammonium hydrogen fluoride creates hydride layer. An electron is transferred from the silicon surface to the diazonium salt in an open circuit potential reduction leaving a silicon radical cation and a diazonium radical. In the next step a proton and a nitrogen molecule are expelled and the two radical residues recombine creating a surface silicon to carbon bond. Diazonium salt application silicon wafer So far grafting of diazonium salts on metals has been accomplished on iron, cobalt, nickel, platinum, palladium, zinc, copper and gold surfaces. Also grafting to diamond surfaces has been reported. One interesting question raised is the actual positioning on the aryl group on the surface. An in silico study demonstrates that in the period 4 elements from titanium to copper the binding energy decreases from left to right because the number of d-electrons increases. The metals to the left of iron are positioned tilted towards or flat on the surface favoring metal to carbon pi bond formation and those on the right of iron are positioned in an upright position, favoring metal to carbon sigma bond formation. This also explains why diazonium salt grafting thus far has been possible with those metals to right of iron in the periodic table. Reduction to a hydrazine group Diazonium salts can be reduced with stannous chloride (SnCl2) to the corresponding hydrazine derivatives. This reaction is particularly useful in the Fischer indole synthesis of triptan compounds and indometacin. The use of sodium dithionite is an improvement over stannous chloride since it is a cheaper reducing agent with fewer environmental problems. Biochemistry Alkanediazonium ions, otherwise rarely encountered in organic chemistry, are implicated as the causative agents in the carcinogens. Specifically, nitrosamines are thought to undergo metabolic activation to produce alkanediazonium species. Metabolic activation of the nitrosamine NDMA, involving its conversion to an alkylating agent. Applications The first use of diazonium salts was to produce water-fast dyed fabrics by immersing the fabric in an aqueous solution of the diazonium compound, followed by immersion in a solution of the coupler (the electron-rich ring that undergoes electrophilic substitution). The major applications of diazonium compounds remains in the dye and pigment industry.Klaus Hunger, Peter Mischke, Wolfgang Rieper, et al. \\"Azo Dyes\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . =Other uses= Diazonium compounds are standard reagents used in synthesis of organic compounds, especially aryl derivatives. Diazonium salts are light sensitive and break down under near UV or violet light. This property has led to their use in document reproduction. In this process, paper or film is coated with a diazonium salt. After contact exposure under light, the residual diazo is converted to a stable azo dye with an aqueous solution of coupler. A more common process uses a paper coated with diazo, coupler and an acid to inhibit coupling; after exposure the image is developed by a vapor mixture of ammonia and water which forces coupling. Safety Solid diazonium halides are often dangerously explosive, and fatalities and injuries have been reported. The nature of the anions affects stability of the salt. Arenediazonium perchlorates, such as nitrobenzenediazonium perchlorate, have been used to initiate explosives.

As a child he hopped freight trains across the country and learned tattooing from a man named \\"Big Mike\\" from Palmer, Alaska, originally using the hand-pricking method. In the late 1920s he met Tatts Thomas from Chicago who taught him how to use a tattoo machine. He practiced on drunks brought in from Skid Row. He later sailed the Pacific Ocean before settling in Hawaii in the 1930s. At age 19, Collins enlisted in the United States Navy. During his subsequent travels at sea, he was exposed to the art and imagery of Southeast Asia. During his career as a tattoo artist, he worked as a licensed skipper of a large three- masted schooner, on which he conducted tours of the Hawaiian islands. In addition to sailing and tattooing, he played the saxophone in his own dance band and frequently hosted his own radio show, where he was known as \\"Old Ironsides\\".Old Ironside Tattoo, 1033 Smith St, Honolulu, HI 96817 Body artist Sailor Jerry made significant contributions to the art of tattooing. He expanded the array of colors available by developing his own pigments. He created custom needle formations that embedded pigment with much less trauma to the skin. He became one of the first artists to utilize single-use needles. His tattoo studio was one of the first to use an autoclave to sterilize equipment. Collin's last studio was at 1033 Smith Street in Honolulu's Chinatown, then the only place on the island where tattoo studios were located. Among Sailor Jerry's most well known designs were: * Bottles of booze * Snakes * Wildcats * The infamous \\"Aloha\\" monkey * Eagles, falcons and other birds of prey * Swallows * Motor heads and pistons * Nautical stars * Classically styled scroll banners * Knives, guns and other weapons * Dice * Anchors * Hawaii themes * Pin-up girls Legacy Sailor Jerry's influence on the art of modern tattooing is widely recognized.See, e.g., Margo DeMello, Bodies of Inscription: A Cultural History of the Modern Tattoo Community (2000); Arnold Rubin, \\"The Tattoo Renaissance\\", in Marks of Civilization: Artistic Transformations of the Human Body, ed. Arnold Rubin (1988); documentary film, \\"Hori Smoku: Sailor Jerry, The Life of Norman K. Collins\\" (2008). Sailor Jerry wanted at least one of three proteges/friends ‚Äì Ed Hardy, Mike Malone, or Zeke Owen ‚Äì to take over his shop (or else burn it) when he died. Since 2015, an annual independently produced event now takes place in Hawaii every June called the \\"Sailor Jerry Festival\\" to honor Collins's legacy and Chinatown roots on Oahu. The multi-venue event includes live music, DJ's, cabaret performances, an art show - featured artists have included Sailor Jerry's great-grand niece Madison Thomas, local artists, and Masami Teraoka, movie screenings, a pin-up fashion show ‚Äì where models wear outfits designed from Sailor Jerry flash, neighborhood tours, and tattoos available at three area shops, including Sailor Jerry's last location. A portion of the proceeds from the event is donated every year to the Collins family by the festival founder (Jason Miller of 808shows.com/Hawaiian Express Records) and his co- host 'Josh86' (a popular musician and entrepreneur). Image rights In 1999, Ed Hardy and Mike Malone partnered with Steven Grasse from the Philadelphia- based creative agency, Quaker City Mercantile, to establish Sailor Jerry Ltd. The limited company, which owns the commercial rights to Collins' letters, art, and flash (tattoos), uses his designs on clothing and items such as ash trays, sneakers, playing cards, churchkeys and shot glasses. As an anti- sweatshop company, Sailor Jerry Ltd. produces nearly all its items in the United States and sells them from the company's web site. The company also showcases rising talents within the Tattoo industry in its \\"Artist Series\\" which it describes as a way to \\"keep Sailor Jerry's legacy alive and kicking\\". Sailor Jerry Ltd. produces a 92 proof spiced Navy rum featuring a quintessential Sailor Jerry hula girl on the label. As the bottle is emptied, additional pin-up girls designed by Sailor Jerry are visible on the inner side of the label. The rum is distilled in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It takes its influence from Caribbean rum, which sailors would spice with flavors from the Far East and Asia. In 2010, the 40% ABV formula being sold in the United Kingdom was changed to include a less sweet taste in a move that was described as more \\"vanilla and caramel flavours\\". None of Collins' family profit from his creations or the things that have come from them since. There is a legal disagreement as to his naming rights. Personal life Sailor Jerry was married more than once and his widow Louise still resides in Hawaii, as do several of his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He is buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, a military cemetery located in Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu.

The name \\"Moshassuck\\" means \\"river where moose watered\\".Friends of the Moshassuck The river became very important during the Industrial Revolution, powering numerous mills and also connecting to the Blackstone River to function as the lower section of the Blackstone Canal. The southern end of the Moshassuck River was the center for the area's earliest mills in the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and the location of base-metal works and textile factories in the nineteenth century. Today it contains several industrial buildings, such as the Fletcher Building, now used for retail and office space. Further north on the Moshassuck are the few remaining early-and-late nineteenth-century buildings of the Allen Printworks, a textile-printing operation. In Pawtucket along the river are the remaining structures of the Hope Webbing Company and the Lorraine Mills.Providence Industrial Sites, issued in 1981 by the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission. By the mid nineteenth century, the pollution in the Moshassuck River had become so bad from factories dumping both industrial and human waste into the water that Rhode Island's cholera outbreaks of 1849 and 1854 were blamed on the state of the river. The first cleanup attempt on the river was started in 1897 by building sewers. During the twentieth century, the river steadily lost its functions as an industrial and transportation artery. When Interstate 95 was constructed during the 1960s, a ¬æ mile (1.2 km) section of the river was paved over, leaving the river underneath the road in a narrow concrete channel. The loss of industry along the river over the years has also done much to improve the quality of the water in the river; however, as of 2005, it still has the second highest fecal coliform level (2,206 units per 100 mL) of all the monitored rivers in Rhode Island.

He also served in the diplomatic corps, spending an extended period in 1818 and 1819 as a secretary to the Russian diplomatic mission at Naples.N. V. Fridman, –ü–æ—ç–∑–∏—è –ë–∞—Ç—é—à–∫–æ–≤–∞, Moscow, Nauka, 1971, pp. 124, 248. Biography The early years of Konstantin Batyushkov's life are difficult to reconstruct. He probably spent the first four years of his life in Vologda; the exact place he lived from 1792 to 1796 is unknown: possibly with his father, possibly with his grandfather, Lev Andreyevich Batyushkov, on their family estate, the village of Danilovskoe, Bezhetski district, Tver province. However, it was Konstantin's youth spent in St. Petersburg which played the most important part in his development as a poet. Batyushkov's earliest extant letter from St. Petersburg is dated 6 July 1797. His first years there were spent in Pensionnats (private boarding schools). Contact with his relatives was restricted to correspondence and rare meetings. From 1797 to 1800 he studied at the Pensionnat directed by O.P. Jacquinot; it was a rather expensive school for children of good families. The curriculum included Russian, French, German, divinity, geography, history, statistics, arithmetic, chemistry, botany, calligraphy, drawing and dancing. In 1801 Batyushkov entered a Pensionnat run by an Italian, I.A. Tripoli; he graduated in 1802. It was here that Batyushkov began to study Italian. His first literary offering, however, was a translation into French of Metropolitan Platon's Address on the occasion of the coronation of Alexander I of Russia. Early works 1802 is conventionally considered the beginning of Batyushkov's poetic career. He wrote in a letter to Nikolai Gnedich on 1 April 1810 that he had composed his first poem at the age of fifteen. Batyushkov quotes two lines; he felt that their main idea ‚Äî dissatisfaction with reality and a longing for \\"distant lands\\", both geographic and spiritual ‚Äî anticipated his mature work: \\"–ú—É–∑–∞ –º–æ—è, –µ—â—ë –¥–µ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, —É–≥–∞–¥–∞–ª–∞\\" (My Muse, while still a virgin, had divined it). Batyushkov began to write poetry seriously in 1804 (at least, the dating of his first works from 1802‚Äî03 is not documented). Two poems are conventionally regarded as having been written before the first published one. The first of these, \\"Bog\\" (God), is a direct imitation of Gavrila Derzhavin's spiritual odes (Echoes of Derzhavin continued to appear in Batyushkov's mature work, but as only one element of his own, highly individual, style). The other poem is \\"Mechta\\" (the title, usually translated as \\"Dream\\", can also mean \\"Fantasy\\" or \\"Imagination\\"). Never satisfied with the realization of his idea, Batyushkov reworked \\"Mechta\\" for the rest of his literary life; thus it is possible to illustrate the evolution of Batiushkov's versification and verbal style using only examples from successive wordings of this piece. Including both original and translated fragments, this piece became a manifesto of Batiushkov's own aesthetics: \\"Mechtan'e est' dusha poetov i stikhov\\" (Dreaming is the soul of poets and of verse). This brings him close to Nikolay Karamzin and the Vasily Zhukovsky, but even in \\"Mechta\\", the literary pose of an escapist and hedonist is already evident. It was most likely the programmatic nature of this, on the whole rather weak, poem that continued to hold the interest of its otherwise self-critical author. The journals, in which Batyushkov's first poems were published, are easy to link to his personal contacts. His first poetic offering was the satirical \\"Poslanie k stikham moim\\" (Epistle to My Verses); in January 1805 it appeared in \\"Novosti russkoi literatury\\", supplement to the periodical of Moscow University. In the army In the autumn of 1806 Napoleon occupied Berlin and most of Prussia, Russia's ally; Alexander I declared a mass levy. On 13 January 1807 Batyushkov, with the civil rank corresponding to the twelfth class, was attached to General Nikolai Nikolaevich Tatishchev's staff. On 22 February he enlisted in the Petersburg battalion of the Militia as sotennyi (a junior officer), and immediately set out for the West. On 2 March he was in Narva, on the 19 March in Riga, from where he sent letters to Gnedich, containing an impromptu and another verse epistle. When taking part in the Prussian campaign, he met Ivan Aleksandrovich Petin, an officer, who was to become another close friend. Batyushkov fought at the battle of Gutstadt (22‚Äî27 May); on 29 May he was seriously wounded at the battle of Heilsberg. (A year later, on 20 May 1808, he was awarded the Order of St. Anne, 3rd class, for bravery.) After the battle he was transported to hospital and then to Riga where he was convalescing during June and July 1807. Portrait by Orest Kiprensky (1815) In Riga, Batyushkov was living at the house of a merchant, M√ºguel, with whose daughter Emilie he fell in love. This episode formed the background for two poems: \\"Vyzdorovleniie\\" (Convalescence, 1815‚Äî16?), considered by Pushkin one of Batyushkov's best elegies, and \\"Vospominaniia 1807 goda\\" (Recollections of 1807), whose popularity is also testified to by Pushkin's note in his epistle \\"To Batyushkov\\" (1814). Both works strongly influenced the Russian elegy of the 1810s and 1820s. The idea of presenting the main works of world literature in the Russian language and making them part of Russian belles lettres is characteristic of the early nineteenth century. Batyushkov might have come to similar ideas under the influence of Gnedich who was already working on his translation of the Iliad. First and foremost in importance to the literati were heroic epopees. This is why in Batyushkov's correspondence with Gnedich, \\"your poet\\" and \\"my poet\\" are Homer and Tasso, although Batyushkov considered only two extracts from his incomplete verse translation of Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata worth publishing. In his translation Batyushkov ignored the metric and stanzaic form of the Italian original, octave, and used the \\"classical\\" alexandrine. In July 1809, he wrote his famous \\"Videnie na bregakh Lety\\" (A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe). \\"Videnie...\\" soon became widely known and brought the author a certain notoriety. In October 1809 it was sent to Gnedich who allowed to make a copy, which rapidly multiplied. Batyushkov wrote the poem following the French satirical tradition, but its material was wholly Russian: it describes a dream in which all contemporary Russian poets have unexpectedly died and turned up in Elysium; their works are immersed in the waters of the Lethe: those found wanting sink into oblivion. The Russian writers of the eighteenth century were not the main concern of the satire. In the poem, it is not only the notorious Ivan Barkov who escapes oblivion, but also Vasily Trediakovsky who was generally despised at that time. \\"Videnie\\" performs a balancing act between ridicule and obscenity, it is full of caustic allusions and offensively transformed or reinterpreted quotations. With \\"Videnie\\", Batyushkov's reputation was established; he began to regard himself as a mature and original poet, and started gathering material for a publication of his collected works. Napoleon Invasion On 22 April 1812 Batyushkov became an Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts at the Imperial Public Library. His colleagues included Gnedich, Krylov and Uvarov. In June he bought an apartment nearby. The quiet life (\\"thank God, I have wine, friends, tobacco...\\") was clouded only by ill-health (\\"I am so weak that shall not even outlive my verses\\"). But even now peace and calm denied Batyushkov: Napoleon invaded Russia on 12 June 1812. Batyushkov wrote to Pyotr Vyazemsky that had it not been for a fever, he would have immediately joined the army. The scenes of destruction deeply affected him and determined his attitude to the war; he wrote to Gnedich of the French: \\"Barbarians! Vandals! And this nation of monsters even dares to speak of freedom, of philosophy, of philanthropy!\\". On 29 March Batyushkov entered military service, with the rank of junior captain. It was the events of 1812 that dictated the mood of an epistle-elegy, \\"K Dashkovu\\" (To Dashkov), a turning-point in Batyushkov's poetics and weltanschauung. The poem echoes his personal letters and expresses his feelings on seeing Moscow in ruins. The War becomes an incarnation of Evil: \\"Moi drug! ia videl more zla / I neba mstitel'nogo kary\\" (My friend! I saw a sea of evil / And wrath of the avenging heavens). In January 1814 the Russians crossed the Rhine, entered France and moved in on the capital. The first month in Paris was an exciting time for Batyushkov. He even managed to attend a meeting of the Academy. Batyushkov's impressions were negative and he wrote on 25 April 1814 that the age of glory for French literature had passed. This letter was also a literary work; an abridged version was published by the poet's friends in 1827. In May Batyushkov fell ill, grew depressed and decided to return home. Batyushkov arrived in London in mid May and spent two weeks in England. On 25 May he was issued a passport to travel home via Sweden, and from 30 May to June was sailing from Harwich to Gothenburg. The crossing was described in a letter on 19 June 1814; Batyushkov later revised it as a traveller's sketch which was published in 1827. 1815-1817 Batyushkov in 1815; portrait by Nikolai Utkin In early January 1815 a crash of matrimonial hopes coupled with serious illness caused a nervous reaction. In March Batyushkov set off in search of spiritual healing. He spent the second week of Lent at a monastery in Tikhvin. It seems that Batyushkov experienced a religious conversion, evidence of which may be found in a poem of this year, \\"Nadezhda\\" (Hope). Apparently in the same year he composed a poem combining the motifs of love and fatal illness: \\"Posledniaia vesna\\" (The Last Spring), a free version of Charles-Hubert Millevoye's \\"La Chute des feuilles\\", one of the most popular elegies among Russian translators of the 1810s and 1820s. Another translation, \\"Mshchenie\\" (Vengeance) from Parny, was composed both as an addition to the earlier \\"Prividenie\\" (a \\"mirror image\\" of the same theme), and a possible sublimation of his disappointment in love, which was still eloquent in his poems. In the first half of 1815 Batyushkov came to meet the young Aleksandr Pushkin at Tsarskoe Selo; in the eyes of later generations this meeting took on a historic or even symbolic meaning. The verse volume of Opyty appeared in October 1817. It was divided into genre sections: \\"elegies\\" (opened by \\"Nadezhda\\" and concluded by a new version of \\"Mechta\\"); \\"epistles\\" (first, a \\"friendly\\" one, \\"Moi Penaty\\", and last, a \\"didactic\\" one to Murav'ev-Apostol); and \\"miscellanea\\" (a section with an undefined organizing principle, for some reason followed by three of Batiushkov's most recent works). Public recognition immediately followed. On 17 October 1817 Batyushkov became an honorary member of the \\"Military Society\\", on 18 November he was made an honorary librarian at the Public Library; and in April 1818 he became an honorary member of the \\"Free Society of the Lovers of Russian Letters\\". Insanity and death During 1820 Batyushkov's depression grew. In August he applied for leave to go to Germany, which was confirmed only in April 1821. From December 1820 to May 1821 he lived in Rome, then went to Teplitz for convalescence; in November he moved to Dresden. The first signs of approaching insanity were a series of quarrels on relatively insignificant grounds. In 1820 an editor of \\"Syn otechestva\\" journal, Aleksandr Voeikov, permitted himself an unauthorized publication of an epitaph by Batyushkov. The author overreacted: Batyushkov, infuriated, sent Gnedich a letter intended for \\"Syn otechestva\\", claiming he had abandoned his writing forever. Pletnev, a genuine admirer of Batyushkov, attempted to palliate his \\"guilt\\" by publishing a panegyrical \\"inscription\\" to Batyushkov ‚Äî who took it as yet another insult. Batyushkov's mind became clouded, and in a fit of depression he destroyed his latest manuscripts. On 18 September and 12 December 1821 Batyushkov applied for retirement. Instead, the Emperor Alexander I granted him indefinite leave. He came to St. Petersburg on 14 April 1822 and travelled to the Caucasus from May to July; in August he arrived in Simferopol, where, over the following months, symptoms of persecution mania became obvious. He burnt his books and three times attempted suicide. On 4 April 1823 he was sent to St. Petersburg, supervised by a doctor. For a whole year his relatives and friends looked after him. In April 1824 he wrote a completely mad letter to the Emperor with a request to enter a monastery. After a word with Zhukovsky, Alexander I decided to send the unfortunate writer for treatment at state expense. From 1824 to 1828 Batyushkov was at the \\"Maison de sant√©\\" in Sonnenstein (Saxony), from 1828 to 1833 in Moscow; and from 1833 onward he lived in Vologda. On 9 December 1833 the incurable Batyushkov was at last released from service and granted a life pension. When ill, he wrote only a few incoherent texts. His final poem was written in Vologda on 14 May 1853; it is a quatrain which concludes as follows: \\"Ia prosypaius', chtob zasnut', / I spliu, chtob vechno prosypat'sia\\" (I only wake to fall asleep / And sleep, to awake without end).

It was written in only four days in April 1838 and a revised version appeared in 1850. The work was dedicated to Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, but when a copy was sent to the Polish composer, \\"he commented favorably only on the design of the title page\\".Charles Rosen, The Romantic Generation, p. 284 Kreisleriana is a very dramatic work and is viewed by some critics as one of Schumann's finest compositions. In 1839, soon after publishing it, Schumann called it in a letter \\"my favourite work,\\" remarking that \\"The title conveys nothing to any but Germans. Kreisler is one of E. T. A. Hoffmann's creations, an eccentric, wild, and witty conductor.\\" In 1843, when he had moved from writing for solo piano to much larger works, in particular Paradise and the Peri, he still listed it as one of his best piano works.Stork, Karl, ed., The Letters of Robert Schumann, London, 1907, pp. 126, 241. The work's title was inspired by the character of Johannes Kreisler from works of E. T. A. Hoffmann. Like the kaleidoscopic Kreisler, each number has multiple contrasting sections, resembling the imaginary musician's manic depression, and recalling Schumann's own \\"Florestan\\" and \\"Eusebius,\\" the two characters Schumann used to indicate his own contrasting impulsive and dreamy sides. Johannes Kreisler appears in several books by Hoffmann, including Kater Murr and most notably in the Kreisleriana section of ', published in 1814. In a letter to his wife Clara, Schumann reveals that she has figured largely in the composition of Kreisleriana:  Movements  # (Extremely animated), D minor # (Very inwardly and not too quickly), B major. This movement in ABACA form, with its lyrical main theme, includes two contrasting intermezzi. In his 1850 edition, Schumann extended the first reprise of the theme by twenty measures in order to repeat it in full.Fisk, Charles, \\"Performance, Analysis and Musical Imagining Part II: Schumann's 'Kreisleriana', No. 2,\\" College Music Symposium, Vol. 37 (1997), p. 95. # (Very agitated), G minor # (Very slowly), B major/G minor # (Very lively), G minor # (Very slowly), B major # (Very fast), C minor/E major # (Fast and playful), G minor.

It revolves around a group of graffiti artists living in New York City who decide to make a mark on the city, and stars Mark Webber, Gano Grills, Jaclyn DeSantis, Jade Yorker, B√∂nz Malone, Kumar Pallana and Joey SEMZ. Bomb the System was the first major fictional feature film about the subculture of graffiti art since Wild Style was released 1982. Several well-known graffiti artists participated in the making of the film including Lee Qui√±ones, Cope2 and Chino BYI. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by El-P. In January 2004 the film was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature.  Brief history  The film was produced for US$500,000, expanded from the director's thesis project at NYU. The director, producer, cinematographer, and other key members of the crew had recently graduated from NYU and this was their first film. The film played at over 26 film festivals on four continents and was first offered distribution by Now on Media in Japan after the company's president saw a 1-minute clip at the 2004 Independent Spirit Awards. The film received a wide theatrical release in Japan and extensive press coverage. Palm Pictures distributed the film in the US and gave it a limited 2-theater release in New York City and Los Angeles on May 27, 2005. Palm decided not to open the film wider despite positive reviews in The New York Times, LA Times, Variety, Rolling Stone, and The Village Voice and a per-screen average gross of US$4,588. The film was released on DVD October 8, 2005.  Critical response  Rolling Stone called the film a \\"next-gen update of 1982's Wild Style. With strong whiffs of Trainspotting and Kids\\" that \\"distinguishes itself with streaky, Krylon-bright editing and El-P's eerie soundtrack beats.\\" Village Voice noted the movie was \\"birthed from a blunt-fueled blend of Aronofskian frenzy and nostalgia for the agreeable griminess of mid-'90s Wu-Tang Clan videos.\\" Los Angeles Times critic Kevin Crust wrote, \\"Lough's impressive, if uneven, debut feature captures the adrenaline rush and contradictory nature of the simultaneously creative and criminal activity.\\" The New York Times review was the most positive: \\"The movie runs on the synergy between this grimy but glamorous urban landscape and the emotional intensity of characters who at moments suggest contemporary descendants of the innocent, tormented teenagers in Rebel Without a Cause. Bomb the System, which rides on a subtle hip-hop soundtrack, might be described as soulful pulp; cult recognition awaits it.\\" The negative reviews were mainly scathing. The New York Post called the film \\"a mild, slow-moving drama that belatedly tries to argue that graffiti writers are political artists, not an urban blight\\"; The New York Daily News called the film \\"brashly passionate in its desire to express the power and validity of graffiti art. But it's also preachy and single-minded, populated by a world of sympathetic heroes and hissable villains\\"; and Sean Axmaker in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer likened the film to \\"tomcats spraying outside their yards.\\" Jim Jarmusch wrote, \\"For Bomb the System director Adam Lough takes far more inspiration from the on-going graffiti culture than from the depleted stylistic formulas of recent commercial cinema. His refreshing use of skewed camera angles, blasts of color, and inventive cutting are deftly blended, becoming much more than calculated atmosphere. The performances are also consistently strong, and Mark Webber in particular, in the central role, never hits a false note. Bomb the System is welcome proof that the spirit of graffiti writing has a continuing cultural influence on both the subtleties of form and explosive personal expression.\\" Parts of the quotation ran in a Village Voice ad on the second weekend of the film's release.  Sticker controversy  Shortly after the theatrical release, a movie theater in Delaware was closed down after a promotional Bomb the System sticker was found illegally posted in the theater. Due to fear of terrorism, the theater manager called the police and bomb squad and the theater was shut down for a few hours while the canine unit sniffed for bombs. Nothing was found. In all actuality, \\"Bombing\\" has nothing to do with actual explosives in graffiti terminology - \\"to bomb\\" is graffiti slang for covering a surface with graffiti.

Eddy's signature, 10/1854 Ezra Butler Eddy (August 22, 1827 - February 10, 1906) was a Canadian businessman and political figure. Born in Vermont, Eddy moved to Canada and founded the E. B. Eddy Company, which produced matches, and related wood products, and later diversified into pulp and paper, growing to a major manufacturer. Eddy later became a politician, serving as mayor of Hull, Quebec and Quebec legislator. Early life Although born in the United States, Ezra Butler Eddy who was one of Canada's most progressive manufacturers, became one of its most loyal citizens and few men of his time were more devoted to his Sovereigns institutions and more imbued with the National traditions and aspirations than was he. Descended from the oldest Puritan stock, the blood of Miles Standish flowed in his veins. Lois Eastman, his grandmother, being a Standish and direct descendant of that New England hero. He was born near Bristol, Vermont on August 22, 1827, the son of Samuel Eddy and Clarissa Eastman. His father was of Scottish ancestry. With respect to his religious connections, he was brought up a Baptist. He was brought up on the farm until he was about ten and during some of that time he attended the district school. His father then moved from the farm into the village of Bristol and began hotel-keeping, and young Eddy became his assistant. While here he again had the privilege of attending school for four winters. Not caring for his mode of life, and having a strong inclination for general business, at the age of fifteen, Ezra left home and went to New York City, and here he procured a situation in a mercantile at three dollars a week, and on that sum had to board himself. He was, however, promoted in three months and received ten dollars per week, and he was soon entrusted with the banking business of the firm. After a year, not enjoying city life, he returned to Vermont, and commenced business for himself, by purchasing butter, cheese, etc., and taking the same to Boston and New York markets. Manufacturing Eddy first began manufacturing wooden matches by hand in Burlington, Vermont in 1851. In 1854, he brought his business to Hull, Canada East (now Gatineau, Quebec) when he was only twenty-four, where he began producing matches using discarded wood from the nearby sawmills. With the help of his first wife, E. B. Eddy produced his matches by hand at his home in Hull. His business grew rapidly, becoming one of the largest match factories in the world. In 1856 he added the manufacture of wooden ware, such as pails, tubs, washboards, clothes-pins, etc., to his business. In 1858 he commenced lumbering in a small way; but all these branches increased in volume from year to year, up to 1868, when the business had reached a magnitude of one million dollars per annum; and at the present time the yearly out-put is upwards of $1,500,000. In 1882 his entire premises were consumed by fire, and this entailed upon him a loss of $250,000, over and above insurance. With characteristic enterprise and courage, in the space of twelve months new premises were erected, and he was able to turn out nearly the same quantity of goods, as during former years.A Cyclopedia of Canadian biography By 1886, he had reorganized and established the E. B. Eddy Company. He set up a factory, acquired timber rights and built his sawmill. At the same time, he expanded into the pulp and paper business. Mayor For thirteen years, at different times he occupied the position of Mayor of Hull. He represented Ottawa electoral district in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1871 to 1875. He was a member of the municipal council for Hull from 1878 to 1888 and mayor from 1881 to 1885, from 1887 to 1888 and from 1891 to 1892. He tabled the bill creating the City of Hull in 1875. Besides running his factories, he was an administrator of the Canada Central Railway Company. 1900 fire After the great fire on April 26, 1900, Eddy was able to re-establish operation in less than a year in spite of the fact that he had suffered an estimated loss of 3 million dollars in the fire. In spite of the fires that repeatedly ravaged his factories and his house, Eddy persevered. He was an astute and canny industrialist whose success during this era of industrial capitalist expansion was due, in part, to his involvement in politics. Personal life He was highly esteemed, not only in Hull but throughout Canada. He founded the Eddy Lodge, A. F. & A. M. of the Grand Lodge of Quebec, and was also a Knight Templar. He was married twice, first in Bristol, Vermont, on December 29, 1884, to Zaida Diana Arnold, daughter of Uriah Fields Arnold and John Arnold, of Frankfort-on-the-Main, Germany. She bore him three children, two sons and one daughter. The boys, Rollin and Samuel, died in infancy, but his daughter, Ella Clarissa, survived him. She died in 1893. He wed his second wife, Jennie Grahl Shirreff, in Halifax on June 27, 1894. Upon his death, she became his principal heir. Death He died at Standish Hall, Hull, Quebec, on February 10, 1906, and his body was taken to Bristol, Vermont where he was buried at the Bristol Board Cemetery. Eddy's company was one of the major employers in the region for over a hundred years. The pulp and paper business is now a division of Domtar and Eddy Match Company is now a brand name of Atlas Matches of Euless, Texas. In 1976, a plaque was dedicated to Ezra Butler Eddy in Hull, Quebec.

Diazotization  The process of conversion of primary aromatic amines into its diazonium salt is called diazotization. Diazonium salts are important synthetic intermediates that can undergo coupling reactions to form azo dyes and electrophilic substitution reactions to introduce functional groups. Uses of the reaction Aromatic azo compounds tend to be brightly colored due to the extended conjugated systems. Many are used as dyes (see azo dye). Important azo dyes include methyl red and pigment red 170. Azo printing exploits this reaction as well. Azo coupling is also used to produce prontosil and other sulfa drugs.

Set in an Oregon psychiatric hospital, the narrative serves as a study of institutional processes and the human mind as well as a critique of psychiatry and a tribute to individualistic principles. It was adapted into the Broadway (and later off-Broadway) play One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Dale Wasserman in 1963. Bo Goldman adapted the novel into a 1975 film directed by Milo≈° Forman, which won five Academy Awards. Time magazine included the novel in its \\"100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\\" list. In 2003 the book was listed on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's 200 \\"best-loved novels.\\"\\"BBC ‚Äì The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003, Retrieved August 23, 2017 Plot The book is narrated by \\"Chief\\" Bromden, a gigantic yet docile half- Native American patient at a psychiatric hospital, who presents himself as deaf and mute. Bromden‚Äôs tale focuses mainly on the antics of the rebellious Randle Patrick McMurphy, who faked insanity to serve his sentence for battery and gambling in the hospital rather than at a prison work farm. The head administrative nurse, Nurse Ratched, rules the ward with absolute authority and little medical oversight. She is assisted by her three day-shift orderlies and her assistant doctors and nurses. McMurphy constantly antagonizes Nurse Ratched and upsets the routines of the ward, leading to endless power struggles between the inmate and the nurse. He runs a card table, captains the ward's basketball team, comments on Nurse Ratched's figure, incites the other patients to conduct a vote about watching the World Series on television, and organizes a deep-sea fishing trip wherein the patients were going to be \\"supervised\\" by prostitutes. After claiming to be able, and subsequently failing, to lift a heavy control panel in the defunct hydrotherapy room (referred to as the \\"tub room\\"), his response‚Äî\\"But at least I tried\\"‚Äîgives the men incentive to try to stand up for themselves, instead of allowing Nurse Ratched to take control of every aspect of their lives. The Chief opens up to McMurphy, revealing late one night that he can speak and hear. A violent disturbance after the fishing trip results in McMurphy and the Chief being sent for electroshock therapy sessions, but such punishment does nothing to curb McMurphy's rambunctious behavior. One night, after bribing the night orderly, McMurphy smuggles two prostitute girlfriends with liquor onto the ward and breaks into the pharmacy for codeine cough syrup and unnamed psychiatric medications. McMurphy, having noticed on the fishing trip that Billy Bibbit‚Äîa timid, boyish patient with a stutter and little experience with women‚Äîhad a crush on the prostitute named Candy, primarily arranged this break-in so that Billy could lose his virginity; to a slightly lesser extent, it was also arranged so that McMurphy and other patients could throw an unsanctioned party. Although McMurphy agrees before the end of the night to a plan involving his escaping before the morning shift starts, he and the other patients instead fall asleep without cleaning up the mess of the group's antics, and the morning staff discovers the ward in complete disarray. Nurse Ratched finds Billy and the prostitute in each other's arms, partially dressed, and admonishes him. Billy asserts himself for the first time, answering Nurse Ratched without stuttering. Ratched calmly threatens to tell Billy's mother what she has seen. Billy has an emotional breakdown, regressing immediately back to a boyish state, and, upon being left alone in the doctor's office, takes his life by cutting his own throat. Nurse Ratched blames McMurphy for the loss of Billy's life. Enraged at what she has done to Billy, McMurphy attacks Ratched, sexually assaulting her by ripping her shirt open and attempting to strangle her to death. McMurphy is physically restrained and moved to the Disturbed ward. Nurse Ratched misses a week of work due to her injuries, during which time many of the patients either transfer to other wards or check out of the hospital forever. When she returns she cannot speak and is thus deprived of her most potent tool to keep the men in line. With Bromden, Martini, and Scanlon the only patients who attended the boat trip left on the ward, McMurphy is brought back in. He has received a lobotomy, and is now in a vegetative state, rendering him silent and motionless. The Chief smothers McMurphy with a pillow during the night in an act of mercy before lifting the tub room control panel that McMurphy could not lift earlier, throwing it through a window and escaping the hospital. Background One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement and deep changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America. The 1960s began the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization, an act that would have affected the characters in Kesey's novel. The novel is a direct product of Kesey's time working the graveyard shift as an orderly at a mental health facility in Menlo Park, California. Not only did he speak to the patients and witness the workings of the institution; he also voluntarily took psychoactive drugs, including mescaline and LSD, as part of Project MKUltra. In addition to his work with Project MKUltra, Kesey took LSD recreationally. He advocated for drug use as a path to individual freedom, an attitude that was reflected in the views of psychological researchers of the time.Masters, R.E.L. & Jean Houston, (1966) The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience, America Press Inc., 115(4). 110.The LSD Pother (1966), America Press Inc., 115(14). 377 In the 1960s LSD was thought to offer the best access to the human mind. Each individual's experiences were said to vary; emotions and experiences ranged from transformations into other life forms, religious experiences, and extreme empathy. It was Kesey's experience with LSD and other psychedelics that made him sympathetic toward the patients. The novel constantly refers to different authorities that control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. The novel's narrator, the Chief, combines these authorities in his mind, calling them \\"The Combine\\" in reference to the mechanistic way they manipulate and process individuals. The authority of The Combine is most often personified in the character of Nurse Ratched who controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of rewards and subtle shame. Although she does not normally resort to conventionally harsh discipline, her actions are portrayed as more insidious than those of a conventional prison administrator. This is because the subtlety of her actions prevents her prisoners from understanding they are being controlled at all. The Chief also sees the Combine in the damming of the wild Columbia River at Celilo Falls, where his Native American ancestors hunted, and in the broader conformity of post-war American consumer society. The novel's critique of the mental ward as an instrument of oppression comparable to the prison mirrored many of the claims that French intellectual Michel Foucault was making at the same time. Similarly, Foucault argued that invisible forms of discipline oppressed individuals on a broad societal scale, encouraging them to censor aspects of themselves and their actions. The novel also criticizes the emasculation of men in society, particularly in the character of Billy Bibbit, the stuttering Acute patient who is domineered by both Nurse Ratched and his mother. Central elements of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest embody Erving Goffman's sociological analysis of total institutions, particularly the analytical subset of mental hospitals. Goffman's description of admission procedures in total institutions, for example, reflects the notion of \\"the combine\\" espoused by Chief Brombden's character: \\"Admission procedures might be called 'trimming' or 'programming' because, in thus being squared away, the new arrival allows himself to be shaped and coded into an object that can be fed into the administrative machinery, to be worked on smoothly by routine operations\\" (p. 16). Further, the behavior of the patients in One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest represent the range of adaptations to total institutions delineated in section VI of \\"The Inmate World\\" in the essay, \\"Characteristics of Total Institutions.\\" Title The title of the book is a line from a nursery rhyme: Vintery, mintery, cutery, corn, Apple seed and apple thorn, Wire, briar, limber lock Three geese in a flock One flew East One flew West And one flew over the cuckoo's nest Chief Bromden's grandmother sang a version of this song to him when he was a child, a fact revealed in the story when the Chief received yet another ECT treatment after he assisted McMurphy with defending George, a patient being abused by the ward's aides. Main characters * Randle McMurphy: A free-spirited, rebellious con man, sent to the hospital from a prison work farm. He is guilty of battery and gambling. He had also been charged with - but never convicted of, due to the girl in question not wishing to testify so as not to implicate herself and her willingness to participate‚Äîstatutory rape. McMurphy is transferred from a prison work farm to the hospital, thinking it will be an easy way to serve out his sentence in comfort. In the end, McMurphy attacks Nurse Ratched, sacrificing his freedom and his health in exchange for freeing the previously shackled spirits of the cowed patients on the ward. * Chief Bromden: The novel's half-Native American narrator has been in the mental hospital since the end of World War II. Bromden is presumed by staff and patients alike to be deaf and mute, and through this guise he becomes privy to many of the ward's dirtiest secrets. As a young man, the Chief was a high school football star, a college student, and a war hero. After seeing his father, a Native American chieftain, humiliated at the hands of the U.S. government and his white wife, Chief Bromden descends into clinical depression and begins hallucinating. Soon he is diagnosed with schizophrenia. He believes society is controlled by a large, mechanized system which he calls \\"The Combine.\\" ** Richard Gray, author of A History of American Literature, said Bromden \\"supplies\\" the novel's \\"vision\\". Gray explains Bromden's \\"eye\\" \\"sees the inner truth\\" and Bromden \\"is an outsider, an innocent eye in a way like Huck Finn, but what he sees is far stranger, far more surreal.\\" Gray explained Bromden's vision \\"may not be literally true but it is symbolically so because, to quote Emily Dickinson again, 'Much madness is divinest sense.'\\" The first chapter ends with the Chief pleading to the reader, \\"...you think this is too horrible to have really happened, this is too awful to be the truth! But, please. It's still hard for me to have a clear mind thinking on it. But it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\" =Staff= * Nurse Ratched (also known as \\"Big Nurse\\"): The tyrannical head nurse of the mental institution, who exercises near-total control over those in her care, including her subordinates. She will not hesitate to restrict her patients' access to medication, amenities, and basic human necessities if it suits her manipulative whims. Her favorite informant is the timid Billy Bibbit, whom she coerces into divulging the unit's secrets by threatening to complain about him to his mother. McMurphy's fun-loving, rebellious presence in Ratched's institution is a constant annoyance, as neither threats nor punishment nor shock therapy will stop him or the patients under his sway. Eventually, after McMurphy nearly chokes her to death in a fit of rage, Nurse Ratched has him lobotomized. However, the damage has already been done, and Nurse Ratched's rule is broken after McMurphy's attack leaves her nearly unable to speak, which renders her unable to intimidate her patients, subordinates and superiors. * The \\"Black Boys\\" Washington, Williams and Warren: Three black men who work as aides in the ward. Williams is a dwarf, his growth supposedly ‚Äústunted after witnessing his mother being raped by white men.‚Äù The Chief says Nurse Ratched hired them for their sadistic nature. * Dr. John Spivey: The ward doctor. Nurse Ratched drove off other doctors, but she kept Spivey because he always did as he was told. Harding suggests that the nurse could threaten to expose him as a drug addict if he stood up to her. McMurphy's rebellion inspires him to stand up to Nurse Ratched. * Nurse Pilbow: The young night nurse. Her face, neck, and chest are stained with a profound birthmark. She is a devout Catholic and fears sinning. She blames the patients for infecting her with their evil and takes it out on them. * Mr. Turkle: An elderly African American aide who works the late shift in the ward. He agrees to let McMurphy host a party and sneak in prostitutes one night. * The Japanese Nurse: The nurse in charge of the upstairs disturbed ward, for violent and unmanageable patients. She is kind and openly opposes Nurse Ratched's methods. =Acutes= The acutes are patients who officials believe can still be cured. With few exceptions, they are there voluntarily, a fact that angers McMurphy when he first learns of it, then later causes him to feel further pity for the patients, thus further inspiring him to prove to them they can still be strong despite their seeming willingness to be weak. * Billy Bibbit: A nervous, shy, and boyish patient with an extreme speech impediment, Billy cuts and burns himself, and has attempted suicide numerous times. Billy has a fear of women, especially those with authority such as his mother. To alleviate this, McMurphy sneaks a prostitute into the ward so Billy can lose his virginity. The next morning, Nurse Ratched threatens to tell his mother; fearing the loss of his mother's love, Billy has an emotional breakdown and commits suicide by cutting his own throat. * Dale Harding: The unofficial leader of the patients before McMurphy arrives, he is an intelligent, good-looking man who's ashamed of his repressed homosexuality. Harding's beautiful yet malcontent wife is a source of shame for him. * George Sorensen: A man with germaphobia, he spends his days washing his hands in the ward's drinking fountain. McMurphy manages to persuade him to lead a fishing expedition for the patients after discovering he had captained a PT boat during World War II. Afterward, the three black boys maliciously forcibly delouse him, cruelly knowing the mental anguish this will cause him. * Charlie Cheswick: A loud-mouthed patient who always demands changes in the ward, but never has the courage to see anything through. He finds a friend in McMurphy, who's able to voice his opinions for him. At one point McMurphy decides to fall in line when he learns his stay in the ward is indefinite and his release is solely determined by the Big Nurse. As a result, Cheswick drowns himself in the ward's swimming pool when he decides he himself will never escape the relentless Big Nurse. * Martini: A patient who suffers from severe hallucinations. * Scanlon: A patient obsessed with explosives and destruction. He is the only other non-vegetative patient confined to the ward by force aside from McMurphy and Bromden; the rest can leave at any time. * Jim Sefelt and Bruce Fredrickson: Two epileptic patients. Sefelt refuses to take his anti-seizure medication, as it makes his teeth fall out and as such makes him self-conscious over his appearance. Fredrickson takes Sefelt's medication as well as his own because he is terrified of the seizures, and loses teeth due to the resulting overdosage. * Max Taber: An unruly patient who was released before McMurphy arrived, a broken man. The Chief later describes how, after he questioned what was in his medication, Nurse Ratched had him \\"fixed.\\" =Chronics= The chronics are patients who will never be cured. Many of the chronics are elderly and/or in vegetative states. * Ruckly: A hell-raising patient who challenged the rules until the Big Nurse authorized his lobotomy. After the lobotomy, he sits and stares at a picture of his wife, and occasionally screams profanities. * Ellis: Ellis was put in a vegetative state by electroshock therapy. He stands against the wall in a disturbing messianic position with arms outstretched. * Pete Bancini: Bancini suffered brain damage at birth but managed to hold down simple jobs, such as a switch operator on a lightly-used railroad branch line, until the switches were automated and he lost his job, after which he was institutionalized. The Chief remembers how once, and only once, he lashed out violently against the aides, telling the other patients that he was a living miscarriage, born dead. * Rawler: A patient on the Disturbed ward, above the main ward, who says nothing but \\"loo, loo, loo!\\" all day and tries to run up the walls. One night, Rawler castrates himself while sitting on the toilet and bleeds to death before anyone realizes what he has done. * Old Blastic: An old patient who is in a vegetative state. The first night McMurphy is in the ward, Bromden dreams Blastic is hung by his heel and sliced open, spilling his rusty visceral matter. The next morning, Bromden learns Blastic died during the night. * The Lifeguard: An ex- professional football player, he still has the cleat marks on his forehead from the injury that scrambled his brains. He explains to McMurphy, unlike prison, patients are kept in the hospital as long as the staff desires. It is this conversation that causes McMurphy to fall in line for a time. * Colonel Matterson: The oldest patient in the ward, he suffers from severe senile dementia and cannot move without a wheelchair. He is a veteran of the First World War, and spends his days \\"explaining\\" objects through metaphor. =Other characters= * Candy: The prostitute McMurphy brings on the fishing trip. Billy Bibbit has a crush on her and McMurphy arranges a night for Candy to have sex with him. * Sandra: Another prostitute and friend of Candy and McMurphy. She and Sefelt sleep together on the night she and Candy are sneaked into the ward late one night. Sefelt has a seizure while they are fornicating. * Vera Harding: Dale Harding's wife. Described as an attractive lady with very big breasts. She is a primary cause of concern for Dale, who often worries about her fidelity. Controversy One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of America's most challenged and banned novels. * 1974: Five residents of Strongsville, Ohio sued the local Board of Education to remove the novel from classrooms. They deemed the book \\"pornographic\\" and said it \\"glorifies criminal activity, has a tendency to corrupt juveniles, and contains descriptions of bestiality, bizarre violence, and torture, dismemberment, death, and human elimination\\". * 1975: Randolph, New York and Alton, Oklahoma removed the book from all of their public schools. * 1977: Schools in Westport, Maine removed it from required reading lists. * 1978: Freemont High School in St. Anthony, Idaho banned it and fired the teacher who assigned it. * 1982: Merrimack, New Hampshire High School challenged it. * 1986: Aberdeen Washington High school challenged it in Honors English classes. * 2000: Placentia Unified School District (Yorba Linda, California) challenged it. Parents said the teachers could \\"choose the best books, but they keep choosing this garbage over and over again\\". Adaptations The novel was adapted into a 1963 play, starring Kirk Douglas (who purchased the rights to produce it for the stage and motion pictures) as McMurphy and Gene Wilder as Billy Bibbit. A film adaptation, starring Jack Nicholson, and co-produced by Michael Douglas was released in 1975. The film won five Academy Awards. The characters of Nurse Ratched and Chief Bromden appear as recurring characters in ABC's Once Upon a Time, where they are portrayed by Ingrid Torrance and Peter Marcin. Netflix and Ryan Murphy produced a prequel series titled Ratched which follows Sarah Paulson as a younger version of Nurse Ratched. The first of the two season order was released on September 18th, 2020.

It is an association in the United States with headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. Members include soloists, orchestral players, jazz and world music performers, teachers, adult amateurs, and students of all ages. The organization was founded in 1972 by flutist Mark Thomas and incorporated in 1973 in the state of Indiana. In 1973, an ad-hoc committee was created to help plan a convention of flutists. The group became the members of the first Board of Directors. Past presidents, program chairs, and committee chairs have included principal flutists of American orchestras, soloists and chamber musicians, and professors at conservatories and universities. Notable members include Sir James Galway and Ian Anderson. The first administrative role was established in 1977 and the organization currently has five full-time staff members.  Annual Conventions  The NFA Convention is the largest annual flute event in the world, with more than 3,000 attendees and 80 exhibitors each year. The four-day event includes hundreds of workshops, masterclasses, competitions, and performances. Conventions are held in cities across the United States. Previous locations include San Diego, Washington D.C., New York City, and Chicago.  Committees  NFA members have established committees that focus on individual components of the organization and the concerns of the wider flute community, including highlighting less prominent areas of flute musicianship, such as low and Baroque flute, reaching out to underserved communities, and providing pedagogical guidance, among other initiatives. These committees helped establish the NFA‚Äôs music commission program, create scholarships and competitions, and collect pedagogical materials aimed at young flutists.  Competitions  NFA competitions create opportunities for young and emerging flutists to compete and gain performance and audition skills. The Annual NFA Convention currently hosts 15 performance competitions in solo, flute choir, and masterclass categories and four non-performance competitions, which highlight new flute music, research, and entrepreneurship.  Commissions  The NFA commissions original compositions for all members of the flute family. The New Music Advisory Committee, established in 1985, works with the NFA Board to create opportunities for flutists to interact with contemporary composers by playing their music and ensuring today's composers create substantial repertoire for flute players. The NFA has commissioned more than 70 new works for both flute and piccolo. Beginning in 1986, the NFA has commissioned a new piece to be used as repertoire in the Young Artist Competition each year. In 1989 a yearly commission for a new work for the High School Soloist Competition was added. The NFA also commissions a piece for the bi-annual Piccolo Artist Competition, as well as special project commissions. Composers include winners of the Pulitzer Prize, Prix de Rome, and other awards.  Scholarships  The NFA has established numerous scholarship programs for continuing education, including cultural outreach scholarships in 15 U.S. and non-U.S. cities. The NFA supports promising students with several scholarships named after flutists whose involvement in the organization helped shape its vision: The annual Frances Blaisdell Scholarship, named for Frances Blaisdell, provides a U.S. high school or undergraduate student with the opportunity to receive complimentary registration for that year‚Äôs convention and take advantage of the many performances, workshops, and sessions being offered. Every other year, the NFA offers the Myrna Brown Scholarship, which allows an international student to attend and present at the Annual Convention. The NFA also offers several scholarship prizes at the convention. The Geoffrey Gilbert Scholarship prize is awarded to the NFA High School Soloist Competition first-place winner for further flute study with any teacher who is a member of the NFA. The Deveau Scholarship is awarded for the outstanding performance of the NFA High School Soloist Competition commissioned work.  Awards  Since 1991 the National Flute Association has honored the best and the brightest of its colleagues with the Lifetime Achievement Award. The debut award went to Jean-Pierre Rampal. Other notable recipients include Julius Baker and Sir James Galway. The NFA also gives out the Distinguished Service Award, first given to John Solum in 1998.  The NFA Library  The NFA Library was established in 1973 when exhibiting publishers at the first convention were asked to donate copies of their music. The NFA holds the largest lending library of flute music internationally with a catalog of more than 15,000 works, many of which are rare or out of print. The library is located at the University of Arizona Fine Arts Library in Tucson, Arizona.  Publications  NFA members create ongoing publications to communicate with the flute world and share valuable research, history, educational, and pedagogical resources. The NFA‚Äôs member magazine, The Flutist Quarterly, is published each season and includes contributions from members, flute scholars, and other enthusiasts from around the world. The NFA also produces special publications, including The Flutist‚Äôs Handbook, Kindcaidiana, and historic recordings.

Career As an employee of TSR, Rose Estes came up with an idea for a new sort of game, which would become the Endless Quest. Estes wrote the first four books in the series, beginning with Dungeon of Dread (1982). These first four Endless Quest books were on the Best Seller list for more than six months. TSR considered Endless Quest ultimately a fad, and worked to diversify its new mainstream publishing; Estes and James M. Ward thus formed an education department, which ultimately failed due to TSR's decision not to hire educational sales staff. After contributing extensively to TSR, Inc.'s Dungeons & Dragons Endless Quest series (of which she wrote the first six, as well as others later down the line), she wrote her first full-length novel, Children of the Dragon (1985). After Gary Gygax left TSR, Estes wrote new books in the \\"Greyhawk Adventures\\" series, starting with Master Wolf (1987) and ending with The Eyes Have it (1989). She continued to write for TSR by writing six volumes in a series of Greyhawk novels.

Despite its name, it is not a governmentally funded national theatre, but operated by a private, non- profit organization. History This historic playhouse was founded on December 7, 1835, by William Wilson Corcoran and other prominent citizens who wanted the national capital to have a first-rate theatre. The theatre's initial production was Man of the World. The theatre has been in almost continuous operation since, at the same Pennsylvania Avenue location a few blocks from the White House. Its name was changed at times to \\"Grover's National Theatre,\\" and \\"Grover's Theatre,\\" as management changed. Famed actor Joseph Jefferson managed the theatre at one time. The structure has been rebuilt several times, including partial reconstructions after five fires in the 19th century. The current building, at 1321 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, was constructed in 1923, opening in September of that year. Exterior view of the National Theatre, circa 1920s Located three blocks from the White House, the theater has entertained every U.S. President of the United States since Andrew Jackson. On April 14, 1865, Tad Lincoln was attending a performance of Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp at Grover's Theater when his father, President Abraham Lincoln, was assassinated at Ford's Theatre. Like many theatres in the U.S. prior to the civil rights movement, the National Theatre was racially segregated. Black actors were allowed to appear on stage, but African Americans audience members were relegated to a special section. During the Washington run of Porgy and Bess in 1936, the cast, led by Todd Duncan, protested the audience's segregation. Duncan stated that he \\"would never play in a theatre which barred him from purchasing tickets to certain seats because of his race.\\" Management allowed for the first integrated performance at National Theatre. A movement to integrate the playhouse was spearheaded by actor Helen Hayes, educator Gilbert V. Hartke, O.P., Washington art impresario Patrick Hayes, and Washington Post theatre critic Richard L. Coe. When that effort failed, they persuaded Actors Equity performers to refuse to play at the theatre. Rather than desegregating, the New York management discontinued live performances in 1948. One prestige attraction, the Washington premier of the British film The Red Shoes, was presented. Earlier in 1941, Walt Disney's Fantasia played at the theatre for seven weeks, also as a prestige attraction. Then the theatre remained dark until it reopened as an integrated theater in 1952. The National Theatre is located across from Freedom Plaza (foreground) In 1970, the theatre came under the management of the Nederlander Organization.The Broadway Battle Flares in Washington In 1974, the not-for- profit National Theatre Corporation was established by Roger L. Stevens, Maurice B. Tobin, Donn B. Murphy and others to save the failing enterprise, in the wake of racial riots, and a downtown made unfashionable by the growth of the surrounding suburbs. The theatre underwent a major renovation in 1982-1983, when the original wing housing dressing rooms was replaced with a modern structure. The refurbished structure opened in concert with the redevelopment of that part of downtown Washington, D.C., that included The Shops at National Place, the 774 room flagship JW Marriott Hotel, and National Press Club. Stage designer Oliver Smith supervised the interior design. The 1835 stone foundations and brick stage house still exist, although the rock work is now reinforced with steel caissons to resist erosion by the Tiber Creek, which flows beneath the building. From the stage, President Ronald Reagan saluted the refurbished \\"neighborhood theatre\\" in January 1984. Among the Broadway productions which have had out-of-town try-outs at the National are Amadeus, Crazy for You, Hello, Dolly!, If/Then, Show Boat and West Side Story. In 2012, Jam Theatricals assumed operations for the theatre from the Shubert Organization. Jam Theatricals and Nederlander National Markets LLC merged in 2019, and the Nederlander family regained control of the theater. Performers The many performers who have appeared at the theatre include Pearl Bailey, Ethel Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore and John Barrymore, Warren Beatty, Sarah Bernhardt, Claire Bloom, Edwin Booth, John Wilkes Booth, Fanny Brice, Tom Burke, Carol Channing, George M. Cohan, Claudette Colbert, Katharine Cornell, Hume Cronyn, Tim Curry, Denishawn, Ruth Draper, Todd Duncan, Maurice Evans, Lillian Gish, Ruth Gordon, Valerie Harper, Julie Harris, Rex Harrison, Helen Hayes, Audrey Hepburn, Katharine Hepburn, Joseph Jefferson, James Earl Jones, Lucille La Verne, Eva LeGallienne, Jerry Lewis, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, Eartha Kitt, Ian McKellen, Mary Martin, Ethel Merman, Idina Menzel, Rita Moreno, Helen Morgan, Rosie O'Donnell, Laurence Olivier, Annie Oakley, Geraldine Page, Robert Redford, Debbie Reynolds, Chita Rivera, Will Rogers, Rosalind Russell, George C. Scott, Kevin Spacey, Sting, Jessica Tandy, Norma Terris, Marlo Thomas, Lily Tomlin, Franchot Tone, Rip Torn and Liv Ullmann. Winston Churchill once spoke from the stage. Operations The National Theatre has expanded its activities to include not only Broadway musical performances but also concerts, lectures, opera, ballet, seminars and receptions. The National Theatre Corporation is a non-profit organization that is responsible for the operation of the theatre. Sarah K. Bartlo, is the Executive Director. The National Theatre Group (Jam Theatricals) manages the daily activities of the theatre and provides content for the main stage. Citations See also *Theater in Washington D.C.

Playing career Born in Botley, Hampshire, Roper was a prolific scorer as a schoolboy. He was spotted playing parks football by Toby Keleher, assistant manager to Tom Parker, and in July 1940 was persuaded to sign for his local club, Southampton, making his debut for them during wartime matches. By the resumption of competitive football in 1946, Roper had established himself as a \\"two-footed powerful (right) winger\\". After impressing in the Second Division in 1946‚Äì47 he was signed by Arsenal in the close season for ¬£12,000, plus George Curtis and Tom Rudkin moving in the opposite direction, an estimated total fee of ¬£24,000. Arsenal had been so keen to secure Roper's signature that their manager Tom Whittaker had made eleven visits to The Dell. Roper immediately became a regular for the Gunners, playing 40 times and scoring ten goals in 1947‚Äì48, as Arsenal won the First Division. He switched to the left wing in 1949‚Äì50 but was displaced by Denis Compton in Arsenal's FA Cup-winning side of 1950. He regained his place the following season, and continued to be a near ever-present for Arsenal for the next five. He played in Arsenal's 1952 FA Cup Final defeat to Newcastle United, although in that match he was forced to deputise for full back Walley Barnes after Barnes was stretchered off with an injury. In 1952‚Äì53 Roper enjoyed one of his finest seasons ‚Äì winning another League title and earned an England B cap against Scotland B, although he never played for the full England side. He also scored five in a friendly match against Hibernian in 1952, which was one of the first in the country to be played under floodlights. Roper enjoyed another two seasons as a first-team regular, but lost his Arsenal first-team place during 1955‚Äì56, dropping down to the reserves. He played 321 matches for Arsenal in total, scoring 95 goals. He rejoined former club Southampton who were now in the Third Division (South), in January 1957. He went on to become club captain, playing alongside star player Derek Reeves and the young Terry Paine. At the end of the 1958‚Äì59 season Roper fell out with the club over terms and alleged promises from Ted Bates of a place as trainer and left nursing a grudge which he never overcame, refusing to attend any club reunions or even to visit The Dell. He finished his career by playing for Weymouth and Dorchester Town, finally retiring from the game in 1963. He also played first- class cricket for Hampshire once in 1947 against Cambridge University. After retiring from the game, he settled in Southampton and worked as an engineer. He died in 2001, at the age of 78.

It was formed in 1922 by nineteen schools in the state of Texas. Since then it has expanded to 300 chapters throughout the United States. It is an open society that invites university juniors, seniors and graduate students who are in the top 10 percent of their class into its ranks. History In 1915, Southwestern University President Charles M. Bishop created an honor society to encourage and promote superior students. Faculty at Southwestern reached out to four other colleges and universities in Texas to create an intercollegiate honor society. On February 22, 1922, the Scholarship Societies of Texas was formed. A year later, representatives from thirteen schools met on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin and six other schools mailed in votes to establish the organization's first constitution. These nineteen schools went on to establish their own chapters of the organization including the Nolle Scholarship Society at Southwest Texas State Normal College, now known as Texas State University‚ÄìSan Marcos. Between 1926 and 1927 the honor society expanded to schools in Arkansas and Louisiana resulting in the name changing to the Scholarship Societies of the South. Dean Alfred H. Nolle, after whom Southwest Texas' chapter was named, became President of the newly named organization; Nolle would later serve as the secretary-treasurer for nearly fifty years. With plans for further expansion, in 1934 the organization voted to change its name again, this time to Alpha Chi. The name was chosen such that its initials AX would come from the Greek words aletheia for truth and œáŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫œÑŒÆœÅ for character. At the 2007 National Convention a membership category for graduate students was created allowing them to join the society as well as college juniors and seniors. Its current headquarters is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Membership The Alpha Chi Honor Society is open to college juniors, seniors and graduate students who are in the top 10% of their class. Invitations to join the organization are issued directly to eligible students by faculty sponsors of active Alpha Chi organizations. Alpha Chi membership is a lifetime membership for a one-time fee of $75. The society inducts about 12,000 new members each year through its 403 chapters. Awards The national headquarters for Alpha Chi sponsors twenty-six scholarships and fellowships to active members, totaling each year. Undergraduate students can receive the Gaston/Nolle Scholarship to help fund their senior year of college. Members who will be attending their first year of graduate school can compete for the Sledge/Benedict Fellowship. Other active members who are currently, or will be, a graduate student can earn the Pryor Fellowship. Alpha Chi's regional headquarters and university chapters may also offer their own scholarships.

Subsection 3(4) of the Act allowed government departments to retain records that were either still in use 30 years after creation or were of special sensitivity, such as intelligence agency materials and weapons of mass destruction information. The time of opening was subsequently reduced to 30 years by the Public Records Act 1967 and then access was completely redefined as being on creation, unless subject to an exemption, by the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Australian Constitution (Public Record Copy) Act 1990 was passed in 1990 on the request of Australia to allow the original copy of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 to be permanently removed from the Public Records Office and given to Australia. The UK government agreed as a gift to celebrate the bicentenary of British settlement in Australia.

He has represented New Zealand in Test match, One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket as well as playing for Auckland in New Zealand domestic cricket and Worcestershire and Lancashire in English domestic cricket. In December 2013 it emerged that Vincent was being investigated by the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit (ACSU) in relation to allegations of his involvement in the spot-fixing of dozens of professional cricket matches, including matches in the Indian Cricket League, the ECB 40, the Bangladesh Premier League and the Champions League Twenty20.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid;=11257902 In June 2014, the Bangladesh Cricket Board found him guilty for not alerting authorities that he had been approached and banned him for three years. On 1 July 2014, he accepted that he was involved in match fixing on many occasions. The England and Wales Cricket Board imposed a lifetime ban on Vincent playing in any form of cricket, applying to sanctioned matches by the ECB, the International Cricket Council or any other national cricket federation. Early and personal life Vincent was born in Warkworth, New Zealand and is the son of well known ABC NewsRadio sports announcer Mike Vincent. Vincent became interested in cricket at an early age as his father used to represent Eden Roskill Cricket Club of Auckland in first grade cricket and took Lou to all the international matches at Eden Park. At the age of 15, his parents separated with Mike and Lou moving to Adelaide in Australia where Lou began playing in the age-tournaments. After Vincent was left out of several important age-group games by his coach, he decided to move back to New Zealand at the age of 18. When Vincent returned to New Zealand he had the opportunity to play for New Zealand in the 1998 Under 19 Cricket World Cup. He played for Esholt Cricket Club of the Bradford Cricket League in England during the off season while continuing to play for Auckland in New Zealand domestic cricket. He also considered jockeying as a career and has umpired Australian Rules football. Domestic career =First-class cricket= Vincent played for Auckland from 1997 to 2008 competing in the Plunket Shield First Class competition, the Ford Trophy Domestic One Day competition and the HRV Cup Twenty20 competition. In 2006, Vincent signed for Worcestershire to play county cricket for part of the English season. He had a fine debut on 25 June, making 83 from 91 balls to help set up a 50-run win over Yorkshire in the C&G; Trophy. Lancashire League side Ramsbottom announced that they had signed Lou Vincent as a professional for the 2008 season despite strong interest from the Australian domestic side Southern Redbacks in signing him. Vincent replaced the previous club professional, Sunil Joshi. Vincent had also played for Central Lancashire Cricket League side Rochdale in 2005 where he had an impressive league tally for the season of 656 before having to miss the last 10 games of the league after being called up for New Zealand's training camp ahead of a series in Zimbabwe. Whilst playing for Ramsbottom, Vincent signed for Lancashire as a replacement overseas player for the duration of the 2008 Twenty20 tournament. He replaced Mohammed Yousuf as the club's overseas player, who himself had replaced the Australian Brad Hodge ‚Äì both were on International duty. Lancashire's cricket manager, Mike Watkinson, said that the club \\"have brought in a player with a great reputation in the format who will add firepower to our top order. He is an exciting player and excellent fielder, just what we need for Twenty20 cricket\\". Vincent made his debut during the Championship game at Old Trafford between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. He made 5 in the first innings and 19 in the second innings with the match finished in a draw. Vincent made his Lancashire Twenty20 debut against Leicestershire hitting 31 from 26 balls with Lancashire won the game by 52 runs. During Lancashire's seventh Twenty20 group game against Derbyshire at Old Trafford Vincent hit 102 from 63 balls which included 11 fours and three sixes with a strike rate of 161.90. Lancashire won the game by 9 wickets and Vincent was named man of the match. Through this innings Vincent became the fourth Lancashire player to hit a Twenty20 century, the previous players being Mal Loye, Stuart Law and Brad Hodge. The innings came after Vincent was controversially dropped for the Yorkshire home game 72 hours earlier which Lancashire lost by 4 runs at Old Trafford. Vincent followed this up by hitting 56 from 36 balls in Lancashire's eighth Twenty20 group game against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford. The innings included 9 fours and one six with a strike rate 155.56. Vincent won the man of the match award for the second time in three days and helped secure Lancashire's qualification to the Quarter Finals where they were drawn to play Middlesex. Lancashire succumbed to a narrow defeat by 12 runs and were eliminated from the tournament. Lancashire announced that Vincent was to stay on at the club as their overseas player for the remainder of the 2008 season. Brad Hodge, Lancashire's Australian designated overseas player for the 2008 season, could not return to play for Lancashire due to the ill health of his wife. Hodge had been playing in the Indian Premier League and for Australia during their tour of the West Indies and was due to return to Lancashire. In 2010 Vincent played for Northants in the T20 competition. In the 2011 season Vincent represented Sussex for all forms of the game. International career A right-handed batsman, Vincent made his Test match debut in 2001‚Äì02 when he opened the batting against Australia at Perth. In a bizarre New Zealand first innings of 534/9 declared which saw four players make hundreds but no one else reach double figures, Vincent made 104. He followed this up with 54 in the second innings. In 2005‚Äì06, Vincent hit 172 in a One Day International against Zimbabwe at Harare to set a new record for the highest individual innings for New Zealand in ODIs, beating Glenn Turner's 171 not out against East Africa in the 1975 World Cup. Vincent's innings came off just 120 balls, and included 16 fours and nine sixes. Vincent was recalled into the New Zealand squad for the Commonwealth Bank Tri Series due to the sudden retirement of veteran Nathan Astle midway through the series. Once in Australia he became New Zealand's most prolific run scorer, with three consecutive half centuries, contributing to three consecutive totals of over 290. Vincent played in the early stages of the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean but after scoring a century and fielding well he caught a blow in the nets from Shane Bond and fractured his wrist. He was replaced in the squad by Hamish Marshall. After being dropped from the national team due to the implementation of a rotation policy and despite his good form Vincent suffered from Major depressive disorder and his contract with New Zealand Cricket was then later terminated with his signing for the Chandigarh Lions of the Indian Cricket League cited as the reason. Some commentators have mentioned unfair treatment of Vincent by the then New Zealand coach John Bracewell as the main cause for his departure from the national team.

He came to prominence in an incident where he accused his platoon commander, Ilario Pantano, of shooting two unarmed captives while on patrol in Mahmudiyah, Iraq on April 15, 2004. Coburn's accusation was at odds with Pantano's account of events which stated that the shootings were done in self-defence as he was rushed by the insurgent prisoners. Coburn's accusation led to Pantano being charged with murder but was later cleared of any wrongdoing. April 15th incident As the platoon approached a compound in Haditha (needs citations...), they saw a vehicle with two Iraqis in it. Pantano ordered his men to stop the vehicle and to have the occupants of the vehicle handcuffed. The vehicle was searched for weapons. Lieutenant Pantano remained with the captives, while the rest of his platoon secured the compound. The compound was deserted, but his men found a cache of arms, including \\"several mortar aiming stakes, a flare gun, three AK47 rifles, 10 AK magazines with assault vests and IED making material.\\"Scarborough, Ryan. When Pantano learned that the compound contained weapons, he ordered Sergeant Daniel Coburn and Corpsman George Gobles to watch for enemies. He then released the captives from their bonds. According to a statement Lieutenant Pantano made to military investigators in June 2004, he then used hand signals to order the captives to search the vehicle again. According to Pantano, during the search of the vehicle he felt the Iraqis posed a threat to him (needs citation). They were talking, and Pantano believed they were conspiring together. When they both turned to face each other, he shouted \\"Stop!\\" in both Arabic and English, and when they did not, he shot them. After emptying his magazine, he continued to fire. He later stated: \\"I then changed magazines and continued to fire until the second magazine was empty...I had made a decision that when I was firing I was going to send a message to these Iraqis and others that when we say, 'No better friend, No worse enemy,' we mean it. I had fired both magazines into the men, hitting them with about 80 percent of my rounds.\\" Indictment In June 2004, Sergeant Coburn registered a complaint about the incident, triggering a Naval Criminal Investigative Service probe. On February 1, 2005, Pantano was charged with two counts of premeditated murder, and faced the death penalty if convicted. Autopsy report Prior to Pantano's Article 32 hearing the Department of Defense had maintained that it was impossible to do a post-mortem examination on the corpses of Lieutenant Pantano's captives because they were buried in a cemetery that was in an area that was not under U.S. control. However, shortly before the hearing, bodies were exhumed after all. The autopsy report was released the day after the Article 32 recommendation was made and, according to the Washington Times, supported Lt. Pantano's version of events. Witnesses Medical corpsman George Goble was present but did not witness the danger Lieutenant Pantano reported, because he was looking outwards, as ordered. He later stated when he turned back he saw the Iraqis trying to run away. Sergeant Coburn is reported to have said \\"As soon as I turned my back, Lt. Pantano opened [fire] with approximately 45 rounds.\\" Coburn, throughout the case, gave five distinctly separate versions of events. Lieutenant Pantano's defense counsels have said they believe that Sergeant Daniel Coburn's account should not be given any credit because he was disgruntled, having been demoted recently due in part to a poor performance evaluation by Pantano. Another witness, \\"Corporal 'O' \\", was an Arabic- speaking Nigerian-American in Pantano's platoon. His full name was kept confidential at Pantano's hearing because he is being trained for counter- intelligence duties. In his testimony at Pantano's hearing, Corporal \\"O\\" described interviewing the two captives. He described seeing the vehicle being searched by other Marines, including the removal of its seats. He described seeing the corpses of the captives, following the shooting, face down, with the heads and torsos in the vehicle and their knees resting on the ground, as if Pantano shot the captives in the back while they were kneeling facing the vehicle. Corporal \\"O\\" described the sight as \\"weird\\". Sergeant Coburn was heavily criticized for some interviews he had given (he was under a gag order) as well as untruths concerning the evidence in the case (citation needed). Coburn's internet statements The blogosphere also played a major role. Coburn made remarks on Euphoric Reality during the case that were in direct contradiction of his statements to naval investigators. The blog owner turned in the comments to Pantano's attorney, who confronted Coburn on the stand with his own remarks in a dramatic cross-examination that resulted in Coburn being taken off the stand and read his Miranda rights. Coburn returned to the stand three days later after being granted immunity. Recommendations Major Winn recommended to Major General Huck, commander of Lieutenant Pantano's division, that the murder charges be dropped. It was his assessment that Sergeant Coburn was an uncredible witness. He did, however, recommend that Pantano receive non-judicial punishment for conduct unbecoming an officer, for the sign he left on the corpses. He described Lieutenant Pantano's treatment of his captive's corpses as a \\"desecration\\". Under U.S. military law, the decision as to whether a court-martial takes place was with General Huck. He decided not to refer the case to a court-martial.

Biography =Early life= Born in Jackson, Mississippi, Brown was a graduate of Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, California, where he played high school baseball with Darryl Strawberry. The 1979 Crenshaw High Cougars baseball team was the subject of Michael Sokolove's The Ticket Out: Darryl Strawberry and the Boys of Crenshaw. Brown was selected by the Giants in the second round (44th overall) during the 1979 amateur draft. =Professional baseball career= San Francisco Giants After a steady climb through the Giants minor league system, Brown made his major league debut for them in 1984 as a September call-up. In his first full season in 1985, Brown batted .261 with 16 home runs and 61 runs batted in (RBIs) for the last-place Giants, made the All-Rookie team, and finished fourth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting; Brown also led the NL in times being hit by pitch (11). In 1986, Brown batted .317 and made the NL All-Star team after hitting nearly .350 in the season's first half. The same season, he was involved in an infamous brawl. At the end of 1986 he complained of shoulder soreness. That offseason, an examination by Dr. Frank Jobe in Los Angeles discovered that there was indeed a serious problem, and surgery was performed that winter. The following season, with Brown hitting a paltry .242 after 38 games, the Giants sent him packing on July 5 along with Keith Comstock, Mark Davis, and Mark Grant in a midseason trade to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Kevin Mitchell, Dave Dravecky, and Craig Lefferts. San Diego Padres and Detroit Tigers Brown's play declined further as the year progressed, and he ended the year with a .237 average; the Giants went on to win the NL West division, and the Padres finished in last place. After dropping to a .235 average in 1988 for San Diego, Brown was dealt to the Detroit Tigers and was out of baseball by 1989 at the age of 28. In his career he batted .269 with 38 home runs, 184 RBIs, 164 runs, 410 hits and 21 stolen bases in 449 games. Brown batting for the Giants in 1985 =Life after baseball= After retirement, Brown lived in Houston, Texas, with his wife Lisa and their two children, Paris Brown and Gordon Pickett. In 2004, Brown worked in Iraq driving an 18-wheel truck delivering diesel fuel for Halliburton. He took fire on numerous occasions, including in a convoy that was attacked on April 9, 2004, in which six Halliburton drivers and one soldier were killed and another driver kidnapped and later released. By 2006, Brown had returned to the United States. Brown died at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston on December 26, 2006, nearly a month after he suffered burns in a fire at a vacant house he owned in Sugar Land, Texas.

For a short time in the 1750s he was tutor in the household of Henry Home, Lord Kames. In 1760 he was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates. From 1761 to 1800, Millar was Regius Professor of Civil Law at Glasgow, where his lectures gained him nationwide fame. His colleagues and supporters included Smith, Kames, and David Hume. Millar was elected Clerk of the Senate of the University of Glasgow in 1772.University of Glasgow. Biography, John Millar Retrieved 201-05-03 Millar's Origin of the Distinction of Ranks, published in 1778, advanced the view that economic system determines all social relations, even those between the genders. Such a view later became known as economic determinism, and was an important influence on Marxism. Werner Sombart described Millar's book as \\"one of the best and most complete sociologies that we possess\\". His Historical View of the English Government, published from 1787, was an important contemporary history of England, representing a milestone in the development of historiography. Millar engaged with other historians, drawing comparisons with the works and emphasised the social and economic bases of political system, which strongly differentiated his work from most of the earlier ones, which were more speculative than scientific. Family Millar lost a daughter by consumption in 1791, and his wife in 1795. His eldest son, John, a promising young man, went to the bar, and married the daughter of Dr. Cullen. He published a book, \\"Elements of the Law relating to Insurances\\", in 1787. Ill-health and the unpopularity of the Whiggism which he inherited from his father induced him to emigrate in the spring of 1795 to America, where he died soon afterwards from a sunstroke. Three sons and six daughters survived their father. Of these James became professor of mathematics at Glasgow; the second, William joined the Royal Artillery; the third was a writer to the signet. One daughter, Agnes was married to James Mylne, professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow, and another, Margaret, to Dr. John Thomson, by whom she was mother of Allan Thomson, professor of surgery at Edinburgh. He left his manuscripts to his eldest son, to Professor Mylne, and to John Craig, his nephew, by whom some were published in 1803.http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1192&type;=P Memorials In 1985 the John Millar Chair of Law at the University of Glasgow was established in his memory.University of Glasgow.

The first hotel was built on North Webb Road in Wichita, Kansas, United States, and opened in 1996. The brand's locations are extended-stay hotels focused primarily on rate-sensitive business travelers, also known as corporate transient travelers. Typically corporate transient travelers stay only during the week, leaving the occupancy of the subject hotels lower during the weekend. However, with true extended-stay business being over seven days, and often beyond 30 days, it allows the hotel to maintain a higher occupancy average overall. While this occupancy generally comes with a lower average rate or average daily rate (ADR), the revenue per available room sold (RevPAR) is typically higher as a result of the significantly higher occupancy and penetration rate within the respective markets. A Candlewood Suites in Gillette, Wyoming Typical amenities provided by Candlewood in line with brand standards and according to the IHG website include spacious suites with fully equipped kitchenettes, free local calls, voice mail, data ports, and two phone lines; an on-site convenience store with food items at a low price (the Candlewood Cupboard); a free entertainment library of CD's and videos available at the front desk; complimentary guest laundry; a free 24-hour exercise facility; free fax service; and an outdoor barbecue gazebo.

In 2008, the Anita Thigpen Perry School of Nursing at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center was renamed in her honor. Early life and education Perry was born in Haskell, Texas. She is the youngest daughter of family physician Joseph Eltidge Thigpen (1920‚Äì2013), a native of Bay Springs, Mississippi, and homemaker Beunis Fay Ratliff Thigpen, originally from Haskell. Her parents met in Tyler, where Beunis was visiting relatives. Her father had a distinguished flight record in World War II and earned several medals, including the Bronze Star. He also flew his own plane and was known for making house calls long after the practice ceased to be the norm. Her paternal grandfather was also a doctor and also named Joseph Thigpen.

She then obtained a Master of Science degree in nursing from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. She worked in the nursing profession for more than 17 years, including surgery, pediatrics, intensive care, administration, and teaching and as a consultant.

She is remembered for playing the title character in the cult film Candy where she appeared with John Huston, Ringo Starr, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, Richard Burton and Marlon Brando. She is known to horror film fans for starring in Death Smiles at a Murderer, Death Laid an Egg and Ceremonia Sangrienta (aka Legend of Blood Castle).  Biography  Ewa Aulin rose to fame in her native Sweden when she won the title of Miss Teen Sweden in 1965 at age 15. In the same year Aulin had been approached by Gunnar Fischer to appear as the young girl in his short film Dj√§vulen's Instrument (The Devil's Instrument). Subsequently, she represented Sweden in the first ever Miss Teen International pageant, which was held on April 6, 1966 in Hollywood, California. Aulin won; thereby earning the title of Miss Teen International 1966. Aulin's success as Miss Teen International attracted attention not only in Sweden, where she appeared on the popular entertainment show Hylands H√∂rna, but also in Italy, and in 1967 at age 16, she made her feature-film debut with a supporting role in the comedy Don Giovanni in Sicilia (Don Juan in Sicily), based on the novel by Vitaliano Brancati. This film led to a movie career for Aulin that would last a little more than six years, starting with leading roles in two notable giallo films: the pop art-style Col cuore in gola (With Heart in Mouth, 1967) directed by Tinto Brass, and the avant-garde La morte ha fatto l'uovo (Death Laid an Egg, 1968) directed by Giulio Questi. Aulin's co- star in both these films was Jean-Louis Trintignant. In late 1967, Aulin was cast as the title character in her most famous film, the American-Italian- French co-production Candy, directed by Christian Marquand. Aulin learned that she had the role only the day before filming began in early December 1967. The story involves Aulin's character's search for the meaning of life, which leads to encounters with a variety of different men and always ends in a sexual situation. The film did poorly in America and failed to make an international star out of Aulin. It was more successful in Europe and has gained some popularity as a cult film in later years. Aulin, in particular received praise for performance in the film, earning a Golden Globe nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. As a consequence of her appearance in this role, Aulin was stereotyped as something of a 'blonde nymphet' by people in the film industry. The only other American film Aulin appeared in was Start the Revolution Without Me (1970), a comedy of errors set during the French Revolution. Aulin played a supporting role as Christina of Belgium, and the film starred Gene Wilder and Donald Sutherland, but like Candy, the film did little business in America. Later the same year, Aulin starred in the experimental film Microscopic Liquid Subway to Oblivion, which was written and directed by Aulin's husband who used family money to set himself up as a film producer, using the Anglo sounding stage name John Shadow. They had married secretly in Mexico in early 1968. The film itself barely was released anywhere in the world. After this, Aulin only appeared in Italian films. Many of her films were sex comedies set in the Middle Ages but she also managed to make more impact in drama and thriller films. She played one of the leads in the giallo The Double (1971) directed by Romolo Guerrieri, as well as leading roles in Quando l'amore √® sensualit√† (When Love Is Lust, 1973) and Jorge Grau's Ceremonia Sangrienta (1973), played an undead avenging angel in Joe D'Amato's gothic horror film La morte ha sorriso all'assassino (Death Smiles at a Murderer, 1973) and also appeared in the thriller Una vita lunga un giorno (Long Lasting Days, 1973). Aulin and John Shadow had divorced in 1972. In 1974, at age 24, Aulin married a builder, Cesare Paladino, and by him had two daughters. One of her daughters, Olivia Paladino, is partner of Giuseppe Conte, 58th prime minister of Italy. She abandoned her acting career, enrolled at university, and became a teacher. Since her retirement, she has appeared only in one other film, Mi fai un favore (Stella's Favor, 1996), in a supporting role.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117031/reference Filmography Ewa Aulin with singer Mino Reitano (1973) *Don Juan in Sicily (1967, director: Alberto Lattuada) *Col cuore in gola (1967, director: Tinto Brass) *Candy (1968, director: Christian Marquand) *Death Laid an Egg (1968, director: Giulio Questi) *Start the Revolution Without Me (1970, director: Bud Yorkin) *Microscopic Liquid Subway to Oblivion (1970, director: John Shadow) *The Double (1971, director: Romolo Guerrieri) *This Kind of Love (1972, director: Alberto Bevilacqua) *Rosina Fumo viene in citt√†... per farsi il corredo (1972, director: Claudio Gora) *Fiorina la vacca (1972, director: Vittorio De Sisti) *My Pleasure Is Your Pleasure (1973, director: Claudio Racca) *Death Smiles on a Murderer (1973, director: Joe D'Amato) *Ceremonia sangrienta (1973, director: Jorge Grau) aka Legend of Blood Castle *When Love Is Lust (1973, director: Vittorio De Sisti) *Long Lasting Days (1973, director: Ferdinando Baldi) *Stella's Favor (1996, director: Giancarlo Scarchilli) References External links * * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Landskrona Municipality Category:Swedish film actresses Category:Swedish beauty pageant winners Category:Swedish schoolteachers ","title":"Ewa Aulin"},{"id":"2531732","text":"Grange Beach in summer Southeast-facing view of the historic Marine Apartments over the coastal sand dune north of Grange jetty The Grange, Charles Sturt's cottage Grange is a coastal suburb of the City of Charles Sturt, in Adelaide, South Australia, located 11 kilometres from the Adelaide city centre. Geography Grange is a suburb with partial frontage to Gulf St Vincent located about west of the Adelaide city centre. Its land boundaries (in clockwise order from the north-west) are Fort Street, Military Road, Trimmer Parade, Sportsmans Drive, Brebner Drive, Frederick Road and Grange Road. History Originally called The Grange, the suburb is named after Captain Charles Sturt's cottage, which originally stood on of farmland. Sturt's farm was subdivided in 1878 by a private company intending to establish a beach resort. The cottage still stands and is now a museum. In 1945, the name was adopted in 1945 by the local government area of the Town of Henley and Grange following agreement between it and the state's Nomenclature Committee and other government agencies. Boundaries were also established in 1945 over that portion of the Town of Henley and Grange located north of Kirkcaldy Beach Road. On 30 September 1976, its boundaries were revised along with adjoining suburbs including Tennyson and the new suburb of West Lakes. On 19 November 2009, land bounded by Trimmer Parade, Sportsmans Drive, Brebner Drive and Frederick Road was removed from the adjoining suburb of Seaton and added to the northern side of Grange following a proposal put forward by a resident group associated with the \\"Grange Golf Course Estate\\" and sponsored by the City of Charles Sturt. Demographics The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 5,238 persons in Grange on census night. Of these, 47.1% were male and 52.9% were female. The majority of residents (77.1%) are of Australian birth, with an additional 5.9% naming England as their country of birth. The age distribution of Grange residents is skewed slightly higher than the greater Australian population. 72% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 28% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%.

The Phalangist forces launched a surprise attack on the Tigers, a 500-man militia that was the armed force of the National Liberal Party of former Lebanese President Camille Chamoun. The attack was supposed to be conducted at around 4:00 a.m., but in order to spare the life of Camille's son and commander of the Tigers Dany Chamoun, the attack was postponed to 10:00 a.m. to make sure that Dany left for Fakra. The attack claimed the lives of roughly 83 people. Prior to the attack, Camille Chamoun decided to disarm the militia in order to avoid further bloodshed from both the Phalangists and the Tigers. Since that time, the National Liberal Party has survived only as a political party although the Tigers were virtually wiped out.

Mayfair is home to a large Irish American population. History Mayfair Diner Before development in the 1920s, Mayfair was essentially farmland and home to The Edwin Forrest Home for Children (near present-day Frankford and Shelmire Avenue) and The Oxford and Lower Dublin Poor House (west of present-day Rowland and Sheffield Aves). First established in 1929, Mayfair came to fruition in the years following World War II as a community that provided fresher and more spacious living in an urban environment. It was constructed over farmland surrounded by the established neighborhoods of Tacony, Holmesburg and Fox Chase. Mayfair featured several groundbreaking concepts for city dwellers: bigger rowhomes with yards in the front and parking garages in the back. The automobile became the primary mode of transportation and shopping retail centers became available close to home, as shopping districts developed along Roosevelt Boulevard and Cottman Avenue. Development also served to connect the surrounding neighborhoods of the Northeast that had previously been isolated. In these regards, Mayfair was a forerunner to American suburbanization, an early part of the population shift from the inner city to its outer regions. Education Residents are zoned to the School District of Philadelphia. The Ethan Allen School and Edwin Forrest School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mayfair Elementary School is also in Mayfair. Ethan Allen and Mayfair elementary are K-8 schools, while Edwin Forrest-zoned students go onto Austin Meehan Middle.\\"Edwin Forrest Elementary School Geographic Boundaries .\\" School District of Philadelphia.

Lincoln High was originally scheduled to be named Mayfair High School, but opposition from other neighborhoods meant that the school was instead named after Abraham Lincoln. Mayfair residents had a negative reception to this change. In 1949 the school's cornerstone was laid. Mayfair Elementary School also opened in 1949.

His career, which began in 1959, has specialised in examining the underside of society, and his photographs have depicted the unemployed, downtrodden and the impoverished.  Early life  McCullin was born in St Pancras and grew up in Finsbury Park, but he was evacuated to a farm in Somerset during the Blitz.Don McCullin at SundaySalon. Retrieved 22 March 2014 He is slightly dyslexic but displayed a talent for drawing at the Secondary Modern School he attended. He won a scholarship to Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts but, following the death of his father, he left school at the age of 15, without qualifications, for a catering job on the railways. He was then called up for National Service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1953. Photojournalism  During his National Service, McCullin was posted to the Suez Canal during the 1956 Suez Crisis, where he served as a photographer's assistant. He failed the written theory paper to become a photographer in the RAF and spent his service in the darkroom. During this period McCullin bought his first camera, a Rolleicord for ¬£30 when stationed in Nairobi. On return to Britain, shortage of funds led to his pawning the camera and his mother used her money to redeem the pledge. In 1958 he took a photograph of a local London gang posing in a bombed out building. He was persuaded by his colleagues to take his photograph of The Guvnors, as the gang was known, to The Observer, who published it, setting him on his path as a photographer. Between 1966 and 1984, he worked as an overseas correspondent for the Sunday Times Magazine, recording ecological and man-made catastrophes such as wars, amongst them Biafra in 1968, and victims of the African AIDS epidemic. His hard-hitting coverage of the Vietnam War and the Northern Ireland conflict is particularly highly regarded. He also took the photographs of Maryon Park in London which were used in Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blowup,Philippe Garner, David Alan Miller, Blow Up (Steidl, 2011). In 1968, his Nikon camera stopped a bullet intended for him. Also in 1968, on 28 July, he was invited to photograph the Beatles, then at the height of their fame and in the midst of recording The White Album. These sessions, made at several London locations, have become known as The Mad Day Out. They contain many well known images of the band, including the gatefold sleeve picture from the Red and Blue compilations, where the Beatles mingled with the crowd seen through railings. The photographs from this day were published in the 2010 book A Day in the Life of the Beatles. In 1982 the British Government refused to grant McCullin a press pass to cover the Falklands War, claiming the boat was full. At the time he believed it was because the Thatcher government felt his images might be too disturbing politically. He is the author of a number of books, including The Palestinians (with Jonathan Dimbleby, 1980), Beirut: A City in Crisis (1983) and Don McCullin in Africa (2005). His book, Shaped by War (2010) was published to accompany a retrospective exhibition at the Imperial War Museum North, Salford, England in 2010 and then at the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath and the Imperial War Museum, London. His most recent publication is Southern Frontiers: A Journey Across the Roman Empire, a poetic and contemplative study of selected Roman and pre- Roman ruins in North Africa and the Middle East. In 2012, a documentary film of his life titled McCullin and directed by David Morris and Jacqui Morris was released. The film was nominated for two BAFTA awards. In later years, McCullin has turned to landscape, still-life works and commissioned portraits. In November 2015 McCullin was named the Photo London Master of Photography for 2016, at the launch of Photo London, an art fair due to open at Somerset House in May 2016. A special exhibition dedicated to his work is to be commissioned. When asked about the rise of digital photography, he said: \\"Digital photography can be a totally lying experience ‚Äì you can move what you want, the whole thing can‚Äôt be trusted really\\". Filmed in February 2018 and broadcast the following May, the BBC Four documentary The Road To Palmyra saw McCullin visit Syria with historian Dan Cruickshank to see the devastation left by the conflict on the UNESCO listed site of Palmyra. Discussing his trip with the Radio Times he spoke of his approach to entering war zones: \\"I have risked my life endless times, and ended up in hospital with all kinds of burns and shell wounds. I have those reptile eyes that see behind and in front of me. I‚Äôm constantly trying to stay alive. I‚Äôm aware of warfare, of hidden mines.\\" Despite his reputation as a war photographer, McCullin has said that Alfred Stieglitz was a key influence on his work. Personal life Living in Somerset, he is married and has five children from his marriages.

The house, described as \\"large and noble\\" and ornamented, had within a collection of pictures by the \\"best masters\\", including a portrait of George Washington, whose great grandfather lived at the house, possessed part of the estate, and emigrated to America in 1657 to settle in Westmoreland, Virginia. In the town Market Place was a merchant, two attorneys, an educational academy (another two existed elsewhere), a National school, a blacksmith, two boot & shoe makers, a bricklayer, four butchers, four farmers, three shopkeepers, an agent for Cave Castle, two tailors, one of whom was a draper, a further draper who was a grocer, a wheelwright, a weaver, a horse dealer, an auctioneer, a gardener, and a baker, and one trader who was a grocer, druggist, linen & woolen draper, and hardware dealer. Some of these professions and trades were repeated elsewhere in the town, particularly at West End and West Gate. Further town occupations included a cooper, a clock & watch maker, a common brewer, a tinner & brazier, gunsmith, and a saddler & collar maker. There were the landlords of The Bay Horse, The Bear Inn, The Fox & Coney, The Three Tuns, and The Windmill public houses. The Fox & Coney also held the post and excise office of the town Postmaster, the office sending and receiving letters every day. Residents included a Leed church minister, two gentlemen and a gentlewoman. Coaches between Hull and Thorne passed through The Fox & Coney daily. Two carriers operated between the town and Hull, and Howden. South Cave was served by South Cave railway station on the Hull and Barnsley Railway between 1885 and 1955.

The initial system will be demonstrated from a static ground-based installation, but in order to eventually be integrated on an aircraft, design requirements are maximum weight of 750 kg (1,650 lb) and maximum envelope of 2 cubic meters (70.6 feet3). Development is being funded by The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). History Liquid lasers that have large cooling systems can fire continuous beams, while solid state laser beams are more intense but generally must be fired in pulses to stop them from overheating. (As long as the heat transfer requirements are met solid state lasers can run continuously.) In the past, both types of lasers were very bulky because of their need for these huge cooling systems. The only aircraft in which they could fit were the size of jumbo jets. Need for such a system was reinforced during the 2006 Lebanon War. Israel had participated in similar work in the past by funding the Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL). This system was tested on August 24, 2004, and was found to be effective at neutralizing mortar threats under an actual scenario. However, this test was administered with short, 20 km range missiles. Development For the first few years of the program the Photonics Division of General Atomics was the prime contractor. The design combined the high energy density of a solid-state laser with the thermal management of a liquid laser. Dubbed the \\"HEL weapon\\", the initial prototype demonstrated firing a mild one kilowatt (kW) beam. Phase 3 of the program in 2007 demonstrated 15 kW power in a laboratory setting, and at the end of 2008 under the General Atomics bid, Lockheed Martin was selected as the weapon system integrator. In September 2007, DARPA contracted Textron Systems to supply an alternate laser module using its proprietary \\"ThinZag\\" ceramic solid-state technology. Unlike the GA/Lockheed partnership, Textron will also perform the system integration function for their device. DARPA planned a \\"shoot-off\\" between the two contenders in 2009 to determine which would be funded to continue the program to further phases. The more powerful version will produce a 150-kW beam capable of knocking down missiles with the weight and size requirements for fitting onto fighter aircraft or a Humvee. In mid 2008, Jane's International Defence Review quoted the US military that the program is on schedule to meet this ground test. Phase 4 of the program, involving outdoor testing of a weapon-power laser against tactical targets, was planned for 2010. A prototype was expected to be available by the end of 2012. DARPA planned to use the completed prototypes against targets at White Sands Missile Range in early 2013. This included ground testing against rockets, mortars, and surface-to-air missiles.Neal Ungerleider, \\"DARPA Unveils Drone-Slaying War Laser\\", Fastcompany.com, March 8, 2012 DARPA planned for General Atomics to produce a second HELLADS system in January 2013 for use by the Office of Naval Research to test against targets \\"relevant to surface ships.\\" The first example is committed to Air Force use and cannot be made available for the Navy. Fabrication of the system was planned to be completed in 2012, with power, thermal management, beam control, and command-and-control subsystem integration planned through 2013. The system has a weight goal of per kW of power. Both services plan for demonstrations in 2014.Graham Warwick, \\"Navy to Test-Fire DARPA's Hellads Laser\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, 24 January 2013 General Atomics revealed in April 2015 that its Gen 3 High Energy Laser (HEL) completed beam quality and power measurements tests. The Gen 3 laser has a number of upgrades that provide improved beam quality, increased electrical to optical efficiency, and reduced size and weight; the assembly is small at only , and is powered by a compact Lithium-ion battery to demonstrate deployability on tactical platforms. Beam quality remained constant through the 30-second demonstration, proving that the beam quality of electrically-pumped lasers can be maintained above 50 kilowatts. General Atomics plans to have the laser module deployable on their Avenger unmanned aerial vehicle by 2018.John McHale, \\"High energy laser from General Atomics finishes beam quality test\\", Mil-embedded.com, 9 April 2015 Demonstrating sufficient laser power and beam quality ended the program's laboratory development phase and achieved acceptance for field trials. Ground-based field testing will assess its effects against rockets, mortars, vehicles, and surrogate surface-to-air missiles.\\"HELLADS Laser Achieves Acceptance For Field Testing\\", DARPA, 21 May 2015 HELLADS was to be tested during summer 2015 at White Sands. General Atomics has also proposed its Gen 3 HEL to the Navy after an ONR solicitation for a 150 kW laser weapon suitable for installation on Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, to be tested in 2018. The company has displayed the laser as a Tactical Laser Weapon Module which includes high- power-density lithium-ion batteries, liquid cooling, one or more laser unit cells, and optics to clean up and stabilize the beam before it enters the beam-director telescope; a unit cell produces a 75 kW beam, and modules can be combined to create beams of 150-300 kW in power with no beam combining like low-power fiber lasers. General Atomics also plans to offer the Gen 3 to the U.S. Army for their High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL-MD) when its power levels increase to 120 kW in the early 2020s.Graham Warwick, \\"General Atomics: Third-Gen Electric Laser Weapon Now Ready\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, 20 April 2015 See also * Airborne Laser * Advanced Tactical Laser * Tactical High Energy Laser References ;Notes * New Scientist: US on course for shrink-to-fit laser * High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) * DARPA's 'Star Wars'-style Laser Cannon * Lockheed Martin Chosen as Weapon System Integrator for DARPA Laser Program from Spaceref.com * Mobile/Tactical High Energy Laser (M-THEL) * US military pinpoints date for HELLADS ground test from Janes Defence (extract - full text requires account) * Lockheed Martin Chosen as Weapon System Integrator for DARPA Laser Program from Spaceref.com * Textron Defense Systems Awarded Funding for the DARPA HELLADS Program from PR inside.com * General Atomics Photonics Request for Information document * DARPA High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) Category:DARPA projects Category:Lockheed Martin Category:Military lasers Category:Missile defense Category:Research projects Category:Directed- energy weapon of the United States ","title":"High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System"},{"id":"2531821","title":"Something in Common"},{"id":"2531822","text":"A 1932 article that suggested trickery and ventriloquism from Voirrey Irving was the cause of the Gef phenomena. Gef ( ), also referred to as the Talking Mongoose or the Dalby Spook, was the name given to an allegedly talking mongoose which was claimed to inhabit a farmhouse owned by the Irving family. The Irvings' farm was located at Cashen's Gap near the hamlet of Dalby on the Isle of Man. The story was given extensive coverage by the tabloid press in Britain in the early 1930s. The Irvings' claims gained the attention of parapsychologists and ghost hunters, such as Harry Price, Hereward Carrington, and Nandor Fodor. Some investigators of the era as well as contemporary critics have concluded that Voirrey Irving used ventriloquism and family collusion to perpetuate the hoax. Story In September 1931, the Irving family, consisting of James, Margaret and a 13-year-old daughter named Voirrey, claimed they heard persistent scratching, rustling, and vocal noises behind their farmhouse's wooden wall panels that variously resembled a ferret, a dog or a baby. According to the Irvings, a creature named Gef introduced itself and told them it was a mongoose born in New Delhi, India, in 1852. According to Voirrey, Gef was the size of a small rat with yellowish fur and a large bushy tail. The Irvings say that Gef communicated to them that he was \\"an extra extra clever mongoose\\", an \\"Earthbound spirit\\" and \\"a ghost in the form of a mongoose\\" and once said, \\"I am a freak. I have hands and I have feet, and if you saw me you'd faint, you'd be petrified, mummified, turned into stone or a pillar of salt!\\" The Irvings made various claims about Gef: he supposedly guarded their house and informed them of the approach of guests or any unfamiliar dog. They said that if someone had forgotten to put out the fire at night, Gef would go down and stop the stove. The Irvings claimed Gef would also wake people up when they overslept, and whenever mice got into the house, Gef supposedly assumed the role of the cat, although he preferred to scare them rather than kill them. The Irvings say they gave Gef biscuits, chocolates and bananas, and food was left for him in a saucer suspended from the ceiling which he took when he thought no one was watching. The Irvings claimed the mongoose regularly accompanied them on trips to the market, but always stayed on the other side of the hedges, chatting incessantly. The story of Gef became popular in the tabloid press, and many journalists flocked to the Isle to try to catch a glimpse of the creature.Out of this World, Mysteries of Mind, Space and Time, 1989, page 419‚Äì420. Several other people, both locals and visitors, claimed to have heard Gef's voice, and two claimed to have seen it, however physical evidence was lacking. Footprints, stains on the wall, and hair samples claimed to be evidence of Gef were identified as belonging to the Irvings' sheepdog, as were several photos which were claimed by the Irvings to depict Gef. Margaret and Voirrey Irving left the home in 1945 after the death of James Irving. They reportedly had to sell the farm at a loss because it had the reputation of being haunted. In 1946, Leslie Graham, the actor who had bought their farm, claimed in the press that he had shot and killed Gef. The body displayed by Graham was, however, black and white and much larger than the famous mongoose and Voirrey Irving was certain that it was not Gef. She died in 2005. In an interview published late in life, she maintained that Gef was not her creation.McGraw, Walter. (1970). Gef - the Talking Mongoose...30 Years Later . Fate (magazine). pp. 74-82 Psychic investigators In July 1935 the editor of The Listener, Richard S. Lambert (known as \\"Rex\\"), and his friend, paranormal investigator Harry Price, went to the Isle of Man to investigate the case and produced the book The Haunting of Cashen's Gap (1936). They avoided saying that they believed the story but were careful to report it objectively. The book reports how a hair from the alleged mongoose was sent to Julian Huxley, who then sent it to naturalist F. Martin Duncan, who identified it as a dog hair. Price suspected the hair belonged to the Irvings' sheepdog, Mona.Richard Wiseman. (2011). Paranormality: Why we see what isn't there. London, UK: Pan Macmillan. p. 185. Price asked Reginald Pocock of the Natural History Museum to evaluate pawprints allegedly made by Gef in plasticene together with an impression of his supposed tooth marks. Pocock could not match them to any known animal, though he conceded that one of them might have been \\"conceivably made by a dog\\". He did state that none of the markings had been made by a mongoose. The diaries of James Irving, along with reports about the case, are in Harry Price's archives in the Senate House Library, University of London.Raymond Buckland. (2009). The Weiser Field Guide to Ghosts. Weiser Books . p. 26. Price visited the Irvings and observed double walls of wooden panelling covering the interior rooms of the old stone farmhouse which featured considerable interior air space between stone and wood walls that \\"makes the whole house one great speaking-tube, with walls like soundingboards. By speaking into one of the many apertures in the panels, it should be possible to convey the voice to various parts of the house.\\" According to Richard Wiseman \\"Price and Lambert were less than enthusiastic about the case, concluding that only the most credulous of individuals would be impressed with the evidence for Gef.\\" Nandor Fodor, Research Officer for the International Institute for Psychical Research stayed at the Irvings' house for a week without seeing or hearing Gef. Fodor did not believe deliberate deception had occurred and moulded a complex psychological theory to explain Gef based on \\"a split-off part\\" of Jim Irving's personality. Critical reception Although some psychic investigators thought that Gef was a poltergeist or a ghost, sceptics, including residents of the Isle of Man, believed the Irving family had colluded to perpetuate a hoax that was originated by daughter Voirrey. An Isle of Man Examiner reporter wrote that when he caught the girl making noises, her father tried to convince him the sound came from somewhere else. According to Joe Nickell researchers have suspected Voirrey used ventriloquism and other tricks \\"the effects of which were hyped by family members, reporters in search of a story, and credulous paranormalists.\\"Psychic Pets and Pet Psychics Nickell, Joe. Vol. 26.6, November / December 2002. Skeptical Inquirer. Contemporary media scholar Jeffrey Sconce writes that the most likely explanation is that \\"this extra extra clever mongoose was an imaginary companion created by the Irvings' extra extra clever daughter.\\" Lambert slander case In 1937 Lambert brought an action for slander against Sir Cecil Levita, after Levita suggested to a friend that Lambert was unfit to be on the board of the British Film Institute. Levita said that Lambert was \\"off his head\\" because he had believed in the talking mongoose and the evil eye. Lambert was pressured to abandon his action by Sir Stephen Tallents but persisted with it and won, receiving ¬£7,600 in damages, then an exceptional figure for a slander case, awarded because Lambert's counsel managed to introduce a BBC memo which showed Lambert's career had been threatened if he persisted with the case. The case became known as \\"the Mongoose Case\\".

Following the end of European feudalism, feudal baronies have largely been superseded by baronies held as a rank of nobility, without any attachment to a fief. However, in Scotland, the feudal dignity of baron remains in existence, and may be bought and sold independently of the land to which it was formerly attached. England Historically, the feudal barons of England were the king's tenants-in-chief, that is to say men who held land by feudal tenure directly from the king as their sole overlord and were granted by him a legal jurisdiction (court baron) over their territory, the barony, comprising several manors. Such men, if not already noblemen, were ennobled by obtaining such tenure, and had thenceforth an obligation, upon summons by writ, to attend the king's peripatetic court, the earliest form of Parliament and the House of Lords. They thus formed the baronage, which later formed a large part of the peerage of England. English feudal baronies (and all lesser forms of feudal tenure) were abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, but the titles/dignities remain. However, long before then the royal summons to attend parliament had been withheld from all but the most powerful feudal barons and had been extended to persons with lesser feudal tenures who had personal qualities fitting them to be royal councillors and thus peers. These latter were barons by writ. The English feudal barony, or \\"barony by tenure\\", now has no legal existence except as an incorporeal hereditament title or dignity. It was the highest form of feudal land tenure, namely per baroniam (Latin for \\"by barony\\") under which the land-holder owed the now little understood service of \\"being one of the king's barons\\". It must be distinguished from the lesser barony, also feudal, which existed within a county palatine, such as the barony of Halton within the Palatinate of Chester. Such barons were merely tenants-in-chief of a prince, whose own overlord was the king. The duties and privileges owed by feudal barons cannot now be defined exactly but the main duty certainly was the provision of soldiers to the royal feudal army on demand by the king, and a further duty, which involved considerable expense and travel, clearly also a privilege, was the attendance at the king's feudal court, the precursor of Parliament. The principal benefit clearly was the revenue generated from rents and production within the demesne lands of the barony, and also the personal power and prestige derived from the feudal service of the tenants, the highest level of whom, lords of their own manors, became knights in the baron's retinue. The estate-in-land held by barony if containing a significant castle as its caput and if especially large, that is to say consisting of more than about 20 knight's fees (each loosely equivalent to a manor), was termed an \\"honour\\". Constituent manors of a barony were mostly subinfeudated by the baron to his own knights or followers, with a few retained tenantless as his demesne. Most English Feudal Barons were converted to baronies of writ or peerage according to the Abolition Act of 1660. The baronies not converted became baronies of free socage, a dignity title. There exist today a very few cases of English families which, had it not been for the 1660 Act, would still be feudal barons of ancient creation. One such is the Berkeley family, which although its Earldom of Berkeley became extinct in 1942Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.140 and it recently lost its older peerage title Baron Berkeley to a female line, still possesses and resides (that is to say retains tenure) as county gentry at Berkeley Castle in 2014, the caput of the feudal barony of Berkeley granted by King Henry II (1154-1189) to its direct ancestor in the male line Robert FitzHarding (d.1171), whose son took the surname de Berkeley. France Under the Ancien R√©gime until the abolition of the feudal system in 1789, a French baron was any noble in possession of fief called a barony. As such, possession of the title and the land were in theory inextricably linked. Nevertheless, nobles without any fief of their own might assume the title of baron for themselves. Under the imperial nobility of Napoleon and the recreated peerage of the Bourbon Restoration, French baronies returned. However, these new baronies were simply titles of nobility and not fiefdoms. Ireland Scotland In contrast to the English equivalent, the Scottish feudal barony retains a dignity preserved by the \\"Abolition of Feudal Tenure, etc (Scotland) Act 2000\\". A feudal barony is the only title of dignity legally assignable and able to be legally alienated from the bloodline of its previous possessor. The heraldry and legal determination of ownership of Scottish baronies are governed by the court of the Lord Lyon.

He is perhaps most well known for his English-to-Polish translations of the dramas of William Shakespeare and of the poetry of E.E. Cummings, Elizabeth Bishop, Emily Dickinson, Wystan Hugh Auden, Seamus Heaney, Thomas Hardy, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Thomas Stearns Eliot, John Keats, Robert Frost, Edward Lear and others. Personal life Born in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland on November 13, 1946, Bara≈Ñczak was raised by his father Jan and mother Zofia, both doctors. He was the brother of the novelist Ma≈Çgorzata Musierowicz. He studied philology at Pozna≈Ñ's Adam Mickiewicz University, where he obtained an M.A. and Ph.D. His doctoral dissertation concerned the poetic language of Miron Bia≈Çoszewski. In 1968, he married Anna Brylka, with whom he had two children, Michael and Anna. Career Bara≈Ñczak became a lecturer at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ. He broke into print as a poet and critic in 1965. Bara≈Ñczak was on the staff of the Pozna≈Ñ magazine Nurt from 1967-1971. After the political events of June 1976, he became a co-founder of the Workers' Defence Committee (KOR) and of the clandestine quarterly Zapis. In 1981, the year Poland declared martial law, he left the country and accepted a three-year contract to work as a lecturer at Harvard University. He stayed at Harvard for almost two decades, leaving in 1999 due to complications with Parkinson's disease. He was a co- founder of the Paris Zeszyty Literackie (\\"Literary Textbooks\\") in 1983, and a regular contributor to the periodical Teksty Drugie. He also served as editor of The Polish Review from 1986 to 1990. Bara≈Ñczak was a prominent representative of the Polish \\"New Wave\\" and is generally regarded as one of the greatest translators of English poetry into Polish and Polish poetry into English. He received the PEN Translation Prize with Clare Cavanagh in 1996. His book, Surgical Precision (Chirurgiczna precyzja), won the 1999 Nike Award - Poland's top literary prize. The language he employed in his works is highly evocative of the poetry of Emily Dickinson, John Donne and Robert Frost, with whom he felt strongest connection and whose literary legacy he helped popularize in Poland. Bara≈Ñczak's own poetry deals with three major themes: the ethical, the political, and the literary. His language can be characterized as outstandingly fluent and flexible and the subject-matter of his poems seems to confirm his commitment to social issues. He started his literary career as \\"a poetic critic of language and the social order\\" but his greatest achievements came from his works as a late-20th-century Parnassist, a master of poetic form. Some of his poems were set to music by Jan Krzysztof Kelus. Death Stanis≈Çaw Bara≈Ñczak died at the age of 68 after \\"a long debilitating disease\\" in Newtonville, Massachusetts on December 26, 2014. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery.

He represented Virginia in the U.S. Congress from 1798 until 1801. He was the uncle of William S. Archer. Joseph was born in Middlesex County to Joseph (1721‚Äì1792) and Judith (Segar, 1729‚Äì1806) Eggleston. In 1759 his parents moved to the newly built plantation house named Egglestetton in Amelia County. Joseph was tutored at home and then attended William and Mary College where he graduated with honors in 1776. That same year he joined American Revolutionary War in the cavalry commanded by Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee. Revolutionary War Eggleston became a captain when Lee organized his own irregular unit (Lee's Legion) of the Continental Army in 1778. He served with them throughout the war, but earned distinction in the Southern Campaign. He was cited for gallantry for his actions in the Battle of Guilford Court House on March 15, 1781. He won praise again in the siege of Augusta in June, as well as a promotion to Major. The initial American success in the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September came from Major Eggleston's attack of the British advance units. Unfortunately the outcome of the battle was indecisive, even though the British casualties were twice those of the American forces. Personal life After the war Eggleston returned home to Egglestetton, and on February 23, 1788 he married Sarah 'Sally' Meade. They had three children, Joseph Everard (1790), Charles (1791) and William (1792). When his father (Joseph Sr.) died in 1792 he inherited the family seat and . Over the years he would buy land and expand his holding to . Sally died in 1794, and in 1798 Joseph married again, to his first cousin Ann Cary Eggleston (daughter of his uncle John). She gave him two more children: Francis (1798) and in 1802 a daughter they named Sarah Meade Eggleston after his first wife. Egglestetton was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Political career Eggleston was elected to the Virginia state House of Delegates several times as a representative for Amelia County. In all he served thirteen years in the House (1785‚Äì88 and 1791‚Äì99). He was in the state Senate when U.S. Congressman William B. Giles resigned that post on October 2, 1798. In a special election, Eggleston won the rest of the term. Then he won the regular election for the next term, to serve in the U.S. House in the Sixth Congress. Eggleston declined to be nominated in 1800, so his service in Congress extended from December 3, 1798 to March 3, 1801. He returned home, but was made a Justice of the Peace for Amelia County, and held that post until he died in 1811. Joseph died at home and was buried in the Churchyard of St. John's Episcopal Church. The church was also known as St. John's of Grub Hill, and the cemetery is now known as the Grub Hill Cemetery. The main house at Egglestetton still stands in Egglestetton Road (Route 630) about 4 km north of Amelia Court House. The home is on the National Register of Historic Places but is a private residence. The Civil War general, Joseph Eggleston Johnston, was named for him, since Johnston's father had served in Eggleston's command in the Revolution.

He succeeded his father as 5th Earl in 1558, as his elder half-brothers Norman Leslie and William Leslie had forfeited their rights by having been implicated in the murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546. Leslie took an active part with the Lords of the Congregation, first against the queen-mother, Mary of Guise, when she was regent of Scotland, and afterwards against Mary, Queen of Scots in opposing her marriage with Lord Darnley, and in being part of the plot to murder David Rizzio. He was, however, one of the peers who acquitted Bothwell of Darnley's murder, and went over to the side of the queen. He fought for her at the Battle of Langside, and continued to occupy a position of some prominence in Scottish affairs until his death.

He was in strong opposition to the government of ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, which he criticized for co-operating with the communists.Biography of Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z (Turkish) He was accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Personal life Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z in the 1930s Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z was born on January 12, 1905 at Kasƒ±mpa≈üa, Istanbul. His father was navy commander Mehmet Nail Bey, from the √áift√ßioƒülu family of Torul, G√ºm√º≈ühane; and his mother was Fatma Zehra, daughter of navy commander Osman Fevzi Bey, from the Kadƒ±oƒülu family of Trabzon.

Atsƒ±z had a younger brother, Nejdet San√ßar, also a prominent personality of the Pan-Turkist ideology. Education and professional life He began to study at the Military School of Medicine in 1925 but was expelled due to his ultra-nationalist views and activities as he declined to salute an officer of Arab origin who was of a superior rank than his in 1925. He then began to study at the Teachers College in Istanbul and the Istanbul University School of Literature and graduated from both in 1930. Following he became assistant to Professor Fuat K√∂pr√ºl√º at the Istanbul University. He challenged the Turkish History Thesis and following this incident he was dismissed from the University in 1932.Ayt√ºrk, Ilker (April 2011), p.316 After he worked in high schools in Malatya and Edirne as a teacher but due to his persistent challenge of the Turkish History Thesis he often faced difficulties in his career.Ayt√ºrk, Ilker (April 2011),p.316 Following his imprisonment in due to the Racism Turanism Trials in 1944‚Äì1945 he wasn't rehired as a teacher and only in 1949 he was employed at the S√ºleymaniye Library, where he was active until 1969.Ayt√ºrk, Ilker (April 2011),p.318 After his retirement in 1969 he kept publishing √ñt√ºken. = Publishing = Atsƒ±z was a publisher of several magazines. Atsƒ±z published several academic essays about Ottoman literature and history. He began to publish magazines in 1931, which he kept doing until 1975. Atsƒ±z Mecmua was the first Pan-Turk magazine, which was published from 15 May 1931 to 25 September 1932. He also published Orhun from 1933 to 1934 and again from 1943 to 1944. Orkun was first published in 1950. His last magazine √ñtuken was published from 1964 to 1975. Politics Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z in his early days Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z was an important ideologue who lived during the early years of the Republic of Turkey. His circle attacked Atat√ºrk's leadership, condemned Turkey's foreign policy, and particularly the appeasement policy vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Most importantly, his supporters ridiculed Kemalist attempts at building a civic nation model in the Early Republican Era. However, he also praised Atat√ºrk after the Democrat Party's dismiss in 1960. He was foremost known for his nationalist views, his active campaign against Turkish communists, and his embracing of Tengriistic ancient Turkic traditions. Atsƒ±z viewed racism and pan-Turkism as the two main components of Turkish nationalism and disputed the ideologues of the likes of Ziya G√∂kalp or Hamdullah Suphi Tanri√∂ver who didn't share his views regarding racism, however, according to him, racism \\"is not about measuring head, analysing blood or counting seven ancestors as a couple of phony zanies claimed\\".https://issuu.com/canerkara/docs/merged__1__76b31d72ce0691 He was among the authors that influenced a type of Turkish nationalism known as √úlk√ºc√º movement (translated as \\"idealist\\"), a nationalist movement later associated to Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü (and which was a break with Atsƒ±z's previous ideology of Pan-Turkism, on the grounds that it reconciles with Islam instead of denouncing it as \\"Arab religion\\", which Atsƒ±z previously stated).Cenk Sara√ßoƒülu, Nihal Atsƒ±z's World-View and Its Influences on the Shared Symbols, Rituals, Myths and Practices of the √úlk√ºc√º Movement He wrote that the Kipchaks in Lithuania and Kirghiz are from the same blood and therefore Turks, but \\"alien people\\" living in Turkey like Jews or Negroes are not Turks even if they speak Turkish. Kemalism, which had been condemned so harshly in his novel \\"Dalkavuklar Gecesi\\" (Night of the Sycophants) is the founding ideology of the Republic of Turkey. The nature and the type of Kemalist nationalism during the Early Republican Period (1923‚Äì50) had since 1923 have interpreted Turkish identity under the guiding light of constitutional principles which equated ‚ÄòTurkishness‚Äô with being a Turkish citizen. Identifying all Turkish citizens as Turks proper, the three constitutions of the Republican Era were completely and positively blind to ethnic, and religious differences between Turkish citizens and disassociated ‚ÄòTurkishness‚Äô from its popular meaning: that is, the name of an ethnic group. Supporters of this view argue that Republican statesmen rejected the German model of ethnic nationalism and emulated the French model of civic nationalism by reducing ‚ÄòTurkishness‚Äô to a legal category only. In other words, citizens of Turkey who happened to be of Kurdish, Greek, Armenian, Jewish or Assyrian descent had only to accept a plebiscite, according to this view, to take advantage of the opportunity of Turkification, as far as their citizenship status was concerned, and gaining full equality with ethnic Turks, provided that they remained faithful to their side of the bargain.The Racist Critics of Atat√ºrk and Kemalism, from the 1930s to the 1960s, Ilker Ayt√ºrk (Bilkent University, Ankara), Journal of Contemporary History, SAGE Pub., 2011 Atsƒ±z and his comrades published several Pan-Turkist magazines such as √ñt√ºken, Yeni Hayat and Orkun. He wrote strong articles which criticized the government of ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º and his alleged tolerance of communism in the country. In 1934, he had written that \\"the Jew\\" was among \\"the internal enemies of Turkey\\" but in 1947, he praised the Jewish people for setting an example of strong nationalism (Zionism): indeed, the Jews managed \\"to get back the land they had lost 2,000 years ago and to revive Hebrew which has remained only in the books and turn into a spoken language.\\"Ofra Bengio, The Turkish-Israeli Relationship, New York-London: Palgrave MacMillan, 2009, p. 77. He thought Turks and non-Turks should not intermarry and love has not the same value as nationalist feelings. He further believed nationalism was superior than religion and Islam was a manifestation of the struggle of the Arabs to form a nation.  Legal prosecution  Nih√¢l Atsƒ±z goes to trial In 1944 he was prosecuted twice. Once he was prosecuted on the initiative of Sabahattin Ali for accusing him of being a Russian agent. Atsƒ±z and Ali knew each other form before as they shared a room with him in the 1920s.Ayt√ºrk, Ilker (April 2011), p.318 And in a other trial Atsƒ±z was prosecuted together with more than 30 others, amongst them also Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü, for racism and pan-Turanism. He first got sentenced to 6 years and 6 months in prison, after the sentence was lowered to 1 year and 6 months and at the end he received an amnesty. 1973 he received a prison sentence because of his writings against Kurds. He wrote Kurds should leave Turkey and learn from the Armenians what happens to the people who challenge the Turkish nation. After 2 1/2 months in prison, he was pardoned by the President Fahri Korut√ºrk. His legacy Nineteen young academicians and authors, assembled under a nationalist association \\"Siyah Beyaz K√ºlt√ºr ve Sanat Platformu\\", published a book on him, \\"Vaktiyle Bir Atsƒ±z Varmƒ±≈ü\\",(Once upon a time there was Atsƒ±z) inspired by his verses: \\"Vaktiyle bir Atsƒ±z varmƒ±≈ü derlerse ne ho≈ü / anƒ±lmakla hangi bir ruh olmaz ki sarho≈ü?\\" (If one day some say \\"once upon a time there was Atsƒ±z\\", I would be delighted / Whose soul would not be intoxicated by being remembered?) consisted of articles and comparative studies on his works, life and views. =Political groups= In Turkey in 2012 a nationalist group calling itself \\"Gen√ß Atsƒ±zlar\\" (\\"Young Atsƒ±zes\\") emerged, participating in anti-Armenian demonstrations in Istanbul, carrying banners stating \\"You are all Armenians, You are all bastards\\", in response to the slogan \\"We are all Hrant Dink, We are all Armenians\\".\\"Hocalƒ± mitingini 'Gen√ß Atsƒ±zlar' sabote etmi≈ü\\", Radikal, 29-02-2012 .\\"ANCA Condemns Anti-Armenian Protests in Turkey\\", Armenian Weekly, 26 February 2012 In February 2015, in response to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Anti-Armenian banners of Gen√ß Atsƒ±zlar appeared in cities around Turkey, including banners in ƒ∞stanbul condemning the Khojaly Genocide, and a banner in Muƒüla proclaiming \\"We celebrate the 100th anniversary of our country being cleared of Armenians\\".Nanore Barsoumian, \\"Banners Celebrating Genocide Displayed in Turkey\\", Armenian Weekly, 23 February 2015 .  Literary Work  His essays about history are gathered and published as a book under the name of T√ºrk Tarihinde Meseleler (Issues in Turkish History). He also served as a literature teacher for a number of years. A famous politicised novel of his was Dalkavuklar Gecesi (Night of the Sycophants), a historical allegory and critique of Kemalism. Published in 1941, it tells the story of political corruption during the Hittite era but actually referring (in a roman a clef fashion) to the injustices and arbitrariness of Atat√ºrk's rule during the early 1930s, especially the Turkish History Thesis. Atsƒ±z is also an important novelist and poet. His historical epic novel Bozkurtlarƒ±n √ñl√ºm√º (Death of the Grey Wolves) is one of the most popular historical novels in Turkish literature. The book concerns the last days of the first G√∂k T√ºrk Empire and the impossible rebellion of Prince K√ºr- ≈ûad and his forty warriors against the Chinese invaders, referring to the attempt to kidnap the Chinese emperor by Ashina Jiesheshuai in 639. His original Turkic name is unknown, K√ºr≈üad is a made-up name by Atsƒ±z. Its sequel Bozkurtlar Diriliyor (Revival of the Grey Wolves) tells the story of Urungu (the unknown son of K√ºr-≈ûad) and the beginning of the second G√∂k T√ºrk Empire. His third novel, Deli Kurt (Mad Wolf), is about the mystic romance between a Sipahi warrior and a mysterious shamanist nomad woman in the early Ottoman Empire. Atsƒ±z wrote a satirical political comedy about the ƒ∞n√∂n√º government, Z Vitamini (Vitamin Z), which was about a fictional special vitamin which gives immortality to the dictator and his government. It was published in 1959. His last novel, Ruh Adam (Soul Man), is quite a complex psychological novel. The book has a spiritual and mystical atmosphere, full with surrealistic, allegorical figures such as Yek (who symbolizes Satan) and Lieutenant ≈ûeref (who symbolizes Honour). It has a complex story, which is generally about the forbidden platonic love affair between an alcoholic ex-army officer and a diabolical, mysterious young high school student. The plot develops on the reincarnation of two lovers, which was a warrior banned from the army because of his love to the girl was greater than his love to his country in ancient nomad times. His poems are in the style of Pre-Islamic literature and his common themes are idealism, honour, forbidden love, war and history.

Life and work Autograph Signature of Michael Attaleiates from the manuscript of the Diataxis. Michael Attaleiates was probably a native of Attaleia (now Antalya, in Turkey) and moved to Constantinople between 1030 and 1040 to pursue studies in law.Gautier, ¬´La Diataxis de Michel Attaliate¬ª, 12 argues convincingly for birth in Attaleia; Tsolakis, ‚ÄúAus dem Leben des Michael Attaleiates,‚Äù 5‚Äì7; Kazhdan, ‚ÄúThe Social Views of Michael Attaleiates,‚Äù 58 both argued for Constantinopolitan origins. During years of service in the empire's judicial system he built a small private fortune. Prominence on the judge's bench also brought him to the attention of a number of emperors who rewarded him with some of the highest honours available to civil servants (patrikios and anthypatos). In 1072, Attaleiates compiled for Emperor Michael VII a synopsis of law, known as the Ponema Nomikon, based on the late ninth-century Basilika. In addition, he drew up an Ordinance for the Poor House and Monastery, which he founded at Constantinople in the mid-1070s. This work, known as the Diataxis, is of value for students of the social, economic, cultural and religious history of Byzantium in Constantinople and the provinces during the eleventh century. It also provides invaluable information regarding the life of Attaleiates himself. It includes a catalogue of the books available in the monastery's library, while also offering details about the founder's fortune in the capital and in Thrace. From the Diataxis we learn that Attaleiates owned numerous properties (both farms and urban real estate) in Constantinople, Raidestos (mod. Tekirdag), Selymbria (mod. Silivri). Around 1079/80, Michael Attaleiates circulated The History, a political and military history of the Byzantine Empire from 1034 to 1079. This vivid and largely reliable presentation of the empire's declining fortunes after the end of the Macedonian dynasty, offered Attaleiates the opportunity to engage with political questions of his time also addressed, albeit often from a different point of view, by his contemporary Michael Psellos.Krallis, ‚ÄúMichael Attaleiates as a Reader of Psellos‚Äù The History concludes with a long encomium to Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates, to whom the whole work is dedicated. On account of this encomium and dedication, Attaleiates was for years considered an honest supporter of this elderly and largely ineffective emperor. Careful reading of his text, however, suggests that the words of praise may be less than honest. Instead Attaleiates appears to be partial towards the young military commander and future emperor Alexios Komnenos.Krallis, Michael Attaleiates and the Politics of Imperial Decline, 213-28 Attaleiates probably died around 1080, shortly before the beginning of the Komnenian era. He therefore had no chance to rededicate his work to the founder of the Komnenian dynasty, Alexios I Komnenos, whom The History treats as a potential saviour of the Byzantine state. He was outlived by his son Theodore, who died sometime before 1085. Their bodies, along with those of the judge's two wives, Eirene and Sophia, were put to rest on the grounds of the church of St. George of the Cypresses in the southwestern side of Constantinople. This was the area where the family's Constantinopolitan estates were likely clustered, close to the monastery of Christ Panoikteirmon, of which the Attaleiatai were patrons. One may still visit the church of St George (Samatya Aya Yorgi Rum Ortodoks Kilisesi), which today, after two fires and extensive reconstruction, bears no resemblance to the church of Attaleiates' day.Attaleiates, Diataxis and Krallis, Michael Attaleiates and the Politics of Imperial Decline, 235-36 for the localization of Attaleiates' property in the southwestern side of Constantinople The historian's goals Attaleiates‚Äô History is a consciously constructed account of Byzantine military decline. In the context of his analysis, the author frequently deviates from contemporary political and military history and sprinkles the pages of his work with images of Roman Republican glory that are starkly juxtaposed to the ineptitude of his contemporaries. The author's turn to the past is not, however, a sign of idle antiquarianism.Krallis, ‚Äú‚ÄòDemocratic‚Äô Action in Eleventh-Century Byzantium: Michael Attaleiates‚Äô ‚ÄòRepublicanism‚Äô in Context,‚Äù Viator 40.2 (Fall 2009): 35-53; Michael Attaleiates and the Politics of Imperial Decline, 192-198 This is not an attempt on Attaleiates' part to impress the reader with a display of erudition. Instead, in the civic virtue of The History's Republican heroes the reader detects a quest for a new Roman patriotism that would take the empire out of the crisis. At the same time history-writing allows Attaleiates to reflect on the empire‚Äôs troubled present through the prism of the past in a manner that hints at his ability to plan for an uncertain future. The History therefore confirms the author's status as a politically engaged official and competent imperial advisor.Krallis, Michael Attaleiates and the Politics of Imperial Decline, 134-41 History-writing in general, and The History in particular, cast Attaleiates as an ambitious, patriotic, and astute observer of political developments in his time, denouncing the failings of Byzantine administration, while engaging in close dialogue on current affairs with his contemporaries about the Roman world unravelling around them. Attaleiates and historical causation From the first lines of The History, Attaleiates explains to his readers that he will be seeking the causes behind the various historical events presented in his work.Attaleiates, The History 5 (p. 7 in Kaldellis/Krallis translation): \\"For this reason I have written a book containing an account of the deeds that took place during our time in wars and battles, both the victories and the defeats, the military accomplishments and the reversals, and I have added the causes why they happened the way they did, to the best of my ability\\" This programmatic statement is taken very seriously by the historian throughout his work. Attaleiates provides, to the degree that it is possible, proper historical analysis for each event and focuses each time on the actions of men. The author‚Äôs interest in the causes of things also extends to his descriptions of the natural world. Thus natural phenomena, like earthquakes and thunder, are described and explained in The History with what at the time passed as scientific analysis. Writing, however, for an audience steeped in the Christian faith, Attaleiates is cautious and frequently mentions the Christian God as a possible force behind historical and natural events that he otherwise explains away through historical or scientific reasoning. Thus the reader often encounters what appear to be contradictory explanations of a single event. Careful analysis of The History, however, shows the historian‚Äôs analysis to be weighted in favour of reasoned analysis. At the same time, Attaleiates' invocation of the divine is frequently vague enough to evoke the classical notion of fortune (tyche) rather than the Christian God per se.Kaldellis, \\"A Byzantine Argument for the Equivalence of All Religions\\" In that, Attaleiates is a proper disciple of Michael Psellos, the philosopher who marked the Constantinopolitan intellectual scene with his inquisitiveness and search for knowledge.Krallis, Michael Attaleiates and the Politics of Imperial Decline, 105-112, 171-212 Place in the Byzantine intellectual tradition While Attaleiates is mostly studied for his highly informative work of history, and secondarily for the usable historical trivia to be found in the Diataxis, his work, both historical and legal, must be read in the context of the eleventh-century intellectual ferment and florescence. Alexander Kazhdan thought of Attaleiates as a relatively conservative voice aligned with the circle of the patriarch Michael Keroularios.Kazhdan, \\"The Social Views of Michael Attaleiates,\\" 23-86; Krallis, ‚ÄúSacred Emperor, Holy Patriarch: A New Reading of the Clash between Emperor Isaakios I Komnenos and Patriarch Michael Keroularios in Attaleiates‚Äô History,‚Äù Byzantinoslavica 67 (2009): 169‚Äì190 for an opposing opinion. One would do better, however, to think of the judge as part of the fascinating world of intellectuals from Michael Psellos and John Mauropous, to the Xiphilinoi (both monk and patriarch) and Symeon Seth.

The Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action is the basis for the most elementary variational principle from which the field equations of general relativity can be defined. However, the use of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action is appropriate only when the underlying spacetime manifold \\\\mathcal{M} is closed, i.e., a manifold which is both compact and without boundary. In the event that the manifold has a boundary \\\\partial\\\\mathcal{M}, the action should be supplemented by a boundary term so that the variational principle is well- defined. The necessity of such a boundary term was first realised by York and later refined in a minor way by Gibbons and Hawking. For a manifold that is not closed, the appropriate action is :\\\\mathcal{S}_\\\\mathrm{EH} + \\\\mathcal{S}_\\\\mathrm{GHY} = \\\\frac{1}{16 \\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\mathrm{d}^4 x \\\\, \\\\sqrt{-g} R + \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi} \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\mathrm{d}^3 y \\\\, \\\\epsilon \\\\sqrt{h}K, where \\\\mathcal{S}_\\\\mathrm{EH} is the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action, \\\\mathcal{S}_\\\\mathrm{GHY} is the Gibbons‚ÄìHawking‚ÄìYork boundary term, h_{ab} is the induced metric (see section below on definitions) on the boundary, h its determinant, K is the trace of the second fundamental form, \\\\epsilon is equal to +1 where the normal to \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M} is spacelike and -1 where the normal to \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M} is timelike, and y^a are the coordinates on the boundary. Varying the action with respect to the metric g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}, subject to the condition :\\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\big_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} = 0, gives the Einstein equations; the addition of the boundary term means that in performing the variation, the geometry of the boundary encoded in the transverse metric h_{ab} is fixed (see section below). There remains ambiguity in the action up to an arbitrary functional of the induced metric h_{ab}. That a boundary term is needed in the gravitational case is because R, the gravitational Lagrangian density, contains second derivatives of the metric tensor. This is a non-typical feature of field theories, which are usually formulated in terms of Lagrangians that involve first derivatives of fields to be varied over only. The GHY term is desirable, as it possesses a number of other key features. When passing to the Hamiltonian formalism, it is necessary to include the GHY term in order to reproduce the correct Arnowitt‚ÄìDeser‚ÄìMisner energy (ADM energy). The term is required to ensure the path integral (a la Hawking) for quantum gravity has the correct composition properties. When calculating black hole entropy using the Euclidean semiclassical approach, the entire contribution comes from the GHY term. This term has had more recent applications in loop quantum gravity in calculating transition amplitudes and background-independent scattering amplitudes. In order to determine a finite value for the action, one may have to subtract off a surface term for flat spacetime: :S_{EH} + S_{GHY,0} = \\\\frac{1}{16 \\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\mathrm{d}^4 x \\\\, \\\\sqrt{-g} R + \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi} \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\mathrm{d}^3 y \\\\, \\\\epsilon \\\\sqrt{h} K - {1 \\\\over 8 \\\\pi} \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\mathrm{d}^3 y \\\\, \\\\epsilon \\\\sqrt{h} K_0, where K_0 is the extrinsic curvature of the boundary imbedded flat spacetime. As \\\\sqrt{h} is invariant under variations of g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}, this addition term does not affect the field equations; as such, this is referred to as the non-dynamical term.  Introduction to hyper-surfaces  = Defining hyper-surfaces = In a four-dimensional spacetime manifold, a hypersurface is a three-dimensional submanifold that can be either timelike, spacelike, or null. A particular hyper-surface \\\\Sigma can be selected either by imposing a constraint on the coordinates :f (x^\\\\alpha) = 0, or by giving parametric equations, :x^\\\\alpha = x^\\\\alpha (y^a), where y^a (a=1,2,3) are coordinates intrinsic to the hyper-surface. For example, a two-sphere in three-dimensional Euclidean space can be described either by :f (x^\\\\alpha) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2 = 0, where r is the radius of the sphere, or by :x = r \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\phi, \\\\quad y = r \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\phi, \\\\quad z = r \\\\cos \\\\theta, where \\\\theta and \\\\phi are intrinsic coordinates. = Hyper-surface orthogonal vector fields = We take the metric convention (-,+,...,+). We start with the family of hyper-surfaces given by :f (x^\\\\alpha) = C where different members of the family correspond to different values of the constant C. Consider two neighbouring points P and Q with coordinates x^\\\\alpha and x^\\\\alpha + d x^\\\\alpha, respectively, lying in the same hyper-surface. We then have to first order :C = f (x^\\\\alpha + d x^\\\\alpha) = f (x^\\\\alpha) + {\\\\partial f \\\\over \\\\partial x^\\\\alpha} d x^\\\\alpha. Subtracting off C = f (x^\\\\alpha) from this equation gives :{\\\\partial f \\\\over \\\\partial x^\\\\alpha} d x^\\\\alpha = 0 at P. This implies that f_{, \\\\alpha} is normal to the hyper-surface. A unit normal n_\\\\alpha can be introduced in the case where the hyper-surface is not null. This is defined by :n^\\\\alpha n_\\\\alpha \\\\equiv \\\\epsilon =\\\\begin{cases} -1 & \\\\text{if } \\\\Sigma \\\\text{ is spacelike} \\\\ +1 & \\\\text{if } \\\\Sigma \\\\text{ is timelike} \\\\end{cases} and we require that n^\\\\alpha point in the direction of increasing f : n^\\\\alpha f_{, \\\\alpha} > 0. It can then easily be checked that n_\\\\alpha is given by :n_\\\\alpha = {\\\\epsilon f_{, \\\\alpha} \\\\over g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} f_{, \\\\alpha} f_{, \\\\beta}^{1 \\\\over 2}} if the hyper-surface either spacelike or timelike. = Induced and transverse metric = The three vectors :e^\\\\alpha_a = \\\\left( {\\\\partial x^\\\\alpha \\\\over \\\\partial y^a} \\\\right)_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\quad a=1,2,3 are tangential to the hyper-surface. The induced metric is the three-tensor h_{ab} defined by :h_{ab} = g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} e^\\\\alpha_a e^\\\\beta_b . This acts as a metric tensor on the hyper-surface in the y^a coordinates. For displacements confined to the hyper-surface (so that x^\\\\alpha = x^\\\\alpha (y^a)) :\\\\begin{align} ds^2 &= g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} dx^\\\\alpha dx^\\\\beta \\\\ &= g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial y^a} dy^a \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial y^b} dy^b \\\\right) \\\\ &= \\\\left( g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} e^\\\\alpha_a e^\\\\beta_b \\\\right) dy^a dy^b \\\\ &= h_{ab} dy^a dy^b \\\\end{align} Because the three vectors e^\\\\alpha_1, e^\\\\alpha_2, e^\\\\alpha_3 are tangential to the hyper-surface, :n_\\\\alpha e^\\\\alpha_a = 0 where n_\\\\alpha is the unit vector (n_\\\\alpha n^\\\\alpha = \\\\pm 1) normal to the hyper- surface. We introduce what is called the transverse metric :h_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} - \\\\epsilon n_\\\\alpha n_\\\\beta. It isolates the part of the metric that is transverse to the normal n^\\\\alpha. It is easily seen that this four-tensor :{h^\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta} = {\\\\delta^\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta} - \\\\epsilon n^\\\\alpha n_\\\\beta projects out the part of a four-vector transverse to the normal n^\\\\alpha as :{h^\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta} n^\\\\beta = ({\\\\delta^\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta} - \\\\epsilon n^\\\\alpha n_\\\\beta) n^\\\\beta = (n^\\\\alpha - \\\\epsilon^2 n^\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{and } \\\\; \\\\mathrm{if} \\\\quad w^\\\\alpha n_\\\\alpha = 0 \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{then} \\\\quad {h^\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta} w^\\\\beta = w^\\\\alpha. We have : h_{ab} = h_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} e^\\\\alpha_a e^\\\\beta_b. If we define h^{ab} to be the inverse of h_{ab}, it is easy to check :h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = h^{ab} e^\\\\alpha_a e^\\\\beta_b where :h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} - \\\\epsilon n^\\\\alpha n^\\\\beta. Note that variation subject to the condition :\\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\big_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} = 0, implies that h_{ab} = g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} e^\\\\alpha_a e^\\\\beta_b, the induced metric on \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}, is held fixed during the variation.  On proving the main result  In the following subsections we will first compute the variation of the Einstein-Hilbert term and then the variation of the boundary term, and show that their sum results in :\\\\delta S_{TOTAL} = \\\\delta S_{EH} + \\\\delta S_{GHY} = \\\\frac{1}{16 \\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} G_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt{-g} d^4x where G_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} - {1 \\\\over 2} g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} R is the Einstein tensor, which produces the correct left-hand side to the Einstein field equations, without the cosmological term, which however is trivial to include by replacing S_{EH} with :{1 \\\\over 16 \\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} (R - 2 \\\\Lambda) \\\\sqrt{-g} d^4x where \\\\Lambda is the cosmological constant. In the third subsection we elaborate on the meaning of the non-dynamical term. = Variation of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert term = We will use the identity : \\\\delta \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\equiv - {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\sqrt{-g} g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}, and the Palatini identity: : \\\\delta R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\equiv abla_\\\\mu (\\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}) - abla_\\\\beta (\\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha \\\\mu}), which are both obtained in the article Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action. We consider the variation of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert term: :\\\\begin{align} (16 \\\\pi) \\\\delta S_{EH} & = \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\delta \\\\left ( g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\right ) d^4x \\\\ & = \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\left( R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\delta g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} + g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta \\\\sqrt{-g} + \\\\sqrt{-g} g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\right) d^4x \\\\ & = \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\left( R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} - {1 \\\\over 2} g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} R \\\\right ) \\\\delta g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt{-g} d^4x + \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt{-g} d^4x . \\\\end{align} The first term gives us what we need for the left-hand side of the Einstein field equations. We must account for the second term. By the Palatini identity : g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = \\\\delta {V^\\\\mu}_{; \\\\mu}, \\\\qquad \\\\delta V^\\\\mu = g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} - g^{\\\\alpha \\\\mu} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\beta_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} . We will need Stokes theorem in the form: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} {A^\\\\mu}_{; \\\\mu} \\\\sqrt{-g} d^4x & = \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} (\\\\sqrt{-g} A^\\\\mu)_{, \\\\mu} d^4x \\\\ & = \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} A^\\\\mu d \\\\Sigma_\\\\mu \\\\ & = \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\epsilon A^\\\\mu n_\\\\mu \\\\sqrt{h} d^3y \\\\end{align} where n_\\\\mu is the unit normal to \\\\partial_\\\\mathcal{M} and \\\\epsilon \\\\equiv n^\\\\mu n_\\\\mu = \\\\pm 1, and y^a are coordinates on the boundary. And d \\\\Sigma_\\\\mu = \\\\epsilon n_\\\\mu d \\\\Sigma where d \\\\Sigma = h^{1 \\\\over 2} d^3 y where h = \\\\det [h_{ab}], is an invariant three-dimensional volume element on the hyper-surface. In our particular case we take A^\\\\mu = \\\\delta V^\\\\mu. We now evaluate \\\\delta V^\\\\mu n_\\\\mu on the boundary \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}, keeping in mind that on \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}, \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = 0 = \\\\delta g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}. Taking this into account we have :\\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\big_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\\\mu u} (\\\\delta g_{ u \\\\alpha, \\\\beta} + \\\\delta g_{ u \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, u}). It is useful to note that :\\\\begin{align} g^{\\\\alpha \\\\mu} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\beta_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\big_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} & = {1 \\\\over 2} g^{\\\\alpha \\\\mu} g^{\\\\beta u} (\\\\delta g_{ u \\\\alpha, \\\\beta} + \\\\delta g_{ u \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, u}) \\\\ & = {1 \\\\over 2} g^{\\\\mu u} g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (\\\\delta g_{ u \\\\alpha, \\\\beta} + \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, u} - \\\\delta g_{ u \\\\beta, \\\\alpha}) \\\\end{align} where in the second line we have swapped around \\\\alpha and u and used that the metric is symmetric. It is then not difficult to work out \\\\delta V^\\\\mu = g^{\\\\mu u} g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (\\\\delta g_{ u \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, u}). So now :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta V^\\\\mu n_\\\\mu \\\\big_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} & = n^\\\\mu g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (\\\\delta g_{\\\\mu \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu}) \\\\ & = n^\\\\mu (\\\\epsilon n^\\\\alpha n^\\\\beta + h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}) (\\\\delta g_{\\\\mu \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu}) \\\\ & = n^\\\\mu h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (\\\\delta g_{\\\\mu \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu}) \\\\end{align} where in the second line we used the identity g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = \\\\epsilon n^\\\\alpha n^\\\\beta + h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}, and in the third line we have used the anti-symmetry in \\\\alpha and \\\\mu. As \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} vanishes everywhere on the boundary \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}, its tangential derivatives must also vanish: \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\gamma} e^\\\\gamma_c = 0. It follows that h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g_{\\\\mu \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} = h^{ab} e^\\\\alpha_a e^\\\\beta_b \\\\delta g_{\\\\mu \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} = 0. So finally we have :n^\\\\mu \\\\delta V_\\\\mu \\\\big_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} = - h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu} n^\\\\mu. Gathering the results we obtain :(16 \\\\pi) \\\\delta S_{EH} = \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} G_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt{-g} d^4x - \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\epsilon h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu} n^\\\\mu \\\\sqrt{h} d^3 y \\\\quad Eq 1. We next show that the above boundary term will be cancelled by the variation of S_{GHY}. = Variation of the boundary term = We now turn to the variation of the S_{GHY} term. Because the induced metric is fixed on \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}, the only quantity to be varied is K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature. We have :\\\\begin{align} K & = {n^\\\\alpha}_{; \\\\alpha} \\\\ & = g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} n_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta} \\\\ & = \\\\left (\\\\epsilon n^\\\\alpha n^\\\\beta + h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\right ) n_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta} \\\\ & = h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} n_{\\\\alpha ; \\\\beta} \\\\ & = h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (n_{\\\\alpha, \\\\beta} - \\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} n_\\\\gamma) \\\\end{align} where we have used that 0 = (n^\\\\alpha n_\\\\alpha)_{; \\\\beta} implies n^\\\\alpha n_{\\\\alpha; \\\\beta} = 0. So the variation of K is :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta K &= -h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} n_\\\\gamma \\\\ &= -h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} n_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\\\gamma \\\\sigma} \\\\left (\\\\delta g_{\\\\sigma \\\\alpha, \\\\beta} + \\\\delta g_{\\\\sigma \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\sigma} \\\\right ) \\\\ &= -{1 \\\\over 2} h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\left( \\\\delta g_{\\\\mu \\\\alpha, \\\\beta} + \\\\delta g_{\\\\mu \\\\beta, \\\\alpha} - \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu} \\\\right ) n^\\\\mu \\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2} h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu} n^\\\\mu \\\\end{align} where we have use the fact that the tangential derivatives of \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} vanish on \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}. We have obtained :(16 \\\\pi) \\\\delta S_{GHY} = \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\epsilon h^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\mu} n^\\\\mu \\\\sqrt{h} d^3 y which cancels the second integral on the right-hand side of Eq. 1. The total variation of the gravitational action is: :\\\\delta S_{TOTAL} = {1 \\\\over 16 \\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\mathcal{M} G_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\delta g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\sqrt{-g} d^4x . This produces the correct left-hand side of the Einstein equations. This proves the main result. This result was generalized to fourth order theories of gravity on manifolds with boundaries in 1983 and published in 1985. = The non-dynamical term = We elaborate on the role of :S_0 = {1 \\\\over 8 \\\\pi} \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\epsilon K_0 h^{1 \\\\over 2} d^3y in the gravitational action. As already mentioned above, because this term only depends on h_{ab}, its variation with respect to g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} gives zero and so does not effect the field equations, its purpose is to change the numerical value of the action. As such we will refer to it as the non-dynamical term. Let us assume that g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} is a solution of the vacuum field equations, in which case the Ricci scalar R vanishes. The numerical value of the gravitational action is then :S = {1 \\\\over 8 \\\\pi} \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\epsilon K h^{1 \\\\over 2} d^3y , where we are ignoring the non-dynamical term for the moment. Let us evaluate this for flat spacetime. Choose the boundary \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M} to consist of two hyper-surfaces of constant time value t= t_1, t_2 and a large three- cylinder at r=r_0 (that is, the product of a finite interval and a three- sphere of radius r_0). We have K=0 on the hyper-surfaces of constant time. On the three cylinder, in coordinates intrinsic to the hyper-surface, the line element is :\\\\begin{align} ds^2 & = - dt^2 + r_0^2 d \\\\Omega^2 \\\\ & = - dt^2 + r_0^2 (d \\\\theta^2 + \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta d \\\\phi^2) \\\\end{align} meaning the induced metric is :h_{ab} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & r_0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & r_0^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\end{bmatrix}. so that h^{1 \\\\over 2} = r_0^2 \\\\sin \\\\theta. The unit normal is n_\\\\alpha = \\\\partial_\\\\alpha r, so K = {n^\\\\alpha}_{; \\\\alpha} = 2/r_0. Then :\\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{M}} \\\\epsilon K h^{1 \\\\over 2} d^3y = \\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} d \\\\varphi \\\\int_0^\\\\pi d \\\\theta \\\\left( {2 \\\\over r_0} \\\\right) (r_0^2 \\\\sin \\\\theta) = 8 \\\\pi r_0 (t_2 - t_1) and diverges as r_0 \\\\to \\\\infty, that is, when the spatial boundary is pushed to infinity, even when the \\\\mathcal{M} is bounded by two hyper-surfaces of constant time. One would expect the same problem for curved spacetimes that are asymptotically flat (there is no problem if the spacetime is compact). This problem is remedied by the non-dynamical term. The difference S_{GHY} - S_0 will be well defined in the limit r_0 \\\\to \\\\infty. =Variation of modified gravity terms= There are many theories which attempt to modify General Relativity in different ways, for example f(R) gravity replaces R, the Ricci scalar in the Einstein-Hilbert action with a function f(R). Guarnizo et al. found the boundary term for a general f(R) theory. They found that \\"the modified action in the metric formalism of f(R) gravity plus a Gibbons- York- Hawking like boundary term must be written as: :S_{mod} = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa} \\\\int_V d^4x\\\\sqrt{-g} f(R) +2 \\\\int_{\\\\partial V} d^3y \\\\epsilon h f'(R) K where f'(R) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{d f(R)}{d R}. By using the ADM decomposition and introducing extra auxiliary fields, in 2009 Deruelle et al. found a method to find the boundary term for \\"gravity theories whose Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the Riemann tensor.\\" This method can be used to find the GHY boundary terms for Infinite derivative gravity.  A path-integral approach to quantum gravity  As mentioned at the beginning, the GHY term is required to ensure the path integral (a la Hawking et al.) for quantum gravity has the correct composition properties. This older approach to path-integral quantum gravity had a number of difficulties and unsolved problems. The starting point in this approach is Feynman's idea that one can represent the amplitude :\\\\langle g_2, \\\\phi_2, \\\\Sigma_2  g_1, \\\\phi_1, \\\\Sigma_1 \\\\rangle to go from the state with metric g_1 and matter fields \\\\phi_1 on a surface \\\\Sigma_1 to a state with metric g_2 and matter fields \\\\phi_2 on a surface \\\\Sigma_2, as a sum over all field configurations g and \\\\phi which take the boundary values of the fields on the surfaces \\\\Sigma_1 and \\\\Sigma_2. We write :\\\\langle g_2, \\\\phi_2, \\\\Sigma_2  g_1, \\\\phi_1, \\\\Sigma_1 \\\\rangle = \\\\int \\\\mathcal{D} [g,\\\\phi] \\\\exp (i S [g,\\\\phi]) where \\\\mathcal{D} [g,\\\\phi] is a measure on the space of all field configurations g and \\\\phi, S [g,\\\\phi] is the action of the fields, and the integral is taken over all fields which have the given values on \\\\Sigma_1 and \\\\Sigma_2. It is argued that one need only specify the three-dimensional induced metric h on the boundary. Now consider the situation where one makes the transition from metric h_1, on a surface \\\\Sigma_1, to a metric h_2, on a surface \\\\Sigma_2 and then on to a metric h_3 on a later surface \\\\Sigma_3 One would like to have the usual composition rule :\\\\langle h_3, \\\\Sigma_3  h_1, \\\\Sigma_1 \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{h_2} \\\\langle h_3, \\\\Sigma_3  h_2, \\\\Sigma_2 \\\\rangle \\\\langle h_2, \\\\Sigma_2  h_1, \\\\Sigma_1 \\\\rangle expressing that the amplitude to go from the initial to final state to be obtained by summing over all states on the intermediate surface \\\\Sigma_2. Let g_1 be the metric between \\\\Sigma_1 and \\\\Sigma_2 and g_2 be the metric between \\\\Sigma_2 and \\\\Sigma_3. Although the induced metric of g_1 and g_2 will agree on \\\\Sigma_2, the normal derivative of g_1 at \\\\Sigma_2 will not in general be equal to that of g_2 at \\\\Sigma_2. Taking the implications of this into account, it can then be shown that the composition rule will hold if and only if we include the GHY boundary term.For example see the book \\"Hawking on the big bang and black holes\\" by Stephen Hawking, chapter 15. In the next section it is demonstrated how this path integral approach to quantum gravity leads to the concept of black hole temperature and intrinsic quantum mechanical entropy.  Calculating black- hole entropy using the Euclidean semi-classical approach   Application in loop quantum gravity  = Transition amplitudes and the Hamilton's principal function = In the quantum theory, the object that corresponds to the Hamilton's principal function is the transition amplitude. Consider gravity defined on a compact region of spacetime, with the topology of a four dimensional ball. The boundary of this region is a three-dimensional space with the topology of a three-sphere, which we call \\\\Sigma. In pure gravity without cosmological constant, since the Ricci scalar vanishes on solutions of Einstein's equations, the bulk action vanishes and the Hamilton's principal function is given entirely in terms of the boundary term, :S [q] = \\\\int_\\\\Sigma K^{ab} [q] q_{ab} \\\\sqrt{q} \\\\; d^3 \\\\sigma where K^{ab} is the extrinsic curvature of the boundary, q_{ab} is the three-metric induced on the boundary, and \\\\sigma are coordinates on the boundary. The functional S [q] is a highly non-trivial functional to compute; this is because the extrinsic curvature K^{ab} [q] is determined by the bulk solution singled out by the boundary intrinsic geometry. As such K^{ab} [q] is non-local. Knowing the general dependence of K^{ab} from q_{ab} is equivalent to knowing the general solution of the Einstein equations. = Background-independent scattering amplitudes = Loop quantum gravity is formulated in a background-independent language. No spacetime is assumed a priori, but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves - however scattering amplitudes are derived from n-point functions (Correlation function (quantum field theory)) and these, formulated in conventional quantum field theory, are functions of points of a background space-time. The relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is far from obvious, and it is far from obvious how to recover low-energy quantities from the full background-independent theory. One would like to derive the n-point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism, in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit. A strategy for addressing this problem has been suggested; the idea is to study the boundary amplitude, or transition amplitude of a compact region of spacetime, namely a path integral over a finite space-time region, seen as a function of the boundary value of the field. In conventional quantum field theory, this boundary amplitude is well‚Äìdefined and codes the physical information of the theory; it does so in quantum gravity as well, but in a fully background‚Äìindependent manner. A generally covariant definition of n-point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance between physical points ‚Äìarguments of the n-point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered. The key observation is that in gravity the boundary data include the gravitational field, hence the geometry of the boundary, hence all relevant relative distances and time separations. In other words, the boundary formulation realizes very elegantly in the quantum context the complete identification between spacetime geometry and dynamical fields.

Biography  Gertrude Bernard was born in Mattawa, Ontario, on June 18, 1906. Her mother, Mary Nash Ockiping, was Algonquin. Her father, Matthew Barnard, was Algonquin and Mohawk. She grew up a strongly independent girl and young woman, and was described as something of a tomboy. Her friends nicknamed her \\"Pony\\".Native American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, ed. Gretchen M. Bataille & Laurie Lisa, p. 12) When Barnard was 19, she met writer and imposter, Grey Owl, born Archibald Stansfeld Belaney, at Camp Wabikon in Temagami, Canada, where she was working as a waitress and he was a guide. Almost twice her age at 37, the English fur trapper claimed to be a half-Apache from America.\\"Mattawa woman Grey Owl's inspiration\\", PastForward, 16 Jun 2000 As they got to know one another, she insisted on accompanying him to his traplines. She did not approve of the way he was living, and encouraged him to stop his trapping activities and become an animal rights activist. In Pilgrims of the Wild (1934), Belaney recounts how his young wife, by saving the lives of two beaver kits and raising them, led him to change his way of life and to work for the protection of wildlife. They considered themselves married, albeit informally, despite the fact he was still legally married to his first wife Angele Egwuna, an Ojibwe. They had two daughters. The couple split up in 1936. Belaney died in 1938, a best-selling author. Shortly after his death, it was publicly revealed that he was not part-Apache as he had claimed, but an Englishman named Archibald Stansfeld Belaney. In 1940 Barnard, using the name Anahareo that Belaney had given her, wrote a book called My Life With Grey Owl with the encouragement of Belaney's publisher, Lovat Dickson. She was dissatisfied with it, in part because her lack of control over the final publication; it stereotyped her, as she put it, as \\"a sweet gentle Indian maiden.\\" In 1972, she wrote the best-seller, Devil in Deerskins: My Life With Grey Owl, in which she denied having known Belaney's true origins. She said she had been hurt to discover his deception. In 1939, she married a Swedish nobleman, Count Eric Axel Moltke-Huitfeldt. They had one daughter, Katharine. Over the 50 years following her separation from Belaney, Anahareo, as she is now better known, continued to be active in the conservation and animal rights movement. In 1979 she was admitted into the Order of Nature of the Paris-based International League of Animal Rights. She was elected a Member of the Order of Canada in 1983. On June 17, 1986, just a day before her 80th birthday, Anahareo died in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada.

He then transferred to the Corps of Engineers in 1926 and served as District Engineer in Buffalo, New York; Wilmington, North Carolina; and Memphis, Tennessee. In the last assignment he successfully battled record Mississippi River flood crests. He was appointed Southwestern Division Engineer (1937‚Äì40) and War Department Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4 (1940‚Äì41). Appointed Chief of Engineers shortly before Pearl Harbor, General Reybold directed the Corps' tremendous range of activities throughout the war and became the first Army officer ever to attain the rank of Lieutenant General while serving in the position of Chief of Engineers. General Reybold retired on January 31, 1946, and died November 21, 1961, in Washington, D.C. He was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster.

His association with the film came about as a result of a chance meeting with its director. The success of the film and the enduring popularity of its theme song changed Karas' life. Early life Born in Vienna, one of five children of a factory worker, Anton Karas was already keen on music as a child. He wanted to become a band leader, which was impossible because of his family's financial situation. He was allowed to learn to play an instrument, as were his two brothers and two sisters. He later reported that his first zither was one he found in his grandmother's attic at the age of 12. As ordered by his father, he became an apprentice tool and die maker at the age of 14, while taking evening courses in music at a private institution. He finished his apprenticeship in 1924, and worked in a car factory until becoming unemployed in January 1925. Having already begun to study at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna in 1924, he subsequently earned a living as an entertainer in a Heuriger. He soon earned more than his father, and continued his studies until 1928. Career In 1930, he married, with the birth of his daughter following three months later. From 1939 to 1945 he was with German Wehrmacht anti-aircraft warfare, temporarily in Russia, where he took a zither along. He lost more than one instrument from war action, but always managed to find another one. =The Third Man= In the summer of 1948, director Carol Reed was preparing to shoot The Third Man in Vienna and was staying in the Hotel Sacher, along with many of the British element of the Allied Control Commission for Austria. Robert Baty, the young son of the Director of Education, C.W. Baty, was tasked with showing the director around the city. On the second day they stopped at a Heuriger and heard Karas playing the zither in the background. This is described in Karas' L.A. Times/Reuters obituary which states that:Anton Karas, 'Third Man'Theme Composer, Dies - LA Times \\"From Reuters\\", 1985-01-10 > Reed, desperately searching for a theme tune ... chanced on the tavern in > Vienna's Grinzing wine-growing district. Struck by the simple zither > melodies, Reed asked a stunned Karas if he would compose the music for the > film. Karas protested, saying he had never actually written music. As Karas > later told the story, the director insisted and invited Karas to England. > The Austrian became homesick and asked to return. Reed told him he could; > when he had written the music. Under this pressure Karas wrote his Harry > Lime theme. The film‚Äîwith the music a contributing factor‚Äîwas a success, and Karas' life was changed drastically.\\"Wherever the film is shown you can almost see the procession from cinema to gramophone shop. In its first three weeks sales have reached 100,000.\\" (The Continental Daily Mail quoted by Ulrike Gran√∂gger, p. 84.) As a result, he toured globally and performed for many celebrities, including members of the British Royal family. Princess Margaret invited him to London's Empress Club, where he played twice a week while in London. He also appeared before Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, members of the Swedish royal family, and Pope Pius XII.Karas's biography by Peter Payer, p. 13. By the end of 1949, half a million copies of \\"The Harry Lime Theme\\" had been sold, an unprecedented number. The success of the score caused a surge in zither sales. In Austria, the film opened on 10 March 1950, in Vienna's Apollo Kino, and it initially offended some Viennese inhabitants, as it focused on the disgrace of the destroyed city. Vienna's newspaper critics hated the film, except for its music.\\"Der Sieveringer Zithervirtuose hat den Streifen kompositorisch untermalt und ersetzt mit seinem Instrument wirkungsvoll ein Orchester. Er beherrscht die Zither mit einer Virtuosit√§t, die aller Anerkennung w√ºrdig ist.\\" (Die Presse, 1950-3-11) Rough translation: \\"The zither-virtuoso from Sievering has composed his accompaniments for the film and effectively replaces, with his instrument, a whole orchestra. He plays the zither with a virtuosity that is praiseworthy.\\" When Karas returned to Austria after his first world tour in July 1950, he was welcomed by Chancellor Leopold Figl and other members of the government. Most importantly, the public liked the film. In Brigittenau, where Karas was born, people queued for tickets which were sold out eight days in advance. Karas disliked the glamour, and his soundtrack proved to be an enduring one-hit wonder. He later stated, \\"I never was a star, and never felt like one. It is because of that film that I was pushed from one place to the other ... My only desire was to be back home again.\\" He toured again in 1951, travelling to Montreal and Las Vegas, followed by other tours, including Japan in 1962, 1969 and 1972, where he performed for Emperor Hirohito. In 1954, he opened a Heuriger, which became fashionable among cinema celebrities including Orson Welles, Gina Lollobrigida, Curd J√ºrgens, Hans Moser, Paul H√∂rbiger, Marika R√∂kk and Johannes Heesters, thereby becoming a tourist attraction. He was not satisfied, as he preferred to perform for locals who would understand him, his language and music. Because of this, he retired and retreated from the limelight in 1966, explaining, \\"I'm not a tourist guy, and what I did there had hardly anything to do with 'Vienna Heuriger'.\\"  References   External links  * Anton Karas page by his Grandson (English version) * Karas with celebrities in his \\"Heurige\\" * [ Biography] at Allmusic * The Zithers of Anton Karas Biography and zither information at zither.us * In Search of the Third Man at Amazon.com * Karas biography by Peter Payer from historical research, sponsored by the city of Vienna in 2005 (15 pages, in German). * * Category:1906 births Category:1985 deaths Category:20th-century Austrian composers Category:20th-century Austrian musicians Category:Austrian male composers Category:Austrian composers Category:Zither players Category:University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna alumni Category:London Records artists Category:Austrian people of Hungarian descent Category:People from Brigittenau Category:Musicians from Vienna Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Anton Karas"},{"id":"2532027","text":"Hylton v. United States, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 171 (1796),. is an early United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a yearly tax on carriages\\"An Act laying duties upon Carriages for the conveyance of Persons,\\" Ch. XLV, 1 Stat. 373 (June 5, 1794). did not violate the Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 and Article I, Section 9, Clause 4 requirements for the apportioning of direct taxes. The Court concluded that the carriage tax was not a direct tax, which would require apportionment among the states. The Court noted that a tax on land was an example of a direct tax that was contemplated by the Constitution. The case is also significant for being the first case by the Supreme Court to rely on judicial review, later formally established by Marbury v. Madison (1803), to decide whether a statute of Congress was unconstitutional. Oral argument Alexander Hamilton argued before the Court on behalf of the government and claimed that the tax was a valid use of the power of Congress. Justice James Iredell wrote two days after the event: \\"Mr. Hamilton spoke in our Court, attended by the most crowded audience I ever saw there, both Houses of Congress being almost deserted on the occasion. Though he was in very ill health, he spoke with astonishing ability, and in a most pleasing manner, and was listened to with the profoundest attention. His speech lasted about three hours.\\" Decision =Seriatim opinions= The Justices at the time, rather than issuing a single opinion of the Court, instead issued seriatim opinions, with each writing separately and in turn reading a separate analysis. Justice Chase wrote, \\"As I do not think the tax on carriages is a direct tax‚Ä¶. I am for affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court.\\" Justice Paterson wrote, \\"All taxes on expenses or consumption are indirect taxes. A tax on carriages is of this kind, and of course is not a direct tax.... I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment rendered in the Circuit Court of Virginia ought to be affirmed.\\" Justice Iredell wrote, \\"I am clearly of opinion this is not a direct tax in the sense of the Constitution, and therefore that the judgment ought to be affirmed.\\" Justice Wilson wrote, \\"I shall now, however, only add, that my sentiments, in favor of the constitutionality of the tax in question, have not been changed.\\" =Other comments= Regarding the definition of duties, Justice Samuel Chase wrote, \\"The term duty, is the most comprehensive next to the generic term tax; and practically in Great Britain, (whence we take our general ideas of taxes, duties, imposts, excises, customs, etc.) embraces taxes on stamps, tolls for passage, etc. etc. and is not confined to taxes on importation only.\\"Hylton, 3 U.S. at 175 (Chase, J.). On the issue of judicial review, he wrote, \\"As I do not think the tax on carriages is a direct tax, it is unnecessary, at this time, for me to determine, whether this court, constitutionally possesses the power to declare an act of Congress void, on the ground of its being made contrary to, and in violation of, the Constitution; but if the court have such power, I am free to declare, that I will never exercise it, but in a very clear case.\\" Subsequent history The Court's interpretation of federal taxes on personal property as \\"indirect taxes\\" lasted until the 1895 case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., affirmed on rehearing, . Writing for the majority in Pollock, Chief Justice Fuller explained, \\"We are of opinion that taxes on personal property, or on the income of personal property, are likewise direct taxes.\\"Pollock, 158 U.S. at 637. The Congressional Research Service lists the Hylton decision as having been overruled by the Pollock decision.Senate Document # 108-17, 108th Congress, Second Session, \\"Supreme Court Decisions Overruled by Subsequent Decision,\\" in The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002, at page 2388, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, U.S. Gov't Printing Office (2004).

The Amendment did not address taxes on personal property itself. Writing for the majority in the 1916 case of Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., Chief Justice White explained that the \\"Amendment contains nothing repudiating or challenging the ruling in the Pollock Case that the word 'direct' had a broader significance, since it embraced also taxes levied directly on personal property because of its ownership, and therefore the Amendment at least impliedly makes such wider significance a part of the Constitution....\\". In 1916, while presiding over Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., the Supreme Court said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the meaning of the 16th Amendment as interpreted in the Brushaber Case,... by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of taxation.‚Äù. Use as precedent In 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts cited Hylton v. United States as a precedent for deeming the mandate for individuals to buy health insurance contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010) to be constitutional as a tax.

Involvement in the American Civil War During the War, the Union imposed a blockade on the Confederacy, which was then an important trade partner with European countries, particularly England. Harbours such as Bermuda's St. George harbour and Naussau in the Bahamas became important bases for blockade running missions. Those missions were exceedingly dangerous, and so sailors about blockade runners were paid far greater than ordinary sailors. Outerbridge and his brother both took that opportunity. On one occasion, Outerbridge was serving aboard the steamboat Robert E. Lee. Departing from Wilmington at about 9 p.m. (at high tide, which is when the large ship could get over Wilmington's sandbar), the Robert E. Lee joined a small fleet of blockade runners which was soon attacked by two Man-of-War ships, flanking the fleet on either side. The Man-of-Wars immediately attacked with heavy cannons, destroying a winch (and severely wounding a number of foreign sailors). One of them approached the Robert E. Lee close enough for small arms fire, though there were no casualties. While the captain ‚Äì Wilkinson ‚Äì studiously ignored the attack, Outerbridge, the mate and a number of crewmen had gone to the forecastle to watch for other craft. A round shot hit close to Outerbridge, causing him to fall unconscious while the other crewmen fled. The following day, Outerbridge was commended by the ship's officers for his bravery, and the crew picked small bullets from the woodwork (but not, strangely and thankfully, from each other). At the time, the Robert E. Lee was en route to Halifax with a number of Confederate officers on board. The Confederates were bound for England to collect two Man-of-Wars for the Confederate government (the Viper and the Vixen). The British government seized the officers and sent them to Bermuda. The Robert E. Lee also set course for the island. Not all of Outerbridge's adventures in the Civil War would be as pleasant, as he would be twice captured by the North. On one of these occasions, he was serving on the steamer Sirene. Originally owned by the British government and used as the Dockyard duty boat, the ship was mothballed and sold to Mr. Fininsey, the popular Confederate Consul in Bermuda. Fininsey deployed the Sirene to Wilmington with a crew, to bring back another steamship, the Cape of Good Hope, to act as a cotton freighter. At the time, the Cape of Good Hope was a passenger boat between Wilmington and Smithfield, a role that the Sirene would then fulfill. Captain Jeremiah Peniston was selected as the ship's Master, with Outerbridge's brother, Eldon, as first officer and Outerbridge himself as second officer. A Virginian man by the name of Mr. Tab was the ship's Purser. A week out of Bermuda, the rather slow Sirene reached the American coastline off Bowford, North Carolina. She head southwards towards Cape Fear under sail, hoping that it would deceive the Blockade fleet. Only an hour later, the Man- of-War Key Stone State (which was later purchased by a Mr. Webb of New York, renamed the San Francisco and used as a mail ship to, ironically, Bermuda) intercepted the Sirene and towed it into Bowford, with the crew having a merry laugh at the blockade runners' pitiful craft. The following day, the crew were transferred onto a receiving ship in Bowford's harbour, where they found a welcoming presence in the ship's captain. Having visited Bermuda several times in a Whaler, the ship's captain was kind towards his prisoners. However, they spent the next ten days treated like fighting cocks. Four days into this, the Sirene crew witnessed another blockade running steamer, the Pavince, being chased on shore by the Man-of-War. The steamer was fast enough that the crew had the leeway to abandon the ship and row ashore on small craft, but they were immediately captured by Union soldiers. The Pavince was at that time on fire, and exploded. With the crew of the Pavince ‚Äì also familiar with the Captain from his time in Bermuda ‚Äì aboard, the blockade runners \\"had a good time as long as [they] were there\\". After the ten days, the blockade runners disembarked into Camp Hamilton, which was under military authority. Treatment was severe. Four days into the stay, the Union wardens sent all imprisoned masons ‚Äì including the both blockade runner captains and some fifteen thousand Confederate soldiers. At Point Look Out, the blockade runners were stripped, with their possessions to be returned at the end of their imprisonment. Described conservatively as \\"a real pest hole\\", Point Look Out was a mile () square, surrounded by lumber walls. Around this wall, stationed every on a platform from the top, Union soldiers kept watch. Many of these were former slaves liberated by the North, who apparently exacted their revenge by shooting Southern soldiers. Each morning, Outerbridge woke up to fifteen to twenty corpses for former Confederates. The prison was hard for Outerbridge. Like the other prisoners, he had to sleep in the open air, and ate a loaf of bread a day (with a quarter pound [] of fresh beef delivered thrice a week). The wagons that delivered the daily bread \\"carried out something else\\". Luckily for him, however, Eldon had managed to sneak a Gold sovereign under his tongue. Eldon and Thomas used this money to trade with settlers immediately outside the camp, through a small hole in the wall. Initially, the brothers tried to send letters to Lord Lyon, the British Ambassador to Washington, requesting aid. These letters would never be received, however. Mr. Tab ‚Äì the Sirenes Purser ‚Äì would prove invaluable at this point. With the help of the local Chaplain, he managed to get a letter through, and soon the brothers were free. Unfortunately, the money and possessions that had been removed from the brothers was nowhere to be found. With a gift enough to get them to New York, the brothers secured a loan from a Mr. Middleton, the Bermuda Agent, to pay for their trip back home (a loan that was promptly repaid). They returned to Bermuda as crewmen aboard the barque Lapflerene, where they were well treated by the captain ‚Äì William Peniston ‚Äì and his wife for the eight-day journey. Upon returning to Bermuda, the crew made for Castle Harbour, proceeding up the old Quarry as close to the Outerbridge's homes at Bailey's Bay as they could get. Near the close of the war, the Outerbridge brothers entered the employ on one John Tory Bourne. Bourne named them captain (Eldon) and chief officer (Thomas) of his Sarah Ann. The ill-fated brig would be blown ashore and wrecked in a hurricane on the main island of St. Thomas Adventures Beyond the War The American Civil War would not be Outerbridge's only source of adventure however. As the master of Mr. Nicholas McCallan's schooner Bravo, Outerbridge travelled to Prince Edward's Island to take on a cargo of Christmas stores (including yellow turnips, Irish potatoes, cabbages and oats), including a deck load of poultry and 8 to 10 horses. The morning that the Bravo was to set sail for Bermuda, however, the crew awoke to find the entire harbour frozen solid. Outerbridge ordered that the horses be taken ashore and be stabled for the winter, and after completing that order, the crew did not return. Alone save for his faithful steward Mr. John Virgin, Outerbridge waited out the winter. When the ice broke, he took the horses back on board, and the two men sailed for St. George. Though the turkeys and geese were rather lean, they would fetch a fair price of half a crown apiece ‚Äì the usual price for fat birds. Thomas Outerbridge would also sail the Harvest Queen, the McMillian and the T.H.A. Pitt, as was the long-time Master of Mr. J.S. Darrell's tug Clover. It is believed that the last sailing ship her had charge of was the brigantine Peeress, belonging to one Mr. H.C. Outerbridge. Thomas took the Peeress north for general cargo and a deckload of livestock. On his return, the ship's well-kept glass readings showed an approaching hurricane. Outerbridge went north and then west of Bermuda to avoid the damaging storm. They finally arrived in Hamilton without any damage ‚Äì attributed to Outerbridge's skill as a mariner. Personal life Outerbridge did not spend all of his time sailing across the ocean, however. He was reputed to be a keen sportsman, riding and attending the horse races at Shelley Bay. Never far from the water, boat racing was his strongest sport. He introduced the dinghy Teal ‚Äì built by Michael Davis and the winner of three races under Outerbridge's handling. He would marry Alice Hollis, and have five sons by her. Unfortunately, two of them ‚Äì Gordon and William ‚Äì would predecease them. Surviving him were Ernest Seon Outerbridge; Thomas Reginald Outerbridge; and George Harrison Outerbridge. Death Some say that Outerbridge simply wore himself out. He didn't slow down with his years, having been known to continue travelling into St. George's until mere months before his death. He finally died in the afternoon of Sunday, 5 September 1927, at the house of his son George, in Bailey's Bay. His funeral at the Holy Trinity Church was described as \\"very largely attended\\" ‚Äì many attending from a distance ‚Äì with numerous, beautiful floral arrangements. In attendance were his faithful follower John Virgin, his nephews F.C. Outerbridge, Bernard Wilkinson, Wickwire Davis, Stephen Wilkinson, Malcolm Hollis and Sturgis Davis (who acted as the carriers), and was performed by the Rev.

It was the band's second major-label release. A music video was filmed for the single \\"Break it Up\\" and the band embarked on tours in support of the album, on which they were joined by Chris Prescott from San Diego bands Tanner and No Knife who performed as touring percussionist and keyboardist. Although overall reaction to the album was positive and singles \\"Break it Up\\" and \\"Lipstick\\" received radio airplay, RFTC failed to sell impressive numbers to the degree that Interscope had hoped. The label soon turned their attention to higher-grossing acts, leading the band to end their contract with the label the following year. Disagreements between members concerning the professional direction of the band following their departure from Interscope would lead to drummer Atom leaving the group in early 2000. Though the band would continue to record and perform with a new drummer, they would not be as prolific as in their past. Recording the album In the album's liner notes, singer/guitarist John Reis states that the entire recording of RFTC was conducted completely live except for the second vibraslap hit on the first verse of \\"You Gotta Move.\\" He also states that the band were able to use a number of microwave enhancement techniques to exceed the normal industry recording rate of 20 digi-bits per second on compact discs, achieving a rate of 23 digi-bits per second and resulting in a higher quality recording.

She adopted the stage name Vesta Tilley and became one of the most famous male impersonators of her era. Her career lasted from 1869 until 1920. Starting in provincial theatres with her father as manager, she performed her first season in London in 1874. She typically performed as a dandy or fop, also playing other roles. She found additional success as a principal boy in pantomime. By the 1890s, Tilley was England's highest earning woman. She was also a star in the vaudeville circuit in the United States, touring a total of six times. She married Walter de Frece, a theatre impresario who became her new manager and songwriter. At a Royal Command Performance in 1912, she scandalised Queen Mary because she was wearing trousers. During the First World War she was known as \\"England‚Äôs greatest recruiting sergeant\\" since she sang patriotic songs dressed in khaki fatigues like a soldier and promoted enlistment drives. Becoming Lady de Frece in 1919, she decided to retire and made a year-long farewell tour from which all profits went to children's hospitals. Her last ever performance was in 1920 at the Coliseum Theatre, London. She then supported her husband when he became a Member of Parliament and later retired with him to Monte Carlo. She died in 1952 on a visit to London and is buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. Her life story was commemorated in the 1957 film After the Ball. Early years \\"It's part of a policeman's duty\\" by Vesta Tilley in 1907 \\"I'm the idol of the girls\\" by Vest Tilley in 1908 \\"Following a fellow with a face like me\\" by Vesta Tilley in 1908 Matilda Alice Powles was born at Commandery Street, Worcester on 13May 1864.Sarah Maitland (1986) Vesta Tilley p14, Virago Press, London She was the second child out of a total of thirteen and shared her first name with her mother Matilda Powles (n√©e Broughton). Her father was Henry Powles, known as Harry Ball. He was a musician who became master of ceremonies at the Theatre Royal, Gloucester and later the St George's Hall in Nottingham. With her father's encouragement, Powles first appeared on stage at the age of three and by six she was appearing to sing songs dressed as a man. She began her professional career in 1869 and was to be on the stage until 1920. Her first character of note was \\"Pocket Sims Reeves\\", spoofing the act of the then-famous opera singer John Sims Reeves by performing his songs such as \\"The Anchor's Weighed\\". She would later perform male roles exclusively, saying that \\"I felt that I could express myself better if I were dressed as a boy.\\"Lady de Frece, Recollections of Vesta Tilley, London: Hutchinson, 1934. p. 52. At the time, British music hall entertainment was increasingly popular and Powles' fame grew as she became older. By 1872, her father had quit his job to manage her career full-time and she was supporting her family. In 1874, she did her first season in London, performing as the Great Little Tilley at three venues every night. Edward Villiers, then manager at the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth, was concerned by the gender ambiguity of the performance name and suggested a change. Harry Ball decided upon Vesta Tilley. \\"Vesta\\" referred to both the Latin word for virgin and Swan Vesta, a brand of safety matches; \\"Tilley\\" was a diminutive of her name Matilda. She was billed as Vesta Tilley for the first time in April 1878, when performing at the Royal Music Hall in Holborn, London.The Era, 4 April 1878, p. 20. Stardom Poster for Vesta Tilley performing as Burlington Bertie Vesta Tilley performing as a principal boy Tilley's success continued into the 1880s and she was able to command ever higher fees for her performances. As a male impersonator she typically performed as a dandy or a fop, a famous character being \\"Burlington Bertie\\" although she also played other roles such as policemen and clergymen. By the 1890s, she was known as \\"the London Idol\\" and adored by her fans. Her father had died in 1888 and two years later she married Walter de Frece, a theatre impresario who owned music halls across Great Britain. Frece became her new manager and also began to write her songs. She toured extensively in Britain and also played the vaudeville circuit in the United States on six separate visits. She had become the highest-earning woman in England. One theatre in the US offered her a salary of $600 per week. Tilley was known for her painstaking attention to detail in preparing for her roles: she wore her hair tightly plaited and hidden under a wig; she took to wearing men's underwear so her appearance looked believable, since contemporary women's underclothing would have distorted her shape. Her performances were always family-friendly, unlike other acts. She had found her niche, performing as a male impersonator. Working-class men adored her mockery of the upper classes. From the 1870s onwards, women also went to music halls and they revelled in Tilley's independence. By 1912, music hall entertainments had become so famous that a Royal Command Performance was organised. Tilley sang a favourite song, \\"The Piccadilly Johnny with the Little Glass Eye\\" wearing trousers as part of her act. Queen Mary was scandalised to see a woman's legs and hid her face behind a programme. Alongside other stars such Dan Leno and Ada Reeve, Tilley made some of the first sound recordings in England in 1898. She also played the principal boy in a number of pantomimes. At the age of 13 she played Robinson Crusoe at the New Theatre Royal in Portsmouth. She was best known for her titular role in Dick Whittington, which she played many times. She often performed in male roles in pantomimes such as Beauty and the Beast and Sinbad the Sailor, and occasionally played female parts, such as the Queen of Hearts at the Theatre Royal, Brighton. Wartime work  Publicity photograph of Vesta Tilley dressed as a foppish young man By the time the First World War began, Tilley's career was slowing down and the changing situation provided a chance for it to develop further. She and her husband ran military recruitment drives and she sang at charity events. Tilley dressed in khaki fatigues and performed numbers written by her husband such as \\"Jolly Good Luck to the Girl Who Loves a Soldier\\", \\"The Army of Today's All Right\\", \\"Six Days' Leave\\", and \\"Your King and Country Want You\\" (also known as \\"We Don't Want to Lose You but We Think You Ought to Go\\"). She was nicknamed \\"England‚Äôs greatest recruiting sergeant\\" since young men were sometimes asked to join the army during her show. Over the course of a week in Hackney, she enlisted an entire battalion, which became known as \\"The Vesta Tilley Platoon\\". However, Tilley was also prepared to question the carnage of war. In \\"I'm Glad I've Got a Bit of a Blighty One\\", she sang about a soldier who was delighted to have been wounded in battle because it would allow him to go back to England (Blighty). Retirement Grave of Vesta Tilley and her husband Walter de Frece at Putney Vale Cemetery, London in 2014 After the war, music halls declined in popularity. Walter de Frece was knighted in the 1919 King's Birthday Honours List for his services to the war effort, with Tilley becoming Lady de Frece. Frece decided to run for Parliament and Tilley chose to end her stage career. Her farewell tour took a year to complete, between 1919 and 1920. All proceeds were given to a local children's hospitals. She made her final appearance at the Coliseum Theatre, London on Saturday 5 June 1920 (at the age of 56). In its review, The Times called it a \\"wonderful night\\" and commented that at the end she was \\"gradually being submerged under the continuous stream of bouquets\\". Walter de Frece became a Conservative Member of Parliament, first for Ashton-under-Lyne and later for Blackpool. In 1923, Tilley was presented at the royal court as Lady de Frece. Her husband served in office until 1931 and then the couple moved to Monte Carlo for their retirement. Her autobiography, Recollections of Vesta Tilley, was published in 1934. After her husband died in 1935, Vesta Tilley continued to live in Monte Carlo. Tilley died whilst visiting London on 16 September 1952, aged 88. Her body was buried alongside her husband, at Putney Vale Cemetery. Her life story was commemorated in the 1957 film After the Ball.

The series was created (and occasionally directed) by David Greenwalt and John McNamara, and starred Adrian Pasdar as the eponymous lead character Jim Profit. In February 2008 repeat episodes began airing on Chiller (in the USA), and in October 2010 on CBS Action (in Europe).\\"Profit on CBS Action\\" from cbsaction.co.uk Considered by many to have been well ahead of its time, the series was a precursor to the early-21st-century trend of ‚Äúedgy‚Äù TV melodramas (featuring dark themes and multidimensional characters) such as: The Sopranos; Mad Men; Nip/Tuck; Dexter; The Practice, House, Breaking Bad and The Shield. Controversial themes (largely stemming from the lead character's amoral, Richard III-style ways), along with low ratings, made the show uncomfortable and unfamiliar viewing for mainstream U.S. audiences and Fox network affiliates at the time, leading to its cancellation after just three episodes (not including the pilot) aired. In 2013 TV Guide ranked the series #4 on its list of 60 shows that were \\"Canceled Too Soon\\", calling the series \\"shockingly memorable\\".Roush, Matt (June 3, 2013). \\"Canceled Too Soon\\". TV Guide. pp. 20 and 21 Summary Jim Profit is a newly promoted junior-executive at Gracen & Gracen (G&G;), a multinational conglomerate that often engages in unethical business practices while actively cultivating a positive public image. G&G;'s dark side does not bother Profit, who is not above using blackmail, bribery, extortion, or worse to get ahead himself. Jim Profit addresses the audience via voiceover narration, and occasionally even ‚Äúbreaks the fourth wall‚Äù by speaking directly to the camera/audience with such quotes as: \\"The line most people say they won't cross... it's usually something they've already done when they thought no one was watching.\\" Through frequent inner monologues, Profit shares his motives, plans, and situational observations with the audience. When home alone at night, Profit continues his ‚Äòwork‚Äô in his office (hidden behind a false wall of his living room), searching the Internet and hacking G&G;'s servers for information to be used as research and ammunition for his various schemes. Whenever he eliminates or outmaneuvers a G&G; target, that person's avatar is exploded and erased from his computer's virtual-G&G-offices; environment. While obviously affluent and living in a well-furnished luxury penthouse, Profit still goes to bed the same way he did as a child: curled up, naked in the corner of a large G&G; shipping box like the one he was raised in. Characters =Main= * Jim Profit (Adrian Pasdar) ‚Äì born James \\"Jimmy\\" Stakowski, he was raised in a cardboard G&G; shipping box (with a hole cut out for him to view a constantly-on television) by a neglectful, physically and psychologically abusive father in a rural area near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Profit reinvents himself as an Ivy League-educated, corporate business prodigy after escaping his past by chaining his father to his bed, setting it afire, then fleeing the family ranch as a teenager. His upbringing leaves Profit with a hatred of TV, and idolizing Gracen & Gracen as the ideal family he never had. As a result, Profit's goal as an adult is to rise high enough in G&G; to indispensably embed himself into the Gracens‚Äô business and personal lives ‚Äì by any means necessary. He worked in auditing before ascending to junior vice president of Acquisitions; his stated goal is to become president of Acquisitions. He climbs the corporate ladder by covertly engineering the ruin of those who stand in his way and/or refuse to assist him, while mostly staying behind-the-scenes himself. * Joanne Meltzer (Lisa Zane) ‚Äì Profit's archenemy and G&G;'s obsessive, crusading West Coast chief of security. She had a short-lived affair with Jack Walters while his wife had temporarily run off with a lover. She remains loyal to and friendly with Jack, admiring his decent and ethical nature ‚Äì even after he reconciles with his wife (who openly resents her). Jack's spectacular downfall (engineered by Profit) along with parallels in the natures of Profit and her older sister (who raised but also brutally abused her) are key forces driving her to expose and stop Profit. A former police detective and ‚Äúfanatical in pursuit of a goal‚Äù, the ever-suspicious Meltzer constantly tries to figure out and foil Profit's plans, but is oftentimes a step behind her nemesis. She admires Jeffrey Sykes for his sterling morals, and perceives him as able to outsmart and defeat Profit. * Charles Henry \\"Chaz\\" Gracen (Keith Szarabajka) ‚Äì G&G;'s no-nonsense, paranoid, violently short-tempered chief executive officer. Although he takes a different mistress each year, making money is his only love. To clients and all outsiders to G&G; he convincingly pretends to be soft-spoken, friendly and patient. Though usually agitated and curt, Chaz occasionally displays a dark, passive-aggressive sense of humor, constantly berates his brother, and bitterly chafes at working in the long shadow of his meddling father/boss, G&G;'s founder and chairman emeritus of the G&G; board of directors. * Pete Gracen (Jack Gwaltney) ‚Äì Chaz's younger brother, and the senior vice president of Acquisitions. A longtime alcoholic, Pete secretly wants Chaz's approval ‚Äì and to be president of Acquisitions, or even CEO ‚Äì despite being impotent, immature, and apparently incompetent. Drunken stupors, often in public with family, are frequent sources of embarrassment and humiliation for Pete. * Nora Gracen (Allison Hossack) ‚Äì Pete's insecure, emotionally fragile, lonely trophy wife. Trusting and desperate for the love and sense of purpose that her failing husband can no longer provide, she becomes hopelessly obsessed with Profit, after he seduces her but then (intentionally) ends their affair just before physically consummating it. Nora regards Profit as a close friend, confidant, and kindred spirit; Profit strings her along by continuing to build intimacy between them, then restating that he wants to be ‚Äújust friends‚Äù whenever she tries to act on her attraction to him. She harbors unhealed emotional wounds from a childhood tragedy. * Gail Koner (Lisa Darr) ‚Äì Profit's resourceful, morally conflicted secretary (originally Jack Walters' secretary), and primary henchperson. Initially, Profit blackmails Gail into assisting him in his schemes; however, she feels increasingly loyal (and/or obligated) to Profit, as he rewards her service with extravagant favors (e.g., saving her job, hiding her embezzlement, and arranging for vastly upgraded ‚Äì and fully paid ‚Äì nursing home care for her seriously ill mother). She may be the only character that Profit has any genuine human connection with. Profit takes pride as he guides Gail in developing her skills in duplicity. Profit seems interested in her mother's well being, and after Gail is passed over for promotion (yet again), he promises to mold her into ‚Äúexecutive material.‚Äù * Bobbi Stakowski (Lisa Blount) ‚Äì Profit's hedonistic, temperamental step-mother (his father's 2nd wife), and occasional lover (who seduced and molested him during his socially isolated, early adolescence). A shrewd-yet-unpredictable drug abuser, con woman and former prostitute, Bobbi repeatedly tries to blackmail Profit (with threats of exposing evidence of his true background and past crimes ‚Äì including murder) into financing a luxurious, effort-free lifestyle for her. * Jeffrey Sykes (Sherman Augustus) ‚Äì a litigious corporate law attorney and G&G;'s newly hired vice president of Business Affairs. A highly driven, P.R.-savvy do-gooder, Sykes takes a more directly antagonistic approach to Profit and is warmly welcomed by Joanne Meltzer as an ally. Sykes is single- mindedly committed to a secret, personal agenda that repeatedly ‚Äì but sometimes unwittingly ‚Äì disrupts Profit's schemes. =Recurring and guests= * Jack Walters (Scott Paulin) ‚Äì G&G;'s former President of Acquisitions. * Elizabeth Gracen-Walters (Jennifer Hetrick) ‚Äì Jack's (recovering) alcoholic wife; cousin of \\"Chaz\\" and Pete. * Constance Gracen (Teryl Rothery) ‚Äì Chaz's estranged wife. * Dr. Jeremy Batewell (John Hawkes) ‚Äì a former G&G; employee who sexually harassed Gail Koner. * \\"Kelly Hunt\\"/Carol McKenna (Jessica Tuck) ‚Äì Profit's female equivalent.

Low Nielsen ratings were cited as the official cause; Profit ranked 138th of 160 shows for 1996 and suffered from viewer tune-out during the airing of the 2-hour pilot episode. Other factors that may have hastened Profit‚Äôs demise include: * Viewers reportedly flooded their local Fox network affiliates with phone calls objecting to Jim Profit‚Äôs amoral actions, some even referring to him as \\"Satan in a Suit\\";Endrst, James. \\"A Season Finale After a Nine-Year Wait\\", The New York Times, August 13, 2005. Accessed July 30, 2013. such opinions were most vociferously expressed by viewers in the Bible Belt region of the southern USA.\\"3:16 'Profit' Musings\\" Some Fox network affiliates even threatened to pre-empt Profit in their local markets, replacing it with alternative programming. * Members of the business community were outraged that Profit portrayed them so poorly. Shaifali Puri of Fortune said: \\"Just in case there's anyone left who isn't convinced corporate America is a den of naked ambition and bald turpitude, comes now (the TV show) Profit.\\" It was rumored that even Fox network founder Rupert Murdoch objected to the show's edgy portrayal of corporate America, although Adrian Pasdar was quoted as saying that Profit was Murdoch's favorite TV show. * Airings of Profit consistently lost almost all of the lead-in audience from the smash-hit melodrama Melrose Place (the original version) which was scheduled in the timeslot immediately preceding Profit. This reportedly did not sit well with Melrose Place's executive producer Aaron Spelling, especially after Time and Entertainment Weekly published glowing reviews of Profit but scathing reviews of Melrose Place. Coincidentally, Spelling even approached Adrian Pasdar in 1992 to play the role of Jake Hanson on Melrose Place; however Pasdar rejected the role despite Spelling's status as one of the most powerful and influential U.S. television producers of the 1970s-1990s.Adrian Pasdar biography from yahoo.com Profit co-creator David Greenwalt hypothesized that \\"What might have turned off viewers to Profit wasn't just that it was so different [from other TV shows of the time] but that it was such an affront to it.\\"\\"10 Cult TV Hits That Originally Flopped\\" from howstuffworks.com The cancellation of Profit was lamented by the organization Viewers for Quality Television; VQT founder Dorothy Swanson stated: \\"It certainly was not a mainstream show. It wasn't for everyone. There were parts of it I'm sure mainstream viewers found very disturbing and unappealing. But for people who like interesting television, it was very well written. It was spellbinding. You had to know what made this guy (Jim Profit) tick.\\"\\"Loss of 'Profit' Deals a Blow to TV\\" from deseretnews.com Awards * Adrian Pasdar was nominated for a 1996 Petcabus Award in the category \\"Best Actor in a Drama Series\\" for his role as Jim Profit. * Profit was nominated for a 1996 Artios Award in category \\"Best Casting for TV, Dramatic Pilot\\".1996 Artios Award Winner & Nominations from imdb.com Home media Anchor Bay Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 on August 9, 2005.

Gail Koner, Jack's executive secretary, a loyal employee of 3 years and very devoted to her boss. Production Profit was produced by Greenwalt/McNamara Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with New World Television, and was the final series to come from Cannell's company (as well as one of the few for which he did not write any scripts). The exterior shots outside the Gracen & Gracen twin towers were filmed on the plaza in front of the Sheraton Wall Centre Hotel in Vancouver. For production, a \\"Gracen & Gracen Wall Center\\" placard was positioned over the covered entrance in front of one building and two G&G; logo monuments were placed in the front and center of the plaza. Another part of the same hotel complex now includes the well-known One Wall Centre building that had not yet been constructed when Profit was shot in early 1996. According to the Region 1 DVD liner notes, the interior G&G; office shots for the two-hour pilot episode were taken at the real working offices of B.C. Gas and that of a prestigious law firm in downtown Vancouver. Subsequent episodes were shot in studio sets modeled after these offices. The scene outside a hospital with Joanne Meltzer and Profit in the episode \\"Healing\\" was shot in front of St. Paul's Hospital located just across Burrard Street from the Sheraton Wall Centre. The exterior of Profit's apartment building featuring columnar bay windows up and down the entire front of the building is a location called Eugenia Place in Vancouver's West End; the structure is notable for the presence of a 35-foot Pin oak tree growing on the building's roof, located approximately 180 feet above street level. Profit's exploration of Gracen & Gracen's computer network was done through a 3D-image rendering interface, which represents G&G;'s corporate data as a building with a series of offices. This was implemented using the Virtual Reality Modeling Language which was believed to be the way that future websites would be built in 1996. In the years leading up to the production of Profit numerous films such as The Lawnmower Man, Virtuosity, and especially the corporate thriller Disclosure featured a Virtual Reality interface which directly inspired its use in Profit. What would have happened David Greenwalt & John McNamara gave details of plotlines from the never-produced second season in the audio commentaries on the Region 1 DVD. * Joanne Meltzer dies early in the first episode of the second season while in Ireland looking into Profit's background. The phone booth from which she is calling Sykes is set to explode. There is a bomb planted there by the Irish Republican Army. It was to be revealed later that this was done at the behest of Profit. * Jim has stolen the identity of a \\"real\\" Jim Profit. The \\"real\\" Jim Profit is in a coma after he was drowned by the protagonist Jim Profit. Later on, the protagonist would return to finish killing his alias. * Charles \\"Chaz\\" Gracen has a heart attack while running on his treadmill due to a mild poison Profit slips into Chaz's water bottle. Profit eventually convinces Chaz that his father (who is the Chairman of G&G;'s Board of Directors) is trying to kill him. * Profit engineers the death of Chaz and Pete Gracen's father to help the two brothers reconcile their differences, eliminate a troublemaker on G&G;'s Board of Directors, and help tighten Profit's control over G&G.; * Another storyline involved Profit getting a current Senator drunk to the point of blackout, staging a car accident, and convincing the Senator that he had killed someone. These events probably led into a related storyline where Pete Gracen becomes a Senator himself. * Pete and Nora Gracen would have divorced. In 2001 it was reported that co-creator David Greenwalt, who later went on to produce the Buffy the Vampire Slayer spin-off series Angel, once entertained the idea of having Adrian Pasdar reprise his role as Jim Profit on Angel. The main villains in Angel were a law firm called Wolfram & Hart, and Profit would have joined the firm. Conflicting working schedules with Pasdar (then the lead on NBC's Mysterious Ways), and the predictable difficulties in securing the rights (from Fox) to use the Jim Profit character prevented this from happening before Angel's run ended in its fifth and final season in 2004. Notes * According to the 2005 DVD releases‚Äô \\"Greed Kills\\" featurette, McNamara and Greenwalt developed the concept for Profit after McNamara attended a local (i.e., L.A.) touring production of Richard III (in modern dress and set in the 1930s) featuring Sir Ian McKellen. * In the audio commentary of the 2005 Region 1 DVD, McNamara and Greenwalt indicated that Fox executives requested that the character of Bobbi Stakowski be changed from being Profit's biological mother to the somewhat less-inflammatory status of being his step-mother. * According to the \\"Greed Kills\\" featurette, Profit's traumatic upbringing was based on research Greenwalt had done on the childhood of a real-life serial killer (who had been similarly raised in a box, with only a television present to ‚Äúraise‚Äù it), as described in the nonfiction novel Whoever Fights Monsters: My Twenty Years Tracking Serial Killers for the FBI by Robert K. Ressler & Tom Shachtman. The relevant passage is located in Chapter 4 titled Childhoods of Violence: \\"One woman propped her infant son in a cardboard box in front of the television set, and left for work; later, she'd put him in a playpen, toss in some food, and let the TV set be the baby- sitter until she came home again.\\" * Stephen J. Cannell, executive producer of Profit, admitted the name \\"Profit\\" is a bit of homage to the crazed Mel Profitt character (portrayed by Kevin Spacey) in Cannell's critically acclaimed Wiseguy TV series.Wiseguy page from aintitcool.com * Stephen J. Cannell reportedly was \\"shopping\\" a revival of Profit around July 1996, and said that the cable network Showtime had \\"shown some interest\\". A Showtime original series with some similarity to Profit called Dexter premiered in 2006; since then Dexter has received numerous awards and widespread critical acclaim. Lisa Darr, who played Profit's assistant Gail Koner, had a small role as a defense attorney in the season-four premiere episode, \\"Living the Dream\\".Dexter \\"Living The Dream\\" Episode Cast from imdb.com In the episode, Darr's character is cross-examining the title character (Dexter Morgan) and destroying his credibility on the stand. Sherman Augustus, who played Profit's male rival Jeffrey Sykes, also had a small role on Dexter as \\"Benjamin Caffrey\\" in the season 7 episode Helter Skelter.Dexter \\"Helter Skelter\\" Episode Cast from imdb.com Cultural references * The feature film Cement directed by Adrian Pasdar featured a scene where the character Fergus watches part of the pilot episode of Profit on a TV. Fergus says \\"It's 8:00, time for Profit\\"; 8:00pm was the original time-slot for Profit in the Central/Mountain time zone when it first aired on Fox. The scene also includes numerous shots of a fish tank similar to the one located in Profit's apartment. * The character of Jos√©phine Karlsson from the French TV series Engrenages (Spiral) was directly inspired by Jim Profit according to series producer Alain Clert.Origins of Gear: Jim Profit Possible revival * In mid-2018 Adrian Pasdar stated that a reboot of Profit was under development by director/producer Tawnia McKiernan, daughter of Stephen J.

Self-taught, he worked in a variety of positions related to industrial design. Fresco wrote and lectured his views on sustainable cities, energy efficiency, natural-resource management, cybernetic technology, automation, and the role of science in society. He directed the Venus Project and advocated global implementation of a socioeconomic system which he referred to as a \\"resource-based economy\\". Early life Jacque Fresco was born on March 13, 1916, and grew up in a Sephardi Jewish household, at the family's home in Bensonhurst, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. A teenager during the Great Depression, he spent time with friends discussing Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, science, and the future. Fresco attended the Young Communist League before being \\"physically ejected\\" for loudly stating that \\"Karl Marx was wrong!\\" after a discussion with the league president during a meeting. He left home at the age of 14, hitchhiking and \\"jumping\\" trains as one of the so-called \\"Wild Boys of the Road\\". He later turned his attention to technocracy. Career =Aircraft industry= Fresco worked at Douglas Aircraft Company in California during the late 1930s. He presented designs including a flying wingI. and a disk-shaped aircraft. Some of his designs were considered impractical at the time and Fresco's design ideas were not adopted. Fresco resigned from Douglas because of design disagreements. In 1942, Fresco was drafted into the United States Army. He was assigned technical design duties for the United States Army Air Forces at Wright Field design laboratories in Dayton, Ohio. One design he produced was a \\"radical variable camber wing\\" with which he attempted to optimize flight control by allowing the pilot to adjust the thickness and lift of the wings during flight. Fresco did not adjust to military life and was discharged. Model of the Trend Home =Trend Home= Fresco was commissioned by Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz, to design low cost housing. Muntz invested $500,000 seed money in the project. Fresco, 32 years old at the time, along with his associates Harry Giaretto and Eli Catran conceived, designed and engineered a project house called the Trend Home. Fresco came closest to traditional career success with this project. Built mostly of aluminum and glass, it was on prominent display at Stage 8 of the Warner Bros. Sunset Lot in Hollywood for three months. The home could be toured for one dollar, with proceeds going to the Cancer Prevention Society. In the summer of 1948, a Federal Housing Administration official met Muntz about the project. The official's proposal, according to Muntz, would add a bureaucratic overhead negating the low production costs. Without federal or further private funding the project did not go into mass production. This experience led Fresco to the conclusion that society would have to be changed for his inventions to reach their potential. =Scientific Research Laboratories= In the late 1940s, Fresco created and was director of Scientific Research Laboratories in Los Angeles. Here he also gave lectures, and taught technical design, meanwhile researching and working on inventions as a freelance inventor and scientific consultant. During this period, Fresco struggled to get his research funded and faced setbacks and financial difficulties. In 1955, Fresco left California after his laboratory was removed to build the Golden State Freeway. Midlife In 1955 Fresco moved to Miami, Florida. He opened a business as a psychological consultant, but had no formal schooling in the subject. Receiving a \\"barrage of criticism\\" from the American Psychological Association Fresco stopped that business. In a newspaper article from that time period Fresco claimed to have a degree from Sierra University, Los Angeles, California, which is unverified. Fresco described white supremacist organizations he joined to test the feasibility of changing people. He tells of joining a local Ku Klux Klan and White Citizens Council in an attempt to change their views about racial discrimination. In Miami Fresco presented designs of a circular city. Fresco made his living working as an industrial designer for various companies such as Alcoa and the Major Realty Corporation. In 1961, with Pietro Belluschi and C. Frederick Wise, Fresco collaborated on a project known as the Sandwich House. Consisting of mostly prefabricated components, partitions, and aluminum, the project sold houses for $2,950, or $7,500 with foundation and all internal installations. During this period, Fresco supported his projects by designing prefabricated aluminum devices through Jacque Fresco Enterprises Inc.I. * II. * III. * IV. From 1955 to 1969 Fresco named his social ideas \\"Project Americana\\". =Looking Forward= Looking Forward was published in 1969. Author Ken Keyes Jr., and Jacque Fresco coauthored the book. Looking Forward is a speculative look at the future. The authors picture an ideal 'cybernetic society in which want has been banished and work and personal possessions no longer exist; individual gratification is the total concern'. =Sociocyberneering, Inc.= Fresco formed \\"Sociocyberneering\\", a membership organization claiming 250 members, according to an interview with Fresco. He hosted lectures in Miami Beach and Coral Gables Fresco promoted his organization by lecturing at universitiesI. *II. *III. *IV. and appearing on radio and television. Although Fresco is presented as a 'Doctor' on the Larry King show there is no evidence of that being the case. Fresco did not complete high school.http://www.knowledgeoftoday.org/2012/01/jacque-fresco-interview-larry- king-1974.html Retrieved October-28-2015 Fresco's \\"sociocyberneering\\" as a membership group was discontinued and land was purchased at another location in rural Venus, Florida. He established his home and research center there. The Venus Project and later career Construction in Venus Fresco with Roxanne Meadows in Venus Fresco, with his partner Roxanne Meadows, supported the project in the 1990s through freelance inventing, industrial engineering, conventional architectural modeling, and invention consultations. In 2002, Fresco published his main work The Best That Money Can't Buy. In 2006, William Gazecki directed the semi-biographical film about Fresco, Future by Design.Gazecki, W. (2006). Docflix. In 2008, Peter Joseph featured Fresco in the film Zeitgeist Addendum where his ideas of the future were given as possible alternatives. Peter Joseph, founder of the Zeitgeist Movement began advocating Fresco's approach. In April 2012, the two groups disassociated due to disagreements regarding goals and objectives. In 2010, Fresco attempted to trademark the phrase \\"resource-based economy\\". The phrase was reviewed and found to be too generic, so the trademark was denied. Throughout 2010, Fresco traveled with Meadows, worldwide to promote interest in the Venus Project.World Tour Lecture Dates On January 15, 2011, Zeitgeist: Moving Forward was released in theaters, featuring Fresco.Joseph P. (2011). In November 2011, Fresco spoke to protesters at the \\"occupy Miami\\" site at Government Center in Miami. In April 2012, Roxanne Meadows released a film, Paradise or Oblivion, summarizing the goals and proposals of the Venus Project. In June 2012, Maja Borg screened her film, Future My Love, at the Edinburgh International Film Festival featuring the work of Fresco and Roxanne Meadows.EDI Film Fest, edifilmfest.org  Personal life and family  Fresco was born to immigrants from the Middle East, Isaac and Lena Fresco. His father was born in 1880 and around 1905 immigrated from Istanbul to New York where he worked as a horticulturist. He died in 1963. Fresco's mother was born in 1887 in Jerusalem and also migrated to New York around 1904. She died in 1988. Fresco was brother to two siblings, a sister, Freda, and a brother, David. Fresco had two marriages when he lived in Los Angeles and carried his second marriage through his first couple of years in Miami. He divorced his second wife in 1957 and remained unmarried thereafter. His second wife, Patricia, gave birth to a son, Richard, in 1953 and a daughter, Bambi, in 1956. Richard was an army privateI. *II. and died in 1976. Bambi died of cancer in 2010. Fresco died on May 18, 2017 in his sleep at his home in Sebring, Florida, from complications of Parkinson's disease at the age of 101.https://www.thevenusproject.com Roxanne Meadows assisted Fresco from 1976. As Fresco's domestic partner and administrative colleague, she oversees much of the management of the Venus Project. Critical appraisals It's a \\"lack of professional engagement\\", William Gazecki who in 2006 completed Future by Design, a feature-length profile of Jacque Fresco says, that hurt Fresco the most. \\"The real missing link in Jacque's world is having put Jacque to work,\\" Gazecki says, \\"[It's] exemplified when people say: 'Well, show me some buildings he's built. And I don't mean the domes out in Venus. I mean, let's see an office building, let's see a manufacturing plant, let's see a circular city.' And that's where he should have been 30 years ago. He should have been applying his work, in the real world ... [but] he's not a collaborator, and I think that's why he's never had great public achievements.\\" When asked by a reporter why he had such difficulty actualizing his many ideas, Fresco responded, \\"Because I can't get to anybody.\\" =Views on Fresco= Fresco's critical view of modern economics has been compared to Thorstein Veblen's concept of \\"the predatory phase in human development\\", according to an article in the journal Society and Business Review.For the term \\"predatory phase\\", see also the quote from Thorstein Veblen's book The Theory of the Leisure Class, Chapter One: Introductory (Gutenberg Project): \\"The predatory phase of culture is attained only when the predatory attitude has become the habitual and accredited spiritual attitude for the members of the group; when the fight has become the dominant note in the current theory of life; when the common-sense appreciation of men and things has come to be an appreciation with a view to combat.\\" Gr√∏nborg has labeled other facets of Fresco's ideology a \\"tabula rasa approach\\". Synergetics theorist Arthur Coulter called Fresco's city designs \\"organic\\" and \\"evolutionary\\", rather than revolutionary. Coulter posits such cities as the answer to Walter B. Cannon's idea of achieving homeostasis for society. =Hypothetical form of government= Fresco described his form of governance in this way: \\"The aims of The Venus Project have no parallel in history, not with communism, socialism, fascism or any other political ideology. This is true because cybernation is of recent origin. With this system, the system of financial influence and control will no longer exist.\\" Ludwig von Mises Institute scholar Robert P. Murphy has raised the economic calculation problem against a resource-based economy. In a resource-based economy, Murphy believes there would be no ability to calculate the availability and desirability of resources because the price mechanism is not utilized. Addressing this aspect, another article in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics states criticism of \\"central plannings\\" computation problem applies to the ideas of Fresco. =Question of utopianism= The Venus Project states on its website that it is not utopian. Nikolina Olsen-Rule, writing for the Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies, supports this idea, > For most people, the promise of the project sounds like an unattainable > utopia, but if you examine it more closely, there are surprisingly many > scientifically founded arguments that open up an entire new world of > possibilities. Morten Gr√∏nborg, also of Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies, points out the Venus Project is, > ... this visionary idea of a future society has many characteristics in > common with the utopia. ... the word utopia carries a double meaning, since > in Greek it can mean both the good place (eutopia) and the nonexisting place > (outopia). A good place is precisely what Fresco has devoted his life to > describing and fighting for. =Comments on Fresco= Hans-Ulrich Obrist wrote that \\"Fresco's future may, of course, seem outmoded and his writings have been subject to critique for their fascistic undertones of order and similitude, but his contributions are etched in the popular psyche and his eco-friendly concepts continue to influence our present generation of progressive architects, city planners and designers.\\" Fresco's work gained the attention of science fiction enthusiast and critic Forrest J Ackerman. Fresco later attracted Star Trek animator, Doug Drexler, who worked with Fresco to produce several computer renderings of his designs. Commenting on Fresco, physicist Paul G. Hewitt wrote that Fresco inspired him toward a career in physical science. = Awards = In July 2016, Jacque Fresco received a Novus Summit award for City Design/Community.

It is owned by Cincinnati Public Radio. It broadcasts at 90.9 FM and features classical music. WGUC also has HD Radio capability and broadcasts jazz on WGUC-2. When Cincinnati Public Radio purchased Xavier University's \\"X-Star Network\\" (a group of stations headed by WVXU-FM) in 2005, WGUC moved its National Public Radio news and talk programming, including All Things Considered, which had aired on WGUC since the 1970s, to WVXU. The only NPR-produced show still airing on WGUC is the youth classical performance program From the Top, while the news and information programming on WVXU has been expanded from previously. WGUC and WVXU share a building with WCET-TV in central Cincinnati. Format The station was originally licensed to the University of Cincinnati, broadcasting mostly classical music and All Things Considered. However, the creation of additional NPR programming in the 1980s created the need for an additional NPR outlet in Cincinnati, at which time WVXU (then licensed to Xavier University) became a member of NPR. While the two stations together provided most of the NPR programs available to a single market, the two NPR daily flagship newsmagazines aired separately; specifically, WVXU carried Morning Edition, while WGUC carried All Things Considered. With both stations now under the same licensee, program duplication, sometimes a problem in markets with more than one public radio station, could be eliminated. This means that WGUC broadcasts almost exclusively classical music, while WVXU carries news and information programming, including both NPR flagship newsmagazines. History In the late 1950s, a group of Cincinnati-area residents launched a campaign for a radio station devoted to cultural and public affairs programming, particularly classical music. At the time, the only outlet for classical music in the Cincinnati area was WKRC, which only aired four hours of classical music per week. A committee of the Queen City Association sought to bring either a repeater of WOSU in Columbus or a standalone fine-arts station to Cincinnati. The University of Cincinnati, then a municipally-governed institution, responded to the demand, and WGUC went on the air for the first time on September 21, 1960. WGUC was one of the first stations in the nation to meet the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's qualification standards; a charter member of NPR; and a founder of another network, American Public Radio (now Public Radio International). WGUC also had one of the first NPR satellite uplinks, the first digital west-to-east transatlantic broadcast, and is the only U.S. public radio station with an ongoing program to commission new music. In 2003, WGUC became the first public radio station in Ohio to broadcast a digital HD Radio signal. In June 2005, WGUC became one of the first stations in the nation to receive FCC authorization to experiment with FM multicasting. In 2006, the station added a second digital channel of full-time jazz music (formerly heard over the air on WVXU), along with a classical music service on its primary digital channel. In 1994, UC outsourced WGUC's operations to Cincinnati Classical Public Radio, a community-based nonprofit organization. UC retained the station's license until 2002, when it sold the license to CCPR. Currently WGUC's signal covers a 60-mile radius in southwestern Ohio, northern Kentucky, and southeastern Indiana. The station claims that almost 140,000 listeners tune to the station each week. WGUC broadcasts many local musical events, including the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra concerts, the Cincinnati May Festival, and the Cincinnati Opera season. The station currently produces and distributes The 90 Second Naturalist and Classics for Kids nationally. Holiday programs, such as Tunes From the Crypt (Halloween), A Feast For the Ears (Thanksgiving), and Love Greetings (Valentine's Day) have also had national carriage. One weekday feature, Cincinnati Spotlight, which airs weekdays during the 9:00 a.m. hour, highlights events in the listening area, local artists and musicians, and national and international performers who visit greater Cincinnati. Classics for Kids Classics for Kids debuted December 5, 1998 and is designed to help adults introduce children to classical music. The program, heard Saturday mornings and Sunday evenings, features a composer and his/her music, along with games, quizzes and curriculum materials for primary grade school students and teachers. The show is heard on several other classical-formatted public radio stations in the U.S. Radio Reading Service WGUC's subcarrier signal has served the local blind and visually impaired community since 1985. Through an agreement with the Cincinnati Association for the Blind, WGUC carries the audio broadcasts for the Radio Reading Service (RRS) on its alternate band.

He was educated at Purley County Grammar School and the University of Cambridge, where in 1969 he became a research student under the supervision of Dennis Sciama. When Sciama moved to the University of Oxford, he became a student of Stephen Hawking, obtaining his PhD from Cambridge in 1973. Career and research Apart from a stay at the Max Planck Institute in Munich in the 1970s he has remained in Cambridge throughout his career, becoming a full professor in 1997, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1999, and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 2002. Having worked on classical general relativity for his PhD thesis, Gibbons focused on the quantum theory of black holes afterwards. Together with Malcolm Perry, he used thermal Green's functions to prove the universality of thermodynamic properties of horizons, including cosmological event horizons. He developed the Euclidean approach to quantum gravity with Stephen Hawking, which allows a derivation of the thermodynamics of black holes from a functional integral approach. As the Euclidean action for gravity is not positive definite, the integral only converges when a particular contour is used for conformal factors. His work in more recent years includes contributions to research on supergravity, p-branes and M-theory, mainly motivated by string theory. Gibbons remains interested in geometrical problems of all sorts which have applications to physics. =Awards and honours= Gibbons was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1999.

He is an American politician from the State of Iowa. He was previously a Democratic candidate for Governor of Iowa and the U.S. Congress, and served as a member of the Iowa General Assembly from 1993 to 2006. Early life The son of a member of the U.S. military, Fallon was born in Santa Monica, California in 1958, but spent the majority of his formative years living in Saugus, Massachusetts. After two years at Marlboro College in Vermont, he spent several years traveling around Europe, Canada, and the Middle East. At one point, having exhausted his financial resources, he was homeless for a time before returning to the United States. During his travels, he acquired some fluency in Spanish and French. He knows how to play seven musical instruments, including the guitar, the accordion, the Irish whistle, and the piano. Upon returning to his native country, he moved to Iowa, where he attended Drake University between 1985 and 1987, earning a bachelor's degree in religious studies. Fallon also worked as a field canvasser for Iowa Citizen Action Network during this period. After graduating from Drake, he became a community organizer in the inner city of Des Moines, the result of his opposition to the then-dominant policies of President Ronald Reagan and other conservative Republicans. After organizing the Iowa portion of the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament in 1986, Fallon founded the Des Moines Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which ultimately became Clarion Alliance, a non-profit focusing on peace and conflict resolution issues. State legislature In 1992, he decided to enter electoral politics, challenging Democratic State Representative Gary Sherzan, a ten-year incumbent, for re- nomination. Although Sherzan outspent him by almost a two-to-one margin, Fallon won the primary with 63% of the vote and went on to an easy victory in the general election. During the 2000 presidential election, he made headlines across the state when he endorsed the candidacy of Green Party nominee Ralph Nader over that of Democrat Al Gore because of Gore's choice of Joe Lieberman as a running mate. Fallon admitted in 2001 that, while people's frustration with the Democratic Party was legitimate, his decision to back Nader was a mistake. The leaders of the Iowa Democratic Party, angered at Fallon's actions, stripped him of his place as ranking member of the House Local Government Committee. He was voted off the Polk County Democratic Central Committee and, when the state was redistricted in 2001, 70% of his former constituents were moved to another district (which was done through a non- partisan process). Facing a three-way primary in what was for all intents and purposes a new district, Fallon was not expected to survive. Instead, he won 68% of the vote in the primary and won re-election to a sixth term.  Run for governor  In October 2002, after progressive Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash, Fallon decided that he wanted to emulate Wellstone's impact on his state's politics by running for Governor. After spending almost two and a half years testing the waters and preparing for his run, he announced his candidacy on April 9, 2005 at a rally at the Iowa State Capitol, becoming the first candidate to officially declare. During the course of the race, in which he faced Secretary of State Chet Culver and former state economic development director and Congressman Mike Blouin, Fallon positioned himself as a candidate focused on populist concerns. The main focal point of his campaign was a pledge to enact voluntary public financing of elections, a pledge that he reinforced with his refusal to accept donations from political action committees and lobbyists and his self-imposed limitation of $2400 in contributions per person.Evidence suggests Fallon may challenge Boswell in Dem primary Iowa Independent He was also in favor of creating a locally owned renewable fuels industry, universal health care, reforming the Departments of Human Services and Corrections, ending government handouts to big business, and increased funding for public education. He opposed urban sprawl, legalized gambling, factory farms, and the Iowa Values Fund, a multimillion-dollar corporate incentive package that he dubbed \\"corporate welfare.\\" In January and March 2006, more delegates pledged to him were selected to attend the state party convention than those of any other candidate. If no candidate had won 35% of the vote in the primary, convention delegates would have awarded the nomination. In late May, he received the endorsement of the Iowa Sierra Club and the Iowa City Press-Citizen, becoming the first candidate to receive support from a major newspaper. In the primary on June 6, 2006 the winner was Chet Culver with 57,976 votes (39.09%) and Fallon ran third out of a field of four, receiving 38,160 votes (25.73%). Although this result was not the win that Fallon and his supporters had hoped for, it was considerably in excess of the 5 to 10% that pundits had speculated he might receive at the beginning of the race.  Post-primary  On November 10, 2006, three days after the midterm elections, during which candidates that Fallon had campaigned for were elected Governor, Secretary of State, and to the state legislature and the United States Congress, he announced in an e-mail to supporters that he would take a hiatus from electoral politics, during which he would form a new political activist organization, dedicated to social justice, clean elections, and encouraging local and state action to address global warming. On December 28, 2006, Fallon appeared in Des Moines at the first official presidential campaign event of former North Carolina Senator John Edwards, taking tickets and passing out Edwards campaign literature. Edwards, who was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in 2004, has taken positions similar to Fallon's on campaign finance reform and universal health care, and has called for an end to poverty and an immediate withdrawal from the Iraq War.Radio Iowa On January 11, 2007, Fallon announced in an e-mail to supporters that he had co-founded a private business called \\"Independence Movement for Iowa,\\" or I'M for Iowa. According to Fallon, the organization will seek \\"independence\\" for Iowa from \\"special interest campaign contributions\\"; \\"poverty, injustice and discrimination\\"; \\"fossil fuels and foreign oil\\"; \\"government subsidies for big business\\"; and \\"government officials who operate without the public's interest in mind, often behind closed doors, and with a lack of integrity and accountability.\\".Iowa Politics Questions were raised about I'M for Iowa in March 2007 about whether the organization was following campaign finance laws and behaving in an ethical manner.\\"Iowa Independent However, these claims were based on the misunderstanding that I'M for Iowa was not a private, unincorporated business.  Congressional run, 2008  On January 8, 2008, Fallon formally filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for Congress.CQ Politics  Even More Politics for Dems in Iowa He formally announced his candidacy in a press conference in Des Moines on January 16, 2008.Iowa Politics Media reports noted that Fallon carried the 3rd District in the 2006 gubernatorial primary, and examination of the caucus results shows that John Edwards, whom Fallon endorsed, did much better in the district than did Senator Hillary Clinton, whom Boswell endorsed. Edwards carried six counties in the district, while Clinton carried none. Fallon was defeated by Boswell in the Democratic primary on June 3, 2008, by a 61 to 39 percent margin. Talk show host Since 2009, Fallon has hosted the Fallon Forum,http://fallonforum.com/ a call-in talk show. The program discusses a wide range of contemporary issues. In Des Moines, the Fallon Forum airs live on La Reina, 1260 AM and 96.5 FM. The program is rebroadcast on stations in Ames, Iowa City, Fayette (Missouri) and New Orleans (Louisiana).Fallon Forum Fallon was arrested with a number of others on October 8, 2011 on the Iowa Capitol grounds when police broke up the Occupy Des Moines encampment, part of the Occupy Movement.http://www.dailyiowanmedia.com/live/2011/10/10/occupy- demonstrators-arrested-in-des-moines/ Fallon was found not guilty of trespassing by a jury on March 9, 2012. Allegations of sexual misconduct In July, 2018, a former colleague of Fallon's, Heather Pearson, accused Fallon of sexual misconduct, claiming he had \\"abused many women.\\" In 2019, another woman, Jessica Fears, made similar accusations, labeling Fallon a \\"predator.\\" Fallon denied these accusations, stating that he considers the claims made by Pearson and Fears to be a \\"barrage of slander and aggression.\\" In March, 2020, the Sierra Club and Sierra Club Iowa issued a joint statement of support of Heather Pearson, indicating the groups had \\"severed ties of engagement with Mr. Fallon.\\" Climate advocacy On March 1, 2013 Fallon announced the start of a campaign aimed at inspiring society to take action on climate change. Fallon assembled a team and launched the non-profit, Great March for Climate Action. He is planning for up to 1,000 individuals to march across the nation, from Los Angeles, CA to Washington DC, in order to motivate both the general public and elected officials to address climate change. On March 2, 2015, Fallon started a 400-mile hike along the proposed Dakota Access pipeline in Keokuk, to protest and rally support. On May 18, 2015 Capitol Police were called for a disturbance in the Governor's Office. Ed Fallon was found refusing to leave. Fallon was there to protest the Dakota Access pipeline. Fallon was escorted off the premises and was charged with criminal trespassing. He posted bond that evening.Brianne Pfannenstiel Ed Fallon arrested at statehouse, Des Moines Register, 18 May 2015 From late 2015 to early 2016, Fallon worked with The Climate Mobilization to approach presidential candidates campaigning for the Iowa caucuses urging a more realistic and ambitious approach to the climate crisis, an economic mobilization on the scale of the American effort during World War II for 100% clean energy and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. In January 2016, Fallon hosted a \\"Climate Emergency Caucus\\" in Des Moines before the Iowa caucuses, which simulated the state's 2016 Democratic presidential primary caucus. Bernie Sanders won the vote with 67% of attendees. Fallon endorsed Sanders for president, and spoke publicly in his favor in advance of the Iowa caucuses. Since its formation in 2016, Fallon has served as the director of Bold Iowa. Bold Iowa's mission is to build rural-urban coalitions to fight climate change; prevent the abuse of eminent domain; protect Iowa‚Äôs soil, air, and water; and promote non-industrial renewable energy. Fallon wrote his first book, Marcher, Walker, Pilgrim, published in 2018.

The Criminal Courts Building in downtown Los Angeles was renamed after her in 2002, and is now known as the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center. Early life and legal education Foltz was born Clarissa Shortridge in Milton, Indiana, to Talitha and Elias Willetts Shortridge (a lawyer and preacher). Prior to the Civil War, the family moved to Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where Foltz attended a co-educational school (rare at the time). In December 1864, at age 15, she eloped with a farmer and Civil War veteran named Jeremiah D. Foltz, and they began having children. However, he had difficulty supporting his family. The Foltzes moved several times, first to Portland, Oregon and finally to San Jose, California in 1872. During these times, she contributed articles to the New Northwest and the San Jose Mercury. Around 1876, her husband deserted her and their five children. She began studying law in the office of a local judge, in part through the support of local suffragette Sarah Knox-Goodrich. She also supported herself by giving public lectures, starting in 1877, on suffrage.  Legal career  = Joining the California bar = Foltz wanted to take the bar examination but California law at the time allowed only white males to become members of the bar. Foltz authored a state bill, known as the \\"Woman Lawyer Bill,\\" which replaced \\"white male\\" with \\"person,\\" and in September 1878 she passed the examination and was the first woman admitted to the California bar, and the first female lawyer on the entire west coast of the United States. Having little formal education, she wished to study at the first law school in California to improve her skills. Alongside her ally Laura de Force Gordon, Foltz applied to Hastings College of the Law but was denied admission because of her sex. Foltz and Gordon sued, but recognized that they faced strong opposition. To advance their cause, Gordon and Foltz wrote an amendment to the California state constitution that read \\"No person shall, on account of sex, be disqualified from entering upon or pursuing any lawful business, vocation, or profession.\\" Drawing upon both the Woman Lawyer Bill and the soon-to-be-ratified equal opportunity in employment statement in the constitution, Foltz and Gorden were able to argue that if women could serve as lawyers they must certainly be allowed to attend law school at the coeducational University of California. Judge Morrison agreed, and in Foltz v. Hoge ruled that Foltz and Gordon should be admitted to Hastings. The ruling was appealed, and Foltz studied for and passed the California State Supreme Court bar exam in order to argue her case, which she ultimately won. Although Foltz successfully obtained admission for all qualified women to Hastings, the work to win the case left Foltz impoverished and she returned to her legal career instead of pursuing her dream of attending law school. = Later career = Foltz practiced in San Francisco, San Diego, and from 1896 to 1899 in New York, where she attempted to create a career as a corporate attorney. Political career = Public speaking = In an era when public speaking could be a lucrative career, Foltz spoke for the Republicans during the campaigns of 1880, 1882, and 1884. In 1886 she became a Democrat, and in the winter of that year lectured in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa. = Suffrage = Foltz became a leader in the woman‚Äôs voting rights movement. During a career that spanned 56 years, Foltz almost single-handedly pushed a great deal of progressive legislation for women‚Äôs rights in the voting and legal fields. = Public defense = At the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair in 1893, during a \\"congress\\" of the Board of Lady Managers, Foltz made her first highly public presentation of her idea of the public defender. Foltz's then-radical concept of providing assistance to indigent criminal defendants is used today throughout the United States.  Other accomplishments  Foltz was notable for many \\"firsts\\": first female clerk for the State Assembly's Judiciary Committee (1880); the first woman appointed to the State Board of Corrections; the first female licensed Notary Public; the first woman named director of a major bank; and, in 1930, the first woman to run for Governor of California, at the age of 81. In 1910, she was appointed to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, becoming the first female deputy district attorney in the United States. She was active in the suffrage movement, authoring the Women's Vote Amendment for California in 1911. Foltz also raised five children, mostly as a single mother, and encouraged women not to overlook their traditional domestic roles. Foltz also founded and published the San Diego Daily Bee, and New American Woman Magazine, for which she wrote a monthly column until her death.  Family  Foltz's brother, Samuel M. Shortridge, was elected to the United States Senate in 1920 and served two terms. Foltz supported his campaign, though in earlier campaigns she had disagreed with him on key issues like tariffs. Death Foltz died at the age of 85 of heart failure at her home in Los Angeles on September 2, 1934. The pallbearers for her funeral included Governor Frank Merriam and several prominent federal and state judges. She was cremated and interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles County. Posthumous recognition At the insistence of its women students, Hastings College of the Law granted Foltz a posthumous degree of Doctor of Laws in 1991. Additionally, the primary social space inside UC Hastings's McAllister Tower student housing complex was christened the Clara S. Foltz Lounge. In 2002, the Criminal Courts Building in downtown Los Angeles was renamed the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center.

The Peel River is a wilderness river and Fort McPherson is the only community along its banks. The Yukon part of the Peel Watershed is undergoing land use planning.

Biography George Lewis Gillespie Jr. was born October 7, 1841, in Kingston, Tennessee. He graduated second in the Class of 1862 at the United States Military Academy and was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers on June 17, 1862. A Southerner who remained loyal to the Union, Gillespie joined the Army of the Potomac in September 1862. He commanded two companies of the engineer battalion which built fortifications and pontoon bridges throughout the Virginia campaigns until General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox in April 1865. On October 27, 1897, Gillespie received the Medal of Honor for carrying dispatches through enemy lines under withering fire to Major General Philip Sheridan at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Virginia on May 31, 1864. He was later Sheridan's Chief Engineer in the Army of the Shenandoah and the Military Division of the Gulf. At the end of the war, Gillespie held the Regular Army rank of captain and a brevet (temporary promotion) to the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the Civil War, Gillespie successively supervised the improvement of harbors at Cleveland, Ohio, Chicago, Boston, and New York City. He initiated construction of the canal at the Cascades of the Columbia River and built the famous Tillamook Rock Lighthouse off the Oregon coast. Gillespie also served on the Board of Engineers and for six years as president of the Mississippi River Commission. He was promoted to major on September 5, 1871, lieutenant colonel on October 12, 1886 and colonel on October 2, 1895. With the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Gillespie was promoted to brigadier general of Volunteers on May 27, 1898. He commanded the Army's Department of the East until October 31, 1898 when he was discharged from the Volunteers and reverted to his Regular Army rank of colonel. Gillespie was appointed as Chief of Engineers on May 3, 1901 and promoted to brigadier general the same day. He was acting U.S. Secretary of War in August 1901. He had charge of ceremonies at President William McKinley's funeral and at the laying of the cornerstone of the Army War College building in 1903. About 1904 he redesigned the United States Army's version of the Medal of Honor. The new design replaced the original design dating from 1862 which was often erroneously mistaken for the membership badge of the Grand Army of the Republic‚Äîan organization for Union veterans of the American Civil War. General Gillespie's design entirely changed the planchet to feature the head of Minerva in the center of a star surrounded by a wreath. The ribbon was changed from red, white and blue stripes to a light blue ribbon with thirteen white stars. Gillespie's final assignment was as Assistant Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1904 to 1905 with the rank of major general. Gillespie was a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) and was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 4061. He was also a member of the Society of the Army of the Potomac. Major General Gillespie retired from the Army on June 15, 1905, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 64. He died on September 27, 1913, in Saratoga Springs, New York. He was buried in the post cemetery at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Family General Gillespie married Rhobie Frances McMaster (1844-1921). By her he had two sons - Robert McMaster Gillespie (1871-1947) and Laurence Lewis Gillespie (1876-1940).

Randolph Rogers (July 6, 1825 in Waterloo, New York ‚Äì January 15, 1892 in Rome, Italy) was an American Neoclassical sculptor. An expatriate who lived most of his life in Italy, his works ranged from popular subjects to major commissions, including the Columbus Doors at the U.S. Capitol and American Civil War monuments. Biography Nydia, the Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii (1853‚Äì54), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Born in Waterloo, New York, he spent most of his childhood in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He developed an interest in wood cuts and wood engraving, and moved to New York City about 1847, but was unsuccessful in finding employment as an engraver. While working as a clerk in a dry-goods store, his employers discovered his native talent as a sculptor and provided funds for him to travel to Italy. He began study in Florence in 1848, where he studied briefly under Lorenzo Bartolini.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 423. He then opened a studio in Rome in 1851. He resided in that city until his death in 1892.James-Gadzinski & Cunningham, pp. 58‚Äì61. He began his career carving statues of children and portrait busts of tourists. He was not happy working with marble consequently all his marble statues were copied in his studio by Italian artisans under his supervision, from an original produced by him in another material. This also enabled him to profit from his popular works. His first large-scale work was Ruth Gleaning (1853), based on a figure in the Old Testament. It proved extremely popular, and up to 20 marble replicas were produced by his studio. His next large-scale work was Nydia, the Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii (1853‚Äì54), based on a character in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's best-selling 1834 novel, The Last Days of Pompeii. It proved even more popular, and his studio produced at least 77 marble replicas. In 1855 he received his first major commission in the United States: great bronze doors for the East Front of the United States Capitol. He chose to depict scenes from the life of Christopher Columbus. The Columbus Doors were modeled in Rome, cast in Munich, and installed in Washington, DC in 1871.Columbus Doors from Architect of the Capitol Webpage. In 1856, he completed the statue of President John Adams originally for the cemetery of Mount Auburn in Boston, Massachusetts.De Gubernatis, page 423 Following the 1857 death of sculptor Thomas Crawford, Rogers completed the sculpture program of the Washington Monument at the State Capitol in Richmond. He designed four major American Civil War monuments: the Soldiers' National Monument (1865‚Äì1869) at Gettysburg National Cemetery; the Rhode Island Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (1866‚Äì1871) in Providence; the Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (1867‚Äì1872) in Detroit; and the Soldiers' Monument (1871‚Äì1874) in Worcester, Massachusetts. He modeled The Genius of Connecticut (1877‚Äì1878), a bronze goddess that adorned the dome of the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford. It was damaged in a 1938 hurricane, removed, and melted down for scrap metal during World War II. A plaster cast of the statue is now exhibited within the building. In 1873 he became the first American to be elected to Italy's Accademia di San Luca, and he was knighted in 1884 by King Umberto I. Rogers suffered a stroke in 1882, and was never able to work again. He left his papers and plaster casts of his sculptures to the University of Michigan, where there is also a Nydia replica.

(one of the few Sesame Street productions they directly produced, though an \\"Executive Producer for CTW\\" credit was included in the end credits) and was meant to air as part of The Jim Henson Hour, but ended up airing as a solo special the week before the premiere episode aired. In the special, comedian Bill Cosby details the history of the show while interacting with various Muppet characters. Among the subjects featured are the curriculum, the show's adult humor and even the foreign co-productions from around the world (e.g. Plaza S√©samo‚Äînow S√©samo‚Äîand Rechov Sumsum). There are also guest appearances; opera singer Pl√°cido Domingo sings with Placido Flamingo, and Ray Charles sings Kermit's version of the song \\"It's Not Easy Bein' Green\\". Meanwhile, Bert and Ernie are taping the street with their video camera so they can watch Sesame Street on television, but Cookie Monster appears and eats both the video camera and the video tape. Bert, Ernie & Cookie Monster tell everybody on Sesame Street that they'll be sad because they don't like to watch Sesame Street anymore.

He is best known for his Civil War monuments, for the terra cotta relief panels on the Garfield Memorial in Cleveland, Ohio (depicting the various stages of James Garfield's life), and for the -long frieze on the Pension Building in Washington, D.C. Biography Born in K√∂nigsberg, Bohemia, (now Kyn≈°perk nad Oh≈ô√≠, Czech Republic), as a young man Buberl studied art in Prague and Vienna before immigrating to the United States in 1854 to train under sculptor Robert Eberhard Launitz. He married Anna Stubner in 1856, and they had nine children. In 1882 Montgomery C. Meigs was chosen to design and construct the new Pension Building, now the National Building Museum, in Washington D. C. and, in doing so, broke away from the established Greco-Roman models that had been the basis of government buildings in Washington up until then, and was to continue to be following the Pension Building's completion. Meigs based his design on Italian Renaissance precedents, notably Rome's Palazzo Farnese and Plazzo della Cancelleria. Hillsbobro, Ohio Civil War Monument Included in his design was a -long sculptured frieze executed by Buberl. Since creating a work of sculpture of that size was well out of Meigs' budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes [totaling in length), which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous parade that includes over 1,300 individual figures. Because of the way that the 28 sections were modified and intermixed, it is only by somewhat careful examination that the frieze reveals itself to be the same figures repeated some eighteen times. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry and medical components as well as a good deal of the supply and quartermaster functions, since Meigs had overseen the latter two functions during the Civil War. Meigs insisted that any teamster included in the Quartermaster panel \\"must be a negro, a plantation slave, freed by war\\". This figure was ultimately to assume a position in the center, over the west entrance to the building. Buberl created dozens of Civil War statues and monuments for various cities and states, including several for New York veterans associations to be placed on the Gettysburg Battlefield and a bronze bust of President Abraham Lincoln, which was recently sold for $5,800. His impressive New York State Monument crowns Cemetery Hill, and a number of individual memorials for specific regiments dot the battlefield.

Life He was born in Parma, the son of Guido di Adam, a crusader. Salimbene was a follower of Joachim de Fiore, and a believer in his apocalyptic teachings. Salimbene joined the Franciscan order in 1238 at the friary of Fano. He then led a life of wandering, avoiding his father who did not wish him to join the Order, and visited Pisa and other Italian towns; then in 1247 he was sent to Lyon, and visited Paris, Ferrara Cremona, Troyes, Florence, Ravenna, Genoa, Reggio and the friary of Montefalcone (near San Polo d'Enza in the region of Emilia-Romagna). The last was the probable site of his death. Works Salimbene's main work was his Cronica (\\"Chronicle\\"), covering the years 1167-1287.Edited by G. Scalia in the series \\"Scrittori d'Italia\\", Bari 1966, and earlier in the same series by F. Bernini, 1942 (see link below).; G.C.

It was begun around 1282 and begins with the founding of Alessandria. His extensive travels meant that he met many important people of the time including Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Louis IX of France and Pope Innocent IV. He also describes everyday life vividly and gives numerous details of internal disputes in the Franciscan order at the time. He also wrote The Twelve Calamities of Emperor Frederick II and several treatises now lost. \\"The Twelve Calamities\\" is set up as a kind of servant's narrative (Exempla, examples), made to demonstrate the faults of Frederick II - often with loosely fitted biblical quotations. One of the major themes of the work is Salimbene's emphasis on numerology. The chronicle itself is set up to demonstrate the parallel between the ten plagues and the ten calamities of Frederick II (conveniently he tacked on the last two after the parallel). Emphasizing the Christian nature of his narrative and the non-Christian nature of Frederick, Salimbene turns a phrase used during the crusades claiming that ‚Äúif he had been a good Catholic and had loved God, the Church, and his own soul, he would scarcely have had an equal as an emperor in the world.‚ÄùDi Adam, Salimbene. \\"The Chronicle of Salimbene de Adam\\".

Attempts have been made to apply methods of higher criticism to oral histories of Wing Chun and other Chinese martial arts,Chu, Ritchie, and Wu 1998 and to discern the origins of Wing Chun by determining the purpose of its techniques. Wing Chun began to appear in independent documentation during the lifetime of 19th-century Wing Chun master Leung Jan, facilitating verification of its subsequent history and divergence into branches.  Ng Mui Legend  right Legend has it after escaping the destruction of the Fujian Shaolin Monastery by Qing forces around 1730, the Abbess Ng Mui fled to the Daliang Mountains on the border between Yunnan and Sichuan. Ng Mui often bought tofu at a shop owned by Yim Yee (Âö¥‰∫å). Yim Yee had a daughter named Yim Wing Chun (Âö¥Ë©†Êò•), whom a local warlord was trying to force into marriage. Ng Mui taught Yim Wing Chun a version of her southern-Shaolin kung fu, which allowed her to drive off the warlord. After completing her training under Ng Mui around 1790, Yim Wing Chun married Leung Bok-Chao (Ê¢ÅÂçöÂÑî) and taught the fighting techniques which Ng Mui had passed on to her. After Yim Wing Chun died around 1840, Leung Bok-Chao passed the new style on to Leung Lan-kwai. Leung Lan-kwai taught six members of the Red Boat Opera Group around 1850, and present-day Wing Chun descends from the six opera-group members: Yik Kam, Hung Gan Biu, Leung Yee Tai, Wong Wah-bo, Dai Fa Min Kam, and Law Man Kung. = Yiu Kai = The legend of Yiu Kai dates the creation of Wing Chun to the early 19th century and identifies Yim Wing-chun's father as Yim Sei (Âö¥Âõõ), a disciple at the Fujian Shaolin Temple who avoids persecution by fleeing with his daughter to Guangxi. Yim Wing-chun learned the Fujian Shaolin arts from her father and, from their raw material, created a new style after seeing a fight between a snake and a crane. She married Leung Bok-Chao (Ê¢ÅÂçöÂÑî), a Shaolin disciple like Yim Wing-chun's father, and taught him her fighting style. The couple began teaching Wing Chun's fighting style to others after moving to Guangdong Province in 1815, settling in the city of Zhaoqing.  Redboat Opera Company  Scale model of Red Boat Opera ship Red Boat troupes had been an important platform for Wing Chun to build on in Guangdong, and some of the most famous Red Boat Performers such as Leung Lan Kui, leung Yee Tei, and Wong Wah Bo were all grand masters of Guangdong Wing Chun. Nearly all extant lineages of Wing Chun, except the Pao Fa Lien (Âà®Ëä±ËìÆ) and Hek Ki Boen branches, claim to descend from the members of the mid-19th-century Red Boat Opera Company (Á¥ÖËàπÊà≤Áè≠). All Wing Chun descends from six Opera Boat members who were taught by Leung Bok-Chao from 1845 to 1855: Yik Kam, Hung Gan Biu, Leung Yee-Tai, Wong Wa-bo, Dai Fa Min Kam and Law Man Kung. Leung Yee-Tai used a pole to steer the Red Opera Boat away from rocks and shoals, and was chosen by Shaolin master Jee Shim to learn the six-and-a-half point pole. Through Jee Shim, the six-and-a-half point pole was added to the Wing Chun system. Leung Yee-Tai and Wong Wa-bo taught Leung Jan, whose students included his son, Leung Bik (Ê¢ÅÂ£Å); \\"Wooden Man\\" Wah (Êú®‰∫∫ËèØ) and Chan Wah-shun (Èô≥ËèØÈ†Ü, nicknamed \\"Moneychanger Wah\\" ÊâæÈå¢ËèØ), from whom the Ip Man, Yiu Kai and Pan Nam lineages descend. \\"Dai Fa Min\\" Kam (Â§ßËä±Èù¢Èå¶), who played the role of the martial painted face, is the ancestor of the Way Yan lineage. The Yuen Kay Shan and Pan Nam branches descend from Wong Wah-bo and \\"Dai Fa Min\\" Kam. Hung Gun Biu (Á¥ÖÂ∑æÂΩ™) passed the art to his son-in-law, Yin Lee-Chung, and the Wang (Áéã) family. In the Red Boat Opera Company the virtuous female was played by Yik Kam (ÁøºÈáë), better known as Ching-Deng Kam because of the role he played. Cho Shun (ÊõπÈ†Ü), who played the Little Martial (Â∞èÊ≠¶) role, was a student of Yik Kam. By passing the art on to his son, Cho Dak-Sang (ÊõπÂæ∑Áîü), Cho Shun established the Wing Chun lineage of the Cho family from the village of Panyu. = Espionage and assassination = Opera performance According to one theory, opponents of the Qing dynasty used the Red Boat Opera Company as a cover to disguise themselves as a troupe of traveling entertainers. Their identities as Chinese opera performers provided cover for martial-arts training, but the flashy moves of opera-style martial arts were not suited to espionage and assassination. Although assassinations would be carried out with poison or knives, their targets were usually protected by bodyguards. Wing Chun was reportedly designed to deal with an opponent who seized rather than struck, silencing the opponent immediately. This would explain technical aspects of Wing Chun, such as its emphasis on close-range combat, trapping and its strikes to the throat and diaphragm.  Other Theories  Other origins for Wing Chun have been suggested, typically involving connections to the Triads, revolutionary groups (often anti-Qing), or the Hakka people of southern China. Nearly all extant lineages of Wing Chun, except the Pao Fa Lien (Âà®Ëä±ËìÆ) and Hek Ki Boen branches, claim to descend from the members of the mid-19th-century Red Boat Opera Company (Á¥ÖËàπÊà≤Áè≠). According to legend, Wing-chun's lover Leung Bok-Chao (a student of Choy gar) helped shape Wing Chun. Several other Chinese martial arts originated in Yong-chun and the surrounding area, most notably the Fujianese style of White Crane (one branch of which is called Wing Chun Bak Hok Kuen (Ê∞∏Êò•ÁôΩÈ∂¥Êã≥), Wing Chun White Crane boxing). Li Wenmao (ÊùéÊñáËåÇ), an opera performer and leader of the 1854-1856 Red Turban Rebellion in Foshan, is said to have been a Wing Chun White Crane practitioner. Wing Chun may have been created by the Five Elders of the Shaolin temple whose systems included white eyebrow, white crane, Shaolin, Hung Ga and Choy Li Fut. The technical similarities between Wing Chun and Fujian White Crane suggest that they are related. According to Ip Man's student, Leung Ting: \\"[The] Wing Tsun System is derived from the Fukien System of kung fu. Their common features are that during fights, pugilists of these systems prefer short steps and close fighting, with their arms placed close to the center, their elbows in and behind the arm and kept close to the flanks to offer it protection. Another characteristic of these two systems of kung fu is, unlike those of Kwangtung Province and Northern China, their boxing forms are rather simple\\".

It is offered by business schools in several parts of the world, including North America, Europe, India, and Australia. Participants usually have at least 15 years of management experience and are within one or two levels of the C-suite. Such programs skip the core curriculum of MBA and Executive MBA programs because, according to the Wall Street Journal, \\"these students are well beyond that fare.\\" Instead, Advanced Management Programs focus on teaching \\"how to lead ... and the fine art of executing a vision.\\" The Columbia Business School AMP, for example, is built on three pillars: Leading authentically, thinking strategically, and executing dynamically. Advanced Management Programs are usually very selective. Business schools only offer them at most twice per year and generally limit class sizes to no more than 50 students. Admission to Advanced Management Programs, rather than being based on academics or standardized test scores, is based instead on management seniority and workplace accomplishments. In 2008, Advanced Management Programs generally cost within the range of US$30,000-$58,000 at top business schools, and 95% of students were sponsored by their employer. As of 2020, example AMP tuition prices were CHF 30,000 at IMD, ‚Ç¨38,500 at INSEAD, US$52,450 at Columbia, US$60,500 at Wharton, US$65,000 at MIT, and US$82,000 at Harvard.

The collection was withdrawn and pulped after DC became concerned about a scene in one of the stories. Publication history It included the stories \\"Superman Jr. Is No More!\\", featuring the Super-Sons, and \\"Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter\\", among others. However, DC Comics President Paul Levitz deemed the Letitia Lerner story inappropriate (for featuring scenes depicting the baby Superman in a microwave, among others) and ordered the press run halted and the printed issues destroyed. However, around 2,000 copies of the issue had already been shipped to the UK. Although DC attempted to recall these copies, they quickly became a highly sought after collector's item (see Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics), and estimates of available copies range between 700 and 2,000. The Letitia Lerner story earned two Eisner Awards, however, and was later republished in the pages of Bizarro Comics (a collection originally devised as a vehicle to showcase the feature).

The rose gardens were added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004. The National Rose Gardens, conceived in 1926 and opened in 1933, were Australia's first national gardening project and were planned as a physical expression of the principle of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States. In the development of the Gardens roses were contributed by all States in Australia. The Gardens were intended to provide an interest for all Australians in developing Canberra, the national capital, as a garden city. The Gardens demonstrate a distinctive early example of twentieth century public garden design in a formal style. In horticultural terms the Gardens have provided the opportunity to exhibit the best varieties of Australian grown and overseas roses in a favourable climate. Their location in front of the (then Provisional) Old Parliament House was planned to enhance the setting of the House. The Gardens are valued by visitors to Canberra as well as the local community for their aesthetic qualities.  History The concept of an Australian Rose Garden in Canberra dates back to 1926 when it was proposed by the National Rose Society of NSW to the Federal Capital Commission (FCC). Plans for the National Rose Gardens were prepared by 1932 and, through the Horticultural Society of Canberra, Rose Societies in each State were approached to contribute roses. Each garden was to have 2,000 standard and climbing roses and the beds were to have different varieties of roses arranged by colour. Thirty-eight public bodies and many private individuals contributed roses. The first rose was planted by the Minister for the Interior, John Perkins on 12 September 1933. The rose was a Daily Mail donated by the Victorian Mothers' Clubs. Over the following weeks 2,000 roses were planted and the gardens were fully planted by the next planting season. The gardens have some value for their association with Thomas Weston, the first officer in charge of afforestation in Canberra, whose ashes were scattered in the park he designed and laid out in front of the Parliament House. This park includes the National Rose Gardens and the grassed terrace of Parkes Place. Weston died in 1936. The gardens were refurbished for the 1954 visit of Queen Elizabeth II. This involved the replacement of many roses. The perimeter paths around the gardens were converted to rose garden beds and the pyramid style supports for climbing roses were replaced with rectangular timber pergolas. The garden beds were modified between 1965 and 1968 when King George Terrace was realigned and the King George V Memorial was moved to a corner of the western garden. In 1968 a restaurant was built on another corner of the western garden. The timber pergolas were replaced with metal and wire frames in 1968. Physical description Entrance to the Old Parliament House Gardens The gardens are in two parts, set symmetrically either side of the grassed terrace in front of Old Parliament House. The design of the two gardens is similar in plan, but each displays an individual character. The site slopes gently to the north (approximately 1.5% slope) and covers an area of approximately . The general character of the gardens is of a spacious formal parterre enclosed by mature trees. The gardens have three basic components: the rose beds themselves, perimeter plantings of trees and the lawn. The rose beds in each garden are laid out in plan to symbolise the petals of a fully opened rose. This consists of a central circular bed enclosed by punctuated annulus beds in a formal quartered configuration. The replacement of ageing roses with new varieties occurs regularly. Each garden is enclosed by a perimeter of large mature trees of a variety of non native species, evergreen and deciduous and arranged in a regular order. The species used (basically cedar, oak, pine, plane and poplar) provide for a range of seasonal visual effects as well as wind protection and space definition. Pruning of low limbs has provided unimpeded pedestrian access. The avenue of cypress trees (Cupressus sempervirens) which separates the rose gardens and the central grassed terrace is a memorial planting. Planted by visiting dignitaries on the occasion of the meeting of the delegates of the Empire Parliamentary Association in 1926, many of the trees still have a memorial plaque at their base. Also along this avenue are mature poplar trees (Populus nigra) which were intended as markers, because of their strong vertical form and vivid yellow autumn colour, to key entry points within the Parliamentary Triangle. Both the poplars and cypresses are remnants of the original plan and plantings made by Weston. Apart from the beds and the main edge pathways, all other surfaces are irrigated grass. This provides a bright green uniform ground plane which highlights the patterns created by light and shade and allows a smooth transition of views into adjacent spaces. The gardens declined after the Parliament moved to the new Parliament House in 1988. The gardens were restored and officially re-opened in December 2004. The gardens incorporate tennis courts and a bowling green. They were originally used for outdoor parties associated with official visits and at the opening sessions of Parliament.

Hardware interrupts are used to handle events such as receiving data from a modem or network card, key presses, or mouse movements. Interrupt lines are often identified by an index with the format of IRQ followed by a number. For example, on the Intel 8259 family of Programmable Interrupt Controllers (PICs) there are eight interrupt inputs commonly referred to as IRQ0 through IRQ7. In x86 based computer systems that use two of these PICs, the combined set of lines are referred to as IRQ0 through IRQ15. Technically these lines are named IR0 through IR7, and the lines on the ISA bus to which they were historically attached are named IRQ0 through IRQ15 (although historically as the number of hardware devices increased, the total possible number of interrupts was increased by means of cascading requests, by making one of the IRQ numbers cascade to another set or sets of numbered IRQs, handled by one or more subsequent controllers). Newer x86 systems integrate an Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) that conforms to the Intel APIC Architecture. These APICs support a programming interface for up to 255 physical hardware IRQ lines per APIC, with a typical system implementing support for only around 24 total hardware lines. During the early years of personal computing, IRQ management was often of user concern. With the introduction of plug and play devices this has been alleviated.  Overview  When working with personal computer hardware, installing and removing devices, the system relies on interrupt requests. There are default settings that are configured in the system BIOS and recognized by the operating system. These default settings can be altered by advanced users. Modern plug and play technology has not only reduced the need for concern for these settings, but has also virtually eliminated manual configuration.  x86 IRQs  Early PCs using the Intel 8086/8088 processors only had a single PIC, and are therefore limited to eight interrupts. This was expanded to two PICs with the introduction of the 286 based PCs. Typically, on systems using the Intel 8259 PIC, 16 IRQs are used. IRQs 0 to 7 are managed by one Intel 8259 PIC, and IRQs 8 to 15 by a second Intel 8259 PIC. The first PIC, the master, is the only one that directly signals the CPU. The second PIC, the slave, instead signals to the master on its IRQ 2 line, and the master passes the signal on to the CPU. There are therefore only 15 interrupt request lines available for hardware. On newer systems using the Intel APIC Architecture, typically there are 24 IRQs available, and the extra 8 IRQs are used to route PCI interrupts, avoiding conflict between dynamically configured PCI interrupts and statically configured ISA interrupts. On early APIC systems with only 16 IRQs or with only Intel 8259 interrupt controllers, PCI interrupt lines were routed to the 16 IRQs using a PIR integrated into the southbridge. The easiest way of viewing this information on Windows is to use Device Manager or System Information (msinfo32.exe). On Linux, IRQ mappings can be viewed by executing \`cat /proc/interrupts\` or using the \`procinfo\` utility. = Master PIC = * IRQ 0 system timer (cannot be changed) * IRQ 1 keyboard controller (cannot be changed) * IRQ 2 cascaded signals from IRQs 8‚Äì15 (any devices configured to use IRQ 2 will actually be using IRQ 9) * IRQ 3 serial port controller for serial port 2 (shared with serial port 4, if present) * IRQ 4 serial port controller for serial port 1 (shared with serial port 3, if present) * IRQ 5 parallel port 2 and 3 or sound card * IRQ 6 floppy disk controller * IRQ 7 parallel port 1. It is used for printers or for any parallel port if a printer is not present. It can also be potentially be shared with a secondary sound card with careful management of the port. = Slave PIC = * IRQ 8 real-time clock (RTC) * IRQ 9 Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) system control interrupt on Intel chipsets. Other chipset manufacturers might use another interrupt for this purpose, or make it available for the use of peripherals (any devices configured to use IRQ 2 will actually be using IRQ 9) * IRQ 10 The Interrupt is left open for the use of peripherals (open interrupt/available, SCSI or NIC) * IRQ 11 The Interrupt is left open for the use of peripherals (open interrupt/available, SCSI or NIC) * IRQ 12 mouse on PS/2 connector * IRQ 13 CPU co-processor or integrated floating point unit or inter-processor interrupt (use depends on OS) * IRQ 14 primary ATA channel (ATA interface usually serves hard disk drives and CD drives) * IRQ 15 secondary ATA channel  Conflicts  In early IBM-compatible personal computers, an IRQ conflict is a once common hardware error, received when two devices were trying to use the same interrupt request (or IRQ) to signal an interrupt to the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC). The PIC expects interrupt requests from only one device per line, thus more than one device sending IRQ signals along the same line will generally cause an IRQ conflict that can freeze a computer. For example, if a modem expansion card is added into a system and assigned to IRQ4, which is traditionally assigned to the serial port 1, it will likely cause an IRQ conflict. Initially, IRQ 7 was a common choice for the use of a sound card, but later IRQ 5 was used when it was found that IRQ 7 would interfere with the printer port (LPT1). The serial ports are frequently disabled to free an IRQ line for another device. IRQ 2/9 is the traditional interrupt line for an MPU-401 MIDI port, but this conflicts with the ACPI system control interrupt (SCI is hardwired to IRQ9 on Intel chipsets); this means ISA MPU-401 cards with a hardwired IRQ 2/9, and MPU-401 device drivers with a hardcoded IRQ 2/9, cannot be used in interrupt-driven mode on a system with ACPI enabled. In some rare conditions, two devices could share the same IRQ as long as they were not used simultaneously. To solve this problem, the later PCI bus specification allows for IRQ sharing, with the additional support for Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) in its later revisions. PCI Express does not have physical interrupt lines at all, and uses MSI exclusively.

It is situated on the western outskirts of Great Driffield, to the west of the A614 road and south of the A166 road. Little Driffield forms part of the civil parish of Driffield. History The village once had a large pond and green. The pond was reduced to about half its size when Brendan Green was built in the 1960s. The majority of the green is now walled in and privately owned, belonging to one of the most prominent houses in the village ‚Äì Springfield House, (now Church House) which lost its iron railings, together with those from the churchyard, to help the war effort. A chapel built in 1878 was demolished recently and replaced by a house. The village school was demolished about 40 years ago. Horsefair Lane was for many years the home and factory of clothing manufacturers, Dewhirst's. The factory later became Arcadia Clothing which closed some years ago. The site is now occupied by an industrial unit and 6 new houses. The last horse fair was held in 1918. The A166 previously ran through the village until the construction of the town bypass (part of the A614), about 1982. Through traffic runs to the nearby Kelleythorpe Industrial Estate about half a mile south. Landmarks The Church of St Mary was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1985 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. King Aldfrith of Northumbria (685 ‚Äì 705) is supposedly buried in the church. However, no evidence of this was found when the nave and chancel were rebuilt and the floor excavated in 1807 (the 14th-century tower remained untouched). The church was restored in the 1890s by architect Temple Moor. The village previously contained two public houses: The Rose & Crown and The Downe Arms, (named after the lady of the manor). The Downe Arms became a restaurant and is now a private house. The Rose and Crown remains in use. Elmswell Beck runs through the southern edge of the village and joins with Little Driffield Beck (from the pond). These are tributaries of the River Hull. Housing Church Lane New housing has been built since the 1990s, particularly Londsborough Court, which was a milk tanker storage yard and before that an abattoir which adjoined Brendan Green, previously the site of a tannery. There were two tanneries in the village in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Another development from the 1990s comprises nine homes on Church Walk. Six new houses were built in 2006 on Horsefair Lane.

It occurs in the context of Noah's drunkenness and is provoked by a shameful act perpetrated by Noah's son Ham, who \\"saw the nakedness of his father\\". The exact nature of Ham's transgression and the reason Noah cursed Canaan when Ham had sinned have been debated for over 2,000 years. The story's original purpose may have been to justify the subjection of the Canaanite people to the Israelites,. but in later centuries, the narrative was interpreted by some Christians, Muslims and Jews as an explanation for black skin, as well as a justification for slavery. Similarly, the Latter Day Saint movement used the curse of Ham to prevent the ordination of black men to its priesthood.. Nevertheless, most Christians, Muslims, Jews and Mormons now disagree with such interpretations, because in the biblical text, Ham himself is not cursed, and race or skin color is never mentioned. Biblical narrative The concept of the curse of Ham finds its origins in Genesis 9: The objective of the story may have been to justify the subject status of the Canaanites, the descendants of Ham, to the Israelites, the descendants of Shem. The narrative of the curse is replete with difficulties: It is uncertain what the precise nature of Ham's offense is. Verse 22 has been a subject of debate, as to whether it should be taken literally, or as \\"a euphemism for some act of gross immorality\\". In verse 25, Noah names Shem and Japheth as the \\"brethren\\" of Ham. The Table of Nations presents Canaan and Mizraim (Egypt) among the sons of Ham (10:6). In the Psalms, Egypt is equated with Ham. The treatment of Japheth in verses 26‚Äì27 raises questions: Why is YHWH named as the God of Shem, but not of Japheth? What does it mean that God will \\"enlarge\\" Japheth? And why will Japheth \\"dwell in the tents of Shem\\"? Further difficulties include Ham's being referred to as \\"the youngest son\\", when all other lists make him Noah's second son. Biblical scholar Nahum Sarna says that the biggest challenge of the narrative is why Canaan was cursed, rather than Ham, and that the concealed details of the shameful incident bear the same reticence as Reuben's sexual transgression. The narrative's short five verses indicate that Canaan's Hamite paternity must have had great significance to the narrator or redactor, according to Sarna, who adds, \\"The curse on Canaan, invoked in response to an act of moral depravity, is the first intimation of the theme of the corruption of the Canaanites, which is given as the justification for their being dispossessed of their land and for the transfer of that land to the descendants of Abraham.\\" Ham's transgression =Seeing nakedness= The majority of commentators, both ancient and modern, have felt that Ham's seeing his father naked was not a sufficiently serious crime to explain the punishment that follows.. Nevertheless, Genesis 9:23, in which Shem and Japheth cover Noah with a cloak while averting their eyes, suggests that the words are to be taken literally,. and it has recently been pointed out that, in first millennium Babylonia, looking at another person's genitals was indeed regarded as a serious matter. Other ancient commentators suggested that Ham was guilty of more than what the Bible says. The 2nd century Targum Onqelos has Ham gossiping about his father's drunken disgrace \\"in the street\\" (a reading which has a basis in the original Hebrew), so that being held up to public mockery was what had angered Noah; as the Cave of Treasures (4th century) puts it, \\"Ham laughed at his father's shame and did not cover it, but laughed about it and mocked.\\" Ancient commentaries have also debated whether \\"seeing\\" someone's nakedness meant to have sex with that person (e.g., Leviticus 20:17). The same idea was raised by third-century rabbis, in the Babylonian Talmud (c. 500 AD), who argue that Ham either castrated his father, or sodomised him. The same explanations are found in three Greek translations of the Bible, which replace the word \\"see\\" in verse 22 with another word denoting homosexual relations.. The castration theory has its modern counterpart in suggested parallels found in the castration of Uranus by Cronus in Greek mythology and a Hittite myth of the supreme god Anu whose genitals were \\"bitten off by his rebel son and cup- bearer Kumarbi, who afterwards rejoiced and laughed ... until Anu cursed him\\". =Book of Jubilees= In the Book of Jubilees, the seriousness of Ham's curse is compounded by the significance of God's covenant to \\"never again bring a flood on the earth\\".. In response to this covenant, Noah builds a sacrificial altar \\"to atone for the land\\".[Jub. 6:1‚Äì3] Noah‚Äôs practice and ceremonial functions parallel the festival of Shavuot as if it were a prototype to the celebration of the giving of the Torah. His priestly functions also emulate being \\"first priest\\" in accordance with halakhah as taught in the Qumranic works.Albeck. Buch der Jubil√§en, p. 21, 33. By turning the drinking of the wine into a religious ceremony, Jubilees alleviates any misgivings that may be provoked by the episode of Noah's drunkenness. Thus, Ham's offense would constitute an act of disrespect not only to his father, but also to the festival ordinances. =Medieval Judaism= The medieval commentary of Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki 1040‚Äì1105), who cites older sources from Judaism's Oral Torah, which is relied upon by traditional Judaic scholarship as the most basic commentary to the present time, provides an introductory explanation. (: * : and Ham, the father of Canaan, saw: \\"There are those among our rabbis who say that Canaan saw and told his father [Ham] and this is why Canaan was mentioned with regard to the matter and was cursed.\\" (Tanhuma 15; Genesis Rabbah 36:7). And [Ham] saw his father's nakedness.: \\"There are those of our rabbis who say he emasculated (◊°◊®◊°◊ï castrated) him, and there are those who say he had (homosexual ◊®◊ë◊¢◊ï) relations with him.\\" Sanhedrin 70a. [The opinion that holds Ham had homosexual relations with him agrees that Ham also emasculated Noah.] * : And Shem and Japheth...covered their father's nakedness, their faces were turned backward...: \\"...as for Ham who disgraced his father it is said of his offspring 'Thus will the king of Assyria lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.\\" (). (Tanhuma 15; Genesis Rabbah 36:6). * : his small (◊î◊ß◊ò◊ü) son:\\" ◊î◊§◊°◊ï◊ú The 'defective' one (Genesis Rabbah 36:6) ◊ï◊î◊ë◊ñ◊ï◊ô and the 'disgraceful' one. ['small' does not mean 'the youngest' since Ham was older than Shem] similar to 'Behold, I have made you the smallest (◊ß◊ò◊ü) among the nations.'\\" (, ). * : Cursed (◊ê◊®◊ï◊®) is Canaan: Noah said to Ham: \\"You caused me that I should not father a fourth son, another one to serve me. May your fourth son [Canaan was Ham's fourth son, see ] be cursed by serving the offspring of these greater ones [of Shem and Japheth]... What did Ham see that he emasculated him? He said to his brothers Adam the first man had only three sons (Cain, Abel, and Seth) yet one killed the other because of the inheritance of the world [Cain killed Abel over a dispute how to divide the world between them according to Genesis Rabbah 22:7] and our father has three sons yet he seeks still a fourth son.\\" * : ...Blessed is ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î the God of Shem: \\"Who is destined to keep His promise to [Shem's] offspring to give them the Land of Canaan\\" and he shall be: \\"Canaan shall be to them as a servant to pay tribute.\\" * : and Canaan shall be a slave to them.: \\"Even after the children of Shem will be exiled slaves will be sold to them from the Children of Canaan.\\" [Rashi explaining why the curse is repeated.] Curse of Canaan *Genesis 9:25: \\"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren\\" It is noteworthy that the curse was made by Noah, not by God. Some biblical scholars claim that when a curse is made by a man, it could only have been effective if God supports it, unlike the curse of Ham and his descendants, which was not confirmed by GodPhyllis Wiggins (2005). The Curse of Ham: Satan's Vicious Cycle. pages 41, 42; 48. or, at least, it is not mentioned in the Bible that he had confirmed it. =Dead Sea Scrolls= 4Q252, a pesher (interpretation) on the Book of Genesis found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, explains that since Ham had already been blessed by God (Genesis 9:1), he could not now be cursed by Noah. The 4Q252 scroll probably dates from the later half of the first century BC. A century later, the Jewish historian Josephus argued that Noah refrained from cursing Ham because of his nearness of kin, and so cursed Ham's son instead.. A new alternative interpretation of 4Q181, which is a Dead Sea scroll of Genesis, parallels the Book of Jubilees, suggesting that Canaan was cursed because he defied Noah‚Äôs division of the land. =Jubilees= The Book of Jubilees also recounts the incident between Ham and Noah, and Noah's resulting curse against Canaan, in similar terms. Later, however, Jubilees explains further that Noah had allocated Canaan a land west of the Nile along with his brothers, but that he violated this agreement and instead chose to squat in the land delineated to Shem (and later Abraham), and so rightly deserved the curse of slavery. =Classical Judaism= Philo of Alexandria, a 1st-century BC Jewish philosopher, said that Ham and Canaan were equally guilty, if not of whatever had been done to Noah, then of other crimes, \\"for the two of them together had acted foolishly and wrongly and committed other sins.\\" Rabbi Eleazar decided that Canaan had in fact been the first to see Noah, and had then gone and told his father, who then told his brothers in the street; this, said Eleazar, \\"did not take to mind the commandment to honour one's father.\\" Another interpretation was that Noah's \\"youngest son\\" could not be Ham, who was the middle son: \\"for this reason they say that this youngest son was in fact Canaan.\\" : Cursed (◊ê◊®◊ï◊®) is Canaan: Noah said to Ham: \\"You caused me that I should not father a fourth son, another one to serve me. May your fourth son [Canaan was Ham's fourth son, see ] be cursed by serving the offspring of these greater ones [of Shem and Japheth]... What did Ham see that he emasculated him? He said to his brothers Adam the first man had only two sons (Cain and Abel) yet one killed the other because of the inheritance of the world [Cain killed Abel over a dispute how to divide the world between them according to Genesis Rabbah 22:7] and our father has three sons yet he seeks still a fourth son.\\" : ...Blessed is ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î the God of Shem: \\"Who is destined to keep His promise to [Shem's] offspring to give them the Land of Canaan\\" and he shall be: \\"Canaan shall be to them as a servant to pay tribute.\\" : and Canaan shall be a slave to them.: \\"Even after the children of Shem will be exiled slaves will be sold to them from the Children of Canaan.\\" [Rashi explaining why the curse is repeated.] While the episode about Ham and his father Noah displays like a banner the actions of the fathers unto the shame of their sons, the codifiers of Jewish law assert that a Canaanite slave is obligated to perform certain mitzvot, just as Jewish women do, making him of a higher rank than ordinary gentiles when there is a question on whose life should be saved first.Mishnah (Horayiot 3:8); cf. Babylonian Talmud (Horayiot 13a), which puts an emancipated Canaanite slave before an ordinary proselyte, since he had been raised in holiness, whereas the other one had not. Moreover, according to the Hebrew Bible (Exo. 21:26-ff.), whenever a Canaanite slave is set free from his yoke by losing either a tooth or an eye, or one of twenty- four chief limbs in a man's body that cannot be replaced, where the Torah says of him, ‚Äúhe shall set him free,‚Äù according to the exponents of Jewish law, the sense here is that the same emancipated slave becomes a \\"freeborn\\" (benei ·∏•orƒ´n) and is received in the Jewish fold and is permitted to marry a daughter of Israel. However, his emancipation must be followed by a written bill of manumission (she·π≠ar shi·∏•r≈´r) by the rabbinic court of Israel.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah - Code of Jewish Law (Avadim 5:4-ff.) Hence: a Canaanite slave's bondage was meant to elevate himself at a later juncture in life, although his Master in ordinary circumstances is under no constraints to set him free, unless he were physically and openly maimed. The rules governing a Canaanite slave are used generically, and may apply to any non-Jew (gentile) held in bondage by an Israelite.Leviticus 25:44‚Äì46. According to Rashi, citing an earlier Talmudic source,Babylonian Talmud (Gittin 38a). the heathen were never included in the sanction of possessing slaves as the children of Israel were permitted to do, for the Scripture says (Leviticus 25:44): \\"Of them you shall buy, etc.\\", meaning, \\"Israel alone is permitted to buy from them [enslaved persons], but they are not permitted to buy [enslaved persons] from you, nor from one another.\\"Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 6b), Rashi s.v. ◊ï◊¶◊®◊ô◊ö ◊í◊ò ◊©◊ó◊®◊ï◊®  Misconception, racism, and slavery  In the past, some people claimed that the curse of Ham was a biblical justification for imposing slavery or racism upon black people, although this concept is essentially an ideologically driven misconception. Regarding this matter, the Christian leader Martin Luther King Jr. called such an attempt \\"a blasphemy\\" that \\"is against everything that the Christian religion stands for.\\"\\"Paul‚Äôs Letter to American Christians \\", Delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama, on 4 November 1956. \\"I understand that there are Christians among you who try to justify segregation on the basis of the Bible. They argue that the Negro is inferior by nature because of Noah's curse upon the children of Ham. Oh my friends, this is blasphemy. This is against everything that the Christian religion stands for. I must say to you as I have said to so many Christians before, that in Christ \\"there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for we are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" (Quote from Galatians 3:28 found in the New Testament or \\"Christian Scriptures of the Judeo-Christian Bible. For Southern slave owners who were faced with the abolitionist movement to end slavery, the curse of Ham was one of the only grounds upon which Christian slave owners could formulate an ideological defense of slavery. Even before slavery, in order to promote economic motivations within Europe associated with colonialism, the curse of Ham was used to shift the common Aristotelian belief that phenotypic differentiation among humans was a result of climatic difference, to a racialist perspective that phenotypic differentiation among the species was due to there being different racial types. This latter effort started in England. Englishmen were widely afraid to further the colonial efforts of The Crown and begin a new life in lower latitude colonies for fear of becoming black. In 1578, George Best, a sea captain who was a member of the Elizabethan court, first popularized the myth of racial differences within what would be a widely read book on the search for a Northwest passage to Asia. Best used careful ethnographic descriptions to portray the indigenous peoples of North America as being sophisticated hunters and gatherers, not different in spirit than the white Englishmen. At the same time he presented a scathing account of Africans, saying that they are a \\"black and loathsome\\" people on account of being descendants of the ‚Äúcursed chus\\". Best does not mention the curse as lying upon Ham, but rather upon Chus (son of Ham, commonly known as Cush). The historian David Whitford writes of a ‚Äúcurse matrix‚Äù which was derived from the vagueness of Genesis 9 and interpreted to mean that it didn‚Äôt matter who was cursed or what group of people the curse originated with, all that mattered was that there was a vague reference to a generational curse that could be exploited any which way by racists like George Best. Pro-slavery intellectuals were hard-pressed to find any justification for slavery and racism within Christian theology which taught that all humans were descendants of Adam and therefore one race, possessed with equal salvation potential and deserving to be treated as kin. The curse of Ham was used to drive a wedge in the mythology of a single human race, as elite intellectuals were able to convince people that the three sons of Noah represented the three sects of Man and their respective hierarchy of different fates. Leading intellectuals in the south, like Benjamin M. Palmer, claimed that white Europeans were descended from Japhet who was prophesied by Noah to cultivate civilization and the powers of the intellect, while Africans, being descendants of the cursed Ham, were destined to be possessed by a slavish nature ruled by base appetites. =Early Judaism and Islam= Noah curses Ham by Gustave Dore While Genesis 9 never says that Ham was black, he became associated with black skin, through folk etymology deriving his name from a similar, but actually unconnected, word meaning \\"dark\\" or \\"brown\\". The next stage are certain fables according to ancient Jewish traditions. According to one legend preserved in the Babylonian Talmud, God cursed Ham because he broke a prohibition on sex aboard the ark and \\"was smitten in his skin\\";Talmud, Sanhedrin 108b. according to another, Noah cursed him because he castrated his father. Although the Talmud refers only to Ham, the version brought in a midrash goes on further to say \\"Ham, that Cush came from him\\" in reference to the blackness,Yalkut Shim'oni. Noah Sec. 58. that the curse did not apply to all of Ham but only to his eldest son Cush, who migrated to sub-Sahara Africa.Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, p. 305. Thus, two distinct traditions existed, one explaining dark skin as the result of a curse on Ham, the other explaining slavery by the separate curse on Canaan. The concepts were introduced into Islam during the Arab expansion of the 7th century, due to cross-pollination of Jewish and Christian parables and theology into Islam, called \\"Isra'iliyyat\\". Some medieval Muslim writers‚Äîincluding Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Ibn Khaldun, and even the later Book of the Zanj‚Äîasserted the view that the effects of Noah's curse on Ham's descendants included blackness, slavery, and a requirement not to let the hair grow past the ears, despite the fact that this contradicted the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad regarding skin color and racial equality, most notably in his last sermon. This is also in spite of the fact that the account of the drunkenness of Noah and curse of Ham are not present within the text of the Quran, the Islamic holy book,. and not consistent with Islamic teachings that Noah is a prophet, and prophets do not drink alcohol. Islam holds prophets of God in very high esteem, and some Muslims suggest the prophets are infallible.Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa' bisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj. Historically, other Muslim scholars such as Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti criticised the Curse of Ham narrative and went on to criticise the association of black Africans with slaves. Others, such as Ibn Kathir, more broadly criticised the Isra'iliyyat tradition, and avoided using such reports when explaining verses of the Quran.Karen Bauer Gender Hierarchy in the Qur'an: Medieval Interpretations, Modern Responses Cambridge University Press 2015 p. 115. =Medieval serfdom and \\"Pseudo-Berossus\\"= In medieval Christian exegesis, Ham's sin was regarded as laughter (for mocking his father and doing nothing to rectify his condition). Elsewhere in Medieval Europe, the curse of Ham also became used as a justification for serfdom. Honorius Augustodunensis (c. 1100) was the first recorded to propose a caste system associating Ham with serfdom, writing that serfs were descended from Ham, nobles from Japheth, and free men from Shem. However, he also followed the interpretation of 1 Corinthians 7:21 by Ambrosiaster (late 4th century), which held that as servants in the temporal world, these \\"Hamites\\" were likely to receive a far greater reward in the next world than would the Japhetic nobility. The idea that serfs were the descendants of Ham soon became widely promoted in Europe. An example is Dame Juliana Berners (c. 1388), who, in a treatise on hawks, claimed that the \\"churlish\\" descendants of Ham had settled in Europe, those of the temperate Shem in Africa, and those of the noble Japheth in Asia (a departure from normal arrangements, which placed Shem in Asia, Japheth in Europe, and Ham in Africa), because she considered Europe to be the \\"country of churls\\", Asia of gentility, and Africa of temperance. As serfdom waned in the late medieval era, the interpretation of serfs being descendants of Ham decreased as well. Ham also figured in an immensely influential work Commentaria super opera diversorum auctorum de antiquitatibus (Commentaries on the Works of Various Authors Discussing Antiquity). In 1498, Annius of Viterbo claimed to have translated records of Berossus, an ancient Babylonian priest and scholar; which are today usually considered an elaborate forgery. However, they gained great influence over Renaissance ways of thinking about population and migration, filling a historical gap following the biblical account of the flood.Morse, Michael A. How the Celts Came to Britain. Tempus Publishing, Stroud, 2005. page 15. According to this account, Ham studied the evil arts that had been practiced before the flood, and thus became known as \\"Cam Esenus\\" (Ham the Licentious), as well as the original Zoroaster and Saturn (Cronus). He became jealous of Noah's additional children born after the deluge, and began to view his father with enmity, and one day, when Noah lay drunk and naked in his tent, Ham saw him and sang a mocking incantation that rendered Noah temporarily sterile, as if castrated. This account contains several other parallels connecting Ham with Greek myths of the castration of Uranus by Cronus, as well as Italian legends of Saturn and/or Camesis ruling over the Golden Age and fighting the Titanomachy. Ham in this version also abandoned his wife who had been aboard the ark and had mothered the African peoples, and instead married his sister Rhea, daughter of Noah, producing a race of giants in Sicily. =American/European slavery, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries= The explanation that black Africans, as the \\"sons of Ham\\", were cursed, possibly \\"blackened\\" by their sins, was sporadically advanced during the Middle Ages, but its acceptance became increasingly common during the slave trade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Benjamin Braude, \\"The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, \\"William and Mary Quarterly LIV (January 1997): 103‚Äì142. See also William McKee Evans, \\"From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham,\\"American Historical Review 85 (February 1980): 15‚Äì43John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, \\"'Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham'\\", American Literary Realism, vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3. The justification of slavery itself through the sins of Ham was well suited to the ideological interests of the elite; with the emergence of the slave trade, its racialized version justified the exploitation of African labour. A Reden√ß√£o de Cam (Redemption of Ham), Modesto Brocos, 1895, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes. The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their quadroon child, hence three generations of racial hypergamy through whitening. In the parts of Africa where Christianity flourished in its early days, while it was still illegal in Rome, this idea never took hold, and its interpretation of scripture was never adopted by the African Coptic Churches. A modern Amharic commentary on Genesis notes the nineteenth century and earlier European theory that blacks were subject to whites as a result of the curse of Ham, but calls this a false teaching unsupported by the text of the Bible, emphatically pointing out that Noah's curse did not fall upon all descendants of Ham, but only on the descendants of Canaan, and asserting that it was fulfilled when Canaan was occupied by both Semites (Israel) and Japhetites. The commentary further notes that Canaanites ceased to exist politically after the Third Punic War (149 BC), and their current descendants are thus unknown and scattered among all peoples. Robert Boyle‚Äîa seventeenth-century scientist who was also a theologian and a devout Christian‚Äîrefuted the idea that blackness was caused by the curse of Ham, in his book Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours (1664).David Mark Whitford (2009), \\"The curse of Ham in the early modern era\\", pages 174‚Äì175; Nina G. Jablonski (2012), \\"Living Color: The Biological and Social Meaning of Skin Color\\", page 219 There, Boyle explains that the curse of Ham as an explanation for the complexion of coloured people was but a misinterpretation that was embraced by \\"vulgar writers\\", travelers, critics, and also \\"men of note\\" of his time.Robert Boyle (1664), \\"Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours\\", Henry Herringman, London, page 160 In his work, he challenges that vision, explaining: A number of other scholars also support the claim that the racialized version of the curse of Ham was devised at that time because it suited ideological and economical interests of the European elite and slave traders who wanted to justify exploitation of African labour.Tim Robinson (2007), \\"Racism: a History\\", (BBC Documentary). While Robinson (2007) claims that such version was non-existent before, historian David Brion Davis argues, as well, that contrary to the claims of many reputable historians, neither the Talmud nor any early post-biblical Jewish writing relates blackness of the skin to a curse whatsoever.David Brion Davis Sterling Professor of History Yale University (Emeritus), \\"Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World\\", Oxford University Press, Apr 1, 2006, pp. 67‚Äì8. =Latter Day Saint movement= In 1835, Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, published a work which was titled the Book of Abraham. It explicitly denotes that an Egyptian king who is referred to by the name of Pharaoh was a descendant of Ham and the Canaanites, who were black (), that Noah had cursed his lineage so they did not have the right to the priesthood, and that all Egyptians descended from him. It was later considered scripture by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This passage is the only one which is found in any Mormon scripture that bars a particular lineage of people from holding the priesthood, and, while nothing in the Book of Abraham explicitly denotes that Noah's curse was the same curse which is mentioned in the Bible or that the Egyptians were related to other black Africans, it later became the foundation of church policy with regard to the priesthood ban. The 2002 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual points to Abraham 1:21‚Äì27 as the reason why black men were not given the priesthood until 1978. In the following year, Smith taught that the curse of Ham came from God, and it stated that blacks were cursed with servitude. He warned those who tried to interfere with slavery that God could do his own work. Without reversing his opinion on the curse of Ham, Smith started expressing more anti-slavery positions starting in 1842. After Smith's death, leaders of the LDS Church continued to teach that black Africans were under the curse of Ham and that those who tried to abolish slavery were going against the decrees of God, although the day would come when the curse would be nullified through the saving powers of Jesus Christ.. In addition, based on his interpretation of the Book of Abraham, Brigham Young believed that, as a result of this curse, negroes were banned from the Mormon priesthood. In 1978, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball said he received a revelation that extended the priesthood to all worthy male members of the church without regard to race or color.. In 2013, The LDS church denounced the curse of Ham explanation for withholding the priesthood from black Africans.\\"Race and the Priesthood\\", churchofjesuschrist.org. However, the essays have not been well publicized, and many members remain unaware of the essays and hold to racist beliefs that had been taught in the past. The Book of Abraham is still considered scripture in the LDS church. The Old Testament student manual, which is published by the Church and is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament in LDS Institutes, teaches that Canaan could not hold the priesthood because of his ancestral lineage but mentions nothing of race or skin color: See also *Afrikaner Calvinism *Curse and mark of Cain *Hamitic *Lot's daughters References =Citations= =Bibliography=     * * (Levenson author note).   * * VanderKam-Vitae * * External links *Online reprint of statements about abolition by Joseph Smith, originally printed in the Messenger and Advocate Vol. 2.

Knopf) Cause for Alarm is a novel by Eric Ambler first published in 1938. Set in Fascist Italy in that year, the book is one of Ambler's classic spy thrillers. Plot summary Nicholas Marlow, an English engineer engaged to a young doctor, one day, out of the blue, loses his well-paid job. After several months of sheer desperation, he responds to an advert by an English engineering company, the Spartacus Machine Tool Company of Wolverhamption. He is offered the post of the firm's representative in Italy. Although the firm does not itself make weapons, its main sales are of the \\"Spartacus Type S2 automatic\\" boring machine, which is used for shell production. Able to speak some Italian, Marlow gladly accepts, secretly deciding that he will quit the job again as soon as possible to go back to England and get married. On arrival in Milan, he realizes that there is a huge backlog at his office, and that both Bellinetti, his personal assistant (male), and his secretary (female) are highly inefficient co-workers. What is more, a lot of his time is diverted by the Italian authorities, to whom he has to report on a regular basis and who eventually inform him that they have misplaced his passport so that he is temporarily unable to leave the country. There is growing uneasiness on Marlow's part when he happens to notice that his private correspondence with his fianc√©e has been steamed open. When he makes friends with Andreas Zaleshoff, an American businessman of Russian descent whose office is in the same building, he learns from the latter that Bellinetti is an agent for the OVRA and watching each and every step Marlow takes, and that his predecessor's accident--he was run over by a car in a dark and foggy street of Milan--was in fact cold-blooded politically motivated murder. On top of all that, Marlow is contacted by a General Vagas who informs him that he has no choice but to work as a Yugoslav spy. There is no way Marlow could legally leave Italy, especially after an arrest warrant has been issued for him by the authorities. Assisted by Zaleshoff, he succeeds in making his escape from Milan. Together, the two men embark on a several-day-long odyssey through the North of Italy--by train and on foot--until they finally, in the midst of a snowbound forest, reach the Yugoslav border. (Their flight takes up more than one third of the novel.) From Zagreb, Marlow can safely travel home to England. The final episode before the escape is a particularly excoriating attack on the repressive behaviour of the Mussolini State. This novel, together with Uncommon Danger/Background to Danger and The Mask of Dimitrios/A Coffin for Dimitrios comes from Ambler's 'Popular front' period when he was plainly sympathetic to the Left and the USSR. One of Marlow's English work colleagues, an obviously decent and intelligent sort, is sympathetically identified as a 'socialist'. Marlow escapes capture on one occasion thanks to the selfless intervention of a former Communist railwayman, who has been cunningly identified as a one-time Comrade by Andreas Zaleshoff. Context The charming, humorous, resourceful and courageous Zaleshoff and his beautiful sister Tamara - also a Soviet agent - are the only characters to feature at length in two Ambler books. Both also play a significant role in Uncommon Danger, where the English journalist, Kenton, blunders into a major intelligence operation and finds himself working for Moscow against agents of cynical capitalism and National Socialism. In an essay on Ambler, James Fenton argued that Ambler said a decisive farewell to his left-wing period in his post-war thriller Judgement on Deltchev, which revolves around a show trial in an unidentified Communist country somewhere in the Balkans.

The Department of Social and Decision Sciences is headquartered in Porter Hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and is led by Department Head Linda C. Babcock. SDS has a world-class reputation for research and education programs in decision-making in public policy, economics, management, and the behavioral social sciences. History The Department of Social Sciences was established in 1976, as part of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences under Dean John Patrick Crecine with approval from Heinz College Dean Otto Davis, which previously housed the program. The department was staffed by political scientists, sociologists, and economists from within the Dietrich College, the Heinz College, and the Tepper School of Business. In the 1980s, the department was led by Patrick D. Larkey and developed the undergraduate information systems program which became a huge success, eventually being spun off into an independent interdisciplinary program in the Dietrich College. In 1985, Robyn Dawes joined the department and began to re-focus it into its current form and expertise in behavioral decision-making and caused it to be renamed as the Department of Social and Decision Sciences. Carnegie Mellon's Institute for Politics and Strategy was spun off of the department in 2015. Education The department runs highly regarded undergraduate bachelor of science programs in Decision Science and Policy and Management and a bachelor of arts program in Behavioral Economics, Policy, and Organizations as well as minors in Decision Science and Policy and Management. Further, SDS is a partner in various interdisciplinary undergraduate programs such as the Sociology minor, Environmental Policy program, and the Quantitative Social Science Scholars program. At the master's degree level, SDS partners with several other colleges and departments for the Engineering and Technology Innovation Management program. The graduate PhD program allows doctoral students options in Social and Decision Sciences, Behavioral Decision Research (BDR) as well as a joint PhDs in Behavioral Decision Research and Psychology with the Department of Psychology, Behavioral Marketing and Decision Research and Behavioral Economics with the Tepper School of Business, and a joint MD-PhD Medical Scientist Training program with the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. SDS also hosts an executive education program in behavioral economics. All students are trained in policy analysis and research methods. SDS is also closely associated with its spin- off programs: the undergraduate Information Systems program and the Institute for Politics and Strategy. Research The department's primary strength lies in interdisciplinary research, particularly in the intersection of politics and sociology with economics, psychology and human decision making. Statistics, microeconomics, rational decision theory and game theory are among the many areas of specialization. SDS faculty are very involved in interdisciplinary research throughout the university, and are drawn from fields as diverse as economics, psychology, sociology, history, management science, and political science. SDS is affiliated with several labs and centers: Data Truck serving researchers in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences *Behavioral Economics and Decision Research Policy LabBehavioral Economics and Decision Research Policy Lab *Center for Behavioral and Decision ResearchCenter for Behavioral and Decision Research *Center for Risk Perception and CommunicationCenter for Risk Perception and Communication *Data-Driven Diversity LabData-Driven Diversity Lab *Dynamic Decision Making LaboratoryDynamic Decision Making Laboratory As part of the Center for Behavioral Decision Research, SDS manages the Data Truck and managed the Carnegie Mellon Research Cafe. The Data Truck is a mobile behavioral science lab. The Research Cafe was a cafe located in downtown Pittsburgh and was designed to perform behavioral research outside of the student population on the main Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh campus where the SDS labs are located. The cafe is now closed. Rankings In 2006, an Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences study gave four of five stars to the graduate program in prescriptive decision making and five stars in descriptive decision making. These two ratings tied the department for first place among decision science programs in the United States with Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania. Faculty SDS is home to some of the world's top faculty in the fields of decision science, decision support systems, behavioral economics, organizational behavior, risk analysis, management science, and complex social systems. Some notable faculty members (both current and past) include Baruch Fischhoff, Paul Fischbeck, Robyn Dawes, George Loewenstein, Cleotilde Gonzalez, Jennifer Lerner, Kathleen Carley, David Krackhardt, Steven Klepper, Linda C. Babcock, Lee Branstetter, David A. Hounshell, William Keech, John H. Miller, Mark Kamlet, Roberto Weber, Herbert A. Simon, Jendayi Frazer, Kiron Skinner, Sara Kiesler, John Patrick Crecine, Cristina Bicchieri, Joseph Born Kadane, Daniel M. Oppenheimer, Patrick D. Larkey, and Otto Davis. The current faculty consists of 20 full-time members with additional associated and adjunct faculty, staff, and fellows. In addition the department works closely with the departments of Engineering and Public Policy, Psychology, History, and Statistics and Data Science, as well as the Tepper School of Business, Heinz College, and the undergraduate Information Systems program. Many SDS faculty have joint appointments in these departments.

As a child, Warby's hero was Donald Campbell, who died attempting to break the record in 1967. The Spirit of Australia Warby designed the hull of his record-breaking boat, Spirit of Australia, himself and built it in his backyard. He started the project as a Makita salesman who happened to team up with two Leading aircraftmen at RAAF Base Richmond in the early 1970s. Warby bought a military surplus Westinghouse jet engine at auction for only . It was not in working order, but Crandall and Cox refurbished it. The Spirit was covered with a canvas tarpaulin when it rained and was made of wood and fibreglass. On 20 November 1977, he set a new world water speed record of , breaking the record of Lee Taylor by a little over . With a subsequent run on 8 October 1978, he set the record that still stands today. In doing so, he became the first and only person to exceed 300 mph (482.8 km/h) on water and live to tell the tale; Donald Campbell died on his attempt after his hydroplane crashed at over 320 mph (515 km/h) on his return run in his 1967 record attempt. Later boats By 2003 Warby had designed and built another boat, the Aussie Spirit, with which he planned to increase his own record. Of similar dimensions to Spirit of Australia it was also powered by a Westinghouse J34 jet engine. The rudder alone on this new boat cost more than the $10,000 all-up cost of the original Spirit. Again, Warby designed, built, self-financed and piloted his own boat. Rule changes meant that a record attempt was never made with it. Retirement In later years, Warby has been associated with offshore power boat racing in the US with the AMF team. It was at such an event with AMF at Chattanooga, Tennessee on 16 October 2007 that he officially ran his jetboat for the last time. On the 30th anniversary of the 1977 record, Warby announced his retirement from further record attempts.

Scale model of Red Boat Opera ship Nearly all extant lineages of Wing Chun, except the Pao Fa Lien (Âà®Ëä±ËìÆ) and Hek Ki Boen branches, claim to descend from the members of the mid-19th-century Red Boat Opera Company (Á¥ÖËàπÊà≤Áè≠). There is no universally recognized sanctioning body for Wing Chun that governs certification of lineage, nor an unambiguous way of defining lineage. This branch listing relies on existing published, and notable family trees. Listings of notable students within a branch are in no particular order, and not intended to state seniority or rank. Ip Man branch Ip Man (), also known as Yip Kai-Man () was well respected by other martial arts instructors in southern China and Hong Kong. He was the first person to teach Wing Chun to a wider public. After his death, many of his students formed separate schools. Yip Man's teachers included Chan Wah Shun, Chan Wah Shun's student Ng Chung So (Âê¥‰ª≤Á¥†), and Leung Bik, son of Chan Wah Shun's teacher Leung Jan. Ip Man was well known for having a very quick wit and an acid tongue. His teaching style, along with the very direct nature of the art and its despising of superfluous talk, infuses it with a certain edginess. This is probably why Wing Chun is well known for being split into many factions. Ip Chun, the eldest son of Ip Man, is as passionate and relentless in keeping his father's Wing Chun kung fu legacy alive and, in 2014, was selected to represent Wing Chun as the inheritor of the legacy of Wing Chun-style kung fu. Notable students of Ip Man include: Leung Sheung(Ê¢ÅÁõ∏), Lok Yiu (Èß±ËÄÄ), Chu Shong-tin (ÂæêÂ∞öÁî∞), Lo Man Kam (ÁõßÊñáÈå¶), Wong Shun Leung (ÈªÉÊ∑≥Ê®ë), Bruce Lee (ÊùéÂ∞èÈæç), Victor Kan Wah Chit (Á∞°ËèØÊç∑), Ip Chun, William Cheung, Moy Yat and Leung Ting (Ê¢ÅÊå∫). Yiu Choi branch Yiu Choi () first began learning Wing Chun Kuen from Yuen Chai Wan, the elder brother of Yuen Kay San, in roughly 1920 and studied with him until Yuen moved to Vietnam in 1936, just after the death of his Sifu Fung Siu Ching. Just before he left, Yuen introduced Yiu Choi to his friend and fellow Wing Chun Kuen practitioner, Chan Wah Shun, to continue his studies. At the same time, he also learned from Chan Wah Shun's student Ng Chung So. Yiu Choi and his elder brother owned and operated an opium smoke and gambling house and later opened one on Shilutou. They offered Ng Chung So to hold his nightly classes in the back room of the house. Ng taught from the club for roughly a decade until he retired, and Yiu Choi moved him into his home and cared for him for roughly a decade in exchange for further training for himself and his son Yiu Kay. Ng Chung So lived and was cared for until he died. Known as ‚ÄúDai Lik‚Äù (Big Strong) because of his natural power, Yiu Choi taught Wing Chun Kuen to his son, Yiu Kay (Âßö Á•∫), as well as to students such as Go Bing and Fok Joy. According to Wai-Po Tang, Grandmaster Yiu Kay stated that his father, Yiu Choi, was one of Ip Man‚Äôs teachers. During different stages of life, there was also a time when both Yiu Choi and Yip Man had the same teacher (Ng Chung So). This makes Grandmaster Yiu Choi both Yip Man‚Äôs Sifu and also elder Sihing. Yiu Choi is the 5th generation of Wing Chun -- bestowed upon him by Ng Chun So, the title ‚ÄòDescendant of Wing Chun.‚ÄôYiu Choi Wingchunpedia.org The Yiu Choi Style was succeeded by his son, Yiu Kay, who is succeeded by his three sons.Sifu Sergio presents a visit to the Yiu Choi lineage of wing chun part 1 January 25, 2011, experience Wing Chun and Taiji by Sifu Sergio Jiu Wan branch Jiu Wan () first taught Wing Chun at Jing Mo Gwun, a school in Foshan, China. When the Communists took over China, he moved to Hong Kong where he continued to teach. Jiu Wan's relationship with Yip Man is controversial among students of both branches. Some students of Jiu Wan maintainJiu Wan 1 Wing Chun Kuen he studied under his cousin and later under Yip Man. Yip Man students claim that as well. Jason Lau's branch of Jiu WanJiu Wan 2 claim they were kung fu brothers directly under Chan Wah Shun. Notable students of Jiu Wan include Jason Lau, and Ti Lung (Tam Fu-Wing). Gulao (Koo Lo) Village branch Gulao () Wing Chun Kuen was taught by Dr. Leung Jan when he retired back to his native village of Gulao in Heshan County, Guangdong province and is typically referred to by the village name to distinguish it from the doctor‚Äôs Foshan teachings. The Fung family variations found in Kulo Village have also come to be called Pin Sun (Side Body) Wing Chun. Pan Nam branch Pan Nam () studied Hung Gar from 1934 to 1947 until he met Jiu Chow (top student of Chan Yiu Men), and officially began his Wing Chun Kuen training. His classmates included Leung Lam, Jiu Wan, Lee Shing, Wong Jing and other semi famous Wing Chun masters. Jiu Chow had to relocate to Chungshan, and Pan followed him to continue training. According to Sum Nung, prior to learning from Jiu Chow, Pan briefly studied from Cheung Bo, but soon opted to train with Jiu. In 1949 Pan Nam moved back to Fatshan and started teaching at the ‚ÄúUnion of cake industry workers of Fatshan‚Äù. In 1956 he was introduced to Lai Hip Chai a classmate of Ng Chun So, Yip Man and Chan Yiu Men, who was the second to last student accepted by Chan Wah Shun (Yip Man being the last). Lai Hip Chai had not only learned from Chan, but also from Lok Lan Goon's nephew. Notable students include Eddie Chong and Felix Leong is a direct student of Pan Nam who taught Wing Chun in Adelaide, Australia at the same location for 30 years; in September 2015, the Academy was nearly closed down due to a large fire. Yuen Kay Shan branch Yuen Kay Shan () was a master in the martial art of Wing Chun, who lived from 1889 to 1956, known as an undefeated champion of 1000 death duels in Foshan during the 1920-1950s. The fifth of five brothers, he became known as \\"Foshan Yuen Lo Jia\\" (Yuen the Fifth of Foshan). Yuen Kay Shan combined the Wing Chun of both of his teachers, constable Fok Bo Chuen, and body guard and bounty hunter Fung Siu Ching. Notable students: Sum Nung Nguyen Te-Cong/Yuen Chai Wan branch Nguy·ªÖn T·∫ø-C√¥ng/Yuen Chai Wan () Older brother of Yuen Kay-San, Yuen first learned Wing Chun Kuen under Fok Bo-Chuen and later continued his studies with Fung Siu-Ching. In 1936 he was invited to teach Wing Chun in Vietnam at the Nanhai and Shunde Expatriates Associations and moved to Hanoi, where he was known by the Vietnamese pronunciation of his name, Nguyen Te-Cong. In 1954 he relocated to Saigon (Now, Ho Chi Minh City) where he established a second school. Cho family branch The Cho family of Poon Yu Village (near Shunde and Foshan) have been practitioners of southern fist systems, such as Choy Lai Fut, Hung Gar, Mok Gar, and White Crane, for many years. Cho Shun joined the King Fa Wui Goon and became an Operatic performer/actor. He became the first known disciple of Wing Chun practitioner Yik Kam. Hung Fa Yi (Hung Suen Wing Chun Kuen) Hung Fa Yi Wing Chun Kuen (), previously referred to as Hung Suen Wing Chun Kuen (), was introduced by Garrett Gee of San Francisco (although it is said to come from Xiguan, Guangzhou, China.) Pao Fa Lien branch Founded by Dai Dong Fung ( lit. \\"Great East Wind\\") and his students Tze Gwok Leung () and Tze Gwok Cheung (), the branch received its name via Lao Dat Sang, who had the nickname Pao Fa Lien (), or \\"Wood Planer Lien\\". Fut Sao (Buddha Hand) branch Fut Sao Wing Chun Kuen (), was introduced by Henry Leung \\"Chi-Man\\" (Leung Hung-Lay) in New York City back in the early 1960s. The Chinese martial art system was named after GM Leung's Teacher the renowned Ch√°n Buddhist master Hsu Yun aka \\"Ghao Ji Fut Sao\\". Different students of Leung Chi-Man report different origins for the system, including it descended from Fung Siu Ching, Leung Bik, Chan Wah Shun, Mi√°o Xi«én (Miu Sun), Xu Yun Hsu Yun, and Leung Chan Sang aka Dr Leung Jan. The Buddhist Wing Chun system can be traced back to the provinces of Kwang Chow Guangzhou, and or Canton Foshan well over 200 years ago. The Style specializes in close quarters combat techniques that derive from theories, concepts, principles, and methods taught with in its training regime. Fut Sao has seven forms, and various other drills, or exercises. The forms consist of siu lum dao, chum kiu, biu gee, siu baat qua, mook yun jong, bat cham dao, and luk dim boon kwun. The ideas of root, power, structure, flow, time, space, energy, and many other skills are learned by its practitioners. Notable students: James Cama.

Symptoms include pain, redness, light sensitivity, and a feeling like a foreign body is in the eye. Most people recover completely within three days. Most cases are due to minor trauma to the eye such as that which can occur with contact lens use or from fingernails. About 25% of cases occur at work. Diagnosis is often by slit lamp examination after fluorescein dye has been applied. More significant injuries like a corneal ulcer, globe rupture, recurrent erosion syndrome, and a foreign body within the eye should be ruled out. Prevention includes the use of eye protection. Treatment is typically with antibiotic ointment. In those who wear contact lenses a fluoroquinolone antibiotic is often recommended. Paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs, and eye drops such as cyclopentolate that paralysis the pupil can help with pain. Evidence does not support the usefulness of eye patching for those with simple abrasions. About 3 per 1,000 people are affected a year in the United States. Males are more often affected than females. The typical age group affected is those in their 20s and 30s. Complications can include bacterial keratitis, corneal ulcer, and iritis. Complications may occur in up to 8% of people. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of corneal abrasion include pain, trouble with bright lights, a foreign-body sensation, excessive squinting, and reflex production of tears. Signs include epithelial defects and edema, and often redness of the eye. The vision may be blurred, both from any swelling of the cornea and from excess tears. Crusty buildup from excess tears may also be present. =Complications= Complications are the exception rather than the rule from simple corneal abrasions. It is important that any foreign body be identified and removed, especially if containing iron as rusting will occur. Occasionally the healed epithelium may be poorly adherent to the underlying basement membrane in which case it may detach at intervals giving rise to recurrent corneal erosions. Causes Corneal abrasions are generally a result of trauma to the surface of the eye. Common causes include being poked by a finger, walking into a tree branch, and wearing old contact lenses. A foreign body in the eye may also cause a scratch if the eye is rubbed. Injuries can also be incurred by \\"hard\\" or \\"soft\\" contact lenses that have been left in too long. Damage may result when the lenses are removed, rather than when the lens is still in contact with the eye. In addition, if the cornea becomes excessively dry, it may become more brittle and easily damaged by movement across the surface. Soft contact lens wear overnight has been extensively linked to gram negative keratitis (infection of the cornea) particularly by a bacterium known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa which forms in the eye's biofilm as a result of extended soft contact lens wear. When a corneal abrasion occurs either from the contact lens itself or another source, the injured cornea is much more susceptible to this type of bacterial infection than a non-contact lens user's would be. This is an optical emergency as it is sight (in some cases eye) threatening. Contact lens wearers who present with corneal abrasions should never be pressure patched because it has been shown through clinical studies that patching creates a warm, moist dark environment that can cause the cornea to become infected or cause an existing infection to be greatly accelerated on its destructive path. Corneal abrasions are also a common and recurrent feature in people who suffer specific types of corneal dystrophy, such as lattice corneal dystrophy. Lattice dystrophy gets its name from an accumulation of amyloid deposits, or abnormal protein fibers, throughout the middle and anterior stroma. During an eye examination, the doctor sees these deposits in the stroma as clear, comma-shaped overlapping dots and branching filaments, creating a lattice effect. Over time, the lattice lines will grow opaque and involve more of the stroma. They will also gradually converge, giving the cornea a cloudiness that may also reduce vision. In some people, these abnormal protein fibers can accumulate under the cornea's outer layer‚Äîthe epithelium. This can cause erosion of the epithelium. This condition is known as recurrent epithelial erosion. These erosions: (1) Alter the cornea's normal curvature, resulting in temporary vision problems; and (2) Expose the nerves that line the cornea, causing severe pain. Even the involuntary act of blinking can be painful. Diagnosis Although corneal abrasions may be seen with ophthalmoscopes, slit lamp microscopes provide higher magnification which allow for a more thorough evaluation. To aid in viewing, a fluorescein stain that fills in the corneal defect and glows with a cobalt blue-light is generally instilled first. A careful search should be made for any foreign body, in particular looking under the eyelids. Injury following use of hammers or power-tools should always raise the possibility of a penetrating foreign body into the eye, for which urgent ophthalmology opinion should be sought. =Prevention = Prevention is the best method to avoid recurrence of corneal abrasions. Protective eyewear should be worn by people who work with hazardous machinery, metal, wood, or chemicals, as well as those who perform yard work or participate in certain contact sports. The appropriate type of protective eyewear depends on the specific circumstances, but all should provide shielding, good visibility, and a comfortable fit. Some examples include polycarbonate glasses or goggles, plastic safety glasses, face shields, and welding helmets. Specifically, welders should use a helmet with a lens that blocks UV light to avoid UV keratitis. It is important to notice that people with one eye are especially vulnerable to potentially blinding injuries, and should pay special attention to protecting their eyes. In these cases, protective eyewear can ensure some degree of safety while also allowing people to participate in their normal day-to-day activities. Ensuring both a proper contact lens fit and the compliance of the person with care measures can prevent contact lens-related complications. As it has been stated previously, these can cause both mechanic damage to the cornea and be a risk factor for the development of microbial keratitis. Thus, an emphasis should be placed on reducing lens contamination by using effective disinfecting solutions, as well as antimicrobial contact lenses and cases. It is important to avoid swimming with contact lenses, because this increases the frequency of bacterial infections, primarily from Staphylococcus epidermidis and other organisms found in contaminated water. Finally, people who use contact lenses can also avoid both mechanical and infectious trauma by not using contacts beyond the length of their intended use. Treatment The treatment of corneal abrasions aims to prevent bacterial superinfection, speed healing, and provide symptomatic relief. If a foreign body is found, it needs to be removed. = Foreign body = * Positioning: The person is laid in a comfortable position with the affected eye closest to the physician. Loupes can be used if available and the eye can be illuminated with a medical light or, alternatively, with an ophtalmoscope held in the non-dominant hand. The person is then asked to focus on a particular point on the ceiling so that the foreign body sits as centrally between the eyelids as possible. This accounts for a more sterile procedure by keeping the eyelashes as far as possible, and reduces the chance of eliciting a blink reflex. If necessary, the eyelids can be kept open using an eyelid speculum, the examiner‚Äôs fingertips, a cotton tip or an assistant. * Anaesthetic and pupil dilator: Local anaesthetic is instilled into both eyes in order to reduce blepharospasm. Topical oxybuprocaine 0.4% is the preferred choice as it has an onset of action of 20 seconds and a half-life of 20 minutes. A drop of topical pupil dilator such a cyclopentolate 1%, if available, can be helpful to reduce ciliary spasm after removal of the foreign body. Atropine is generally avoided due to its long- lasting mydriatic effects. * Removal techniques: There are mainly two types of techniques, the choice of which will depend on the nature of the foreign body. The first technique is the cotton tip removal, which is indicated in superficial foreign bodies with no surrounding corneal reaction, and the second is the hypodermic needle or n¬∫15 blade removal with which the complete foreign body and any surrounding rust ring can be removed. * Irrigation of the ocular surface and upper and lower fornices can be performed after the procedure to wash out any residual loose foreign body material. A 10 mL ampoule of sterile saline is usually sufficient. =Medications= Current recommendations stress the need to use topical and/or oral analgesia and topical antibiotics. One review has found that eye drops to numb the surface of the eye such as tetracaine improve pain; however, their safety is unclear. Another review did not find evidence of benefit and concluded there was not enough data on safety. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are useful to reduce the pain caused by corneal abrasions. Diclofenac and ketorolac are the most used, one drop four times a day. It is worth noting, however, that diclofenac may delay wound healing and ketorolac should be avoided in people who wear contact lenses. Some studies do not recommend using topical NSAIDs due to the risk of corneal toxicity. There is no direct evidence regarding the use of oral analgesics, but because pain relief is the main concern for people with corneal abrasions, these are prescribed according to individual's characteristics. Topical antibiotics are used to prevent concomitant infections, which result in slower healing of corneal abrasions. Ointments are considered the first-line treatment, as they are more lubricating than drops. If the person uses contact lenses, an antibiotic with anti-pseudomonal activity is preferred (ciprofloxacin, gentamycin or ofloxacin), and the use of contact lenses should be discontinued until the abrasion has healed and the antibiotic treatment has ended. This is because contact lens wearers are often colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which may cause corneal perforations and subsequent permanent vision loss. If the mechanism of injury involves contact lenses, fingernails or organic/ plant matter, antibiotic prophylaxis should be provided with topical fluoroquinolone drops 4 times a day, and a fluoroquinolone ointment, typically ciprofloxacin, at night. If the abrasion was caused by another mechanism, the recommended treatment includes antibiotic ointments (erythromycin, bacitracin or bacitracin/polymyxin B every 2 or 4 hours) or antibiotic drops, usually polymyxin B and trimethoprim 4 times a day. =Patching= Eye patching is not generally recommended as they do not help with healing or pain. Furthermore, it can result in decreased oxygen delivery, increased moisture and a higher chance of an infection. Another measure that is no longer recommended is the use of mydriatics, formerly used to relieve the pain caused by ciliary muscle spasm.

The location shooting for the film took place near Tripoli, Libya. Plot In Timbuktu, experienced guide Joe January (John Wayne) reluctantly joins a Saharan treasure hunting expedition led by Paul Bonnard (Rossano Brazzi), a man obsessed with confirming his dead father's claim to have found a lost city. Dita (Sophia Loren), a woman of dubious reputation, becomes infatuated with Paul and his willingness to overlook her past. She invites herself along, despite Joe's protests. During the tough dry ordeal, Joe and Dita become attracted to each other, raising tensions. Just as they run out of water, they stumble upon the ancient city and a well. There, they find three human skeletons, a woman and two men. It becomes evident that Paul's father found his woman in the arms of his guide, killed them and then himself. There is also no obvious treasure to be found. Paul's faith in his father is shattered and he becomes drunk. However; they find the treasure after Joe deciphers the clues left by Paul's father in his bible. They load it and prepare to leave in the morning. Paul makes an attempt to seduce Dita; she rejects him and he gets into a fight with Joe who protects her. Joe and Dita wake-up to find that Paul had sneaked away during the night taking all the animals, supplies, and treasure with him and leaving the other two to die. Joe and Dita chase after him on foot and eventually catch up. Paul is unconscious from dehydration. While Joe and Dita dig for desperately needed water, Paul regains consciousness. He buries the treasure and attacks Joe from behind with a knife. Dita shoots and kills Paul. When they spot a caravan, Joe and Dita are saved.

Wayne and Hathaway worked together six times, beginning with The Shepherd of the Hills (1941) and ending with Wayne's Oscar-winning role in True Grit (1969). Co-author Robert Presnell, nearing the end of his career at this time, was one of Hollywood's most successful screenwriters. None of this talent managed to keep Legend of the Lost from being harshly reviewed by critics. Wayne liked the location work in Rome and Libya. The plot is vaguely similar to another of Wayne‚Äôs movies crossing the Mojave Desert. The Roman remains of Leptis Magna in Libya were used extensively as a location for the ancient city. In the script Wayne's character refers to 'Timgad' in sardonic reference to the apparent delusions of Paul's father, despite the fact this places a considerable strain on the geography of the plot. The lost city of Timgad referred to in the film was actually the Leptis Magna ruins, a Roman city dating back to the 7th century B.C. near Tripoli, in northwest Libya, while \\"Timbuktu\\" was actually in Zliten, Libya. Headquarters for the film were located in Ghadames, where, according to the publicity material, citizens of the villages were employed on set, as well as some native Tuaregs, an ancient desert tribe.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=22820&category;=Notes This film was Wayne's only collaboration on film with international cinema stars Sophia Loren and Rossano Brazzi.

Like other jumping spiders it does not build a web. It has a particularly large pair of forward facing eyes that help it to locate and stalk its prey before pouncing on it. Their common name refers to their vivid black-and-white colouration, whilst their scientific name derives from Salticus from the Latin for ‚Äúdancing‚Äù, in reference to their agility, and the Greek scenicus, translating to ‚Äútheatrical‚Äù or ‚Äúof a decorative place,‚Äù in reference to the flashy, zebra-like coloration of the species. Description Female zebra spiders are 5‚Äì9 mm long, while males are 5‚Äì6 mm. Male zebra spiders also have distinctly larger chelicerae than females. Spiders in the family Salticidae have especially enlarged anterior median eyes (AME), though the anterior and posterior lateral eyes (ALE, PLE) are also large when compared to the very small posterior median eyes (PME). In total there are eight eyes, with the very large anterior median eyes primarily responsible for its excellent binocular vision. These small spiders are black with white hairs that form stripes. Distribution Zebra spiders are widespread across Britain, Europe, and North America, and are found throughout the Holarctic. They often live close to or in human settlements. They can be found on walls, plants and fences on sunny days; and also indoors on window sills, often in the corner behind curtains. Behaviour S. scenicus eating Hypositticus pubescens =Diet= Zebra spiders tend to hunt smaller spiders and other arthropods. They have been observed feeding on mosquitos that are almost twice their length. They have also been observed taking on prey items up to 3 times the length of the spider, such as some of the smaller species of moth. Like other jumping spiders, these spiders use their large front eyes to locate and stalk their prey. They move slowly towards their prey until they are close enough to pounce on top of their victim, and their hunting behaviour has been described as cat-like. Using their acute eyesight, they are able to accurately judge the distances they need to jump. =Hunting= They orient towards prey detected by their lateral eyes whenever the angle subtended by such prey exceeds 5.5¬∞. The velocity of the prey is not involved in the determination of reactive distance, but only moving objects elicit orientation. The probability that orientation is followed by stalking is a function of both prey size and velocity. The zebra spider's stalk velocity declines progressively as it nears its (stationary) prey. Before jumping, they glue a silk thread to the surface that they are jumping from so that if they miss the target, they can climb up the thread and try again - However, they may 'abseil' with a silk thread if they wish to descend from a height safely, for instance they have been documented 'abseiling' from ceilings. They ignore unappetising insects such as ants. There are no extensor muscles at the 'hinge joints' of the spider leg, instead joints extension is due to the haemocoelic blood pressure in the leg. The most significant evidence that this extension is due to hydraulic forces is that the leg spines become erect during the jump, a result of increased body pressure which can be demonstrated on many spiders. The zebra spider's jump is almost entirely due to the sudden straightening of the fourth pair of legs. The mean jumping velocity is estimated to be between . =Reproduction= When these spiders meet, the male carries out a courtship dance involving waving his front legs and moving his abdomen up and down. The better the dance the more likely the female will want to mate, with success guaranteed if the male can exhibit a perfect shuffle. Females will stay with their egg sacs and will guard the young after they hatch. After the spiderlings have had their second moult they will leave the mother and fend for themselves. Taxonomic history Salticus scenicus was one of the spiders included in Carl Alexander Clerck's 1757 work Svenska Spindlar / Aranei Suecici, the starting point for spider names in zoological nomenclature. Clerck originally called the species Araneus scenicus, and Carl Linnaeus, in the 1758 edition of Systema Naturae named it Aranea scenica; the specific epithet ' means \\"actor\\". Since then a number of synonyms have been published: * Araneus scenicus * Aranea scenica * Aranea albo-fasciata * Aranea fulvata * Attus scenicus * Attus candefactus * Epiblemum faustum * Attus scenicoides * Calliethera histrionica * Calliethera scenica * Calliethera aulica * Salticus albovittatus * Attus histrionicus * Callithera alpina * Callietherus histrionicus * Epiblemum histrionicum * Salticus histrionicus * Epiblemum scenicum * Calliethera goberti * Calliethera albovittata References Category:Salticidae Category:Jumping spiders of Europe Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders of North America Category:Holarctic spiders ","title":"Zebra spider"},{"id":"2532772","text":"NASCAR Nation was a program on the Speed Channel, which aired Monday nights, discussing the lifestyle of NASCAR drivers when they are not on the track.

It is defined by standard as (about ). This value was established by the 3rd CGPM (1901, CR 70) and used to define the standard weight of an object as the product of its mass and this nominal acceleration. The acceleration of a body near the surface of the Earth is due to the combined effects of gravity and centrifugal acceleration from the rotation of the Earth (but which is small enough to be neglected for most purposes); the total (the apparent gravity) is about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the Equator.\\"Curious About Astronomy?\\", Cornell University, retrieved June 2007 Although the symbol is sometimes used for standard gravity, (without a suffix) can also mean the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies depending on one's position on Earth (see Earth's gravity). The symbol should not be confused with , the gravitational constant, or g, the symbol for gram. The is also used as a unit for any form of acceleration, with the value defined as above; see g-force. The value of defined above is a nominal midrange value on Earth, originally based on the acceleration of a body in free fall at sea level at a geodetic latitude of 45¬∞. Although the actual acceleration of free fall on Earth varies according to location, the above standard figure is always used for metrological purposes. In particular, it gives the conversion factor between newton and kilogram-force, two units of force. History Already in the early days of its existence, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) proceeded to define a standard thermometric scale, using the boiling point of water. Since the boiling point varies with the atmospheric pressure, the CIPM needed to define a standard atmospheric pressure. The definition they chose was based on the weight of a column of mercury of 760 mm. But since that weight depends on the local gravity, they now also needed a standard gravity. The 1887 CIPM meeting decided as follows: All that was needed to obtain a numerical value for standard gravity was now to measure the gravitational strength at the International Bureau. This task was given to Gilbert √âtienne Defforges of the Geographic Service of the French Army. The value he found, based on measurements taken in March and April 1888, was 9.80991(5) m‚ãÖs‚àí2. This result formed the basis for determining the value still used today for standard gravity. The third General Conference on Weights and Measures, held in 1901, adopted a resolution declaring as follows: The numeric value adopted for was, in accordance with the 1887 CIPM declaration, obtained by dividing Defforges's result ‚Äì 980.991 cm‚ãÖs‚àí2 in the cgs system then en vogue ‚Äì by 1.0003322 while not taking more digits than warranted considering the uncertainty in the result.

The general view holds that \\"Palmyra\\" is derived from \\"Tadmur\\" either as an alteration, which was supported by Schultens, or as a translation using the Greek word for palm (\\"palame\\", œÄŒ±ŒªŒ¨ŒºŒ∑), which is supported by Jean Starcky. Michael Patrick O'Connor argued for a Hurrian origin of both \\"Palmyra\\" and \\"Tadmur\\", citing the incapability of explaining the alterations to the theorized roots of both names, which are represented in the adding of a -d- to \\"Tamar\\" and a -ra- to \\"palame\\". According to this theory, \\"Tadmur\\" is derived from the Hurrian word \\"tad\\", meaning \\"to love\\", + a typical Hurrian mid vowel rising (mVr) formant \\"mar\\". \\"Palmyra\\" is derived from the word \\"pal\\", meaning \\"to know\\", + the same mVr formant \\"mar\\". There is a Syriac etymology for Tadmor, referring to dmr \\"to wonder\\", and TedmurtƒÅ (Aramaic: ‹¨‹ï‹°‹ò‹™‹¨‹ê) \\"Miracle\\"; thus Tadm≈´ra means \\"object of wonder\\", most recently affirmed by Franz Altheim and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Micha≈Ç Gawlikowski (1974). History Bedouin Chief of Palmyra, Holy Land (i.e., Tadmur, Syria), between 1890 and 1900 In 1929, Henri Arnold Seyrig, the general director of antiquities in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, started excavating the ruins of Palmyra and forcibly displaced the villagers to a government-built village, adjacent to the ancient site. The relocation was completed in 1932, making the ancient city of Palmyra ready for excavations, while the residents settled in the new village of the same name. On 13 May 2015, the militant organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) launched an attack on the modern town, raising fears that the iconoclastic group would destroy the historic city. On 18 May ISIL captured the city, with their forces entering the area of the World Heritage Site several days later. In May 2015 ISIL destroyed the tomb of Mohammed bin Ali, a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's cousin Ali, and a site revered by Shia Muslims, and sometime between then and 23 June destroyed the tomb of Nizar Abu Bahaaeddine, a Sufi scholar who lived in Palmyra in the 16th century. Abu Bahaaeddine's tomb was situated in an oasis about from Palmyra's main ancient ruins. Mohammed bin Ali's tomb was located in a mountainous region north of Palmyra. Ten days prior to the tombs' destruction, ISIL destroyed a number of tombstones at a local cemetery for Palmyra's residents. ISIL is also reported to have placed explosives around Palmyra. In March 2016 a large-scale offensive by the SAA (supported by Hezbollah and Russian airstrikes) initially regained the areas south and west of the city. After capturing the orchards and the area north of the city, the assault on the city began. In the early morning hours of the 27th of March 2016, the Syrian military forces regained full control over the city. In December 2016, ISIS retook the oilfields outside of the city, and began moving back into the city center. On 1 March 2017, the Syrian army backed by warplanes, had entered to Palmyra and captured the western and northern western sections of the city amid information about pulling back by ISIS from the city. The next day, the Syrian Army recaptured the entire city of Palmyra, after ISIL fully withdrew from the city.Syrian army announces recapture of Palmyra from Islamic State Economy Palmyra is a modern resettlement of the ancient city of Palmyra, which developed adjacently to the north of the ancient ruins. The modern city is built along a grid pattern. Quwatli Street is the main road and runs east- west, starting from the Saahat al-Ra'is Square on the western edge of the town.Carter, p. 205. The city served as a base for tourists visiting the ruins. It has a museum in the southwestern part of the city. Syria holds an annual cultural festival in Tadmur celebrating the city's ancient heritage.Cavendish, p. 439. The Palmyra Airport is located here. The city is also home to the Tadmur Prison, which has historically held numerous opponents of the various Syrian governments. Palmyra also serves as a center for Syria's phosphate mining and natural gas industries.Knowles, 2006. The first phosphate mine run by the government was established near Tadmur and started production in 1971.Federal Research Division, p. 169. Work to connect Tadmur's phosphate mines to the port of Tartus began in 1978.Federal Research Division, p. 194. In 1986 Soviet surveyors discovered large iron ore deposits in the vicinity of Tadmur.Federal Research Division, p. 170.

Sacrifice has been a feature of almost all pre- modern societies at some stage of their development and for broadly the same reason: to propitiate or fulfill a perceived obligation towards the gods. Crisis and sacrifice What is known of Mayan ritual practices comes from two sources: the extant chronicles and codices of the missionary-ethnographers who arrived with or shortly after the Spanish conquest of Yucat√°n and subsequent archaeological data. The historical record is more sparse than that for the Aztecs,Bancroft 1882, p/ 687. and can only be reliable in regards to the Post-Classical period, long after the Classic Maya collapse. The chroniclers have also been accused of colonial bias, but the most comprehensive account of Maya society, by Diego de Landa, has been described by modern experts as an \\"ethnographic masterpiece‚Äù,Wells 1996, p.201. despite his role in the destruction of Maya codices. The archaeological data has continued to expand as more excavations are undertaken, confirming much of what the early chroniclers wrote. A major breakthrough was the deciphering of the Maya syllabary in the 1950s, which has allowed the glyphs carved into many temples to be understood. Excavation and forensic examination of human remains has also thrown light on the age, sex and cause of death of sacrificial victims. Sacrifices in calendar and everyday rituals Lintel 24 at Yaxchilan, depicting Lady Xoc drawing a barbed rope through her tongue. The Mayas engaged in a large number of festivals and rituals on fixed days of the year, many of which involved animal sacrifices and all of which seem to have involved blood letting. The ubiquity of this practice is a unique aspect of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture, and is now believed to have originated with the Olmecs,Joyce et al 1991. the region's first civilization. Ritualised sacrifice was usually performed in public by religious or political leaders piercing a soft body part, most commonly the tongue, ear or foreskin, and collecting the blood to smear directly on the idol or collecting it on paper, which was then burned. In what is today Nicaragua, the blood was smeared on maize, distributed to the people and baked into sacred bread.Bancroft, p. 710 The blood could also be collected from the non-elite, often from the foreskins of youths (p. 678), or from high-ranking women. The site of collection was of obvious ritual significance. Joralemon notes it is \\"virtually certain\\" that blood from the penis and the vagina were the most sacred and had \\"extraordinary fertilizing power\\" and that such rituals were essential for the regeneration of the natural world, particularly cultivated plants.Joralemon 1974. In one dramatic variant men and women \\"gathered in the temple in a line, and each made a pierced hole through the member, across from side to side, and then passed through as great a quantity of cord as they could stand; and thus all together fastened and strung together, they anointed the statue the Spanish considered to be sun worship of \\"Ba øal\\" from the Bible.De Landa, pp. 47‚Äì48 But auto-sacrifice could also be an everyday event, with those passing by an idol anointing it with blood drawn on the spot as a sign of piety. Blood sacrifice to the Maya gods was vigorously opposed by the Spanish clergy as the most visible sign of native apostasy, as De Landa, who was later to become the second bishop of the Yucat√°n, makes clear: > \\"After the people had been thus instructed in religion, and the youths > benefitted as we have said, they were perverted by their priests and chiefs > to return to their idolatry; this they did, making sacrifices not only by > incense, but also of human blood. Upon this the friars held an Inquisition, > calling upon the Alcalde Mayor for aid; they held trials and celebrated an > Auto,The reference in this poorly translated passage is to an auto-da-f√©. > See Suppression of the Maya for details. putting many on scaffolds, capped, > shorn and beaten, and some in the penitential robes for a time. Some of the > Indians out of grief, and deluded by the devil, hung themselves; but > generally they all showed much repentance and readiness to be good > Christians.\\"P. 30, with translator's footnote: \\"Landa evades saying here > that it was under his own leadership and assumed authority that this > assumption of full inquisitional rights, with a calling on the plenary civil > power, went on.\\") Mesoamerica lacked domesticated food animals such as sheep, cows and pigs,Diamond 1997. so animal protein and byproducts could only be obtained by hunting. Montero-Lopez argues that on the basis of analysis of the distribution of deer parts in Classical Maya sites (white-tailed deer were the most common sacrificial and festive food animal), the archeological record does not support a clear distinction between the secular and sacred uses of animals.Montero Lopez 2009. After deer, the next most common sacrificial animals were dogs and various birds (whose heads were offered to the idols), followed by a wide range of more exotic creatures, from jaguars to alligators. Animal sacrifice also seems to have been a common ritual before the commencement of any important task or undertaking.Bancroft, p. 687 De Landa provides the most comprehensive account of calendar festivals and rituals (chapters 34-40), but in none of these regular events is human sacrifice mentioned, which must mean his Maya informants were unaware of any instances since the cleric would hardly have suppressed such information. Sacred Cenote: the site of an unknown number of human sacrifices The traditional view is that the Mayans were far less prolific in sacrificing people than their neighbours. Bancroft notes: \\"An event which in Mexico would be the death-signal to a hecatomb of human victims would in Yucat√°n be celebrated by the death of a spotted dog.\\"(p. 704) But mounting archeological evidence has for many decades now supported the chroniclers' contention that human sacrifice was far from unknown in Maya society.Marcus 1978.Tiesler & Cucina 2006. The city of Chichen Itza, the main focus of Maya regional power from the Late Classical period, appears to have also been a major focus of human sacrifice. There are two natural sinkholes, or cenotes, at the site of the city, which would have provided a plentiful supply of potable water. The largest of these, Cenote Sagrado (also known as the Well of Sacrifice), was where many victims were cast as an offering to the rain god Chaac. A 2007 study of remains taken from this cenote found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.de Anda Alan√≠s 2007. Bancroft describes one procedure: > A long cord was then fastened round the body of each victim, and the moment > the smoke ceased to rise from the altar, all were hurled into the gulf. The > crowd, which had gathered from every part of the country to see the > sacrifice, immediately drew back from the brink of the pit and continued to > pray without cessation for some time. The bodies were then drawn up and > buried in the neighboring grove. (p.705) There is no consensus on why these sacrifices took place, their true scale at different times, or even who the victims were. Because Maya society was organised as independent city states, the local political and religious elites could independently initiate human sacrifices as they saw fit. De Landa notes that a common cause for temple sacrifices in many cities was the occurrence of \\"pestilences, dissensions, or droughts or the like ills\\". (p. 91) In such cases, slaves were usually purchased and after a variety of rituals were anointed with blue dye and either shot with arrows through the heart or held on an altar while the priest swiftly removed the heart using a ceremonial knife. In either case the heart was presented to the temple idol, which was also anointed with blood.Pp. 48‚Äì49 According to Bancroft, one tribe sacrificed illegitimate boys twice a year, again by removing the heart, but collecting the blood in a bowl and scattering it to the four cardinal compass points within the temple. Capturing prisoners after a successful battle also provided victims for sacrifice, presumably to propitiate whatever deity had promised victory in the first place, although there is no record of the Maya initiating conflicts solely for this purpose as was apparently the case with the Aztecs. Modern analysis of the ancient Maya art indicates a large number of representations of prisoners of war that are now understood to be sacrificial victims: \\"The analysis of the representations and sometimes of their context shows that the crossed-arms-on-the-chest gesture is associated with the concepts of submissiveness, captivity and death ‚Äî in a word, sacrifice.\\"Baudez & Matthews 1978 or 1979. Human sacrificial victim on a Maya vessel, 600‚Äì850 AD (Dallas Museum of Art) Mayanists believe that, like the Aztecs, the Maya performed child sacrifice in specific circumstances, most commonly as foundation dedications for temples and other structures. Maya art from the Classic period also depicts the extraction of children's hearts during the ascension to the throne of the new king, or at the beginnings of the Maya calendar.Stuart 2003. In one of these cases, Stele 11 in Piedras Negras, Guatemala, a sacrificed boy can be seen. Other scenes of sacrificed boys are visible on jars. As archeologists continue to excavate, more instances of child dedicatory sacrifices are being uncovered. A dig commenced in 1974 at the northern Belize site of Lamanai turned up the remains of five children, ranging in age from a newborn to about 8 years old: > \\"The conclusion that the five children were sacrificial victims is virtually > inescapable... Nowhere else at Lamanai is there evidence of human sacrifice, > either of children or adults... However, it is clear that the offering of > children as part of the dedicatory activities that preceded the setting up > of stelae was not uncommon at any time or place in the Maya > lowlands.\\"Pendergast 1988. In 2005 a mass grave of one- to two-year-old sacrificed children was found in the Maya region of Comalcalco. The sacrifices were apparently performed for dedicatory purposes when building temples at the Comalcalco acropolis.Mar√≠ 2005. An excavation at El Per√∫-Waka º turned up the remains of an infant with, unusually, those of an adult male, in the presence of extensive evidence of feasting that had followed the expansion of a residence which had then been \\"ensouled\\" by the rituals and sacrifices. The analysis suggests that the \\"interments show that human sacrifice was not limited to the royal actors associated with the Classic Maya state, but could be practiced by lesser elites as part of their own private ceremonies\\"Eppich 2009 Origins, meaning and social function Both blood and human sacrifice were ubiquitous in all cultures of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, but beyond some uncontroversial generalisations there is no scholarly consensus on the broader questions (and specific mysteries) this raises. Most scholars agree that both practices arose among the Olmecs at least 3,000 years ago, and have been transmitted to subsequent cultures, including the Maya. Why they arose among the Olmecs is unknown, and probably unknowable, given the paucity of data. Blood, and by extension the still-beating heart, is the central element in both the ethnography and iconography of sacrifice, and its use through ritual established or renewed for the Maya a connection with the sacred that was for them essential to the very existence of the natural order. Julian Lee's observation that the Maya \\"drew no sharp distinction between the animate and the inanimate\\"Lee 1996, p.413. and the remarks by Pendergast and others that sacrifices \\"ensouled\\" buildings and idols indicates a social meaning, as Reilly suggests, most akin to transubstantiationReilly 1991, p.158. - a literal rather than symbolic transformation on which the fate of the world and its inhabitants depended. As with all known theocratic societies, it is likely the Maya political and religious elites played mutually reinforcing roles in supporting the position of the other and ensuring the social stability essential for both, with sacrifice rituals functioning as the performative centrepiece of communal integration. But on likely divergences of interests between different social groups in regard to sacrifice rituals, including within these elites, the historical record has so far been silent.

PAST is a federal 501(c)(3) non-profit educational and research team located in the United States that builds partnerships around compelling scientific and educational projects, making them accessible to students and the public through transdisciplinary program-based learning, experiential field schools, documentary film, and interactive websites. History The PAST Foundation was founded in 2000 by an ad hoc organization of anthropologists and scientists who were determined to make ongoing scientific research across a broad spectrum of professions accessible to the public. Immediately, the PAST team began building partnerships and programs for seamless education. The initial work in 2001 included a partnership with the Zoo School from Lincoln, Nebraska, Yellowstone National Park, and PAST. The year-long program featured the first Thermal River archaeological investigation on the Marshall Hotel in the Firehole River and culminated in a published book on the archaeology of the site garnering PAST the National Park Service John L. Cotter Award for Excellence in American Archaeology. For the next five years, PAST continued to partner with both public and private organizations building educational programs like Riverboatin' on the Red for Oklahoma's Department of Education and SCRUNCH for the US Minerals Management Service. Both programs pivoted around ongoing research such as the discovery of a shipwreck in the Red River dating to Oklahoma's early 19th century settlement period and the effects of pressure on Styrofoam cups that were taken down on the AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) that studied World War II shipwrecks in thousands of feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico. These program-based learning projects that crossed disciplines have become the cornerstone of PAST. In addition, PAST continued to partner with public agencies, universities, businesses, and industry building adult field study programs, anthropological research projects, and interactive websites. Years after their launch, websites for the Deep Wrecks Project and USS Arizona still have high volume visitation. The adult field schools have partnered with the Ohio State University, California State Parks, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Historical Society, Indiana University, and East Carolina University providing participants with rigorous field experience and the partners with published reports and searchable databases. =Transition= In 2005, through a startup donation, PAST transitioned from a loose knit project driven organization to a program-based non-profit. Additionally, PAST moved the main office to Columbus, Ohio centrally located within the United States. The move allowed PAST to strategically address the organization's growth. Continuously on the quest to partner with schools to pilot PAST programs, in 2006 the foundation formed a partnership with the Ohio State University, the Battelle Memorial Institute, the Central Ohio Educational Council, and the innovative STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and Metro Early College and Demonstration High School, located on the OSU campus. Forming the PAST/Metro Program Design Center, PAST set about working with the high school faculty to design transdisciplinary programs that pivot on global issues. The very first program, Garbology, built on the work of Dr. William Rathje of the Stanford University Archaeology Center and pivoted on the very real, global issues of waste management, drew national attention and was rewarded the Emerald Award for Excellence in Environmental Education. The students, the program, and the project director, Dr. Sheli O. Smith, were bestowed with this award. Employing STEM as a delivery vehicle for education, PAST has continued to build popular programs that excite students and allow teachers and students to join on an educational journey. From Forensics in the Classroom to The Cultural Landscape of a Michigan Ghost Town, from The Web of Life to Get Real, from Marine Ecology of the Florida Keys to Growing America, the PAST programs continue to draw on the anthropological base of the organization and to building holistic learning. Utilizing the guidance of a strategic plan, PAST has been able to also grow on several other fronts. The PAST adult field schools, now in their ninth year, continue to study known archaeological sites and collections assisting public agencies in better understanding, interpretation, and protection of America's maritime heritage treasures, as well as forging ahead in areas of anthropology. PAST field schools helped California Parks move forward in nominating the Gold Rush Era, shipwreck, Frolic on the Mendocino Coast for inclusion in California's State Underwater Parks. The 2005 through 2008 field schools assisted the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in better understanding and interpreting the 19th century, Sanctuary shipwrecks, Slobodna, Tonawanda, and Memanon Sanford. Since 2006, PAST and partners have hosted a summer field program dedicated to allowing students to fully explore the world of Forensic Anthropology. Similarly, PAST partnered with the respected documentary film program at Montana State University to offer teachers and students a summer practicum in documentary filmmaking that embeds the process in scientific projects. In 2006, PAST sought out a new avenue of public access in order to bring the educational programs and field work and research to the public. PAST Publications utilizes the print-on-demand process to enable students, professionals, programs, and organizations to publish scientific and educational work in a timely and cost- effective way. In 2007, after a year of working with STEM educational reform, PAST and the Battelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy embarked on a combined, ethnographic and policy network study of STEM at Metro Early College and Demonstration High School. The interdisciplinary approach and findings of the study have added a new dimension to the national consideration of how STEM is developed. =Growth= Closing in on its first decade of operation, the PAST Foundation continues to be dedicated to the original goal of bringing public access to compelling scientific research. Currently, PAST works with emerging STEM schools across the US to build transdisciplinary programs for K-20 education and to better understand through anthropological ethnography, the underlying systems that make STEM successful. PAST continues to build learning programs for both high school age students and adults. The impact of these programs help drive their success. PAST Publications is also growing, helping graduate students publish their theses and academic institutions maintain the tradition of publishing research in a timely manner. =Awards= Since its establishment in 2000, recognition of PAST‚Äôs achievements have steadily accumulated. PAST was honored the 2001 National Park Service Cotter Award for Excellence in Archaeology, the 2007 Wiley Award for Excellence in Documentary Film, the 2007 Secretary of the Interior‚Äôs Conservation Collaborative Partnership Award, the 2007 National Oceanic Partner‚Äôs Program Award, the 2007 Emerald Award for Excellence in Environmental Education, and the 2007 Ohio State University Kellogg Award for Excellence in Experiential Learning. Individually, the PAST research team and its research associates have garnered Emmy Awards, the Society of Historical Archaeology‚Äôs Cotter Award for New Promising Professional, and the Ohio State University‚Äôs Graduate Student of the Year Award. Partnerships The PAST Foundation seeks partnerships for ongoing program-based learning opportunities, field programs, documentary film programs, and publications. It is PAST's contention that strong public networks ensure robust learning opportunities. Currently, PAST partners with public agencies, private businesses, public organizations, non-profit institutions, academic institutions, and industries in building programs, underwriting research, and furthering scientific endeavors. See Partnerships Below. Field schools The PAST Foundation field schools consist of anthropological and scientific work that impact humans and their environment, culture, and heritage. All PAST field opportunities are structured as a course with an authentic learning product that benefits the community. Field studies include supervised training, introduction to scientific techniques and methods, as well as organized presentation of field study results. Students have the opportunity to acquire high school and college credit for the field study programs. Field schools currently include work in cultural landscapes, underwater archaeology, marine ecology, entomology, forensic anthropology, urban gardening, and documentary filmmaking. Students are connected with leading professionals and researchers from around the world in person and through the Internet creating robust experiences and good practice science. All field programs explore real needs, engage community partners, and produce tangible outcomes that both assist the community partners and further the education of the participating students. Research Ongoing research is also key in the organization's interests. The PAST Foundation supports new research and methodologies in linking field projects and researchers with educational programs in the classroom. Through the PAST/Metro Program Design Center, graduate students build upon their graduate research creating programs that are ultimately published for public consumption. Forensics in the Classroom, the Web of Life, and Growing America are examples of ongoing, doctoral research that have been crafted into programs aimed at engaging young students in scientific methods and potential, lifelong careers. Ongoing ethnographic studies of STEM are producing results intended to help schools better understand the universal structure that supports STEM delivery systems and how to successfully grow and sustain the necessary community and public networks that support it. Research on the deepwater shipwrecks and other underwater archaeological sites have spurred the PAST research team to initiate a web driven database that will allow researchers from around the world to share and compare information regarding historic ship construction details. VirtualVessel.com, currently under construction, is planned for launch by the close of 2009. Publications PAST Publications, initiated in 2006, recognizes that large quantities of anthropological research does not reach the public. It is the intention of PAST Publications to fill the niche for small-production printing of student theses and dissertations, special publications, cultural resource management (CRM) firm reports, educational programs, and field studies and research. PAST Publications has a bookstore that is available through the foundation‚Äôs website. Through partnerships with universities, professional organizations, CRM firms, and public agencies, the department now features an array of anthropological master‚Äôs thesis, archaeological reports, manuals, journals, and proceedings. Authors and organizations are also sought after in searching for an efficient and cost-effective method of publishing and printing their work. The relatively new process of inline, on-demand printing allows production of one or more copies without changing the cost. All PAST Publications follow the Library of Congress protocol including ISBN numbers.

He is famous for his roles in the Carlton E. Morse productions I Love a Mystery, where he played Doc Long, and One Man's Family, where he spent 19 years portraying Clifford Barbour. In addition, Yarborough spent three years as Sgt. Ben Romero on Jack Webb's Dragnet.  Early years  He was born in Goldthwaite, Texas.DeLong, Thomas A. (1996). Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960. McFarland & Company, Inc. . p. 290. As a youth, Yarborough ran away from home, attracted by the vaudeville stages, and he first worked in radio during the 1920s. After joining a touring musical comedy show, he progressed from bit parts to leading man as the troupe played in various places in Oklahoma and Texas. He attended college at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Southern California, where in 1925 he became a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. One of Yarborough's earliest reported activities in acting was in November 1922, when he was a member of the cast of a Rebekah and Odd Fellows lodges production of The Prince Chap in Reno, Nevada. He was active in dramatic productions at the University of California, including a one-act play on radio station KLX in 1924. His work on stage at UC ranged from drama (The Frogs) to farce (She Stoops to Conquer).  Career  After graduating from the University of California in 1925, Yarborough acted in London, New York, and California, having the leading-man role in Outward Bound. He was a member of the Eva Le Gallienne Civic Repertoire in New York City. Yarborough's NBC radio debut was in 1930, broadcasting from San Francisco. In 1932, Yarborough began a long run as Clifford Barbour on the radio serial One Man's Family, continuing in the role throughout his life. Yarborough was probably best known for his roles as Doc Long in the West Coast cast of Carlton E. Morse's I Love a Mystery (and the subsequent I Love Adventure) and Sergeant Ben Romero, Joe Friday's original partner, on Dragnet. Yarborough's other radio work includes the title role in Hawk Larabee, as well as the roles of Brazos John in Hawk Durango, Sleepy Stevens in Hashknife Hartley, Skip Turner in Adventures by Morse, also by Carlton E. Morse, and the title attorney's assistant in Attorney for the Defense. Yarborough appeared as Doc Long in three feature films for Columbia Pictures, based on the radio series I Love a Mystery: I Love a Mystery in 1945, The Devil's Mask and The Unknown. Yarborough adopted a Southern accent for the Doc Long character, and would retain the dialect for Dragnet. (In private life Yarborough spoke without a trace of an accent, as evidenced in his motion picture appearances of the early 1940s.) He started work on the Dragnet television series in 1951. However, the day after he filmed the second episode, he suffered a heart attack, and died four days later at age 51.

He is often referred to as The Terran Emperor (), or simply \\"The Emperor\\", and is widely considered to be one of the most successful players of the genre as well as an esports icon. In late 2010, he retired from StarCraft: Brood War and founded the StarCraft II team SlayerS. Since the disbanding of SlayerS, he briefly returned to SK Telecom T1 (SK T1) as a coach before retiring due to health related issues.SlayerS Clan homepage(Korean) He is currently a professional poker player. Lim has a record of 548 wins and 416 losses (56.80%) Teamliquid Player Information in his professional career. He is one of the highest-paid professional gamers, with annual earnings that exceed $400,000 US Dollars and endorsement contracts that bring in an additional $90,000 per year.  Career  Lim first came to fame by dominating professional StarCraft while choosing to use the Terran race. The following reign of dominance earned him the nickname the \\"Terran Emperor\\", a reference to StarCraft lore. During this early time in his career he innovated heavily, creating many new strategies which are still used today, most notably making much more effective use of the Terran Dropship unit than had been achieved in the past. He also gained a reputation for being able to turn around matches against the odds and having excellent micromanagement (unit control) skills. He would often continue the game despite heavy disadvantages yet still pull out a victory. In contrast, his weakness is thought by some commentators to be poor macromanagement (economy/unit production) skills in comparison to other top-level professional StarCraft players. BoxeR is most renowned for his creativity; often building proxy barracks. In many games, he has gone for quick attacks (\\"rushes\\") or special ops units (\\"ghosts\\") which make the games extremely entertaining. He is very well respected in StarCraft both in Korea and abroad. In 2004 he was voted the greatest gamer of all time by readers of ESReality, a popular Western esports website, and in June 2006 he was included in an MTV list of \\"The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers Of All Time.\\"mtv.com ‚Äì Playa Rater: The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers Of All Time Yo-hwan in 2006 Even after his prime years, Lim was ranked 11th on the April 2006 Korean e-Sports Players Association (KeSPA) rankings, and made it to the finals of the EVER Ongamenet Starleague (OSL) of late 2004 (losing to iloveoov by three games to two) and the finals of the 2005 So1 OnGameNet Starleague (losing to Anytime by three games to two). Lim had played professionally since version 1.07 of StarCraft, and managed to stay competitive by constantly changing his style, and has had a great influence of the development of modern playing styles, especially for Terran players. He is the all-time leader in games played and wins. He is a two time OSL champion, one time MSL champion, two time World Cyber Games (WCG) champion, and leader of the SK Telecom \\"T1\\" team. He is considered to have a strong eye for talent in that position, as he drew Choi Yeon-Sung (iloveoov), among others, from the amateur ranks. His team has consistently been the strongest in the Proleague. In August 2006 Lim announced at the MSL group draws that he had received his draft letter from the government, and would be entering the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) by the end of the year. He later said he would try his best to return after his 2 and a half years of service. After Lim joined the Republic of Korea Air Force, he started putting his fame to work. After a month and a half an Air Force pro-gaming team was created. Lim found some retired pro-gamers who joined the Air Force before him, including H.O.T-Forever, CLon, ChRh, fOru, Rage, Qoo, Sunny and MuMyung. Together they formed the first military pro-gaming team. Two months after the team was announced, ACE (Airforce Challenge E-sports) was official. ACE first played in the 2008 ShinHan Proleague, and has participated ever since. On December 22, 2008, Boxer returned to SKT1 and played on that team as military service was ending, and has remained on its A-Team; however, he has concentrated on playing individual league matches since then. In September 2010, Boxer began playing high level StarCraft II games against other pro gamers as Terran under the username ManofOneway,http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=157713 Report on Boxer / ManofOneway on teamliquid.net but has switched to SlayerSBoxeR since he announced his return. He is now playing StarCraft II at a professional level and has made it to the Round of 4 in GSL (GOMTV Global StarCraft II League) Open Season 2, where he lost 0‚Äì4 to NesTea. However, he would not fare as well in following seasons, even dropping to Code A (the lower GSL League) in March 2011. He formed the StarCraft II clan SlayerS (sls) in November 2010. As well, he is featured in a documentary TV show, 'Boxer's Wings, about his StarCraft career and his transition from StarCraft: Brood War to StarCraft II. In March 2011, SlayerSBoxer's newly formed \\"SlayerS Clan\\" StarCraft II team won the GOMTV Global StarCraft II Team League, just months after their formation, defeating teams Startale, and oGs (Old Generations). They would go on to defeat IM (Incredible Miracle) by 5 games to 4 in a best- of-9 series. The same month SlayerSBoxer was also one of the few Koreans drafted for the North American Star League, a new tournament outside of the Korean StarCraft scene, with a prize pool of $100,000. \\"SlayerS Clan\\" repeated the feat by winning the next GOMTV Global StarCraft II Team League in May 2011, beating the team \\"MVP\\" in the final and proving to be a very consistent team. SlayerSBoxeR returned to the most prestigious Code S tournament on December 22, 2011, for the GSL January 2012 tournament. It was announced on January 25, 2012 that SlayerSBoxeR would be appointed the head playing coach for the team SlayerS.

His shoulder has been hurting for over a year and a half and it had gotten to the point where he could not play more than five games a day. As a result, he has decided to take a break from progaming to rehabilitate, assuring that his break is only temporary.BoxeR forfeits his Code A match (Translated) On August 16, 2012, it was announced that BoxeR would be leaving SlayerS and re-joining SKT1 as a StarCraft II team coach.

Zerg) against Im Yoona at the top-floor cafeteria of the SM Entertainment office in Chungdamdong to promote the gaming-related capability of Intel computers. It was confirmed that the two exchanged autographs, including Yoona signing BoxeR's keyboard. The commercial was pulled from Korean TV when Intel execs realized that their gameplay footage was a replay of one of BoxeR's earlier televised matches.Girls' Generation Visual Life Filming Details (Soshified.com) Lim currently holds a position as a public promotional director at a Korean mobile game company Me2on, the company that sponsors Lim's professional poker player career.

Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. . According to the Geographic Names Information System, it is also known as the Hundred and Two River, and MoDOT simply uses 102 River. According to the National Atlas the river begins northwest of Hopkins, Missouri, at the confluence of the East Fork One Hundred and Two River and the Middle Fork One Hundred and Two River. It is joined southwest of Hopkins by the West Fork One Hundred and Two River. All three of the forks originate in Iowa. At Bolckow, MO, the river has a mean annual discharge of 605 cubic feet per second.https://waterdata.usgs.gov/mo/nwis/annual/?format=sites_selection_links&search;_site_no=06820410&agency;_cd=USGS&referred_module=sw  Origin of name  The beginning point of the Sullivan Line (the Missouri- Iowa border) is near Sheridan, Missouri, and is exactly 100 miles north of the confluence of the Missouri River and Kansas River (north of Kaw Point in Kansas City, Missouri). From that point, the Sullivan Line was surveyed east to the Des Moines River in 1816, and it was extended west in 1836 during the Platte Purchase, when Native American territory was purchased by the federal government and annexed to Missouri. The Sullivan Line was used as the starting point for surveys in western Missouri, and the Missouri portion of the One Hundred and Two River is situated entirely within the Platte Purchase area. The three forks of the river cross the western extension of the Sullivan Line at points between 101 and 102 miles north of the Kansas-Missouri confluence. Through the years, writers have speculated on etymologies other than the Sullivan Line coordinates: *Author Homer Croy who chronicled life in Nodaway County speculated that it had something to do with Mormon Trail migration of 1847 in which the river was 102 miles from its previous camp.Our Storehouse of Missouri Placenames by Robert Lee Ramsey, 1973, p. 7 These coordinates do not fit the coordinates for Mount Pisgah (Iowa) which is less than 100 miles from the river although they would be close in relation to the distance from Hopkins to Kanesville, Iowa which was the outfitting point for the Mormon Trail. Another version of this story says that Brigham Young told his followers that the river was the 102nd they had crossed since leaving Nauvoo. *Robert L. Ramsay who wrote etymologies for the names of many place names in Missouri speculated it was English translation for the earlier French name Rivi√®re Cent Deux, this in turn being a corruption of the Osage √áondse, meaning 'Upland Forest'Our Storehouse of Missouri Placenames by Robert Lee Ramsey, 1973, p. 9 (however the traditional area of Osage control was well south of the 102 River). Headwaters and course The three forks of the river rise in Iowa: *The West Fork One Hundred and Two River rises near Corning in Adams County and flows generally southwardly through Taylor County, collecting streams known as the West and Middle Branches of the One Hundred and Two River. *The Middle Fork One Hundred and Two River rises near Sharpsburg in Taylor County, and flows generally south-southwestardly, past the town of Gravity. *The East Fork One Hundred and Two River rises near Lenox in Taylor County and flows generally southwestwardly, past the towns of Conway and Bedford. Each of the forks enters Nodaway County, Missouri, from Taylor County, Iowa, and converge near the town of Hopkins. From this confluence the One Hundred and Two River flows generally southwardly, through Nodaway, Andrew and Buchanan Counties, past the towns of Arkoe, Barnard, Maryville, and Rosendale, in a heavily channelized streambed. It joins the Platte River 6 mi (9.7 km) east of St. Joseph.

He was acting commandant of the second convict settlement at Norfolk Island, the commandant of the Moreton Bay penal settlement at Brisbane, the first police magistrate at Geelong, and commissioner of crown lands for the Portland Bay pastoral district in the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. He is the great-great-grandfather of actor Sam Neill.Pacific with Sam Neill, ep. 4, min. 38. Early life Fyans was baptised at Clontarf, Dublin and joined the British Army in 1810, seeing service in the Peninsula War. From 1817 he served in India. Norfolk Island In 1833 Fyans joined the 4th Regiment of Foot at Sydney, New South Wales, and was posted to Norfolk Island as captain of the guard. In January 1834 an abortive mutiny led by John Knatchbull resulted in nine deaths and many wounded, and led to the recall of the commandant, James Morisset. As the next senior officer, Fyans acted until the new commandant arrived. He treated the mutineers harshly, keeping them locked in jail for many months in irons, and inflicting mass floggings - earning the nickname ‚ÄòFlogger‚Äô Fyans. He regarded the convict settlement there as ‚Äúa disgrace to England‚Äù and tried to replace slackness by strict control. The penal settlement was described as \\"hell upon earth\\" by one convict.  Moreton Bay penal settlement  After returning from Norfolk Island, Fyans wanted a civil service appointment, but none were availablable, so was Fyans was assigned to be the commandant of the Moreton Bay convict settlement from 1835 to 1837, when a civil service appointment became available. Port Phillip District He sold his commission in 1837, sailed for the fledgling town of Melbourne in the Port Phillip District (later the colony of Victoria), and took up the post of police magistrate at Geelong after the settlers there had asked the government for protection. He established himself on the Moorabool River at the site of present-day Fyansford, and set about the task of siting the town of Geelong. This involved building a breakwater in Corio Bay to provide a sheltered harbour that became the premier wool-exporting port of the colony. With convict labour he constructed the rock ford across the Barwon River in 1837, which gave name to the area now known as Breakwater, an eastern industrial and residential suburb of Geelong. The ford stopped the inflow of salt water to the fresh water river, thus supplying the town with fresh river water. The Fyansford Hotel is located nearby to the site of Fyan's first camp. In 1839 Fyans was ordered to Portland to investigate claims of ‚Äúinterference with native women‚Äù by ex- convict shepherds employed by squatters (pastoralists) the Henty Brothers, a revenge killing by Aboriginal people, and the subsequent shooting of a number of Aboriginal people, women as well as men, by a Henty raiding party. He found that the accusations against the Henty brothers were false, and they were appointed as magistrates in the district. (see Bassett, pp. 444‚Äì7). In 1840 he was appointed as commissioner of crown lands for the Portland Bay district, an area half the size of England. With the support of sixteen troopers, his duties included making government returns for the licensed runs and their occupants, receiving their annual ¬£10 licence fee and maintaining law and order between the squatters and the Aboriginals. While he considered himself a \\"friend to the natives\\", when referring to the investigation and capture of aboriginals for trial he wrote to Charles La trobe: > Its a difficult thing to apprehend natives, with great risk of life on both > sides. On the Grange, and many parts of the country, it would be impossible > to take them; and in my opinion, the only plan to bring them to a fit and > proper state is to insist on the gentlemen in the country to protect their > property, and to deal with such useless savages on the spot. In 1842, following pressure from squatters of the Port Fairy area, Charles Latrobe sent Fyans and the Australian native police to quell the conflict known as the Eumeralla wars. Described by Kiddle as ‚Äúa man of hasty temper and a high hand‚Äù his word was law in the district. He ran his own cattle station west of Lake Colac, later selling this and settling in Geelong in 1845. Foster Fyans Later life In January 1843 Fyans married Elizabeth Alice Cane, and they had two daughters and a son. His wife died in March 1858, aged 42. In 1849 he was reappointed police magistrate and was nominated as the inaugural mayor of the Geelong Town Council. Following the discovery of gold in Victoria he retired in 1853, and began to write his recollections. He died at his Geelong home ‚ÄòBalyang‚Äô on 23 May 1870.
