The title track deals with the Siege of Lathom House in 1644, during the English Civil War, during which Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby, held out for four months against Parliamentarian efforts to take the house. The album, the band's 18th studio album, was released in 2004. The album is perhaps most noteworthy for the return of Maddy Prior, the band's most central member, who had departed the band in 1996. Returning with Prior was her husband, Rick Kemp, who had not performed with the band since its 12th album, although both Prior and Kemp had performed on Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span, an album that re-recorded versions of songs from earlier albums. Gay Woods, who had replaced Prior for two albums, departed at the same time. New to the band with this album was guitarist Ken Nicol, while drummer Liam Genockey, who had played on Time, returned. Longtime violinist Peter Knight rounded out the group. Highlights of the album include 'Van Diemen's Land', a song about poaching and deportation to what would eventually be called Tasmania; 'Heir of Linne', a classic ballad of riches lost and regained, and 'Child Owlet', another traditional ballad whose gruesomeness is underlined by Prior's powerful vocals. The album also contains the band's shortest song ever, a 40-second version of 'Bede's Death Song', an early medieval poem attributed to the 8th century monk. In the original version of 'Van Diemen's Land', the narrator is a man, but Prior reworked the lyrics to make the narrator a woman The album received very mixed reviews. Some critics saw it as a return to form after several less-satisfying albums, and attributed the band's revival to Prior's return. Others saw the album as representing a continuing decline of the band, attributing it to the aging of the band's core members, and noting that Prior's voice, while still strong and effective on songs like 'Van Dieman's Land' and 'Child Owlet', does not seem to have its top range any more.

The NCAM is composed of a large number of parallel nanocapillaries, each of which have a pore radius, a/2, which is approximately the same size as the Debye length, Œ∫‚àí1. The electrical double layer is characterized by a counter-ion distribution, N, which is largest at the pore wall and decays toward the center of the pore. Nanofluidics is the study of the behavior, manipulation, and control of fluids that are confined to structures of nanometer (typically 1‚Äì100 nm) characteristic dimensions (1 nm = 10‚àí9 m). Fluids confined in these structures exhibit physical behaviors not observed in larger structures, such as those of micrometer dimensions and above, because the characteristic physical scaling lengths of the fluid, (e.g. Debye length, hydrodynamic radius) very closely coincide with the dimensions of the nanostructure itself. When structures approach the size regime corresponding to molecular scaling lengths, new physical constraints are placed on the behavior of the fluid. For example, these physical constraints induce regions of the fluid to exhibit new properties not observed in bulk, e.g. vastly increased viscosity near the pore wall; they may effect changes in thermodynamic properties and may also alter the chemical reactivity of species at the fluid-solid interface. A particularly relevant and useful example is displayed by electrolyte solutions confined in nanopores that contain surface charges, i.e. at electrified interfaces, as shown in the nanocapillary array membrane (NCAM) in the accompanying figure. All electrified interfaces induce an organized charge distribution near the surface known as the electrical double layer. In pores of nanometer dimensions the electrical double layer may completely span the width of the nanopore, resulting in dramatic changes in the composition of the fluid and the related properties of fluid motion in the structure. For example, the drastically enhanced surface-to-volume ratio of the pore results in a preponderance of counter-ions (i.e. ions charged oppositely to the static wall charges) over co-ions (possessing the same sign as the wall charges), in many cases to the near-complete exclusion of co-ions, such that only one ionic species exists in the pore. This can be used for manipulation of species with selective polarity along the pore length to achieve unusual fluidic manipulation schemes not possible in micrometer and larger structures.  Theory  In 1965, Rice and Whitehead published the seminal contribution to the theory of the transport of electrolyte solutions in long (ideally infinite) nanometer-diameter capillaries. Briefly, the potential, œï, at a radial distance, r, is given by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, :\\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{d}{dr}\\\\left (r \\\\frac{d\\\\phi}{dr} \\\\right )= \\\\kappa^2 \\\\phi, where Œ∫ is the inverse Debye length, :\\\\kappa = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{8\\\\pi n e^2}{\\\\epsilon k T}}, determined by the ion number density, n, the dielectric constant, Œµ, the Boltzmann constant, k, and the temperature, T. Knowing the potential, œÜ(r), the charge density can then be recovered from the Poisson equation, whose solution may be expressed as a modified Bessel function of the first kind, I0, and scaled to the capillary radius, a. An equation of motion under combined pressure and electrically-driven flow can then be written, :\\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{d}{dr} \\\\left (r \\\\frac{d v_z}{dr} \\\\right )= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\frac{dp}{dz} - \\\\frac{F_z}{\\\\eta}, where Œ∑ is the viscosity, dp/dz is the pressure gradient, and Fz is the body force driven by the action of the applied electric field, Ez, on the net charge density in the double layer. When there is no applied pressure, the radial distribution of the velocity is given by, :v_z\\\\left (r \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon \\\\phi_0}{4 \\\\pi \\\\eta} E_z \\\\left [ 1 - \\\\frac {I_0 \\\\left ( \\\\kappa r \\\\right )} {I_0 \\\\left ( \\\\kappa a \\\\right )} \\\\right ]. From the equation above, it follows that fluid flow in nanocapillaries is governed by the Œ∫a product, that is, the relative sizes of the Debye length and the pore radius. By adjusting these two parameters and the surface charge density of the nanopores, fluid flow can be manipulated as desired. Despite the fact that nanofluidics gives rise to entirely new phenomena in comparison to ordinary large-scale fluid mechanics, it is possible to develop a fundamental continuum theory governing momentum transport in isotropic nanofluidic systems. This theory, which extends the classical Navier‚àíStokes equation, shows excellent agreement with computer simulations of systems on the nanometer length.  Fabrication  field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with a focused ion beam (FIB). Nanofluidic channels fabricated with a Zeiss Crossbeam 550 L, in a silicon master stamp Nanostructures can be fabricated as single cylindrical channels, nanoslits, or nanochannel arrays from materials such as silicon, glass, polymers (e.g. PMMA, PDMS, PCTE) and synthetic vesicles. Standard photolithography, bulk or surface micromachining, replication techniques (embossing, printing, casting and injection molding), and nuclear track or chemical etching, are commonly used to fabricate structures which exhibit characteristic nanofluidic behavior.  Applications  Because of the small size of the fluidic conduits, nanofluidic structures are naturally applied in situations demanding that samples be handled in exceedingly small quantities, including Coulter counting, analytical separations and determinations of biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA , and facile handling of mass-limited samples. One of the more promising areas of nanofluidics is its potential for integration into microfluidic systems, i.e. micrototal analytical systems or lab-on-a-chip structures. For instance, NCAMs, when incorporated into microfluidic devices, can reproducibly perform digital switching, allowing transfer of fluid from one microfluidic channel to another, selectivity separate and transfer analytes by size and mass, mix reactants efficiently, and separate fluids with disparate characteristics. In addition, there is a natural analogy between the fluid handling capabilities of nanofluidic structures and the ability of electronic components to control the flow of electrons and holes. This analogy has been used to realize active electronic functions such as rectification and field-effect and bipolar transistor action with ionic currents. Application of nanofluidics is also to nano-optics for producing tuneable microlens array Nanofluidics have had a significant impact in biotechnology, medicine and clinical diagnostics with the development of lab-on-a-chip devices for PCR and related techniques . Attempts have been made to understand the behaviour of flowfields around nanoparticles in terms of fluid forces as a function of Reynolds and Knudsen number using computational fluid dynamics . The relationship between lift, drag and Reynolds number has been shown to differ dramatically at the nanoscale compared with macroscale fluid dynamics.  Challenges  There are a variety of challenges associated with the flow of liquids through carbon nanotubes and nanopipes. A common occurrence is channel blocking due to large macromolecules in the liquid. Also, any insoluble debris in the liquid can easily clog the tube. A solution for this researchers are hoping to find is a low friction coating or channel materials that help reduce the blocking of the tubes. Also, large polymers, including biologically relevant molecules such as DNA, often fold in vivo, causing blockages. Typical DNA molecules from a virus have lengths of approx. 100‚Äì200 kilobases and will form a random coil of the radius some 700 nm in aqueous solution at 20%. This is also several times greater than the pore diameter of even large carbon pipes and two orders of magnitude the diameter of a single walled carbon nanotube.

It is the molecular basis for a variety of light-sensing systems from phototaxis in flagellates to eyesight in animals. Retinylidene proteins include all forms of opsin and rhodopsin (in the broad sense). While rhodopsin in the narrow sense refers to a dim-light visual pigment found in vertebrates, usually on rod cells, rhodopsin in the broad sense (as used here) refers any molecule consisting of an opsin and a retinal chromophore in the ground state. When activated by light, the chromophore is isomerized, at which point the molecule as a whole is no longer rhodopsin, but a related molecule such as metarhodopsin. However, it remains a retinylidene protein. The chromophore then separates from the opsin, at which point the bare opsin is a retinylidene protein. Thus, the molecule remains a retinylidene protein throughout the phototransduction cycle.  Structure  All rhodopsins consist of two building blocks, a protein moiety and a reversibly covalently bound non-protein cofactor, retinal (retinaldehyde). The protein structure of rhodopsin consists of a bundle of seven transmembrane helices that form an internal pocket binding the photoreactive chromophore. They form a superfamily with other membrane-bound receptors containing seven transmembrane domains, for example odor and chemokine receptors.  Mechanism of light reception  Instead of being activated by binding chemical ligands like their relatives, rhodopsins contain retinal which changes conformation in reaction to light via photoisomerization and thus are activated by light. The retinal molecule can take on several different cis-trans isomeric forms, such as all-trans, 11-cis and 13-cis. Photoisomerization (light-dependent isomerization) of retinal from cis to trans or vice versa induces a conformational change in the receptor protein. This change acts as a molecular switch to activate a signal transduction mechanism within the cell. Depending on the type of rhodopsin, it either opens an ion channel (for example in bacteria) or activates an associated G protein and triggers a second messenger cascade (for example in animal eyes).  Types of rhodopsins  Retinylidene proteins or rhodopsins are present in many species from bacteria to algae and animals. They can be divided into two distinct groups based on their sequence as well as the retinal isomer they contain at the ground state and their signal transduction mechanisms.  Ion channels and pumps  Rhodopsins found in prokaryotes and algae commonly contain an all-trans retinal isomer at the ground state that isomerizes to 13-cis upon light activation, also known as microbial-type chromophore. Examples are bacterial sensory rhodopsins, channelrhodopsin, bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and proteorhodopsin. They act as light-gated ion channels and can be further distinguished by the type of ion they channel. Bacteriorhodopsin functions as a proton pump, whereas halorhodopsin act as a chloride pump. Their functions range from bacterial photosynthesis (bacteriorhodopsin) to driving phototaxis (channelrhodopsins in flagellates). Signal transduction in phototaxis involves depolarization of the cell membrane.  G protein-coupled receptors  The retinylidene proteins of the animal kingdom are also referred to as opsins. Vertebrates contain five subfamilies of (rhod)opsins and arthropods three subfamilies.G Protein-Coupled Receptor Data Base Opsins belong to the class of G protein-coupled receptors and bind an 11-cis isomer of retinal at the ground state that photoisomerizes to an all-trans retinal upon light activation. They are commonly found in the light-sensing organs, for example in the photoreceptor cells of vertebrate retina where they facilitate eyesight. Animal opsins can also be found in the skin of amphibians, the pineal glands of lizards and birds, the hypothalamus of toads, and the human brain. They can be categorized into several distinct classes including: *visual opsins (classical rhodopsin and relatives), *melanopsins *peropsins *neuropsins *encephalopsins = Visual perception = The \\"visual purple\\" rhodopsin (opsin-2) of the rod cells in the vertebrate retina absorbs green-blue light. The photopsins of the cone cells of the retina differ in a few amino acids resulting in a shift of their light absorption spectra. The three human photopsins absorb yellowish-green (photopsin I), green (photopsin II), and bluish-violet (photopsin III) light and are the basis of color vision, whereas the more light-sensitive \\"visual purple\\" is responsible for the monochromatic vision in the dark. Light signal transduction involves an enzyme cascade of G-proteins (transducin), cGMP phosphodiesterase, closure of a cation channel and ultimately hyperpolarization of the visual photoreceptor cell. The visual rhodopsins of arthropods and molluscs differ from the vertebrate proteins in their signal transduction cascade involving G-proteins, phospholipase C, and ultimately depolarization of the visual photoreceptor cell. = Others = Other opsins found in humans include encephalopsin (or panopsin, opsin-3), melanopsin (opsin-4), neuropsin (opsin-5) and peropsin. Melanopsin is involved in the light entrainment of the circadian clock in vertebrates. Encephalopsins and neuropsins are highly expressed in nerve cells and brain tissue, but so far their function is unknown. Peropsin binds all-trans retinal (microbial-type chromophore) and might function as a photoisomerase to return retinal to the 11-cis isomer form needed in visual perception.

It is also commonly called online lead generation. Contrary to cost per mille (CPM) and cost per click (CPC) pricing models, where advertisers are charged for impressions (a.k.a. \\"views\\") and clicks, respectively, in a CPL pricing model advertisers pay only for a qualified sign-up regardless of how many impressions or clicks their advertisement receives. CPL advertising enables advertisers to generate guaranteed returns on their online advertising money. Difference between CPL and CPA advertising In CPL campaigns, advertisers pay for an interested lead ‚Äì i.e. the contact information of a person interested in the advertiser's product or service. CPL campaigns are suitable for brand marketers and direct response marketers looking to engage consumers at multiple touchpoints ‚Äì by building a newsletter list, community site, reward program or member acquisition program. In Cost per action campaigns (CPA), the advertiser typically pays for a completed sale involving a credit card transaction. CPA is all about 'now' ‚Äì it focuses on driving consumers to buy at that exact moment. If a visitor to the website does not buy anything, there is no easy way to remarket to them. There are other important differentiators: * CPL campaigns are advertiser-centric. The advertiser remains in control of their brand, selecting trusted and contextually relevant publishers to run their offers. On the other hand, CPA and affiliate marketing campaigns are publisher-centric. Advertisers cede control over where their brand will appear, as publishers browse offers and pick which to run on their websites. Advertisers generally do not know where their offer is running. * CPL campaigns are usually high volume and light-weight. In CPL campaigns, consumers submit only basic contact information. The transaction can be as simple as an email address. On the other hand, CPA campaigns are usually low volume and complex. Typically, consumer has to submit credit card and other detailed information. CPL advertising is more appropriate for advertisers looking to deploy acquisition campaigns by re-marketing to end consumers through e-newsletters, community sites, reward programs, loyalty programs and other engagement vehicles.

Ashliman, \\"The Grimm Brothers' Children's and Household Tales (Grimms' Fairy Tales)\\" Synopsis A childless queen prayed for a child. An angel told her she would have a son with the power of wishing. She had such a son, and every day went with the child to a park where wild beasts were kept. There she washed herself in a stream. One day, a cook stole the child and stained the queen's clothing with hen's blood; then he accused the queen of having let the child be eaten. The queen was imprisoned in a tower to starve, but angels were sent to feed her. The cook, afraid of being caught, had the prince wish for a castle and a little girl as a companion; they lived there, but the cook grew afraid that the boy would wish for his father and reveal his crime, and told the girl, who had grown to a maiden, that she must murder the boy while he slept and cut out his heart and tongue. The girl refused to murder someone so innocent, but the cook threatened to kill her the next day if she didn't obey. She killed a hind and cut out its heart and tongue; then she had the boy hide in the bed. The cook asked about the murder, and the boy got out of the bed and turned him into a poodle for his betrayal. The boy wished to go home. The girl was frightened at the thought of the journey, so the boy turned her into a pink (or carnation) and went home, with the poodle running after and the pink in his pocket. He went to his mother, who at first took him for the angels who fed her; he assured her he would free her. Then he worked as a huntsman for his own father. He hunted so much game that the king insisted that the huntsman sit by him at the feast. During the feast the boy reveals he is the king's son and that the cook was behind the evil plan all along. He changed the cook back into his own shape, and the king had him executed; he changed the pink back into the maiden, and because she had brought him up so tenderly and refused to murder him, the king sanctioned their marriage. The queen was freed, but refused to eat, because angels, having supported her, would now deliver her. She died three days later, and the king died of grief, but the prince married the maiden and they ruled the kingdom together.

He was the first bishop of the Diocese of Davenport in the state of Iowa from 1881 to 1883. Biography=Early life John McMullen was born in Ballynahinch, County Down, Ireland, to James and Alice (Fitzsimmons) McMullen, and was one of ten children. When he was a little more than a year old his family immigrated to Canada. In 1837 they moved to Ogdensburg, New York, and eventually they moved to Chicago. He was educated in the public school district and then parochial schools. He did his secondary and undergraduate studies at the University of St. Mary of the Lake in Chicago, graduating in 1852. He studied for the priesthood at the College of the Propaganda and the Urban College in Rome where he was also awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree. Ministry in Chicago Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago was built by Father John McMullen after the Chicago Fire of 1871. McMullen was ordained to the priesthood in Rome on June 20, 1858, for the Diocese of Chicago. Archbishop Antonio Ligi-Bussi, O.F.M. Conv., was the ordaining prelate. He served the diocese, and later archdiocese, for 25 years. He was initially assigned as an assistant at St. Mary's Cathedral. During this time he helped to establish the House of the Good Shepherd, which cared for women who had been prostitutes, as well as orphanages for both boys and girls. He would go door to door to beg for money to support the institutions. He was well known at the Cook County jail and Bridewell, a house of corrections. In addition to visiting the inmates, he would bring newspapers, periodicals and books. He was known for his friendly demeanor and concern. From 1861 to 1866 McMullen served as president of the University of St. Mary of the Lake, during which time new facilities were built for the school. In 1865 he established the short-lived Catholic Monthly magazine while at the school. Unfortunately, the school suffered from a lack of finances and all but the seminary department was closed in 1866. He then founded St. Louis and St. Paul's parishes in Chicago. McMullen accompanied Bishop James Duggan as one of his theologians to the Second Council of Baltimore. In 1868 he was sent to the Holy See to represent the interests of the priests of Chicago after Bishop Duggan's mental illness became evident. He was named the pastor of St. Rose of Lima parish in Wilmington, Illinois, and started a new parish in Braidwood. He was named pastor of the Church of the Holy Name in Chicago and had just spent $19,000 on renovations when the Great Chicago Fire struck the city on October 8, 1871. Every structure McMullen had built in the city was destroyed. Once Father McMullen looked after his parishioners, he and other priests of the diocese traveled across the country and into Canada to raise funds to rebuild Chicago's churches, and to help the multitudes who were left homeless. He then built the present Holy Name Cathedral, which was consecrated on November 21, 1875. In 1877 he was named vicar general by Bishop Thomas Foley. After Bishop Foley's death he was named administrator of the diocese, and was renamed vicar general after the arrival of Archbishop Patrick Feehan. Bishop of Davenport McMullen Hall at St. Ambrose University On June 14, 1881, McMullen was appointed the first bishop of the newly created Diocese of Davenport. He was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Feehan on July 25, 1881, in Holy Name Cathedral. The principal co-consecrators were Bishops John Hennessy of Dubuque and John Lancaster Spalding of Peoria. Bishop McMullen chose St. Margaret's Church in Davenport to be his new cathedral and with zeal set to work to establish the new diocese. He was known for his simplicity of life. He did not own his own episcopal insignia or robes, but used those of the late Bishop Foley. Soon after arriving in Davenport he set out on a visitation of his diocese. He traveled by stagecoach, buggy, lumber wagon, hand car and passenger coach on the train. While on visitation he administered the sacrament of Confirmation. By December 1881 he confirmed over 7,000 people, and by the end of 1882, the number rose to 13,000. McMullen called the diocese's first synod in 1882 to set procedures and regulations for the new diocese. In September of the same year, he founded St. Ambrose, a seminary and school of commerce, for young men. Bishop McMullen's health soon failed, however. To try to find relief from his sufferings he attempted a trip to Rome, but only made it as far as New York. He also traveled to California where he fell gravely ill. A couple of months after his return to Davenport he died from stomach cancer after serving the diocese for a little less than two years. Archbishop Feehan celebrated the Requiem Mass and Bishop Spalding preached the sermon. He was initially buried in the crypt of St. Margaret's Cathedral, and then his body was transferred to the crypt of Sacred Heart Cathedral after it was built. Finally, he and the other bishops who had been buried in the crypt were transferred to the Bishop's Circle of Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Davenport. Legacy Both Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago and Saint Ambrose University in Davenport stand as monuments to his zeal. McMullen Hall, a classroom building at St. Ambrose, was named in his honor.

Currently, Tchaenhotep is on display at the Kentucky Science Center in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. The meaning of her name is 'the one who is content.' Tchaenhotep lived somewhere between c. 1069 BC and c. 664 BC. Tchaenhotep died at an early age between 25‚Äì35 years old. She was one of eight in her family to be buried in the famous Valley of the Queens. At the time of her death the valley was no longer used for royal burials. She was buried along with forty-two other mummies. Tchaenhotep‚Äôs tomb was located by Italian Egyptologist Ernesto Schiaparellia in 1903. A dig that was commissioned by the Egyptian government. Schiaparellia was noted to have also discovered Queen Nefertari‚Äôs tomb in Deir el-Medina in the Valley of the Queens. The catalogue number 2-2-1 is painted on the bottom of Tchaenhotep‚Äôs coffin.

Also included in the Varanoidea are the Lanthanotidae (earless monitor lizards), and the extinct Palaeovaranidae. Throughout their long evolutionary history, varanoids have exhibited great diversity, both in habitat and form. This superfamily includes the largest- known terrestrial lizard, Megalania (5‚Äì6 meters), and the largest extant lizard, the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis, 3+ meters). Evolution Fossil of a parasaniwid Either synonymous with, or a subgroup of, the group Platynota, the varanoids first appear in the fossil record in the latter part of Early Cretaceous, but possible varanoid ancestors have been traced back as far as Early Jurassic times. Among the earliest known varanoids are the monitor-like necrosaurids Palaeosaniwa canadensis from the Campanian (roughly 71-82 mya) of North America and Estesia mongoliensis and Telmasaurus grangeri, both from the Campanian of Mongolia. Varanoids survived the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event and flourished worldwide during the Cenozoic Era. Current evidence strongly suggests that snakes evolved from an aquatic or burrowing varanoid ancestor, though much debate continues over precisely which lineage of varanoids. Carroll characterises the varanoids as \\"the most advanced of all lizards in achieving large size and an active, predaceous way of life\\". Some taxa, such as the extinct necrosaurids and the possibly varanoid Gila monsters, were armoured with osteoderms (bony deposits on the skin), and many forms have hinged jaws, allowing them to open their mouths very wide when feeding (though they cannot dislocate their jaws, contrary to popular belief).Carroll, R.

He played two seasons in the Netherlands, eight in the North American Soccer League and twelve in the Major Indoor Soccer League. Europe Willrich, a native of Koblenz, Germany, began playing club soccer and played professionally in his home country before joining Dutch First Division club PSV Eindhoven during the 1977‚Äì1978 season. That season Eindhoven won the UEFA Cup, but Willrich made only three first team appearances. San Diego Sockers In 1978, Willrich moved to the United States and signed with the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League (NASL). The Sockers had played the 1977 NASL season as the Las Vegas Quicksilvers before moving to San Diego and changing its name to the Sockers. In 1979 and 1980, the Sockers negotiated a deal with the M√©xico Primera Divisi√≥n (First Division) Association football club UNAM Pumas to exchange players during the offseason. The Mexican league played in the fall, winter and early spring while the NASL played in the spring and summer. As part of this exchange, Willrich spent time with UNAM in 1979 and 1980. During its years playing outdoor soccer in the NASL, the Sockers were a decent, but not dominant team. The NASL introduced an indoor soccer season in 1979‚Äì80, however San Diego did not participate. The following indoor season 1980‚Äì81, was the Sockers' first. That year they failed to qualify for the playoffs but the next year (1981‚Äì82, they swept to the championship. The NASL decided against an indoor season in 1982‚Äì1983 so, at the completion of the NASL outdoor season in 1982, the Sockers jumped to Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) where it again won the 1982‚Äì83 MISL championship. The next year (1983‚Äì84), the NASL ran its last indoor season and the Sockers took that title as well. Willrich was named MVP of the 1984 Indoor Championship Series having scored 7 goals in the three-game sweep of New York. At the end of the 1984 outdoor season, the NASL collapsed and the Sockers moved permanently to MISL. Willrich remained with the Sockers through all this, growing into a powerful and reliable forward. In his first season with the team, he scored nine goals in thirty games. While that was a decent number, he blossomed when playing indoors. During the Sockers run to the 1980‚Äì1981 NASL indoor title, Willrich was second in team scoring with sixteen goals. He continued to enjoy a scoring touch as he helped the Sockers to 6 consecutive indoor titles through the 1987‚Äì1988 season. The San Diego Sockers inducted Willrich into its Hall of Fame. Wichita Wings He also played with the Wichita Wings from 1990 to 1992. U.S. Olympic team While with the Sockers, Willrich gained his U.S. citizenship. In 1984, he was selected for the U.S. Olympic soccer team which competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In the first game, against Costa Rica, Willrich both scored and assisted on a goal in the U.S. victory. Despite this achievement, he was never called up to the full U.S. national team.

Loudermilk in 1960 that was a hit for The Nashville Teens in 1964 and has since become a standard across several musical genres. Loudermilk original Originally framed as a folk song, \\"Tobacco Road\\" was a semi-autobiographical tale of growing up in Durham, North Carolina. Released on Columbia Records, it was not a hit for Loudermilk, achieving only minor chart success in Australia. Other artists, however, immediately began recording and performing the song. Nashville Teens hit The English group The Nashville Teens' garage rock/blues rock rendering was a bold effort featuring prominent piano, electric guitar, and bass drum parts and a dual lead vocal. Mickie Most produced it with the same tough-edged-pop feel that he brought to The Animals' hits. \\"Tobacco Road\\" was a trans-Atlantic pop hit in 1964, reaching number 6 on the UK singles chart and number 14 on the U.S. singles chart. While the Teens would have some further success in the UK, in the U.S. \\"Tobacco Road\\" became another one-hit wonder of the British Invasion. Later versions and uses In the 1970s, songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman claimed to have been inspired by \\"Tobacco Road\\" while writing The Sweet's \\"Blockbuster\\", after accusations of stealing the guitar riff from David Bowie's \\"Jean Genie\\". The song became a hit for Edgar Winter on his debut album Entrance and he plays a 17-minute live version of the song on the double LP Roadwork from 1972. \\"Tobacco Road\\" has been performed by a great number of other artists, often with slightly altered lyrics. In the late 1960s, the song became a staple of the Jackson 5's early shows, and was one of the four songs they performed at their audition for Motown Records in 1968. On 1 February 1966, Lou Rawls performed the song as a medley with \\"Southside Blues\\", which was included on his album Live!. Blues harmonica player Junior Wells (with Buddy Guy on lead guitar) recorded the song in 1968 for his Coming At You album on Vanguard. In 1970 it was a Polydor hit by Eric Burdon & War in an abbreviated version. The MGM album version runs for 14 minutes. Later, after they disbanded, they released another version featured on many compilations. Eric Burdon released some live recordings on \\"Access All Areas\\", \\"Official Live Bootleg #2\\", \\"Athens Traffic Live\\". An 11-minute live version from the early 1980s was released later. The former lead singer of Van Halen, David Lee Roth, recorded the song in 1985 for the studio album \\"Eat 'Em And Smile\\" (and the Spanish vocal version, \\"Sonrisa Salvaje\\"). It includes a cover of Tobacco Road (Spanish title, La Calle de Tabaco). The song features Steve Vai on guitar,and has a much faster tempo. Serbian super-group Smak played a 15-minute version of this song during their concerts in late seventies, in Eric Burdon style. In 1992 they held concerts in Belgrade and recorded and released their 12-minute version on odLIVEno. Roy Clark included the song on his 1986 album Rockin' in the Country. His version peaked at number 56 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The song is also covered by hip-hop duo dead prez in the intro of \\"Psychology\\" on their debut album Let's Get Free.

The yellow lines indicate international borders. :For the Moroccan-born German footballer, see Mimoun Azaouagh The Azawagh forms the northeastern sections of the Niger River basin, although today the Azawagh river is long dry and the area is fed by seasonal underground rivers at best. The Azawagh (alias Azaouagh or Azawak) is a dry basin covering what is today northwestern Niger, as well as parts of northeastern Mali and southern Algeria.Paris (1995): p. 250. The Azawagh is mainly made up of Sahelian and Saharan flatlands and has a population that is predominantly Tuareg, with some Arabic-speaking, Bouzou and Wodaabe minorities and a recent influx of Hausa and Zarma.  Name  The Tuareg word azawa…£ means \\"savannah\\". Azawad, a term used for the portion of northern Mali claimed by the Tuareg rebel movement National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, is believed to be an Arabic corruption of \\"Azawagh\\".  Geography  The Azawagh refers to the dry structural basin, which once carried a northern tributary of the Niger river, the Azawagh river, known as Dallol Bosso further south. The river, which ran some in prehistoric times, dried up after the Neolithic Subpluvial and created a basin of some . Its valley, which geologists call the Iullemmeden Basin, is bordered by the Hoggar Mountains and their foothills in the north, the A√Ør Mountains in the east, and the Adrar des Ifoghas in the west.Paris (1995), p. 228. The bedrock of the region is Cretaceous/Paleocene limestone and clay, which was cut by erosion and covered by aeolian sand in the Upper Pleistocene.Paris (1995), p. 229-30. In ecological terms, the Azawagh basin is divided into, from north to south, a Saharian, a Sahelian and a northern Sudanese (referring to the geographic region) zone. In Niger, Azawagh generally includes the towns of Abalagh (Abalak), In Tibaraden (Tchin-Tabaraden), Tiliya, In Gal and Tabalaq, a village where the sole lake of the region is located. History Human occupation of the Azawagh has been dated back to 4500 BCE, with evidence of cattle-raising beginning 3200 BCE. From this period until roughly 1500 BCE, the region also supported large fauna, including waterbuck, hippopotami, and elephants.Paris (1995), p. 247. Evidence of copper-working has been found at Tekebrine dating to 1600 BCE. At around this time, climatic conditions worsened, and the Sudanese peoples of the region were replaced by Berbers who constructed tumuli. Islam reached the Western A√Ør Mountains via southwest Libya in the eighth century.Paris (1995), p. 238. The region was invaded and colonized by the French in the early twentieth century.Popenoe (2003), p. 15. Following the independence movements of Algeria, Mali, and Niger, and the corresponding departure of the French, the region became divided between these three nations. During the 1970s and 1980s, a series of droughts forced increasing numbers of the region's nomadic population into villages and towns.Popenoe (2003), p. 17. The droughts also sparked a rebellion by the region's Tuareg population, with groups such as Front for the Liberation of A√Ør and Azaouak and the Front for the Liberation of Tamoust rebelling against the Nigerien government, while the Arab Islamic Front of Azawad, Popular Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, Revolutionary Liberation Army of Azawad, and the Popular Liberation Front of Azawad opposed the government of Mali.  Population  Despite being the size of Austria, the Nigerien portion of the Azawagh had a population of only 85,000 as of 2003.Popenoe (2003), p. 13. The area is dominated by the Kel Tamashek peoples, as well as some nomadic Arab-ancestry tribes including Hassaniyya-speakers (also called Azawagh Arabs, not to be confused with Niger's Diffa Arabs).Popenoe (2003), p. 16-17. The Azawagh is the centre for the Iwellemeden Kel Denneg Federation. The region also has a nomadic population of Wodaabe Fulani and a substantial minority of Bouzou, formerly a Tuareg slave caste. In recent years, a number of Hausa and Zarma have settled in the region, primarily as government officials and traders.

The peasant, Hildebrand, left to get them, and the parson came to his house. But on the way, Hildebrand met his cousin, an egg merchant, who alerted him and brought him to the house in his cart. The parson and the wife began to sing, the merchant sang, and Hildebrand sang that it was enough. He jumped from the basket and beat the parson out of the house.

The Museum inaugurated a branch in Neuqu√©n in 2004. The museum hosts works by Goya, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Rodin, Manet and Chagall among other artists. History The Casa de Bombas building circa 1900, the current location of the museum. Argentine painter and art critic Eduardo Schiaffino, was the first director of the museum, which opened on 25 December 1895, in a building on Florida Street that today houses the Galer√≠as Pac√≠fico shopping mall. In 1909, the museum moved to a building in Plaza San Mart√≠n, originally erected in Paris as the Argentine Pavilion for the 1889 Paris exhibition, and later dismantled and brought to Buenos Aires. In its new home, the museum became part of the International Centenary Exhibition held in Buenos Aires in 1910. Following the demolition of the pavilion in 1932, as part of the remodeling of Plaza San Mart√≠n, the museum was transferred to its present location in 1933, a building originally constructed in 1870 as a drainage pumping station and adapted to its current use by architect Alejandro Bustillo. The museum was modernized both physically and in its collections during the 1955‚Äì64 tenure of director Jorge Romero Brest. A temporary exhibits pavilion opened in 1961, and the museum acquired a large volume of modern art though its collaboration with the Torcuato di Tella Institute, a leading promoter of local, avant-garde artists, and elsewhere; a contemporary Argentine art pavilion opened in 1980. This hall is the largest of 34 currently in use at the museum, which totals of exhibit space. Its permanent collection totals 688 major works and over 12,000 sketches, fragments, potteries, and other minor works. The institution also maintains a specialized library, totaling 150,000 volumes, as well as a public auditorium. The museum commissioned architect Mario Roberto √Ålvarez to design a branch in the Patagonian region city of Neuqu√©n. Inaugurated in 2004, this museum has four exhibit halls totaling and a permanent collection of 215 works, as well as temporary exhibits and a public auditorium. The ground floor of the museum holds 24 exhibit halls housing a fine international collection of paintings from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century, together with the museum's art history library. The first floor's eight exhibit halls contain a collection of paintings by some of the most important 20th-century Argentine painters, including Antonio Berni, Ernesto de la C√°rcova, Benito Quinquela Mart√≠n, Eduardo S√≠vori, Sarah Grilo, Alfredo Guttero, Raquel Forner, Xul Solar, Marcelo Pombo and Lino Enea Spilimbergo. The second floor's two halls, completed in 1984, hold an exhibition of photographs and two sculpture terraces, as well as most of the institution's administrative and technical departments.

Part One is the twenty-fifth and final episode of the sixth season and originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 21, 1995, while Part Two is the season premiere of the seventh season and aired on September 17, 1995. Springfield Elementary School strikes oil, but Mr. Burns steals it and at the same time brings misery to many of Springfield's citizens. Part One has a cliffhanger ending where Mr. Burns is shot by an unidentified assailant. In Part Two, Springfield's police try to find the culprit, with their main suspects being Waylon Smithers and Homer Simpson. Both episodes were written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein; Part One was directed by Jeffrey Lynch and Part Two by Wes Archer. Musician Tito Puente guest stars as himself in both parts. \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" was conceived by series creator Matt Groening and the writing staff decided to turn it into a two-part mystery episode. Part One contains several clues about the identity of the culprit because the writers wanted it to be solvable. The concept for the two-part episode was the episode of the primetime soap opera Dallas titled \\"A House Divided\\", known by most as \\"Who shot J.R.?\\" in which character J. R. Ewing was shot. In the months following the airing of Part One, there was much widespread debate among fans of the series as to who actually shot Mr. Burns and in many ways the public reaction and response to the episode mirrored that of its \\"Who shot J.R.?\\" inspiration. Over the summer of 1995, Fox offered a related contest which was one of the first such endeavors to tie in elements of television and the Internet. Plot=Part One Groundskeeper Willie discovers oil under Springfield Elementary School. Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers accept suggestions from students and staff on how to spend their newfound wealth, including Lisa's suggestion of hiring Tito Puente as a music teacher. Mr. Burns disguises himself as Jimbo Jones and unsuccessfully tries to trick Skinner into selling him the drilling rights to secure an energy monopoly over Springfield. At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer is upset that his boss, Burns, can never remember his name. He takes a suggestion from Marge and sends Burns a box of chocolates with a family picture underneath the candy; however, Burns and Smithers are not interested in the one candy covering Homer's face and discard the box. As a result, Burns writes a \\"thank you\\" card only to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, further angering Homer. Meanwhile, Burns plots to take the school's oil, to which Smithers voices his disapproval. Burns establishes a slant drilling operation and beats the school to tapping the oil well. Mr. Burns's drilling operation causes distress to many Springfield citizens as Willie and Puente are laid off; Moe's Tavern is closed due to the harmful fumes from the drilling, enraging Moe and Barney; the drilling destroys the Springfield Retirement Castle, forcing Grampa to move in with the Simpsons; and Bart's treehouse is destroyed by a burst of oil from the rig, which also injures Santa's Little Helper. Burns reveals to Smithers his grandest scheme: the construction of a giant disc that will permanently block out the sun in Springfield, forcing the residents to continuously use the electricity from his power plant. When Smithers says he has gone too far, Burns fires him. Homer, driven to insanity by Burns not knowing his name, sneaks into his office and spraypaints \\"I am Homer Simpson\\". Burns catches him in the act, but still fails to remember him. In a rage, Homer attacks him and is hauled away by security. All the citizens affected by Burns's schemes, including Homer and even Smithers, swear vengeance. A town meeting is held to discuss Burns's actions. Burns arrives, armed with a gun after his encounter with Homer, and activates the sun-blocking device. He walks into an alley and struggles with someone until a gun fires. Burns stumbles into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since he has angered so many people recently, anyone could have been the shooter. Chief Wiggum sheepishly agrees to start the investigation to find the culprit, leaving the episode on a cliffhanger. Part Two With Burns in the hospital, the Springfield police search for his assailant. Smithers vaguely remembers shooting someone the night before in a drunken rage. Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when the confessional turns out to be a police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes a witty remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must have watched it as well, giving him an alibi. As Smithers's memory clears, it turns out he had actually shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townspeople pull down the sun- blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight. With one of the prime suspects cleared, the police, aided by Lisa, eliminate other suspects, including Puente (whose revenge took the form of a \\"slanderous mambo\\"), Skinner (who was found by Chalmers to be applying what he thought was camouflage make-up at the time of the shooting), Willie (who cannot fire a gun due to arthritis in his index fingers), and Moe (who is cleared via polygraph test). After a surreal dream about Lisa, Chief Wiggum finds an eyelash on Mr. Burns's suit which matches Simpson DNA. At the same time, Burns wakes up from his coma, exclaiming \\"Homer Simpson!\\" The police raid the Simpson home and find a gun under the seat of their car, covered with Homer's fingerprints and loaded with bullets that match the one fired into Mr. Burns. Homer is accused of murder and arrested. On the way to jail the paddywagon overturns at the Krusty Burger drive-thru due to Chief Wiggum unbalancing the weight as he leans out the window to collect his order, and Homer escapes. At the hospital, it is revealed \\"Homer Simpson\\" is the only thing Burns can say, suggesting his \\"accusation\\" may not have actually been one. Hoping to clear Homer's name, Lisa returns to the scene of the crime to investigate and discovers the identity of Burns's true assailant. At the same time, Homer arrives at the hospital to confront his boss. After a police bulletin reports Homer's location, the police, Lisa, and many other citizens of Springfield race to the hospital. Upon entering Burns's room, everyone finds an enraged Homer vigorously shaking Burns. This returns Burns's ability to speak normally, and he quickly asks who the person shaking him is. Apoplectic with fury at Burns again not remembering who he is, Homer aims Wiggum's gun at Burns's face, demanding he recant his accusations. Burns laughs at the idea and confirms Homer did not shoot him. He then reveals the true assailant: Maggie. After leaving the town meeting, Burns came across Maggie eating a lollipop in the Simpsons' car. He decided to try stealing candy from a baby, but Maggie would not let go of the lollipop, resulting in a struggle. As he finally yanked it away, his gun slipped from its holster into Maggie's hands and fired at Burns. The gun and lollipop both fell beneath the car seat; Homer would later unknowingly leave fingerprints on the gun while feeling around under the seat for an ice cream cone he accidentally dropped. Lisa guesses that with his last strength Burns pointed to the \\"S\\" and \\"W\\" on the sundial (with the \\"W\\" appearing as an \\"M\\" from his perspective) to identify his assailant. Burns corrects her, saying that with his last strength he swallowed his gold fillings to prevent the paramedics from stealing them, the positions of his arms being purely coincidental. Burns demands for Maggie to be arrested, but he is dismissed by Wiggum, who says no jury would convict a baby for a crime. Marge also adds the shooting must have been an accident, considering Maggie, being an infant, is very unlikely to know how to operate a gun. In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes as she sucks her pacifier in a way that sounds like gunshots, implying that she shot her father's boss intentionally. Production Matt Groening came up with the idea for the episode. The idea for the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, which could be used as a publicity stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. The producers worked hard to keep the ending of the episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited until the end of the summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident. Tito Puente and his Latin jazz ensemble appear in the episode and sing the song \\"Se√±or Burns\\". Oakley and Weinstein were unfamiliar with Puente and wrote him into the episode because Groening is a fan. They figured he would sing the song, but later discovered that Puente was a drummer, not a singer. The lyrics were sung by one of Puente's band members. His band would also play their version of The Simpsons' theme over the end credits. Hidden clues One of the most important clues shows Mr. Burns's arms pointing towards W and S on the sundial. A number of subtle clues, and a few red herrings, were planted in Part One for viewers who wanted to unravel the mystery. * Almost every clock is set at three or nine o'clock. The point of the clocks was to teach the viewer to view the sundial at the end upside down. * Mr. Burns looks from his balcony and talks about stealing candy from a baby. * The box of chocolates Homer sends Burns is lined with a Simpsons family photo, and as Burns and Smithers gorge on the candy, Maggie is the first Simpson the audience sees. * When Mr. Burns collapses on the sundial, he points at W and S, although from his viewpoint, the W looks like an M. * Many of the suspects have the letters S and either W or M in their initials, and the intention was that several \\"obvious\\" suspects could be eliminated by the letters. Several characters already had names with those initials, but some were made up specifically for this episode. ** Principal Skinner's full name is revealed to be \\"W. Seymour Skinner\\" on a diploma in his office. ** Smithers's full name is \\"Waylon Smithers.\\" ** Mr. Burns calls Santa's Little Helper the \\"Simpson Mutt\\". ** Moe's liquor license reveals that his full name is Moe Szyslak. ** Melvin Van Horne is known to everyone by his stage name \\"Sideshow Mel\\". ** Grampa's gun is a Smith & Wesson. * Just before entering Mr. Burns's office to spray paint his name, Homer passes in front of the words \\"ONLY IN\\" on the pavement (upside down from the viewer's perspective), and very briefly blocks all of the letters except \\"NO\\" and a small arrow pointing at him. * A television in Moe's Tavern shows that \\"Pardon My Zinger\\" is broadcast on weekdays at 3 p.m. on Comedy Central. It is later revealed that Burns is shot at 3 p.m. Smithers reveals at the meeting that he never misses the show, and afterward is seen heading in the opposite direction that Burns heads. * During the scene at the town hall, several citizens are seen stroking guns: Smithers and an unidentified woman have revolvers, Moe has a shotgun, Skinner has a semi-automatic pistol with a suppressor attached, and Barney has a derringer. Snake arrives with a revolver. * Also during the town hall scene, Mr. Burns smugly asks the townspeople ‚ÄúWho here has the guts to stop me?‚Äù, followed by a panning shot of the townspeople glaring at Mr. Burns before each looking away in reluctance. During this shot, Maggie, at the bottom of the screen in Marge's arms, was the only one to continue glaring. * As Mr. Burns collapses on the sundial, it is seen that the holster under his arm is empty. This was inserted as an intentional freeze frame clue to show that he had been shot with his own gun. Alternate endings Due to the amount of interest in the ending of this episode, David Mirkin wrote several \\"terrible endings\\" and, with just Harry Shearer, recorded several alternate endings. His original intention was to fool the production staff and also leak the endings to various media outlets, but much to his surprise he was unsuccessful. Several endings were animated that showed various characters shooting Mr. Burns. Several of the alternate endings aired during the clip show \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\". Various clips showed Barney, Tito, Moe, Apu, and even Santa's Little Helper as the gunmen. There was also a full-length conclusion that aired in which Smithers shot Burns and explained his doing so at Burns's bedside after Homer's wild chase, and fell on \\"W\\" and S\\" on the compass, Waylon's initials; Burns then decides to give Smithers a 5 percent pay cut for attempting to kill him. Contest In the months following the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 and was one of the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, \`Springfield.com\`, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries, whether the entries contained correct responses or not. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated. The contest is referenced at the end of Part 1 when Dr. Hibbert, ostensibly breaking the fourth wall says, \\"Well I couldn't possibly solve this mystery... Can you?\\" Springfield's Most Wanted Springfield's Most Wanted was a TV special hosted by John Walsh, host of America's Most Wanted. The special aired on September 17, 1995, before Part Two of \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" A parody of Walsh's television series, this special was designed to help people find out who shot Mr. Burns, by laying out the potential clues and identifying the possible suspects. It features opinions from former Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and predictions from Dennis Franz, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kevin Nealon, Chris Elliott, and Andrew Shue. The special also included oddsmaker Jimmy Vaccaro of The Mirage casino and hotel in Las Vegas, who had been taking bets on the shooter's identity; a brief look at the casino's tote board shows Homer as the favorite with 2:1 odds, while Maggie was a longshot at 70:1. It was directed by Bill Brown and written by Jack Parmeter and Bob Bain. The special was criticized for taking the publicity of the episode too far. Several critics said the special tainted host John Walsh's credibility and was described as gimmicky, tacky, and \\"blatant groveling for viewers\\". The special averaged an 8.4 Nielsen Rating and finished 50th in the United States in the ratings for the week of September 11‚Äì17, 1995. Cultural references The title and concept for these two episodes were taken from the series Dallas. In the \\"Who shot J. R.?\\" plot line, J. R. Ewing is shot in the season finale. The identity of the assailant was not revealed until the following season, leaving viewers to wonder for months which of Ewing's many enemies was the culprit. When Mr. Burns refers to his package at the beginning of the episode, he states that it \\"absolutely, positively\\" has to arrive in Pasadena, California, the following day, a reference to an early FedEx slogan. The song Mr. Burns sings to a lamp-post echo the lyrics of Simon & Garfunkel's song \\"The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)\\". The musical score that ends the first episode (when the credits roll) is a parody of John Williams' Drummers' Salute, which is part of the musical score he composed for Oliver Stone's film JFK. During the scene in Part One where Moe's bar is closed, an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is playing on the television in the background following a promotion for the fictional program Pardon My Zinger at 3:00 pm. Chief Wiggum's dream is a detailed reference to Dale Cooper's interaction with the Man from Another Place in the series Twin Peaks. The moving shadow in the middle of the curtain is also a reference to Twin Peaks. The opening of Part Two, wherein Smithers realizes that he merely dreamed about shooting Mr. Burns, is a reference to the episode \\"Blast from the Past\\" from Dallas, in which the events of the entire ninth season were explained away as being merely a character's dream. The dream itself, in which Smithers and Burns are undercover detectives on the 1960s Speedway racing circuit, parodied The Mod Squad. Groundskeeper Willie's interrogation, and particularly his crossing and uncrossing his legs, is a parody of Sharon Stone's famous interrogation scene in Basic Instinct. The nightclub is called 'Chez Guevara', a reference to Communist revolutionary Che Guevara. leftHomer's escape from the overturned paddy wagon is a homage to the 1993 film The Fugitive. Chief Wiggum's dream in which Lisa speaks backwards is a reference to Twin Peaks and Special Agent Dale Cooper's interaction with the Man from Another Place. While recording Lisa's lines for the segment, Yeardley Smith recorded the part backwards; the recording was in turn reversed, a technique known as phonetic reversal, the same technique used on Twin Peaks. Several other parts out of the segment are direct references to the dream, including a moving shadow on the curtain, and Wiggum's hair standing straight up after waking. A mug shot of a battered and bruised Homer Simpson is shown, in which he is wearing a T-shirt with the campaign slogan \\"Haig in '88\\" on it, a reference to Alexander Haig's unsuccessful run for the 1988 Republican Party presidential nomination. Reception The song \\"Se√±or Burns\\", performed by Tito Puente and his band, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. Part One finished 51st with a Nielsen rating of 8.7, the fifth highest rated Fox show of the week. Part Two averaged 12.3 million households and a 12.9 Nielsen rating. It finished sixteenth in the United States in the ratings for the week of September 11‚Äì17, 1995, finishing first in its time slot and was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. It helped the Fox network rank third overall for that week at a time when Fox was usually finishing fourth. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly published a Top 25 The Simpsons episode list and placed both parts of \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" in 25th place, saying, \\"a two-part comedic homage to Dallas' Who shot J.R.? stunt, [Who Shot Mr. Burns] is perhaps The Simpsons' most grandiose pop moment ever\\". The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of \\"The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes\\". Entertainment.ie named it among the 10 greatest Simpsons episodes of all time. When The Simpsons began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, Oakley named Part One one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"A superb end to the season‚Äîand what's more, it's a genuine whodunnit. There's no cheating‚Äîall the clues are there.\\" Jake Rossen of Wizard called the ending the sixth greatest cliffhanger of all time but expressed disappointment in the resolution, saying, \\"Sometimes it's better to make up your own ending, kids.\\" In 2008, Entertainment Weekly included Part One in their list of the best television season finales of all time. The song \\"Se√±or Burns\\", which was composed by Alf Clausen and written by Oakley and Weinstein, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 1996 for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics\\". Tito Puente ranked 19th on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. References ;Bibliography * External links *\\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?

Eduardo Schiaffino (1858-1935) was an Argentine painter, critic, intellectual and historian. A member of a group known as the Generation of '80, he founded the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires and sparked the development of painting in his country. Biography El Reposo (The Repose, 1889), exhibited at the National Museum of Fine Arts. Schiaffino was born in Buenos Aires in 1858. Trained initially by Venetian painter Giuseppe Agujari, at 18 he was among the founders of the Society for the Stimulus of Fine Arts, the initial name of the National Academy of Fine Arts. In 1884 he travelled to Europe as correspondent for the newspaper El Diario, publishing various articles on artistic themes under the pseudonym Zig Zag. In 1891 he was one of the founders of the Buenos Aires Athenaeum, a group dedicated to renewing Hispanic American culture through the participation of distinguished figures like Ruben Dar√≠o and Leopoldo Lugones. In 1895 he won a victory when the government agreed to create the National Museum of Fine Arts, a project for which he had long struggled. He acted as its first director until 1910, and secured Auguste Rodin's contribution of numerous sculptures for newly established parks in Buenos Aires. The trend in painting he pursued during this period was towards symbolism, which he had publicly and polemically criticised. He acquired a large number of works in thus genre for the Fine Arts Museum during his tenure, just the same. Schiaffino was afterwards engaged in various diplomatic undertakings in Europe, but in 1933 he returned to Buenos Aires and published his most important book, Painting and Sculpture in Argentina.

Most researchers believe that, despite varying names, Peckols and Patollo were probably the same god in charge of the underworld and the dead. It is usually described as an angry, evil spirit similar to the Lithuanian velnias. Patollu was first mentioned in 1418 by Bishop of Warmia in a letter to the Pope. Chronicler Simon Grunau (1529) provided more vivid but dubious details about Patollo. According to Grunau, Patollo was one of the three gods portrayed on the flag and coat of arms of King Widewuto and worshiped in the temple of Rickoyoto. He was portrayed as an old man with a white beard and a white headdress similar to a turban. He was a scary and ruthless god of the dead who would haunt and taunt the living if they disobeyed their pagan priests or buried the dead without proper sacrifices to the gods. Many other early modern writers, including Alexander Guagnini and Lucas David, followed Grunau in descriptions of Patollo. The Sudovian Book (1520s), mentioned two beings ‚Äì Peckols, the god of hell and darkness, and Pockols, the airborne spirit or devil. The same pair is also found in the church decrees of 1530 (Constitutiones Synodales). There, Pecols was identified with the Roman god of the underworld, Pluto and Pocols with the Greek deities of anger, the Furies. Jan Sandecki Malecki followed the Sudovian Book and wrote about Pocclum and Poccollum. Jonas Bretk≈´nas, Caspar Hennenberger, and later authors attempted to reconcile the accounts provided by Grunau and the Sudovian Book. In the 17th century Christoph Hartknoch and Matth√§us Pr√§torius testified that people still believed in Picolli and Pykullis.

During the 1980s, Steeleye released only three albums. By 1991, the band was revitalized through the arrival of bassist Tim Harries and drummer Liam Genockey. Harries was younger than the other band members, and new blood returned the band to full-time activity. Steeleye found a fresh perspective on old material, as is evident on Tonight's the Night...Live, which balances the band's rock and folk roots. The album includes new arrangements of several songs from earlier albums, some of them different from the earlier versions: \\"Cam Ye O'er Frae France\\" from Parcel of Rogues, \\"All Around My Hat\\" from All Around My Hat (preferred by some to the originalhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/tonights-the-night-live!-mw0000091390), \\"Fighting for Strangers\\" from Rocket Cottage, \\"White Man\\" from Back in Line, and \\"Padstow\\" from Tempted and Tried. \\"The Weaver and the Factory Maid\\" (from Parcel of Rogues) is effective. With a thrumming bass line, clicking percussion and repetitive violin and guitar lines, the song conveys the sense of a factory full of power looms. The other half of the album is new pieces. The most experimental is \\"Tam Lin\\", Fairport Convention's signature tune. To find a new approach to the song, Knight traced the Tam Lin story to Bulgarian folklore, combining three Bulgarian folk songs for Prior to sing. More upbeat are \\"Tonight's the Night\\" and \\"The Gentleman Soldier\\". \\"Ten Long Years\\" is a nod to the band's a cappella pieces.

At a student-led outing to a country inn, Balduin encounters the figure Scapinelli who offers him money \\"for very low interest.\\" Balduin believes him to be a loan shark and ignores him to go engage in a fencing match with another student. After the match, the viewer sees Scapinelli on a cliffside, watching a young woman (later revealed to be Margit, the daughter of a count) on horseback who is participating in a boar-hunt. He manipulates the situation such that the animals run amok and head towards the inn. Margit's horse runs away with her and Balduin catches her when she falls off. As a reward, she gives Balduin a crucifix which has fallen from her neck and later he receives an invitation to the house of her father, Count Schwarzenberg. There he becomes aware of his own poverty in comparison to Margit's fianc√©, who is a baron. Later that night, Scapinelli again comes for Balduin and makes an offer. Balduin signs a contract stipulating that Scapinelli can have anything in the room he wants in return for 600,000 florin. Balduin signs and Scapinelli takes out a small bag and proceeds to pour the entirety of the 600,000 onto the table. Scapinelli then takes his part: Balduin's reflection. The scene then shifts to show the new lifestyle that Balduin is leading with his newfound fortune. His happiness does not last long, because his reflection, free of the mirror, runs amok, causing havoc around town, which is blamed on Balduin. Balduin, in his final confrontation, shoots his reflection. This results in his own death. The movie closes as it opens: with a shot of Balduin's grave, upon which is inscribed \\"Here lies Balduin.

The films screenplay was written Galeen and Hanns Heinz Ewers and was influenced by the story of Faust. The film had previously been made as The Student of Prague. It was shot at the Staaken Studios in Berlin. Among the crew was designer Hermann Warm; cinematographer G√ºnther Krampf; and the actors Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, Dagny Servaes, Leni Riefenstahl and Elizza La Porta. Der Student von Prag made La Porta a well-known actress. The film featured impressive special effects for its time, especially the finale in which the lead character is forced to confront his other half, with seamlessly executed split screen technology. Release The Student of Prague was shown in Berlin on 25 October 1926. The film was remade as a sound film in 1935, directed by Arthur Robinson.

Retrieved from http://dup.ucentral.cl/pdf/9_santiago_nuevo_extremo.pdf Initially thought to be a fortress, the structure in the southern tip of the Chena hills has been denominated as a huaca (Quechuan Wak'a) a sacred place, a space of ritual use. The Chena's Pucar√° was observed to have a zoomorphic design, resembling a puma, which is a characteristic of Incan ceremonial and sacred structures. The word Chena (the name of the hills) means puma in oestrous cycle in the Quechuan language. Subsequent investigations have further supported the sacred denomination by revealing the structure to be composed of three separate edifications; an outside perimetral wall, a middle perimetral wall and the central enclosure, all which are consistent with Incan architectural tripartition designs. Furthermore, the principle structure's design is consistent with the structural designs of Incan Ushnu (place of observation). This observatory status has been confirmed by the structure's seemingly perfect lineation of its altar with the first ray of sun during the winter solstice (June 21) and the summer solstice (December 21).Meddens, F., McEwan, C., & Pomacanchari, C.

Located at 360 Portage Avenue in downtown Winnipeg and connected to the Winnipeg Walkway system, Manitoba Hydro Place received LEED Platinum certification in May 2012, making it the most energy efficient office tower in North America and the only office tower in Canada to receive the LEED Platinum rating. Opened as Winnipeg's 4th tallest building in September 2009, the 21-story office tower brought together 1,650 employees from 15 suburban locations into one highrise on a full, downtown block. With the design's plan view resembling a capital letter \\"A\\", the project comprises two 18-storey twin wings framing three 6-storey, south-facing atria (winter gardens). The design's stepped, three-storey, street-scaled podium contains retail space as well as an interior pedestrian street and a single level of parking, partially below grade ‚Äî over which sit the atria, office wings and their 3-storey mechanical penthouse. Total project cost was C$278m. The building's bioclimatic, energy-efficient design features a tall solar chimney, a geo- thermal HVAC system using 280 five-inch tubes bored 380 feet into an underground aquifer, 100% fresh air (24 hours a day, year round, regardless of outside temperature) and a one-meter-wide double exterior wall with computer- controlled motorized vents that adjust the building's exterior skin throughout the day and evening. Together, the various elements of the design enable a 70% energy savings over a typical large office tower. In 2009, CBC News called Manitoba Hydro Place (MHP) one of \\"the most energy-efficient office towers in the world\\" and the Toronto Star called MHP the \\"most important building in Canada.\\" Background and design process Construction of a downtown headquarters building was integral to the 2002 purchase agreement between Manitoba Hydro and the City of Winnipeg for purchase of the formerly city- owned electric utility, Winnipeg Hydro. Manitoba Hydro representatives toured to Europe to identify examples of energy efficient design a year prior to beginning the architect selection process. Subsequently, the company assembled an integrated design team including members from the corporation itself along with the design architects, the architects of record, energy engineers, building system engineers, cost estimators, and project contractors ‚Äî selecting the Design Architect first: Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects of Toronto. Smith Carter Architects of Winnipeg was the Architect of Record. By December 2003, the design team had selected the final site, and by 2004, Manitoba Hydro unveiled a series of design concepts for the building, having created a design brief for the building: The brief was developed into a project charter defining the project's core principles and against which design concepts would be measured: that it would be flexible and adaptable to new technology and workplace changes, offer world-class energy efficiency, offer a signature design to enhance the image of the company and the city, help strengthen the city downtown, and be a solid financial investment. The company committed one year to developing the building concept, using another year to ensure the concept integrated the key elements, including architectural, structural, energy performance, cost, constructability, and LEED factors. Sixteen alternatives were developed, subsequently reduced to three options from which the final concept was selected. Energy efficient design To meet its initial design target, that of a sustainable, energy- efficient building, Manitoba Hydro Place (MHP) was developed using an Integrated Design Process to optimize the building's massing, orientation and exposed thermal mass and to use digital analysis and computerized building management systems to increase its efficiency. MHP integrates passive elements (e.g., the south-facing winter gardens, natural daylighting, and the solar chimney) as well as active systems (e.g., dimmable, programmable fluorescent lighting and a computer-operated building management system). ::See: Conceptual diagram of building systems at MHP Key specifics of the design include siting of the building to take advantage of prevailing winds and solar gain, minimizing north-facing surface area, using the building's south-facing atria to provide and precondition the building's constant fresh-air supply and using several 24-meter-tall waterfalls to humidify and dehumidify the fresh air intake. Green roofs at the base of the building use plants to reduce stormwater runoff and minimize the building's heat-island effect, including such native prairie plants as sweet grass. The design uses the building's concrete thermal mass to mitigate extreme temperature swings and integrate radiant heating and cooling systems, with a solar chimney to provide 100% fresh air by moving exhaust air to the bottom of the chimney to combine with the atria's preconditioned air and preheat incoming cold air to within room temperature, and employing geothermal technology via a closed loop system of 280 boreholes, six inches in diameter (variously reported as five inches in diameter), 400 feet deep, located between elements of the foundation. The geo- thermal boreholes are filled with tubing carrying glycol, which extracts heat from the building in warmer months while warming the thermal mass of the floor slabs radiantly in colder months. Heat pumps and exchangers maximize the system's efficiency, providing conditioned water that is then circulated in tubes in the exposed ceiling slabs, providing 100% of the mechanical temperature conditioning. MHB features a high performance building envelope with a glass skin that is effectively triple-glazed ‚Äî where the interior layer is single-glazed and separated from the double-glazed exterior layer by a one meter wide buffer zone. Windows at the east and west include operable sashes of both motorized, centrally controlled panels in the outer glazing and manually operated panels at the inner glazing as ‚Äî well as shading located in the interstitial space. The floor plan shapes themselves (also known as floorplates) of MHP are shallow, with a distance of 11 meters from the face of the building to its interior core, facilitating natural daylighting. Other systems integral to the design include high ceilings to maximize natural lighting, exterior walls of low-iron glass for maximum solar gain, automated solar shading, raised floors with a displacement ventilation system, high- output lighting with occupancy and light sensors on each fixture, a computer- based building management system to coordinate operation of energy management and building systems as well as a group of green roofs at the building's podium. To achieve personal comfort levels, users have access to the operable elements of the fa√ßade and receives natural lighting 80% of normal office hours. In addition to the operable sashes, users can control their immediate environment via task lighting, shading devices and user-operable floor grilles. Incidental to the building design itself, another idea behind MHP was indirect energy savings the project would facilitate by combining 15 disparate company entities in a single downtown location. Before MHP opened, 95 percent of the employees commuted to work via automobile. After working at the new building for less than half a year, 50% of commuters were using forms of transportation other than the automobile. MHP energy use MHP targets electric usage less than 100 kWh/m¬≤/a compared to 400 kWh/m¬≤/a for a typical large scale North American office tower, located in a more temperate climate. Specifically, the average cold-climate Class A Canadian office uses 400‚Äì550 kWh/m¬≤ per year. A typical office space in Manitoba uses 495 kWh/m¬≤ per year. Five years before the MHB was designed the typical office space in Canada utilized used 550 kWh/m¬≤ per year. Because of recent work to reduce energy consumption in Winnipeg, a typical office highrise in the city uses approximately 325 kWh/m¬≤ annually. Current annual Canadian energy targets for Class A office towers are 260kWh/m¬≤. MHP projected an annual use of 88 kWh/m¬≤ per annum, exceeding the Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB) by 66%. The building targets Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification at the platinum level, the highest level of a four tier rating system. On May 25, 2012, MHB was finally awarded formal certification, achieving LEED Platinum, the first office building in North America to do so. As part of their announcement, it was confirmed that their annual energy use is 85 kWh/m¬≤, slightly lower than anticipated. Cost MHP was constructed at a cost of C$278 m, or $400 per square foot. This would place the cost of the building much higher than local building developers would typically target for a city that is not expanding rapidly. The building was also financed internally, with a target construction payback period of more than 60 years rather than the much shorter typical return projection. During the initial phase of construction, in 2006, engineers discovered a higher water table than anticipated. As the basement had originally been designed to accommodate numerous mechanical systems, the building underwent substantial redesign, including its foundation. A level of the basement was also eliminated during the redesign. Awards *2009 Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH)'s Best Tall Building Americas award.

Gill & Son, Dublin, 1877 (21 April 1817, Oudenaarde, Belgium ‚Äì 23 May 1876, Brussels) was a Belgian Jesuit priest and theologian. He is credited with relaunching the work of the Bollandists in the 19th century, after the restoration of the Society of Jesus. Life His family was one of the most distinguished in the city of Oudenaarde (Audenarde). After a course in the humanities, begun at the College of Soignies and the petit seminaire of Roeselare and completed in 1835 at the college of the Society of Jesus at Aalst, he entered the Society of Jesus on 11 October 1835. After two years in the novitiate, then at Nivelles, and a year at Tronchiennes reviewing and finishing his literary studies, he went to Namur in September 1838 to study philosophy and the natural sciences.De Smedt, Charles. \\"Victor de Buck.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 11 Dec. 2014 De Buck wrote with ease in Flemish, French, and Latin. The work of the Bollandists had just been revived and, in spite of his youth, Victor de Buck was summoned to act as assistant to the hagiographers. He remained at this work in Brussels from September 1840, to September 1845. After devoting four years to theological studies at Louvain where he was ordained priest in 1848, and making his third year of probation in the Society of Jesus, he was permanently assigned to the Bollandist work in 1850. He remained engaged in it until his death, living in a room at St. Michael's College, Brussels, which also served as his study. He had already published in Vol. VII of the October Acta Sanctorum, which appeared in 1845, sixteen commentaries or notices that are easily distinguishable because they are without a signature, unlike those written by the Bollandists. In the early years, he would periodically take a brief respite to preach a country mission in Flemish. He composed in collaboration with scholastic Antoine Tinnebroek an able refutation of a book published by the professor of canon law at the University of Leuven, in which the rights of the regular clergy were assailed and repudiated. This refutation, which fills an octavo volume of 640 pages, was ready for publication within four months. It was to have been supplemented by a second volume that was almost completed but could not be published because of the political disturbances of the year, the prelude to the revolutions of 1848. The work was never resumed. Besides the numerous commentaries in Vols. IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII of the October Acta Sanctorum, which won much praise, Father de Buck published in Latin, French and Dutch a large number of little works of piety and dissertations on devotion to the saints, church history, and Christian archaeology. The partial enumeration of these works fills two folio columns of his eulogy, in the forepart of vol. II of the November Acta. Because of his extensive learning and investigating turn of mind he was naturally bent upon probing abstruse and perplexing questions. Thus in 1862 he was led to publish in the form of a letter to his brother Remi, then professor of church history at the theological college of Louvain and soon afterwards his colleague on the Bollandist work, a Latin dissertation, De solemnitate praecipue paupertatis religiosae. This was followed in 1863 and 1864 by two treatises in French, one under the title Solution amiable de la question des couvents and the other De l'√©tat religieux, treating of the religious life in Belgium in the nineteenth century. De Buck was part of an international scholarly community, researching, studying, and sharing citations with colleagues. He maintained a frequent correspondence with Agostino Morini, O.S.M. Relics controversy In order to satisfy the many requests made to Rome by churches and religious communities for relics of saints, it had become customary to take from the catacombs of Rome the bodies of unknown personages believed to have been honored as martyrs in the early Church. The sign by which they were to be recognized was a glass vial sealed up in the plaster outside the loculus that contained the body, and bearing traces of a red substance that had been enclosed and was supposed to have been blood. Doubts had arisen as to the correctness of this interpretation and, after careful study, Victor de Buck felt convinced that it was false and that what had been taken for blood was probably the sediment of consecrated wine. The conclusion, together with its premises, was set forth in a dissertation published in 1855 under the title De phialis rubricatis quibus martyrum romanorum sepulcra dignosci dicuntur.de Buck, Victor. De Phialis Rubricatis Quibus Martyrum Romanorum Sepulcra Dignosci Dicuntur Observationes..., Nabu Press, 2011 Naturally it raised lively protestations, particularly on the part of those who were responsible for distributing the relics of the saints, the more so, as the cardinal vicar of Rome in 1861 strictly forbade any further transportation of these relics. De Buck had only a few copies of his work printed, these being intended for the cardinals and prelates particularly interested in the question. As none were put on the market, it was rumored that de Buck's superiors had suppressed the publication of the book and that all the copies printed, save five or six, had been destroyed. This was untrue; no copy had been destroyed and his superiors had laid no blame upon the author. Then, in 1863, a decree was obtained from the Congregation of Rites, renewing an older decree, whereby it was declared that a vial of blood placed outside of a sepulchral niche in the catacombs was an unmistakable sign by which the tomb of a martyr might be known, and it was proclaimed that Victor de Buck's opinion was formally disapproved and condemned by Rome. This too was false, as Father De Buck had never intimated that the placing of the vial of blood did not indicate the resting-place of a martyr, when it could be proved that the vial contained genuine blood, such as was supposed by the decree of the congregation. Finally, there appeared in Paris a large quarto volume written by the Roman prelate, Monsignor Sconamiglio, Reliquiarum custode. It was filled with caustic criticisms of the author of De phialis rubricatis and relegated him to the rank of notorious heretics who had combated devotion to the saints and the veneration of their relics. Victor de Buck seemed all but insensible to the attacks and contented himself with opposing to Monsignor Sconamiglio's book a protest in which he rectified the more or less unconscious error of his enemies by proving that neither the decree of 1863 nor any other decision emanating from ecclesiastical authority had affected his thesis. Ecumenism Opinions were attributed to de Buck which, if not formally heretical, at least openly defied ideas generally accepted by Catholics. What apparently gave rise to these accusations were the amicable relations established, principally through correspondence, between Victor de Buck and such men as the celebrated Edward Pusey in England, and Montalembert, in France. Through contacts with foreign hagiographers and the English Jesuits in Louvain, de Buck developed an interest in a possible reunification of the Churches. During the 1850s he expressed this interest in a number of publications, including the √âtudes Religieuses and The Rambler.Brown, Stewart J. and Nockles, Peter B., The Oxford Movement: Europe and the Wider World 1830‚Äì1930, Cambridge University Press, 2012 De Buck's opinion regarding the views of Pusey were closer to those of Newman than Cardinal Manning. A shared interest in the lives of the saints brought him in contact with Alexander Forbes, the learned Anglican bishop, with whom he corresponded at length. De Buck was also a friend of Bishop F√©lix Dupanloup.Chapman, Mark D., The Fantasy of Reunion: Anglicans, Catholics, and Ecumenism, 1833-1882, Oxford University Press, 2014 These relations were brought about by the reputation for deep learning, integrity, and scientific independence that de Buck's works had earned for him, by his readiness to oblige those who addressed questions to him, and by his earnestness and skill in elucidating the most difficult questions. Grave and direct accusations were made against de Buck and reported to the pope. In a Latin letter addressed to Cardinal Patrizzi, and intended to come to the notice of the pope, Father de Buck repudiated the calumnies in a manner that betrayed how deeply he had been affected. His protest was supported by the testimony of four of his principal superiors, former provincials, and rectors who eagerly vouched for the sincerely of his declarations and the genuineness of his religious spirit. With the consent of his superiors he published this letter in order to communicate with those of his friends who might have been disturbed by these accusations. De Buck had hoped for an Anglican presence at the First Vatican Council as a step toward rapprochement, but doctrinal differences proved an impediment, most notably, the doctrine of infallibility. Father Peter Jan Beckx, Father General of the Society, summoned him to Rome to act as official theologian at the First Vatican Council. Father de Buck assumed these new duties with his accustomed ardor and, upon his return, showed the first symptoms of arteriosclerosis, which finally ended his life. Toward the end of his life, Father de Buck lost his sight, but dictated from memory, material previously compiled regarding saints of the early Celtic Church in Ireland, to his brother, Fr. Remi de Buck, also a Bollandist.

Lophostropheus is one of the few dinosaurs that may have survived the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic extinction event. Lophostropheus was a small to medium-sized, moderately-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore, that could grow up to long. Over the years it had been incorrectly classified as Halticosaurus and Liliensternus, but was later recognized as a new genus and was reassigned to Lophostropheus in 2007. Etymology Lophostropheus was described and named by Argentine paleontologist Martin Ezcurra (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) and French paleontologist Gilles Cuny of the Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie in 2007, and the type species is Lophostropheus airelensis. The composite term Lophostropheus is derived from the Greek words \\"loph√®\\" (ŒªœåœÜŒ∑) meaning \\"crest\\" and the word \\"stropheus\\" (œÉœÑœÅŒøœÜŒµœçœÇ) meaning \\"pertaining to the vertebrae\\"; thus, \\"crest vertebrae\\". This naming is a reference to the prominent dorsal and ventral laminae observed in the cranial cervical vertebrae. The specific name, \\"airelensis\\" is a reference to the locality where the specimen was discovered, the Airel Quarry. Description Estimates suggest that Lophostropheus was at best long and weighed at most. In 2016 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 5.2 meters (17 ft) and 136 kg (300 lbs). It is based on a partial skeleton first described in 1966 as a specimen of Halticosaurus. Classification Lophostropheus differs from other theropods in several ways. It has features reminiscent of more derived theropods, such as having a ball connection to the front of its neck vertebrae, a socket connection to the front of its tail vertebrae, and a vertical ridge on the ilium. These characteristics have all been interpreted as convergences, however. It also has prominent crests on the tops and bottoms of its neck vertebrae (for which it was named), and an extra pair of cavities in its neck vertebrae, unlike Liliensternus. It was closer to the coelophysids, including the well-known Coelophysis, than to Liliensternus. It has been assigned to the superfamily Coelophysoidea. An analysis of early dinosaurs by Baron, Norman and Barrett (2017) placed Lophostropheus in a position close to the derived theropods Sinosaurus and Cryolophosaurus.Baron, M.G., Norman, D.B., and Barrett, P.M. (2017). A new hypothesis of dinosaur relationships and early dinosaur evolution. Nature, 543: 501‚Äì506. Distinguishing anatomical features A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Ezcurra and Cuny (2007), Lophostropheus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: * a moderately convex anterior articular surface of the anterior postaxial cervical vertebrae (also present in Ceratosauria+Tetanurae) * the last dorsal vertebral centrum has a large and oval lateral fossa (also observed in Herrerasaurus) * the last dorsal vertebra has a dorsoventrally well-extended hyposphene * an incipient concavity is present on the cranial articular surface of the cranial caudal vertebrae (also present in Ceratosauria+Tetanurae) * the constant length of the caudal vertebrae along the length of the tail (also in Dilophosaurus) History of discovery In 1966, the French paleontologists Claude Larsonneur and Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent described a partial theropod skeleton from the Triassic-Jurassic boundary of Normandy, found in 1959 by Claude Pareyn, as Halticosaurus sp. This specimen consisted of a tooth, five neck vertebrae, two vertebrae from the back, four sacral vertebrae, tail vertebrae, portions of all the pelvic bones, and an unidentified fragment. It was reinterpreted in 1993 by Gilles Cuny and Peter Galton as belonging to a new species, assigned to Liliensternus and named L. airelensis. Other researchers began to notice differences between L. airelensis and the type species, L. liliensterni,Carrano, M. T., and Sampson, S.

Paleobiology Lophostropheus, as a coelophysoid, would have been a small to medium-sized bipedal carnivore, probably comparable in size and habits to Liliensternus (best specimen estimated at 5.15 meters long, or 16.9 feet). Very few dinosaurs are known from its time period; in fact, it is the only theropod genus known from good remains at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Paleoecology=Provenance and occurrence The remains of the type specimen of Lophostropheus airelensis was recovered in the Airel Quarry locality of the Moon-Airel Formation, in Basse-Normandie, France. The specimen was collected by Pareyn in 1959 in sandy claystone and lenticular, sandy limestone that was deposited on the boundary of the Rhaetian stage of the Triassic period and the Hettangian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 201-200 million years ago. It is one of the few dinosaurs known to have lived during the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Lophostropheus is one of the few dinosaurs that may have survived the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic extinction event when at least half of the known species living on Earth became extinct. This specimen is housed in the collection of Caen University in Normandy, France, and has not been assigned a collection number.

Nordstrum High School was built in 1915 and began its first semester in September 1916, although the desks had yet to arrive. They were still within a railroad boxcar that had been lost within Detroit's vast railyards. But it was overcrowded within a few years so Southwestern High School was built beside it, with the recent high school to become an intermediate school. Southwestern was designed with a gymnasium, swimming pool, extensive track and field space, and an auditorium. It was one of the first schools developed following Michigan's enactment of statutes requiring mandatory attendance at high school. The students of adjoining Nordstrum attended the dedication of Southwestern in April 1922, and began using the building immediately, although the first regular classes began in September 1922. The January 1923 yearbook was called the Sou'wester.http://interactive.ancestry.com/1265/43134_b208158-00000?imageId=43134_b208158-00000 Sou'wester January 1923 Yearbook (www.ancestry.com subscription website) The growth in Detroit's student population was so rapid, Nordstrom simply became a wing of Southwestern used mainly by ninth and tenth grade students, with the most advanced classes held in the newer building.

Chadsey High School closed in 2009 and its neighborhoods became part of the Southwestern zone. Population decline continued in Detroit, and specifically in the quantity of schoolchildren in neighborhoods served by Southwestern High School. For several years the district considered closing Southwestern. Robert Bobb, who served as the Detroit Public Schools emergency manager, had almost closed Southwestern. By February 2012 the school district announced that it had plans to close Southwestern at the end of the school year. Several protesters challenged the school closing proposal. Aaron Foley of MLive said that the protesters were concerned about a loss of bilingual education employees and fears of a rivalry with students at Western International High School. The school closed in June 2012. Its neighborhoods were apportioned between Northwestern High School and Western International for summer school and the start of the fall semester in September 2012.

They won the annual Caldecott Medal for The Big Snow (1948), recognizing the year's \\"most distinguished American picture book for children\\". They received the Caldecott Honor Book Award for Cock-a-doodle-doo in 1940 and The Mighty Hunter in 1944. Biography Berta Hoerner was born in San Pedro, Coahuila, Mexico, where her parents Albert and Adelaide unsuccessfully tried to grow cotton with Albert's brother. The family moved 100 km to the east, to the resort town of Parras, Mexico, when Berta was three, then soon-after to Amarillo, Texas, where her father ran a grocery store. Her father died when Berta was five, and the family soon moved to the northeast of the United States. Berta, perhaps inspired by her mother's colorful sketches of Mexican life, took art classes and read extensively while still in elementary school, winning literary and artistic prizes for her work. The family again moved in 1909, this time to Seattle, Washington. While Berta's mother worked for Charity Organization Society and Washington's Home, Berta continued painting and reading, and eventually attended the University of Washington School of Journalism (1909‚Äì1912). She also apprenticed at Western Engraving Company, where she learned printing design, fashion design, illustration, and printing skills. Berta's supervisor, Eva Shepard, moved to San Francisco, and handed over her fashion work in Seattle to Berta. When Ms. Shepard then took a position in New York, Ms. Shepard asked Berta to take over her free-lance fashion illustration business in San Francisco. Berta agreed and, to further her training, she spent the summer of 1915 attending art school in Carmel, California. In the fall she moved to San Francisco, took over Eva Shepard's fashion illustration work, and attended the California School of Design, where she studies from 1915-1918. While in San Francisco, Berta befriended Rose Wilder Lane (daughter of then-unknown writer Laura Ingalls Wilder), with whom she later rented a Telegraph Hill studio (1413 Montgomery Street). Berta first met her future husband Elmer at this studio. Berta had also befriended Bessie \\"Mother\\" Beatty during her time in San Francisco. After Ms. Beatty's adventures covering the Russian Revolution (The Red Heart of Russia, 1918), she invited Berta to New York City to do fashion design illustration for McCall's, where Ms. Beatty had become an editor. Elmer Hader was born in Pajaro, California, but spent much of his youth in San Francisco. At the age of 16, as a member of the National Guard, he helped restore order to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. He worked briefly in a survey party up the American River (near Sacramento, California), then returned to San Francisco to work as a firefighter on the State Belt Railroad (a dock-side railroad that acted as a shuttle for goods and peopleSan Francisco Trains - Welcome!), where his father worked as an engineer. Elmer used his earnings from this job to pay for his first term at California School of Design. He then obtained scholarships to finish at the school (1907‚Äì1910). Elmer was also involved in theatre, and was supported by two theatrical groups, including his time in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian from 1912-1914. He was so successful at vaudeville routines in France and the U.S. (on the Pantages circuit), in which he would do a \\"Painting a Minute\\" act and, later, a living statue routine (in which individuals were made up to appear to be statues), that he considered dropping his long-term goal of becoming an artist. He did not. He returned to San Francisco, set up a studio in his parents attic, painted, taught art, and arranged exhibits. Elmer was the first artist showcased in a one-man one themed show at the Palace of Fine Arts. He was drafted into the U.S. Army and returned to France in 1918 as a member of the Camouflage Corps, just at the time that Berta was asked by Ms. Beatty to come to New York to work in fashion design illustration at McCalls. When Elmer and Berta met in San Francisco, they had both been part of a broad network of artists and intellectuals in the area. They became good friends, and, rather than return to San Francisco, Elmer went directly to New York when he was demobilized in February 1919. Berta was working for McCall's. The two married in July of that year, then lived briefly in Greenwich Village. Seeking a more rustic setting, they left the city to rent the Lyall Cottage in Grand View-on- Hudson, a small town in rural Rockland County, New York on the west bank of the Hudson River. This would become the area where they would spend the rest of their lives. Their home, which took more than twenty years to construct, was largely built by the Haders and their friends, and the house became an art project in its own right. Elmer went so far as to extract the stones used to build the house from the earth himself. The Haders had a son in the early 1920s, Hamilton (named after the author Hamilton Williamson), who died from meningitis not long before he turned three. They retreated to a friend's home in Maine to grieve and heal. They returned to New York to continue work on their home and to continue their artistic careers contributing artwork to many magazines, creating broadsides, pamphlets, painting miniatures (Berta) and portraits (Elmer). Career The two used their talents and Berta's connections to prepare children's sections for Good Housekeeping, McCall's, Pictorial Review, Asia, Century, and The Christian Science Monitor. They did pictures and cut-outs, often featuring children dressed in national costumes. In Berta and Elmer Hader's Picture Book of Mother Goose, the couple collated pen-and-ink and color drawings they had done for Monitor and Good Housekeeping to great acclaim. When the US Postal Service dis-allowed the sending of magazines with cut-out segments in 1926, the Haders switched gears, gaining a contract with MacMillan for a series of children's books. They began writing the stories for some of the books in this period. Demand for their product soared, and they worked incessantly from 1927‚Äì1931, illustrating, in some cases writing, producing, and helping to sell thirty-four titles. They stayed busy for the rest of their lives, producing another seventy or so books before they retired in 1964. One book in particular, Billy Butter (1936), so impressed writer John Steinbeck that he requested Elmer Hader do the cover to The Grapes of Wrath (1939). Hader eventually did covers for two other Steinbeck works, East of Eden (1952) and The Winter of Our Discontent (1961). The Haders were early champions of conservation, animal protection, and pacifism. This made its way into their work, particularly with titles such as The Runaways (1956) and Two Is Company, Three's a Crowd (1965?). In the early 1950s, Berta became a community activist, ignited by the seemingly lost cause of having the location of the proposed Tappan Zee Bridge moved to a less sensitive area than its planned path through her village. Though The New York Times accused her of \\"blocking progress,\\" the New York State Thruway Authority eventually relented,Tappan Zee Bridge (I-87 and I-287) and the massive 4,88 km-long bridge was built several kilometers to the north at Nyack, where the bridge still stands today. Berta and Elmer travelled extensively in Mexico, Jamaica, and the far northeast of the United States, some of which made its way into their work. 'The Story of Pancho and the Bull with the Crooked Tail\\" (1942), Jamaica Johnny (1943), and Tommy Thatcher Goes to Sea (1950) are all informed by their travels. Elmer died on his 84th birthday at his home in Grand-View-on-Hudson. Berta remained at the home until shortly before she died 1976 February 6 at the age of 85.

The word \\"adjuvant\\" comes from the Latin word adiuvare, meaning to help or aid. \\"An immunologic adjuvant is defined as any substance that acts to accelerate, prolong, or enhance antigen-specific immune responses when used in combination with specific vaccine antigens.\\" In the early days of vaccine manufacture, significant variations in the efficacy of different batches of the same vaccine were correctly assumed to be caused by contamination of the reaction vessels. However, it was soon found that more scrupulous cleaning actually seemed to reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines, and that some contaminants actually enhanced the immune response. There are many known adjuvants in widespread use, including aluminium salts, oils and virosomes. Overview Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providing increased immunity to a particular disease. Adjuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called PAMPs, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), molecular cages for antigens, components of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and unmethylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA. Because immune systems have evolved to recognize these specific antigenic moieties, the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase the innate immune response to the antigen by augmenting the activities of dendritic cells (DCs), lymphocytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural infection. Inorganic adjuvantsAluminium salts= There are many adjuvants, some of which are inorganic (such as alum), that also carry the potential to augment immunogenicity. Two common salts include aluminium phosphate and aluminium hydroxide. Aluminium salts are the most commonly-used adjuvants in human vaccines. Their adjuvant activity was described in 1926. The precise mechanism of alum action remains unclear but some insights have been gained. For instance, alum can trigger dendritic cells (DC) and other immune cells to secrete interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤), an immune signal that promotes antibody production. Alum adheres to the cell's plasma membrane and rearranges certain lipids there. Spurred into action, the DC picks up the antigen and speeds to a lymph node, where it sticks tightly to a helper T cell and presumably induces an immune response. A second mechanism depends on alum killing immune cells at the injection site although researchers aren't sure exactly how alum kills these cells. It has been speculated that the dying cells release DNA which serves as an immune alarm. Some studies found that DNA from dying cells causes them to adhere more tightly to helper T cells which ultimately leads to an increased release of antibodies by B cells. No matter what the mechanism is, alum is not a perfect adjuvant because it does not work with all antigens (e.g. malaria and tuberculosis). Organic adjuvants Freund's complete adjuvant is a solution of inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mineral oil developed in 1930. It is not safe enough for human use. A version without the bacteria, that is only oil in water, is known as Freund's incomplete adjuvant. It helps vaccines release antigens for a longer time. Despite the side effects, its potential benefit has led to a few clinical trials. Squalene is a naturally-occurring organic compound that is used in human and animal vaccines. Squalene is an oil, made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms, produced by plants and is present in many foods. Squalene is also produced by the human liver and present in human sebum. MF59 is an oil- in-water emulsion of squalene adjuvant used in some human vaccines. Over 22 million doses of a vaccine with squalene have been administered with no safety concerns. The plant extract QS21 is a liposome made up of plant saponins. It is a part of the Shingrix vaccine approved in 2017. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a detoxified version of Salmonella minnesota lipopolysaccharide, interacts with TLR4 to enhance immune response. It is a part of the Shingrix vaccine approved in 2017.  Adaptive immune response  In order to understand the links between the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response to help substantiate an adjuvant function in enhancing adaptive immune responses to the specific antigen of a vaccine, the following points should be considered: * Innate immune response cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) engulf pathogens through a process called phagocytosis. * DCs then migrate to the lymph nodes where T cells (adaptive immune cells) wait for signals to trigger their activation. * In the lymph nodes, DCs mince the engulfed pathogen and then express the pathogen clippings as antigen on their cell surface by coupling them to a special receptor known as a major histocompatibility complex (MHC). * T cells can then recognize these clippings and undergo a cellular transformation resulting in their own activation. * Œ≥Œ¥ T cells possess characteristics of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. * Macrophages can also activate T cells in a similar approach (but do not do so naturally). This process carried out by both DCs and macrophages is termed antigen presentation and represents a physical link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Upon activation, mast cells release heparin and histamine to effectively increase trafficking to and seal off the site of infection to allow immune cells of both systems to clear the area of pathogens. In addition, mast cells also release chemokines which result in the positive chemotaxis of other immune cells of both the innate and adaptive immune responses to the infected area. Due to the variety of mechanisms and links between the innate and adaptive immune response, an adjuvant-enhanced innate immune response results in an enhanced adaptive immune response. Specifically, adjuvants may exert their immune-enhancing effects according to five immune-functional activities. * First, adjuvants may help in the translocation of antigens to the lymph nodes where they can be recognized by T cells. This will ultimately lead to greater T cell activity resulting in a heightened clearance of pathogen throughout the organism. * Second, adjuvants may provide physical protection to antigens which grants the antigen a prolonged delivery. This means that the organism will be exposed to the antigen for a longer duration, making the immune system more robust as it makes use of the additional time by upregulating the production of B and T cells needed for greater immunological memory in the adaptive immune response. * Third, adjuvants may help to increase the capacity to cause local reactions at the injection site (during vaccination), inducing greater release of danger signals by chemokine releasing cells such as helper T cells and mast cells. * Fourth, they may induce the release of inflammatory cytokines which helps to not only recruit B and T cells at sites of infection but also to increase transcriptional events leading to a net increase of immune cells as a whole. * Finally, adjuvants are believed to increase the innate immune response to antigen by interacting with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on or within accessory cells.  Toll-like receptors  The ability of the immune system to recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens is, in part, due to the presence of immune receptors called Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) that are expressed on the membranes of leukocytes including dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, cells of the adaptive immunity (T and B lymphocytes) and non-immune cells (epithelial and endothelial cells, and fibroblasts). The binding of ligands ‚Äì either in the form of adjuvant used in vaccinations or in the form of invasive moieties during times of natural infection ‚Äì TLR marks the key molecular events that ultimately lead to innate immune responses and the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. As of 2016, several TLR ligands were in clinical development or being tested in animal models as potential adjuvants. Medical complications=Humans Aluminium salts used in many human vaccines are regarded as safe by Food and Drugs Administration, although there are multiple studies suggesting the role of aluminium, especially injected highly bioavailable antigen-aluminum complexes when used as adjuvant, in Alzheimer's disease development.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49682395_Aluminum_and_Alzheimer's_Disease_After_a_Century_of_Controversy_Is_there_a_Plausible_Link Adjuvants may make vaccines too reactogenic, which often leads to fever. This is often an expected outcome upon vaccination and is usually controlled in infants by over-the-counter medication if necessary. An increased number of narcolepsy (a chronic sleep disorder) cases in children and adolescents was observed in Scandinavian and other European countries after vaccinations to address the H1N1 ‚Äúswine flu‚Äù pandemic in 2009. Narcolepsy has previously been associated with HLA-subtype DQB1*602, which has led to the prediction that it is an autoimmune process. After a series of epidemiological investigations, researchers found that the higher incidence correlated with the use of AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Pandemrix). Those vaccinated with Pandemrix have almost a 12 times higher risk of developing the disease.(No reference) The adjuvant of the vaccine contained vitamin E that was no more than a day's normal dietary intake. Vitamin E increases hypocretin-specific fragments that bind to DQB1*602 in cell culture experiments, leading to the hypothesis that autoimmunity may arise in genetically susceptible individuals, but there is no clinical data to support this hypothesis. Animals Aluminum adjuvants have caused motor neuron death in mice when injected directly onto the spine at the scruff of the neck, and oil-water suspensions have been reported to increase the risk of autoimmune disease in mice. Squalene has caused rheumatoid arthritis in rats already prone to arthritis. In cats, vaccine- associated sarcoma (VAS) occurs at a rate of between 1 and 10 per 10,000 injections. In 1993, a causal relationship between VAS and administration of aluminum adjuvated rabies and FeLV vaccines was established through epidemiologic methods, and in 1996 the Vaccine-Associated Feline Sarcoma Task Force was formed to address the problem. However, evidence conflicts on whether types of vaccines, manufacturers or factors have been associated with sarcomas.  Controversy = TLR Signalling  , the premise that TLR signaling acts as the key node in antigen-mediated inflammatory responses has been in question as researchers have observed antigen-mediated inflammatory responses in leukocytes in the absence of TLR signaling. One researcher found that in the absence of MyD88 and Trif (essential adapter proteins in TLR signaling), they were still able to induce inflammatory responses, increase T cell activation and generate greater B cell abundancy using conventional adjuvants (alum, Freund's complete adjuvant, Freund's incomplete adjuvant, and monophosphoryl-lipid A/trehalose dicorynomycolate (Ribi's adjuvant)). These observations suggest that although TLR activation can lead to increases in antibody responses, TLR activation is not required to induce enhanced innate and adaptive responses to antigens. Investigating the mechanisms which underlie TLR signaling has been significant in understanding why adjuvants used during vaccinations are so important in augmenting adaptive immune responses to specific antigens. However, with the knowledge that TLR activation is not required for the immune-enhancing effects caused by common adjuvants, we can conclude that there are, in all likelihood, other receptors besides TLRs that have not yet been characterized, opening the door to future research.  Safety  Reports after the first Gulf War linked anthrax vaccine adjuvants to Gulf War Syndrome in American and British troops. The US Defence Department strongly denied the claims. Discussing the safety of squalene as an adjuvant in 2006, the World Health Organisation stated \\"follow- up to detect any vaccine-related adverse events will need to be performed.\\" No such followup has been published by the WHO. Subsequently, the American National Center for Biotechnology Information published an article discussing the comparative safety of vaccine adjuvants which stated that \\"the biggest remaining challenge in the adjuvant field is to decipher the potential relationship between adjuvants and rare vaccine adverse reactions, such as narcolepsy, macrophagic myofasciitis or Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.\\" In 2011 Israeli immunologist Yehuda Shoenfeld hypothesised that adjuvants could induce any of several autoimmune/inflammatory symptoms in a small minority of individuals. The proposition remains unproven.

Synopsis Illustration by Elenore Abbott Once long ago, it was foretold that a king's son would be killed by a stag at the age of sixteen. When the prince was sixteen, he went hunting and chased a stag; a great man, a king, caught him and carried him off. The king set him to watch his three daughters; one each night. The king told the boy that he would call on the prince each hour and if he answered every time, he could marry his daughter, but if not, he would be killed. Each daughter enchanted a statue of St. Christopher to answer in the prince's place, thus saving the prince from death. The king said that in order to marry one of his daughters, he had to cut down a forest in a day; the king gave him a glass axe, a glass mallet, and a glass wedge to complete the task. When the prince went to the forest, the glass broke, and he wept knowing he would be killed. Finally having felt that he had outwitted the prince, the king told his daughters to bring him some food. The youngest daughter brought it, and told her father to let her comb his hair. The king fell asleep, allowing her to conjure up Earth-workers to fell the forest. Astonished that the prince had completed his task, the king then ordered him to clear a muddy pond and fill it with fish in a day. When the king's son tried, his hoe and shovel stuck in the mud and broke. Once again, the youngest daughter brought her father food and got him to sleep; then she conjured the Earth workers to clear the pond. The king then ordered the prince to clear a mountain of briars and put a castle on it. The glass hatchet he was given broke on the first briars; the youngest daughter saved him again. Finally, the king declared that the youngest daughter could not marry until her older sisters were married. Hearing this, the couple decided to run away at night. Once they were on their way, the king's daughter heard her father behind them. She turned herself into a rose, and the king's son into a briar. Believing he had lost them, the king returned home only to be told by his wife that the briar and the rose had been the children. The king chased them after again and this time the king's daughter turned herself into a priest, and the king's son into a church where she preached a sermon. The king listened to the sermon and went home where, once again, his wife told him that the priest and church were the children. Tired of her husband, the queen went after the children her self; the daughter realized the queen would know their true forms, but she changed herself into a duck and the king's son into a pond. The queen tried to drink the pool, but became ill and told her daughter she could come back. The daughter did, and the queen gave her three walnuts to aid her. The king's son and the king's daughter went on. The king's son had her stay while he went to get her carriage to bring her back in due state, but his mother kissed him, and he forgot the king's daughter entirely. The king's daughter had to work for a miller. One day, the queen sought a bride for her son. The king's daughter cracked one walnut and found a splendid dress in it. She wore it to the wedding. The bride declared she would not marry without a dress as fine. The king's daughter would not give it up unless she could spend a night outside the king's son's bedroom. The bride agreed but had the servants give the king's son a potion so he slept. She lamented all night long; the king's son did not hear, but the servants did. In the morning, the bride took the dress and went with the king's son to the church, but the king's daughter cracked the second walnut, and it held a more splendid dress, and the bride again refused to marry without one as fine. The king's daughter asked the same price, and the bride agreed and gave the same order, but the servant, who had heard, gave the king's son something to keep him awake. He heard her laments and was troubled by them. His mother had locked the door, but in the morning, he begged her pardon. The king's daughter cracked the third walnut and found much more splendid dress and wore it as her wedding gown, but the bride and the false mother were sent away.

Thompson, 478 U.S. 804 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court decision. involving the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1331 (federal question jurisdiction). Background The Thompsons, residents of Canada, and the MacTavishes, residents of Scotland, filed virtually identical complaints against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals in the Court of Common Pleas in Hamilton County, Ohio, claiming negligence, fraud, breach of warranty, and misbranding in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). The mother in each family had taken the drug Bendectin during pregnancy which they claimed caused harm to their children including birth defects. Procedural history The case was filed in state court and then removed to federal district court where it was found that Count IV (the misbranding count) of the complaint alleged a cause of action arising under federal law and the motion to remand was denied. It then granted petitioner's motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed claiming that the FDCA did not create or imply a private right to sue for injury resulting in no federal subject matter jurisdiction. Issue The question raised was whether the federal district courts have original federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1331 when a claim arises out of a federal statute that has not specifically granted a private right to a cause of action. The case considered several different tests to determine when a case is covered under original jurisdiction for the federal courts. These tests include: Holmes' \\"Creation\\" Test: The \\"vast majority\\" of cases that come within this grant of jurisdiction are covered by Justice Holmes' statement that a \\"\`suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.'\\"Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 808, quoting . Franchise Tax Board Test: The Court has also granted jurisdiction \\"where the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turned on some construction of federal law.\\". Smith Test (Quoting from the dissent): \\"The general rule is that where it appears from the bill or statement of the plaintiff that the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that such federal claim is not merely colorable, and rests upon a reasonable foundation, the District Court has jurisdiction [478 U.S. 804, 820] under [the statute granting federal question jurisdiction].\\". Majority opinion The Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit and ruled that there was no federal question jurisdiction. Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, took as his starting point the conclusion that Congress did not intend a private Federal cause of action for violations of the FDCA; in other words, private parties may not bring a suit solely on the basis of a violation of the Act. This was the Sixth Circuit's determination, and it was not disputed by any of the parties to the suit. The Court states that the significance of the lack of a Federal cause of action \\"cannot be overstated.\\" The ruling relies heavily on the notion of respect for congressional intent. The Court interprets the fact that Congress did not create a cause of action to be conclusive evidence that Congress did not intend for claimed violations of the FDCA as elements of a state cause of action to be \\"substantial\\" enough to confer federal-question jurisdiction. Dissent Justice Brennan, writing for the dissent, argued that there is federal jurisdiction whenever a federal question is an ingredient of the action. Furthermore, there may be federal question jurisdiction even though both the right asserted and the remedy sought by a plaintiff are state created. Additionally, federal courts are much more adept at interpreting and applying federal law, and more likely to correctly understand Congress‚Äô intent in enacting legislation than are state courts. Aftermath It was not entirely clear from the opinion whether lack of a private cause of action will always be dispositive in every case. The Court clarified the issue in Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg.,. saying that the absence of a right of action is relevant evidence of congressional intent, but does not necessarily decide the question in all cases.

Strictly speaking, the liquid must have a free surface to constitute a slosh dynamics problem, where the dynamics of the liquid can interact with the container to alter the system dynamics significantly.Moiseyev, N.N. & V.V. Rumyantsev. \\"Dynamic Stability of Bodies Containing Fluid.\\" Springer-Verlag, 1968. Important examples include propellant slosh in spacecraft tanks and rockets (especially upper stages), and the free surface effect (cargo slosh) in ships and trucks transporting liquids (for example oil and gasoline). However, it has become common to refer to liquid motion in a completely filled tank, i.e. without a free surface, as \\"fuel slosh\\". Such motion is characterized by \\"inertial waves\\" and can be an important effect in spinning spacecraft dynamics. Extensive mathematical and empirical relationships have been derived to describe liquid slosh. These types of analyses are typically undertaken using computational fluid dynamics and finite element methods to solve the fluid-structure interaction problem, especially if the solid container is flexible. Relevant fluid dynamics non-dimensional parameters include the Bond number, the Weber number, and the Reynolds number.

Typically, a large part of the mass fraction of a satellite is liquid propellant at/near Beginning of Life (BOL), and slosh can adversely affect satellite performance in a number of ways.

Sloshing in road tank vehicles  Liquid sloshing strongly influences the directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles in a highly adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of partially-filled tank vehicles. Anti-slosh devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the tank vehicles. Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils; therefore stability of partially-filled liquid cargo vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored. The Bloodhound SSC 1,000 mph project car utilizes a liquid-fuelled rocket that requires a specially-baffled oxidizer tank to prevent directional instability, rocket thrust variations and even oxidizer tank damage.  Practical effects  Sloshing or shifting cargo, water ballast, or other liquid (e.g., from leaks or fire fighting) can cause disastrous capsizing in ships due to free surface effect; this can also affect trucks and aircraft. The effect of slosh is used to limit the bounce of a roller hockey ball. Water slosh can significantly reduce the rebound height of a ballSport ball for roller hockey; U.S. Patent 5516098; May 14, 1996; Jeffrey Aiello. but some amounts of liquid seem to lead to a resonance effect. Many of the balls for roller hockey commonly available contain water to reduce the bounce height.

By the later half of the decade, as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to the consolidation of radio station ownership around the United States and in the Bay Area, the Empire Broadcasting family of stations including KRTY were among the last locally owned stations in the Bay Area. KRTY attracted a front page San Jose Mercury News story for banning the Dixie Chicks song \\"Goodbye Earl\\" due to violent lyrics and hosting an on-air, call-in program on March 13, 2000 about the song. The station's editorial decision also got attention in the Los Angeles Times and USA Today. Also published as KRTY later added the song to its playlist and donated to a domestic violence shelter for every play of the song. Beginning in the 2016‚Äì17 season, KRTY became the South Bay affiliate for the Golden State Warriors radio network, after the team moved from the powerful signal of KNBR that covered the entire San Francisco Bay Area. Owner Kieve died on May 25, 2020.

History The tradition of the German oratorio Passion began in Hamburg in 1643 with Thomas Selle‚Äôs St John Passion and continued unbroken until the death of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach in 1788. The oratorio Passion, made famous by Johann Sebastian Bach in his St John Passion and St Matthew Passion, is the style that is most familiar to the modern listener. It makes use of recitative to tell the Passion narrative and initially intersperses reflective chorales but later arias and choruses as well. This is in contrast to the Passion oratorio, a genre typified by the so-called Brockes-Passion text ' (set by Georg Philipp Telemann and George Frideric Handel, among others). The Passion oratorio does away with the vocal characterization used in the oratorio Passion and is more a free, poetic retelling of the narrative, rather than a direct quote from the Gospels. Bach himself made this distinction when he wrote to Georg Michael Telemann in 1767 to clarify his duties in Hamburg: \\"are [Passions] presented in the historic and old manner with the Evangelist and other persons, or is it arranged in the manner of an oratorio with reflections, as is the case in Ramler's oratorio [Der Tod Jesu, arguably the most famous setting of this text is by Carl Heinrich Graun]? See Ernst Suchala, C. P. E. Bach: Briefe und Dokumente, I:132‚Äì36. As the clergy in Hamburg were rather conservative, they preserved this \\"old-fashioned\\" style until the church music reform in 1789, after Bach's death. Bach's Passions Each year while he was in Hamburg, Bach compiled a new Passion to be performed during Lent. The Gospel text to be used was chosen on a rotating cycle, as was the Hamburg tradition established in the late 17th century, in the order Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. As they were performed in a regular Sunday service (not at a separate Vespers, as was the custom in Leipzig), Bach modeled his Passions on those of Telemann: they were roughly an hour long, and began in the Garden of Gethsemane and ended with the death of Jesus, rather than telling the contextualizing details as well. The biblical text was set in recitative and assigned to the appropriate characters (individual singers taking the roles of the Evangelist, Jesus, Peter, and so on). Reflective chorales and arias were inserted at predefined points in the narrative, providing commentary on the Passion events. The length was generally carefully kept within one hour. The Passion for the year was performed five times during Lent, once in each church. They were performed starting in the oldest church and moving to the youngest church as follows: St. Peter, St. Nicholas, St. Catherine, St. James and St. Michael. The Passion librettos were printed each year for sale to the congregation; copies of these librettos survive to this day in the Hamburg Staatsarchiv.The librettos are transcribed in Clark (1984). It is important to note that in addition to the chorale texts, the librettos also listed a corresponding number in the Hamburg Gesangbuch (Hymnal), strongly suggesting that the congregation participated in the chorale singing. Out of all 21 Passions written in Hamburg, none is an entirely original work. Though Bach did borrow from himself, he more frequently borrowed from other composers. He often borrowed biblical material (usually turba choruses) from Telemann and J. S. Bach. For the arias and non- biblical choruses, he turned to the music of his contemporaries, most often Gottfried August Homilius, but also Georg Benda and Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel. The Passions were never published in Bach's lifetime, and survive only in manuscript form. These materials, however, were lost after World War II and were only rediscovered in 1999. In 2001, they were returned to their home at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, where they remain to this day. They are currently being transcribed into modern, engraved editions by the Packard Humanities Institute.

James's son and heir Prince Charles led the dances of the principal masquers, as he had in several previous masques at the Stuart Court. Originally scheduled for Twelfth Night in 1623, its performance was delayed by an illness of the King, James I; the masque was staged on Sunday 19 January, in the Banqueting House at Whitehall Palace. (Coincidentally, Jonson's play The Alchemist had been staged at Court on 1 January.) The sets Jones's elaborate stage set featured a double change of scenery: the first set was a perspective scene of Whitehall itself, which prominently featured Jones's recently completed Banqueting House -- a sort of self- advertisement on the part of the architect.Michael Leapman, Inigo: The Troubled Life of Inigo Jones, Architect of the English Renaissance, London, Headline Book Publishing, 2003; p. 209. That scene changed to a cloudscape that contained the principal masquers, which in turn yielded to a forest setting. The show Jonson's text has an unusual cast, even by the standards of the masque form. It opens with the entrance of a personified Fame, accompanied by \\"the Curious\\" -- who are three, \\"the Eyed, the Eared, and the Nosed.\\" These three personifications of the sense organs were apparently costumed with multiple iterations of their specific parts; in one of his (or its?) speeches, the Eyed refers to his (or its) four eyes. Their conversation on the nature of Fame and Time is broken in upon by Chronomastix, a satyr with a whip or scourge. The main topic of this scene is the climate of political scandalmongering, satire, and libel that was considered epidemic at the time. Two anti-masques ensue; the first is of \\"Mutes,\\" in which the Curious adore Chronomastix and carry him out like a hero (though Fame sits out the dance); and the second is a dance of jugglers and tumblers who are ushered in by the Cat with the fiddle (from the Hey-diddle-diddle nursery rhyme). Once the tomfoolery is done, the serious portion of the masque begins: Saturn, the god of time, and Venus are shown with their votaries, followed by Cupid, Diana, and Hippolytus. The masquers are revealed, and they descend from their cloud and dance, performing \\"braules, corantos, and galliards.\\" Jonson vs. Jones Though Jonson expressed the appropriate establishmentarian disapproval of libel and scandal and political pamphleteering, the mere fact that he broached this increasingly delicate subject was questioned; the masque was not well received by its courtly audience. (British popular culture was then moving into a stage of increasingly aggressive religious and political controversy, especially involving Puritan commentators like William Prynne, who were deeply hostile to the reigning monarchy and the dominant social order.) Jonson also earned disapproval for parodying the then-significant, now-forgotten poet George Wither in the figure of Chronomastix.Jesse Franklin Bradley and Joseph Quincy Adams, eds., The Jonson Allusion Book: A Collection of Allusions to Ben Jonson from 1597 to 1700. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1922; p. 130.Michelle O'Callaghan, The Shepherd's Nation: Jacobean Spenserians and the Early Stuart Political Culture 1612-1625, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 2000; pp. 209-11. Wither enjoyed the patronage of both the King and the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Pembroke. A little more than a month after the staging of Time Vindicated, James consoled Wither by granting him and his heirs a 51-year patent (or copyright) on his Hymns and Songs of the Church, a translation of Biblical lyrics for musical settings by Orlando Gibbons, and potentially a very lucrative work.Joseph Loewenstein, The Author's Due: Printing and the Prehistory of Copyright, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2002; pp. 144-5. Conversely, Jones's share in the masque was praised and highly regarded, according to a contemporary: \\"They say it was performed reasonably well both for the device, and for the handsome conveyance and variety of the scene whereof Inigo Jones hath the whole commendation.\\"Heather Anne Herschfeld, Joint Enterprises: Collaborative Drama and the Institutionalization of the English Renaissance Theatre. Boston, University of Massachusetts Press, 2004; p. 64. Spellings modernized. This second-hand report is somewhat countered by the more exacting eye-witness verdict of the Venetian ambassador, who judged it \\"a spectacle of some pomp and beauty but not attaining the royal standard of excellence.\\"Leapman, p. 209. Publication The text of Time Vindicated was published in quarto in 1623, soon after its performance, as was not uncommon with the Court masques of the era. The text was reprinted in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641, and thereafter was included in the collected editions of the poet's works. Unusually, the masque was reprinted in a separate octavo edition in 1756.

She was then raised by her grandmother, who died when Hampton was seven years old. In 1909, the seven-year-old Hampton was put on a train to New York City, where she went to live with her aunt and uncle. Within a year Hampton ran away from that home, having been raped by her uncle and treated poorly by the family. From ages eight to 17, Hampton lived with a white family in New Jersey. In 1919, she was dubiously imprisoned for prostitution, which she saw as being lesbian encoded. After serving 13 months of a three year sentence in Bedford Hills, Hampton was released on condition she stayed away from New York.  Later life and career  In the 1920s, Hampton danced in all-black productions for Harlem Renaissance notables, including Jackie \\"Moms\\" Mabley. This artistic, political and cultural milieu provided Hampton access to other dancers, artists, and gays and lesbians. As dance work declined, Hampton left the chorus lines. As quoted by Erin Sexton-Sayler, Hampton explained, \\"I like to eat.\\" At this point, Hampton began what was to be her longest career: a cleaning woman for white families in New York City. Joan Nestle, the daughter of one of these families, went on to co-found the Lesbian Herstory Archives in New York City. Mabel Hampton enjoyed a romantic and sexual relationship with Lillian B. Foster (November 13, 1894 ‚Äì August 7, 1978), whom Hampton met in 1932. The two remained a couple until Foster's death in 1978. Along with her lesbian contemporaries, Hampton volunteered for the New York Defense Recreation Committee (1943); as part of this committee, she collected cigarettes and refreshments for American World War II soldiers. Hampton died on October 26, 1989 from pneumonia at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.  Legacy  With only her working-class income, Hampton managed to attend performances of the Negro Opera Company, as well as to contribute to the Martin Luther King Memorial Fund and, later, to gay and lesbian organizations. In addition to her financial contributions to gay and lesbian organizations, Hampton marched in the first National Gay and Lesbian March on Washington, and she appeared in the films Silent Pioneers and Before Stonewall. She was profiled posthumously in the documentary Not Just Passing Through. In 1984, Hampton spoke before thousands of onlookers at New York City Lesbian and Gay Pride Parade in 1984; there, she said, \\"I, Mabel Hampton, have been a lesbian all my life, for 82 years, and I am proud of myself and my people. I would like all my people to be free in this country and all over the world, my gay people and my black people.\\" She was the grand marshal for Pride march in 1985. Hampton left a legacy of invaluable archival materials to the Lesbian Herstory Archives. In particular, she donated her extensive lesbian pulp fiction collection to the Archives in 1976. As well, throughout her career and adult life in New York, Hampton collected memorabilia, ephemera, letters, and other records documenting her history, providing a window into the lives of black women and lesbians during the Harlem Renaissance, which she also donated to the Archives. In 1992, Joan Nestle delivered the first Kessler Lecture for the CUNY Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies, titled \\"I Lift My Eyes to the Hill\\": the Life of Mabel Hampton as Told by a White Woman.
