Its vision is to transform the Big Game into a nationwide movement inspiring people to give locally and make a collective impact on hunger. People collect monetary and food donations traditionally during the weeks leading up to and after Super Bowl Sunday. All of the money and food is then given directly to local charities of the group's choice. Started in 1990 at Spring Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina, the Souper Bowl of Caring has branched out to include schools, businesses and congregations of all faiths. Together, they have raised more than $163 million in monetary and food donations. In 2020, thousands of groups collected over $10.6 million of food and contributions. The Souper Bowl of Caring has gained national attention, securing partnerships with NFL Teams, in addition to finding National Advocates in former President and Mrs George H.W. Bush and former President and Mrs Jimmy Carter.  History  The Souper Bowl of Caring began in 1990 with a simple prayer said by Reverend Brad Smith at Spring Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina: 22 churches raised $5,700 in the first year. The number of groups involved has steadily grown each year, and so has the amount raised and put back into the communities. Souper Bowl of Caring History Time Line  Service Blitz  During the time before and after the Super Bowl, \\"Service Blitzes\\" are held in many communities nationwide. Young people come together to volunteer with and donate to local charities. This gives the participants an understanding of the complexities of hunger and poverty in our country and around the world. Some communities sponsor local events to raise awareness, others get their youth group or club involved with a soup kitchen to have a hands-on experience.  Youth Advisory Board  While Souper Bowl of Caring is led by adults and youth on the Board of Directors, the basis of the organization is its connection with young people serving their communities. Therefore, in 2007, a Youth Advisory Board (YAB) was created to bring youth ambassadors of the Souper Bowl to local communities around America. The YAB is composed of high school students from around the country who serve as youth spokespersons to the media, lead and advise their respective communities, assist the Souper Bowl of Caring by providing ideas and suggestions and represent the Souper Bowl in a positive manner. Additionally, they attend meetings to prepare for the upcoming service events.

Career A native of Boston, Massachusetts, and a member of the class of 1943 at Bowdoin College, Morse served for 3 years in the U.S. Navy, rising to the rank of lieutenant. He received his master's degree in 1947 and PhD under R. Bruce Lindsay in physics in 1949 from Brown University. There he was a faculty member from 1946 to 1964. He became an assistant professor in 1949, a full professor in 1958, physics department head in 1960, and college dean in 1962. In 1956, Morse took part in the National Academy of Science's Nobska Project, which was instrumental in the creation of the UGM-27 Polaris missile submarine. In 1964, he was named Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research and Development) for the United States Navy. Dissatisfied with the United States' role in Vietnam, Morse left the Navy in 1966 to become president of the Case Institute of Technology.

He was raised in Springville, Utah as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He served an LDS mission to Germany. In 1959, Jessee received his Master of Arts in LDS church history from the College of Religion at Brigham Young University (BYU), writing his thesis on the controversial topic of Mormon fundamentalism (D. Michael Quinn claims BYU restricted access to this paper for several years.) He then taught LDS Seminary for four years at West High School in Salt Lake City. In his career, Jesse was a respected archivist, editor and historian, as well as an authority on early Mormon handwriting. Davis Bitton called him one of the \\"[Mormon] historians who are deeply familiar with the sources on Mormon origins [yet] still find it possible to remain in the fold.\\" In addition to his mission, Jessee has served in his local Salt Lake City congregation as a home teacher and counselor of the high priest group, as well as a stake family history coordinator. Jessee married Margaret June Wood and they had eight children and reside in Salt Lake City.Personal Writings of Joseph Smith dust jacket. Jessee's younger brother Donald served in the LDS Church as president of the Oregon Portland Mission and as a Regional Representative. Church Historian's Office In 1964, Jessee was hired by the Church Historian's Office under Joseph Fielding Smith as an archivist in the church historical archives. While Leonard J. Arrington was researching a book on the Mormon development of western America, he met Jessee in the church archives during 1967. As a cataloguer of manuscripts, Jessee informed Arrington of many useful documents in the archive that historians had not yet studied. Arrington later recalled that at the time Jessee was \\"Intelligent, well-informed, hardworking, and modest,\\" and that \\"he knew more about the documents of LDS history than any other person.\\" In the late 1960s, Jessee was invited by Truman G. Madsen, at BYU's Institute of Mormon Studies, to publish articles on Joseph Smith and early Mormon history in BYU Studies. This began Jessee's research and publication in early Mormon manuscripts and historical documents. In 1972, Leonard J. Arrington became the official Church Historian. He requested the transfer of Jessee from the archives to the new History Division, a newly created, impressive team of historians for researching and writing of new Mormon histories. One such work, Jessee's 1974 Letters of Brigham Young to his Sons, caused Apostle Boyd K. Packer to bring concerns to the First Presidency about the Historical Department's \\"orientation toward scholarly work,\\" an early sign of the tension that would eventually lead to the History Division's disbandment. Jessee was also assigned by Arrington to locate, collect and transcribe all of Joseph Smith Jr.'s writings, a work inspired by the Thomas Jefferson Papers of the 1950s and those of other Founding Fathers. In the 1980s, Jessee was a major player in the Historical Department's examinations of important historical documents produced by Mark Hofmann, which were later found to be forgeries. Jessee was considered the preeminent expert on early Mormon handwriting, especially Joseph Smith's, and he authenticated and defended a number of Hofmann's forgeries,Texts from Hofmann's forgeries that Jessee identified as Joseph Smith holographs made it into the 1984 first edition of Jessee's The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith. A corrected second edition was published in 2002. including the famous \\"Salamander Letter\\". Hofmann's extensive deception of document and forgery experts led him to be called \\"unquestionably the most skilled forger this country has ever seen\\". Jessee served as a research historian in the church's Historical Department until 1981, when he was transferred to the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History at Brigham Young University (BYU). At BYU, he was also an associate professor of history and LDS Church history. Joseph Smith Papers As a Senior Historical Associate then Senior Research Fellow, Jessee served for nineteen years in the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute. During this time he continued his earlier work to produce the papers of Joseph Smith. In 1984, he published most of Smith's own writings and many of his dictations in The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith. This research continued to expand into two volumes of The Papers of Joseph Smith, one in 1989 on Smith's autobiographical and historical writings, and the other in 1992 on Smith's journals. Jessee's efforts were eventually made an official joint effort of BYU and the LDS Church in 2001, called the Joseph Smith Papers Project. This is intended to be a large multi-volume series, including virtually everything written by Joseph Smith, by his office, or under his direction. That year, Larry H. Miller, a Salt Lake City businessman and philanthropist, began funding the venture. In 2005, Miller announced the goal of completing the project by 2015, \\"while Dean Jessee is still around\\", since Jessee was then in his 70s. Jessee is general manager of the project along with Richard Bushman and Ron Esplin.

As built, the canal was made up of four distinct sections: * the branche Sud or southern branch, 224 km from the Sa√¥ne just north of Saint-Jean-de-Losne to the √éle Napol√©on basin and junction just east of Mulhouse, * the branche Nord or northern branch, 134 km from the Mulhouse junction to the Dusuzeau basin in the port of Strasbourg, * the 22-km-long Canal de Huningue, from the junction to the Rhine at Huningue, just north from the Swiss port of Basle, * the 10-km-long Belfort branch, which when built was to be the first section of the Canal de Montb√©liard √† la Haute- Sa√¥ne. Developments for high-capacity navigation in the second half of the 20th century thoroughly transformed this Y-shaped system. When the first lock was built on the Grand Canal d'Alsace at Kembs, a new cut was also excavated from Kembs to Niffer, and the rest of the Canal de Huningue was upgraded from here to the docks at Mulhouse. A 3-km-long section of the former Canal de Huningue, from Niffer to Kembs, is maintained and gives access to a boat harbour, while the remainder of that canal to Basel has been closed, and the terminal basin transformed into a whitewater canoeing course. Most of the northern branch was abandoned, and in the early 1980s the A36 motorway sliced through the canal embankment east of Mulhouse. Two sections were maintained and new cuts built from the Rhine to make them accessible: * the Colmar Canal or embranchement de Colmar 23 km long, from a new lock at Neuf-Brisach to Colmar, * a 34 km lateral canal starting from a new entrance lock at Rhinau and finishing in the basins of the port of Strasbourg. A further major upheaval, planned from the 1960s, was construction of a high-capacity waterway to connect the Rh√¥ne-Sa√¥ne corridor with the main European waterway network. This project was abandoned by Environment Minister Dominique Voynet in 1997. The section from Mulhouse to Neuf-Brisach is abandoned, while the 29 km section between Artzenheim and Friesenheim has been partially restored by Alsace Region, but works were stopped in 2009 for financial reasons. A cycle path was built along this section in 2011, extending the popular cycle path south from Strasbourg.  History  The first section of the Canal de Franche-Comt√© was authorised by Burgundy Council in 1783 and completed in 1802 from the Sa√¥ne to D√¥le. Napoleon was seeking to develop inland waterway connections throughout the country, and the Rh√¥ne-Rhine link was of such strategic importance that he gave his name to the project. The Emperor‚Äôs administration conceived the predecessor of today‚Äôs public-private partnership model, selling existing canals to private companies, to provide funds for new links. The proceeds were diverted for the war effort, and it was not until 1821 that this project, now renamed ‚ÄòCanal Monsieur‚Äô, was reactivated by the canal company set up for this purpose. Works were completed in 1833. Upgrading to Freycinet standards started in 1882, and the summit level was lowered, reducing the number of locks. The new high-capacity Rhine-Rh√¥ne waterway would have made the canal obsolete, but the environment minister Dominique Voynet cancelled that project in 1997. The Government then funded ‚Äì as compensation ‚Äì the backlog of maintenance works and other improvements, but with little impact on commercial traffic in 250-tonne p√©niches, which has all but disappeared.

Historical background The village is being built on brownfield land vacated by a former oil refinery, the Llandarcy Oil Refinery, owned by BP. The oil refinery was the first crude oil refinery in the UK, and was constructed between 1918 and 1922. The refinery produced diesel, kerosene and other products. During the post-war period, the refinery underwent large scale development as demand for products increased to 340,000 tonnes per year. Due to economic changes, it was announced in 1997 that the site would close. Planned outputs The ¬£1.2 billion planned community development will comprise 4,000 homes, community facilities, employment space and open space covering . Four new schools (1 Welsh primary, 2 English primaries and 1 secondary) are planned. Part of the development proposals includes a new southern access road linking the village to the Fabian Way (A483) into Swansea. The construction work is expected to create 3,000 to 4,000 jobs which includes jobs created directly in the construction industry and from related support services. The village is expected to become a home to some 10,000 people once development is complete.Swansea Bay News - Coed Darcy Urban Village Development could create 4000 jobs Planning and construction The design specification was developed with input from The Prince's Foundation and the village will be developed as an urban village in a similar fashion the Poundbury development, which is hoped will encourage people live and work in the same community. The development is expected to take 20 years to complete. The name of the village was suggested by members of Coedffranc Community Council. The village takes its name from the local parish of Coedffranc and the neighbouring village of Llandarcy. On 8 May 2007, it was announced that St. Modwen Properties was appointed as the preferred developer of the site. St. Modwen will lead the redevelopment and reclamation of the brownfield site, which is planned to take seven years. The remediation work involves removing contaminated material from the land which was deposited when the site was used as a refinery. The reclamation work involves removing the remaining unrequired oil refinery infrastructure such as pipeworks, buildings and roads, including the draining of a large reservoir at the northern part of the site. The full completion of the regeneration project is anticipated by 2026-8. Area one Work started on building the first 150 homes and 58 apartments, on of the site in June 2008 on a site at old refinery main entrance designated Area 1. The first properties, designed by Robert Adam, Director at ADAM Architecture were developed by Edward Ware Homes and Atlantic Properties Plc (Atlantic Ware Developments) with construction being carried out by Dawnus Construction.Projects + Buildings by Robert Adam Architects, UK Area One is marketed as Heritage Gate.Heritage Gate Main site Construction work on the main site began in November 2012 where 302 houses will be built on what will be the first of three residential neighborhoods on the site.BBC News - Coed Darcy: New community build on ex-BP site starts Controversies The development of the village has not been devoid of controversy. The residents' association of the neighbouring village of Llandarcy are concerned that the new development does not swallow up Llandarcy. Concerns were expressed about some green belt land being used up in addition to the brownfield site by the village and the new access road to the Fabian Way. The Countryside Council for Wales is monitoring the development of the village.

The village has a population of 1,000. History In the 6th-9th centuries this area has been inhabited by the Baltic tribe of Yotvingians. The first mention of the settlement comes from 1253 when it was recorded as \\"Weyze\\", which was most likely taken from the name of a nearby lake, which in turn was derived from the Lithuanian word vƒó≈æƒós, or crawfish.

Accessed 12 June 2010. of Cranston, Rhode Island, wherein lettered tiles are used to spell words. Nathanson conceived and developed the idea for the game with the help of his family. The name is derived from the founding family's claim that it's the \\"anagram game that will drive you bananas!\\" Beginning as a family innovation, Bananagrams was made available to the public in January 2006 at the London Toy Fair. The game is similar to the older Scrabble variant Take Two. Gameplay involves arranging one's tiles into a grid of connected words faster than one's opponents. The object of the game is to be the first to complete a word grid after the pool of tiles has been exhausted. The tiles come in a fabric banana-shaped package. Gameplay Bananagrams game bag and word tiles An arranged word grid with a newly drawn tile, \\"T\\" (left). In order to fit the \\"T\\" in, the \\"D\\" at the end of \\"F O O D\\" can be moved to another position at which it spells a valid word, yet where \\"T\\" would not spell a word, so that \\"T\\" can take \\"D\\"'s current position (right).The game consists of 144 lettered tiles that are placed face down on the playing surface. This is called the 'Bunch'. The same number of tiles is drawn by each player (between 11 and 21 depending on the number of players ‚Äì 1 to 8 people can play), and once a player calls out \\"Split!\\", all the players turn over their tiles to reveal the lettered sides. Each player races to create their own word grids by arranging the letters to form words connected in intersecting or interlocking manner (words should not be separate from one another). You may rearrange your grid as many times as you like ‚Äì the name \\"Bananagrams\\" is a play on the word anagrams, as one must often rearrange the words one has already formed in order to allow newly drawn tiles to be placed into one's grid. When a player uses up all of their tiles, they call out \\"Peel!\\" and each player must draw a new tile from the pool of remaining tiles (\\"the Bunch\\"). If at any time during play a player gets stuck with a tricky letter, the player can announce \\"Dump!\\" and exchange any letter for three tiles from the \\"Bunch\\". When there are fewer tiles in the \\"Bunch\\" than there are players, the first person to use up all their letters shouts \\"Bananas\\" and wins, becoming Top Banana if all of their words are valid. The letter distribution is as follows: *2: J, K, Q, X, Z *3: B, C, F, H, M, P, V, W, Y *4: G *5: L *6: D, S, U *8: N *9: T, R *11: O *12: I *13: A *18: E Comparison with other games Bananagrams uses elements of both Boggle and Scrabble. It is similar to Boggle in the sense that gameplay is simultaneous, yet players build interlocking puzzles similar to those in Scrabble. Because Bananagrams can be played by players at any (English) reading level, the game is useful for children who are learning to spell, and has been touted as both educational and popular among consumers. An independent psychologist reviewed Bananagrams and expressed her recommendation of Bananagrams as a positive example of creativity stimulation because, perhaps unlike Scrabble, the goal is to play all of one's tiles, which generates a need to configure and reconfigure one's word grid to accept all of the letters. Other tabletop word games that are played without a board include Anagrams, Dabble, Perquackey, Puzzlage, and Quiddler. Bananagrams is also similar to Syzygy, a letter-tile game released in 1997, and Double Quick. Awards Bananagrams has won numerous awards for its innovation, popularity among consumers, and educational value: *Game of the Year 2009 by TOTY Awards *Gold Award, Good Toy Guide (UK 2006) *Best Toy Bronze Award, Right Start Magazine (UK 2006) *Top Toy of the Year Award, Creative Child Magazine 2007 *NAPPA Honors Award, Parenthood.com Online gameplay An online version of Bananagrams was developed by Large Animal Games, in partnership with Majesco Entertainment. It ran from 2008 until 2012. The online version adhered to the same protocol as the tabletop edition, but certain gameplay adjustments and social features were also available. Players could play live games or send challenges to friends, and share completed games with one another. The game also included solitaire modes and \\"Banana Caf√©\\", where the objective was to beat one's own best time. The online game version offered players the opportunity to customize the game with \\"Banana Chip\\" credits. Banana Chips were earned by playing games and by issuing and winning challenges. They could be spent in the virtual store to purchase new tiles and playing boards, and to buy in-game hints and bonuses to gain an advantage over other players. Multi-tier achievements were also awarded to players in recognition of outstanding skill, and a leaderboard contained information pertaining to other players. Also from Bananagrams Bananagrams also publishes the games Bananagrams Duel, My First Bananagrams, Big Letter Bananagrams, Party Bananagrams, Appletters, Cobra Paw, Fluff, Fruitominoes, Spiky Dastards, Cheeky Butts, The Furglars, Pairsinpears, Word-a-Melon, and Zip-It.

It was traditionally sung by soldiers, popularised in 1974 by the Dutch band Hydra with three verses added to the chorus, and now is very popular for singing during long walks and bus journeys. The song is also popular amongst lesbians because potje is the diminutive of pot, originally a swearword for lesbian, but successfully reappropriated as a word for proud self-identification. It can be seen as the Dutch version of the similar English song \\"99 Bottles of Beer\\".

Male grips female at back of thorax with his (pale-coloured) mandibles Cicindela campestris, commonly called the green tiger beetle is a widespread Eurasian species of tiger beetle. It is the type species of the large genus Cicindela. Adult Adults are typically long. The elytra and thorax are green, varying in tone from light to dark, spotted with cream- coloured patches, and in bright sunlight are somewhat iridescent. The eyes are blackish; the legs are brown with whitish hairs. The antennae are long and straight, not clubbed. Close-up Behaviour The adults are sun-loving. They live in places with dry soils (sandy or chalky), mostly between May and October at the latitude of Britain. Like other tiger beetles, they run fast on their long legs and are most often seen on bare ground, in Britain typically on heather moorland. They can fly fast, making a loud buzzing noise.Chinery, M. page 110 It can run at speeds of 60 cm per second. Distribution Cicindela campestris is distributed across Europe from Spain in the southwest to Finland in the northeast. Most records are from the UK, Germany, Austria and the south of Sweden. In Britain, records are mainly from dry sandy or heathy areas such as the heathlands of Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset, and the mountains and moorlands of the Scottish Highlands. Subspecies The species is divided into several subspecies: *Cicindela campestris atlantis Mandl, 1944 *Cicindela campestris balearica Sydow, 1934 *Cicindela campestris cyprensis Hlisnikowsky, 1929 *Cicindela campestris nigrita Dejean, 1825 *Cicindela campestris olivieria Brull√©, 1832 *Cicindela campestris palustris Motschulsky, 1840 *Cicindela campestris pontica Fischer von Waldheim, 1825 *Cicindela campestris saphyrina Gen√©, 1836 *Cicindela campestris siculorum Schilder, 1953 *Cicindela campestris suffriani Loew, 1943 *Cicindela campestris calabrica Mandl, 1944 Ecology The mollicute bacterium species Entomoplasma freundtii (Entomoplasmatales, Entomoplasmataceae) can be isolated from the green tiger beetle.

Visual arts Major studied drawing and painting under the direction of painter Gus Nall (1919‚Äì1995) from 1952 to 1954.

Major's apprentice art work was first shown to the public in a group show in the mid-1950s at Gales Gallery on Sixty-Third Street, Chicago. The gallery owner, Mrs. Edna Powell Gale, featured the works of local artists.

Fiscal officers  A fiscal procurator (procurator Augusti) was the chief financial officer of a province during the Principate (30 BC ‚Äì AD 284). A fiscal procurator worked alongside the legatus Augusti pro praetore (imperial governor) of his province but was not subordinate to him, reporting directly to the emperor. The governor headed the civil and judicial administration of the province and was the commander-in-chief of all military units deployed there. The procurator, with his own staff and agents, was in charge of the province's financial affairs, including the following primary responsibilities:Mattingly (2006) 256 *the collection of taxes, especially the land tax (tributum soli), poll tax (tributum capitis), and the portorium, an imperial duty on the carriage of goods on public highways *collection of rents on land belonging to imperial estates *management of minesMattingly (2006) 507 *the distribution of pay to public servants (mostly in the military) The office of fiscal procurator was always held by an equestrian, unlike the office of governor, which was reserved for members of the higher senatorial order.Mattingly (2006) 256 The reason for the dual administrative structure was to prevent excessive concentration of power in the hands of the governor, as well as to limit his opportunities for peculation. It was not unknown for friction to arise between governors and procurators over matters of jurisdiction and finance.  Provincial governors  A procurator Augusti (often called the Praesidial Procurator, i.e., a garrison- or troop-commanding procurator), however, might also be the governor of the smaller imperial provinces (i.e., those provinces whose governor was appointed by the emperor, rather than the Roman Senate). The same title was held by the fiscal procurators, who assisted governors of the senatorial provinces, who were always senators. In addition, procurator was the title given to various other officials in Rome and Italy.Encyclopedia of the Roman empire, page 256, Matthew Bunson, Infobase Publishing, 2002. After the mid-first century, as a result of the Pax Romana, the provinces previously governed by prefects, who were military men, were gradually moved into the hands of procurators, who were essentially civilian fiscal officials. Egypt, as the special private domain of the emperor, which was administered by a Praefectus Augustalis, remained the exception. This transfer created some confusion among scholars dealing with Pontius Pilate, governor of Judaea, who was often thought to have been a procurator, until the excavation of the inscribed so-called Pilate Stone, which proved his title was prefect.Jerry Vardaman, A New Inscription Which Mentions Pilate as 'Prefect' , Journal of Biblical Literature Vol. 81, 1962. pp. 70‚Äì71.

Location The wilderness site of the Tanbi Wetland Complex, in Gambia, is on the southern channel at the mouth of the River Gambia. It encompasses a total area of about 6,000 hectares, of which mangroves make up 4,800 hectares, located to the west and south west of Banjul. The northernmost portion of the complex skirts the Kankujeri Road of Banjul and includes Cape Creek. It encompasses the western shores of St. Mary Island and extends to the south east towards Lamin and Mandinari Village. It was declared a Ramsar convention protected site in February 2007. Flora and habitat Eighty per cent of the Tanbi Wetland Complex is composed of mangrove forest which are made up of several species of mangroves which includes Avicennia africana, Conocarpus erectus, Laguncularia racemosa, Annona glabra and the Rhizophora spp with the occasional Baobab or Borassius aethiopicus standing on the drier ground. The vegetation gradually changes to the west and south into bare flats, salt marsh and dry woodland, with agricultural land encroaching around the fringes of the complex. There is a lattice work of tidal creeks, known locals as \\"bolongs\\", as well as tidal lagoons and estuarial saline mudflats. The complex has a role in retaining incoming water and rainfall, stabilizing the shoreline, the retention of sedimenst and nutrients and also controlling their erosiont, ground water replenishment and flood control, so Tanbi Wetlands acts as a hydrological buffer zone for the Banjul region. Fauna The complex is home to some troops of small monkeys, including troops of the Western red colobus while other interesting mammals recorded include the West African manatee, marsh mongoose and the Cape clawless otter. There are West African crocodiles as well as various snakes and lizards. Over 360 species of bird have been recorded in the complex including such interesting or charismatic species as Pel‚Äôs fishing owl, brown- necked parrot, blue-bellied roller and pygmy sunbird; while in the northern winter Palearctic migrants such as osprey, black-tailed godwit and Caspian tern are found. Climate change and global warming pose a particular threat to wildlife in the wetlands as sea levels rise. It is an important breeding area for the shrimp Farfantepenaeus notialis. Human activities The main human activities in and around the complex are shrimp fishing, market gardening and the cultivation of rice. During the dry season, a small number of women from the Jola forage for, roast and sell oysters which they harvest from the mangroves, the oysters are cooked with firewood collected at the same time.

The film takes its title from a successful Los Angeles musical revue, which ran on Broadway from December 25, 1940 to May 10, 1941. Vaughn Monroe and his orchestra, Spike Jones and his City Slickers, and Virginia O'Brien were also in the original stage cast. O'Brien sings the hit song \\"Say We're Sweethearts Again\\". Plot Welder William \\"Swanee\\" Swanson works at a shipyard in Morganville, Delaware. One day he sees the brightly shining Broadway star Julie Hampton speak in front of a crowd of workers at the yard, and he instantly falls in love with her. Luckily enough, Julie has promised to go on a date with the man who sells the most war bonds within a certain time limit. Swanee lies to Julie and tells her that he has $7,500 in pledges. He also tells the workers that Julie will kiss every worker who makes additional pledges to him. The crowd goes wild with excitement, and Swanee easily wins the prize. Swanee drives Julie up to the romantic Inspiration Point in his old car, trying to impress her. He also tells her about the musical he has written together with his cousin John, a U.S.M.C. It is about working men, and he even performs the theme love song for her. He calls the musical \\"Meet the People\\". She is impressed enough to show the musical screenplay to a Broadway producer, Monte Rowland, and the producer agrees to stage the play on the condition that he can use old costumes from previous shows. When the show is rehearsed, Swanee discovers that all the roles have glittery showbiz costumes, and don't look the least like working men. He is disappointed, and demands the costumes to be altered. Monte refuses and cancels the show, hoping that Swanee will surrender and give in. But he doesn't. Instead he leaves New York in anger, denounces Julie and the showbiz industry, and goes back to Morganville. Julie follows him there, determined to make him change his mind. She starts working at the shipyard as a welder, and finds out that she enjoys the work very much. She also makes a lot of new friends among her colleagues, who are eager to get to know the beautiful star. Julie continues dating Swanee, and she tells him about her motive for coming with him. She wants to change the show, and hire some out-of-work chorus friends of her to be on stage. Swanee likes the idea, and signs a new deal with Monte. But then he sees Julie posing for promotional photographs in her working outfit, and thinks she makes a mockery of him and his co-workers. He calls her egotistic and refuses to go through with the plans. Julie doesn't give up. During a pep talk speech to her co-workers at the shipyard, she leaves the microphone on behind the stage, and gets Swanee to confess his feelings for her. Everyone at the shipyard hears his words, and he is laughed at and ridiculed by his colleagues. Swanee calls Julie a hypocrite and storms away. Problem arises when John is on his way home from the service, because Swanee's uncle Felix has told John that the show he helped write is a hit on Broadway. Swanee has to produce the show somehow, and comes up with the idea to make it on the yard's 300th finished ship anniversary. But Julie refuses to take part, since she is determined on doing a show on her own, with the help of her friends from Broadway. John is disappointed when he arrives and learns the truth about the fate of \\"Meet the People\\". When Julie sees the disappointment in his eyes, she changes her mind and starts casting for the musical anyway. She and John stage and rehearse the musical while Swanee, unaware of their preparations, is away looking for funds to back up the musical. When he returns to find the musical is opening, he is delighted and impressed with Julie's work. Julie tells Swanee that she loves him, and they become a couple on stage in time for the musical's grand finale.\\"Full synopsis\\" TCM.com Cast * Lucille Ball as Julie Hampton * Dick Powell as William \\"Swanee\\" Swanson * Virginia O'Brien as \\"Woodpecker\\" Peg * Bert Lahr as The Commander * Rags Ragland as \\"Smitty\\" Smith * June Allyson as Annie * Steven Geray as Uncle Felix * Paul Regan as \\"Buck\\" * Howard Freeman as George Peetwick * Betty Jaynes as Steffi * John Craven as John Swanson * Morris Ankrum as Monte Rowland * Ziggie Talent as Ziggie * Mata and Hari as oriental dancers * Vaughn Monroe and His Orchestra as themselves * Spike Jones and His City Slickers as themselves Cast notes: *Lucille Ball's singing voice was provided by Gloria Grafton.

The Group was created in November 2005 through the merger of Henry Birks and Sons Ltd. (Canada) and Mayors Jewelers Inc. (United States). The company is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, with American corporate offices located in Tamarac, Florida.  History = Henry Birks and Sons  The Birks store in downtown Vancouver Birks Group traces its origins to the opening by Henry Birks of a small jewellery shop in Montreal in 1879. With an investment of CAD$3,000, Henry Birks opened in 1879 a small jewellery shop on Saint James Street in the heart of Montreal's financial and commercial district. In 1893, Birks entered into a partnership with his three sons (William, John and Gerald), and the name of the firm became Henry Birks and Sons. As the focus of Montreal's commercial centre moved northward towards Saint Catherine Street, the Birks store moved to new premises on Phillips Square in 1894, where the company still maintains a store and corporate offices. Starting in 1901, Birks oversaw the expansion of the company across Canada, with stores opening in the country's largest cities. In some cases, it bought local jewellers, adding its name to the local one (the Birks store in Toronto was Birks-Ryrie and the one in Winnipeg was Birks-Dingwall). The store on Phillips Square in Montreal opened in 1907. In 1934, Birks received a Royal Warrant of Appointment. In December 1934, Birks opened its first store in Vancouver. In 1954, the first Canadian shopping centre opened in Dorval and Birks is the first to open a jewelry store within a shopping centre. In 1953, Henry Birks and Sons bought out Roden Bros. Ltd., a company that produced silver hollowware, flatware, cut crystal, and medals.Giorgio B. (2014). American Sterling Silver Marks: Marks and hallmark of USA and Canada manufacturers of silver hollowware, flatware and jewelry. Retrieved from http://www.silvercollection.it/AMERICANSILVERMARKSRDUE.html In 1955, the company successfully sued the City of Montreal before the Supreme Court of Canada for forcing it to close on Catholic holidays, in Henry Birks & Sons (Montreal) Ltd v Montreal (City of).  Regaluxe Group  In 1993 Jonathan Birks sold the company to Italy-based Iniziativa Regaluxe SrL. The Birks Group is now publicly traded under the ticker symbol BGI. In 2001, the company completely renovated its flagship store on Phillips Square in Montreal. In November 2005, Henry Birks and Sons Ltd. and the American Mayors Jewelers Inc. merged to create the Birks & Mayors Group. In 2007, Birks was named as the official supplier of jewellery for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The Ottawa store on Sparks Street became a source of gifts to official parliamentary visitors during its existence. The freestyle skier Jennifer Heil was a spokeswoman for the company. In 2013, the group changed its name from Birks & Mayors to the Birks Group. In 2015, Birks caused some controversy after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gr√©goire-Trudeau, wore a number of their pieces to meet the Queen Elizabeth II. One of jewels was a maple leaf brooch that Birks had loaned to her. Since this brooch was worth $7,125, it raised questions regarding the ethics of such a loan.  UK development  The Birks Group sold the Mayors chain (founded in 1910 in Ohio) to Aurum in 2017. As part of the agreement between Birks and Aurum, the Birks Brand collections of fine jewelry will continue to be offered in 16 locations in the U.S. through the Mayors network. This transaction allowed the company to develop internationally, starting with the UK in October 2017. A month after it launched in the UK, Birks made headlines when Meghan Markle wore a pair of 18K yellow gold and opal earrings for her official engagement announcement to Prince Harry. This publicity increased the demand for the brand on digital stores and some inventories sold out. Meghan Markle supposedly holds Birks among her favorite jewellery brands, bought at least seven Birks pieces for approximately $20,000.  Activities  The Birks flagship store in Vancouver. Maison Birks is a designer, manufacturer and retailer of jewellery, timepieces, silverware and gifts, with stores and manufacturing facilities located in Canada and the United States. As of October 2017, it operates stores under two different retail banners: 28 Maison Birks stores across Canada (formerly Birks) and 2 Brinkhaus stores in Vancouver and Calgary. Maison Birks has six flagship stores in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. The company also operates one Rolex-branded store in Orlando.

The image looks smooth when zoomed out, but when a small section is viewed more closely, individual pixels can be distinguished. A pixel artist is a graphic designer who specializes in computer art and can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation. \\"On reflection, he said that 'I would have preferred to have brought in a more professional pixel artist.'\\" PDF version Similar to chromoluminarism used in the pointillism style of painting, in which small distinct points of primary colors create the impression of a wide selection of secondary and intermediate colors, a pixel artist works with pixels, the smallest piece of information in an image. The technique relies on the perceptive ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to mix the color spots into a fuller range of tones. Pixel art is often utilitarian and anonymous. Pixel design can refer to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated. Common uses of pixel design include print and broadcast media, web design and games. For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of design especially when utilizing pre-existing materials or using diverse elements. Pixel artists can also be a specialist in computer animation such as Computer Animation Production System users in post production of animated films and rendering (computer graphics) images like raster graphics. In the 2000s, pixel artists such as Tyler West, Stephane Martiniere and Daniel Dociu have gained international artistic recognition, due in part to the popularity of computer and video games. For instance the E3 Media and Business Summit, an annual trade show for the computer and video games industry, has a concurrent juried art show, \\"Into the Pixel\\" starting in 2003. Jurist and Getty Research Institute curator Louis Marchesano noted that most of the works were concept pieces used in the development of games. Pixel artists are also used in digital forensics, an emerging field, to both create and detect fraud in all forms of media including \\"the courts, politics and scientific journals\\". For instance, the Federal Office of Research Integrity has said that the percent of allegations of fraud they investigated involved contested images has risen from less than 3 in 1990 to 44.1 percent in 2006. History Computer art started in 1960s and by its nature is evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible. The term pixel art was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982.Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal, \\"ACM president's letter: Pixel Art\\", Communications of the ACM, Vol. 25, Issue 12, Dec. 1982. Adobe Systems, founded in 1982, developed the Postscript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular. Adobe Illustrator, a vector drawing program based on the Bezier curve, was introduced in 1987 and Adobe Photoshop followed in 1990.Wands, Bruce. (2006) Art of the Digital Age, Thames & Hudson. Adobe Flash, a popular set of multimedia software used to add animation and interactivity to web pages, was introduced in 1996. In the 2000s, pixel artists have been employed increasingly in video games and, to a lesser extent in music videos. These artists have remained somewhat underground until the mid-2000s. In 2006 R√∂yksopp released \\"Remind Me\\", illustrated completely by pixel art, which the New York Times cited as amazing and hypnotic. (See video here .) Background smiley face in the top left corner as an RGB bitmap image. When zoomed in, it might look like the big smiley face to the right. Every square represents a pixel. Zooming in further, the individual pixels can be analyzed, with their colors adjusted by adding the values for red, green and blue. A pixel artist is one of the new media artists that employs technology while also utilizing traditional media and art forms. They may have a fine arts background such as photography, painting or drawing but self-taught designers and artists are also able to accomplish this work. They are often required to employ imaging and a full range of artistic and technological skills including those of conceptual artists. In digital imaging, a pixel (picture element) is the smallest piece of information in an image. The word pixel is based on a contraction of pix (for \\"pictures\\") and el (for \\"element\\"); similar formations with el for \\"element\\" include voxel, luxel, and texel. Pixels are normally arranged in a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots, squares, or rectangles. Each pixel is a sample of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three or four components such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Neuroplasticity is a key element of observing many pixel images. While two individuals will observe the same photons reflecting off a photorealistic image and hitting their retinas, someone whose mind has been primed with the theory of pointillism may see a very different image as the image is interpreted in the visual cortex. Techniques Invader A pixel does not need to be rendered as a small square. This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering. The total number of pixels (image resolution), and the amount of information in each pixel (often called color depth) determine the quality of an image. For example, an image that stores 24 bits of color-information per pixel (the standard for computer displays since around 1995) can represent smoother degrees of shading than one that only stores 16 bits per pixel, but not as smooth as one that stores 48 bits. Likewise, an image sampled at 640 x 480 pixels (and therefore containing 307,200 pixels) will look rough and blocky compared to one sampled at 1280 x 1024 (1,310,720 pixels). Because it takes a large amount of data to store a high-quality image, computer software often uses data compression techniques to reduce this size for images stored on disk. Some techniques sacrifice information, and therefore image quality, in order to achieve a smaller file-size. Computer scientists refer to compression techniques that lose information as lossy compression. Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 pixels per inch (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 dots per inch (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor. Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process (CMYK) printing. Drawings usually start with what is called the line art, which is the basic line that defines the item the artist intends to create. Line arts can be either traced over scanned drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a mouse or a graphics tablet and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling painting, also exist, such as knowledge of the color theory. The limited palette often implemented into pixel art usually promotes the use of dithering in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made anti-aliasing is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.

Small Memorial Stadium is a baseball park in Jacksonville, Florida. It is located in the Durkeeville community in northwest Jacksonville. Constructed in 1912 and rebuilt in 1936, it was the city's first municipal recreation field, and served as its primary baseball park before the construction of Wolfson Park in 1954. Throughout the years the stadium has been known at various times as Barrs Field, Durkee Field, and the Myrtle Avenue Ball Park. History=Barrs Field era The original facility was constructed in 1911‚Äì1912 on a patch of land owned by Joseph H. Durkee, a former Union officer during the American Civil War who had settled in Jacksonville, where he became a prominent businessman and politician. In 1911, Durkee's son Jay Durkee turned control of the property over to Amander Barrs, a local businessman and President of the Jacksonville Baseball Association. Barrs ordered the construction of a recreational field to be used by local teams on the property. The facility was completed in 1912 and was known as Barrs Field, but was generally known as the Myrtle Avenue Ball Park to locals.Foley, Bill (March 13, 1999). \\"Millennium Moment: March 13, 1926\\". The Florida Times- Union. Retrieved June 29, 2011. One early tenant was the Jacksonville Athletics, an African-American club for which James Weldon Johnson played. One of the rare professional clubs was the Jacksonville Scouts of the Florida State League, who played in 1921. However, as the city had no municipal park, other teams used fields at the Jacksonville Fairgrounds or across the river in South Jacksonville during this time. In addition to local teams, Major League clubs including the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers held their spring training at the field. The Philadelphia Athletics were the first major league team to use Barrs Field for spring training, from 1914 until 1918. In 1918, the Pittsburgh Pirates held their spring training at the ballpark. From 1919 until 1920, the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers called Barrs Field their spring training home. The Dodgers would return for one last spring at Barrs in 1922. Durkee Field era The lack of a city park led both major and minor league teams to avoid Jacksonville after 1922. In 1926, the city government decided to purchase Barrs Field from Durkee in hopes of bringing back professional baseball. On March 13, 1926, the city signed a binder to purchase the park, which was renamed Durkee Field. Shortly after this, the city entered into negotiations to bring a Southeastern League franchise to the city. This was successful, and the original incarnation of the Jacksonville Tars was born. In 1932, the city purchased Durkee Field for $348,000. The original stadium was destroyed in a fire in 1936, but the city immediately rebuilt it in 1936‚Äì1937. The new structure was larger, and included a section for African-American patrons in the era of segregation. In 1938 and from 1941 to mid-1942, Jacksonville's only Negro league franchise, the Jacksonville Red Caps of the Negro American League, used the park as their home field. The Jersey City Giants held spring training at the ballpark in 1946. In that year, the Giants were scheduled to play against a Montreal Royals team that included Jackie Robinson and John Wright, who were in the process of integrating organized baseball. The Giants-Royals game was scheduled for On March 24, 1946 at Durkee Field; however, the Jacksonville Playground and Recreation Board prohibited \\"white and Negro athletes\\" from playing together in their facilities, and they pledged to bar Robinson and Wright from the park. The Royals, with support from the Dodgers, refused to leave Robinson and Wright at Montreal's training camp in Daytona Beach, and they canceled the game. In 1953, Jacksonville businessman Samuel W. Wolfson purchased the Jacksonville Tars franchise and reorganized the team as the Jacksonville Braves, a Class A affiliate of the Milwaukee Braves Major League Baseball club. Among the major changes Wolfson introduced was racial integration. Three black players from the Braves farm system ‚Äì Hank Aaron, F√©lix Mantilla, and Horace Garner ‚Äì came to Jacksonville, making the Braves one of the first integrated teams in the South Atlantic League and in the state of Florida.Foley, Bill (October 22, 1997). \\"Braves ousted again: It's the Jacksonville jinx\\". The Florida Times- Union. Retrieved June 29, 2011. The following year, the city started construction on Wolfson Park, and the Braves moved out upon its completion. Later use and renovation After its replacement as the municipal ballpark, Durkee Field continued to be used by local high schools and colleges, including Edward Waters College, Raines High School, and Stanton High School. By the late 1970s the stadium was in disrepair, and it was scheduled for demolition. Local advocates pushed to save the park, and in 1980 Jacksonville City Council member Sallye B. Mathis sponsored legislation to renovate it and rename it for J. P. Small, who served as a teacher, band director, coach, and athletic director at Stanton High from 1934 to 1969. Renovations included structural repairs, a new roof, press box and dugouts, paving the parking lot, a new playscape, and lighted fields. Councilwoman Denise Lee and Mayor Jake Godbold hosted a rededication ceremony at the park. Following the demolition of Wolfson Park in 2002, J. P. Small Ballpark became the last historic park in the city of Jacksonville. In May 2003 the Jacksonville City Government pushed forward legislation that would give J. P. Small Ballpark a permanent historical marker. Further renovation in 2006 included a small museum. In July 2013, the park was added to the National Register of Historic Places under the name Joseph E.

He was also brother-in-law to Kansas City crime boss Anthony Civella. Born in Brooklyn, New York, DeLuna rose through the ranks of the family to eventually become underboss and second-in-command to Nicholas Civella. He was said to be personally responsible for the ambush of a rival mob crew, the Spero brothers, at the Virginia Tavern in Kansas City, Missouri in 1978. A well-respected and trusted mobster, DeLuna maintained the family's close ties with the Chicago Outfit, the Frank Balistrieri family in Milwaukee, and the Cleveland family during the mob infiltration of several Las Vegas casinos in the mid-1970s. Artie Piscano (portrayed by Vinny Vella) in the film Casino was based in large part on Carl DeLuna. In the film, Piscano dies of a heart attack during a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raid on his home. In reality, DeLuna's home was raided on February 14, 1979 and it was found that he kept extensive cryptic notes hidden in his basement which, together with wiretaps, connected all the dots the FBI needed in linking the mob to illegal control of Las Vegas casinos. He was tried and sentenced to 20 years for his crimes. Chicago Outfit mobsters, including its then reputed boss, Joseph Aiuppa, were convicted along with DeLuna, based on the evidence seized from him. As a result, all cooperation between other Midwestern organized crime families and the Kansas City LCN was terminated. \\"Mob Families Go Separate Ways,\\" Jonathan Koziol, Chicago Tribune 29 July 1987 DeLuna was released from prison in 1998 and died in Kansas City in 2008.

The current one stands in Hackensack, New Jersey. History The current Bergen County Courthouse is not the first courthouse but actually the sixth courthouse built for Bergen County. In 1683 four counties were created in East Jersey and they were Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth. In 1710 Hackensack became the county seat in Bergen. In 1715 the first courthouse was built and it was located three blocks from the current courthouse. The courthouse also housed a jail. The second courthouse was built in 1734 near the ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù, but was burned by the British in 1780 during the Revolutionary War. The third courthouse, a log building, was then built in Oakland. This was considered a temporary location and the courthouse later moved to the home of John Hopper in Ho-Ho-Kus. After the war, the courthouse was moved to the house of Archibald Campbell of Hackensack. Freeholder Peter Zabriskie later donated land near his Hackensack home located at the northeast corner of Main and Bridge Streets and in 1786 a new courthouse and jail opened. Peter Zabriskie's home, called ‚ÄúThe Mansion‚Äù was also called ‚ÄúWashington‚Äôs Headquarters‚Äù because George Washington frequently was a guest there. Years later the Mansion became a hotel. The Mansion was then torn down in 1945. In 1822 due to space limitations, a new courthouse was built at the location of the current courthouse and it was utilized for over 90 years. The current courthouse is the sixth Bergen County courthouse. James Riely Gordon, a civil engineer, born in Winchester, Virginia, won a competition to design the Bergen County courthouse. The style of the courthouse building is known as American Renaissance. Construction began in 1910 and was completed in 1912 at a cost of one million dollars. The jail was also completed in 1912 and the style of the jail is medieval revival. The courthouse was placed on the New Jersey and National Registers of historic places in 1982 and 1983. Enoch Poor's burial site. Bergen County Court House is in the background. The Green is a public square located across the street from the courthouse at the corner of Main Street and Court Street. On the west side of the green is a marker showing where the second courthouse stood before it was burned by the British in 1780. A bronze statue is located at the intersection of Court Street and Washington Place. This statue is of General Enoch Poor. General Poor, a New Hampshire native, was a hero at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. General Poor served under General Washington. He was in New Jersey organizing an army to raid New York City. General Poor died in 1780 and is buried across the street from the Green at the Dutch Reformed Church. General Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette attended General Poor's funeral. Construction The interior dome of the rotunda area of the courthouse is modeled after the Pantheon in Rome. On the first floor of the rotunda building there was a fountain. The fountain was removed in 1930. In the 1930s as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), murals were painted in courtrooms 253 and 352. In the early 1940s an additional mural was added in courtroom 357. All three murals were designed by Teaneck resident William Winter. The murals in room 352 (formerly known as the Supreme Court Room) represent the roots of American Law. The murals in room 253 (formerly known as the Freeholder Chambers) represent local historical sights. The murals in room 357 (formerly known as the Circuit Court Chamber) represent Roman Law. There are four stained glass skylights in the rotunda building. The first is located in the rotunda dome and it measures eight feet in diameter. Eight trapezoidal sections carry the name of a historically significant English or American jurist. The three remaining skylights contain the Bergen County seal. The glass utilized for these skylights was made by M.J. Lamb. The interior of the rotunda and its courtrooms were treated with marble, scagliola, bronze and cast iron. The exterior walls of the courthouse rotunda building were made from Vermont marble. On top of the dome is a copper figure entitled ‚ÄúEnlightenment Giving Power‚Äù by Johannes Gelert. Around the drum of the dome is a relief consisting of forty panels that represent twelve tablets of the first Roman Law. Five bronze eagles adorn the balustrades on the corners of the building. The eagles and ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù were resurfaced with gold leaf in 1994. There are four sculptures on the front of the rotunda building that faces Court Street. Two of the sculptures each contain three figures. The left group consists of Truth holding a mirror flanked by Justice and Integrity. The right group consists of Honor flanked by Law and Order. There are two statues located on the walls of the main steps. The left statue represents History and the right statue represents Law. Construction for the Administration Building started in 1929 and was completed in 1933. The style of this building is called neoclassical. The exterior walls of the Administration Building were made from Arkansas limestone. The Annex building that joins the Administration Building with the rotunda building was completed in 1958. In popular culture The historical charm of the courthouse has even caught the eye of Hollywood.

Grunthal was born in Zehdenick, Province of Brandenburg. In 1945, after having heard the news of Hitler's death, she had called out aloud with relief, \\"Gott sei Dank, dann ist der furchtbare Krieg endlich zu Ende\\". (English: \\"Thank god, then this terrible war will be over at last\\", different version: \\"Thank God, then there will be peace\\".) She was heard by SS guards who were on their way to bring prisoners from Ravensbr√ºck and Sachsenhausen concentration camps on so-called death marches towards the west. For having spoken this single sentence, Grunthal was hanged by SS men on 2 May 1945 on the Schwerin Central Station square - only hours before American troops entered the city. Today, the station square is named after Marianne Grunthal, as is a street in Zehdenick. The lamp post on which she was hanged is still standing, bearing a memorial plaque. Her grave is situated on the Nordfriedhof (Northern cemetery) in the City of Zehdenick (State of Brandenburg).

The name is a portmanteau word formed from \\"quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe\\". Technique The sample (fruits, vegetables, tobacco, etc.) is homogenized and centrifuged with a reagent and agitated for 1 minute. The reagents used depend on the type of sample to be analyzed. Following this, the sample is put through a dispersive solid phase extraction cleanup prior to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography or liquid- liquid chromatography. Samples prepared using the QuEChERS method can be processed more quickly using a homogenization instrument. Such instruments can homogenize the food sample in a centrifuge tube, then agitate the sample with the reagent of choice, before moving the extracted sample for centrifuging. By using such an instrument, the samples can be moved through the QuEChERS method more quickly. Some modifications to the original QuEChERS method had to be introduced to ensure efficient extraction of pH-dependent compounds (e.g., phenoxyalkanoic acids), to minimize degradation of susceptible compounds (e.g., base and acid labile pesticides) and to expand the spectrum of matrices covered.

In other locations, the pickaxe and shovel fill the same purpose The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to mining: Mining - extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, usually (but not always) from an ore body, vein or (coal) seam. Any material that cannot be grown from agricultural processes, or created artificially in a laboratory or factory, is usually mined.  Basic Concepts  *Mining engineering *Resource extraction  Geology of mining =Basic terms * Mineral * Rock (geology), an aggregate material usually made up of a number of minerals * Ore, rock containing a desired mineral ** Ore genesis, the geological processes by which ore is formed and deposited ** Ore grade, the amount of a desired mineral or metal that a quantity of ore contains ***high grade ores are rich in the mineral desired, low-grade ores have less of the mineral desired ** Gangue, minerals within the ore that are not desired; these are removed during ore processing **Vein (geology) a geological formation that often contains ore * Overburden, the material on top of a given mineral deposit (in surface mining, it has to be removed) Finding ore *Prospecting *Mineral exploration  Materials mined  Some examples of materials that are extracted from the earth by mining include: * Base metals ** Bauxite (Aluminium) ** Cassiterite (Tin) ** Chromite (Chromium) ** Cinnabar (Mercury) ** Cobaltite (Cobalt) ** Coltan (Niobium and Tantalum) ** Columbite (Niobium) ** Copper ‚Äì see List of copper ores ** Ilmenite (Titanium) ** Iron ore (Iron) ** Galena (Lead) ** Magnesite (Magnesium) ** Malachite (Copper) ** Molybdenite (Molybdenum) ** Pentlandite (Nickel) ** Pyrolusite (Manganese) ** Scheelite (Tungsten) ** Sphalerite (Zinc) ** Tantalite (Tantalum) ** Wolframite (Tungsten) * Baryte (Barium) * Beryl (Beryllium and Gemstones) * Clay * Construction aggregates ** Gravel ‚Äì see Gravel pit ** Sand ‚Äì see Sand mining * Diamonds * dolomite (ornamental stone, Magnesium) * Fossil fuels ** Coal ‚Äì see Coal mining ** Oil sands ** Oil shale ‚Äì see Oil shale industry and Shale oil extraction * Gemstones * Kaolinite * Limestone * Phosphorite (Phosphate) * Precious metals ** Gold ‚Äì see Gold mining ** Silver ‚Äì see Silver mining ** Platinum * Potash * Rare-earth elements * Slate ‚Äì see Slate industry * Rock salt * Stone ‚Äì see Quarry ** List of decorative stones * Sulfur * Uranium ore  Types of mining and techniques=Surface mining *Surface mining, mining conducted down into the ground, but with the sky open above * Open-pit mining, where the overburden is removed and put in a different location, leaving a large pit at the end. * Strip mining, where the overburden is stripped off and placed onto the area where the mineral (usually coal) has already been mined out, allowing the surface to be returned to roughly how it was before * Mountaintop removal mining, where the overburden on a mountain is pushed off the mountain into the adjacent valley * Quarrying * Placer mining * Dredging * Hydraulic mining, using high-pressure jets of water to blast soil or hillsides apart Underground mining *Sub-surface mining, mining conducted underground **Two main types of underground mining, classified by the characteristic of the rock being mined: ***Underground mining (hard rock) ***Underground mining (soft rock) **There are three directions by which an underground mine may be conducted: * Drift mining, mining horizontally * Shaft mining, mining vertically * Slope mining, mining at an inclined angle **Stoping is the process of extracting out the ore from underground, leaving a hole called a stope * Room and pillar * Longwall mining * Retreat mining * Fire-setting, a method used in stoping by setting fires to timber and letting the resulting collapse break up the rock Other methods * Borehole mining * Box cut * Deepsea mining * Glory hole (petroleum production) * Heap leaching * In-situ leach * Landfill mining * Mine reclamation * Omega Hydraulic Diggings * Quartz reef mining  Mining equipment =ExcavationHeavy machinery= * Steam shovel, used from the 19th century to the 1930s * Power shovel, derived from the steam shovel, but using electricity instead of steam * Excavator, derived from the steam shovel, but using hydraulics or pneumatics instead of steam * Draglines use buckets attached to long cable lines, rather than affixed to a beam * Bucket-wheel excavator, the largest moving land machines ever built * Dredge Blasting Rock blasting *Explosives **Gunpowder or black powder, used from the 17th century to the mid-19th century **Dynamite, used from the mid-19th century into the 20th century, still used some today **ANFO, used from the 20th century, and the primary explosive in use today *Blasting gear **Detonator, a small explosive charge used to set off the main explosive **Blasting machine, a device used to generate or send an electric charge to the denators Transport *Vertical equipment ** Hoist (mining) ** Winding engine ** Headframe *Equipment for transporting miners ** Man engine ** Mantrip Engines used in mining * Archimedes' screw * Beam engine * Drilling rig * Loader (equipment) * Wheel tractor-scraper Liquid mining * Pumpjack * Wellhead * Subsea Safety and environment * Safety lamp * Miner's canary * Air classifier * Movement and Surveying Radar Processing *Ore dressing **General methods of ore processing ***Froth flotation ***Trommel **Methods peculiar to gold placer mining.

Proven natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic, constitute the country's most important mineral resource. More than 80% of the country's energy sources are imported. The energy sector is highly dependent on imports from abroad: in 2006 the country imported more than 86% of its total energy consumption. In the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy, ranking as the world's fifth largest solar energy producer in 2009 and the sixth largest producer of wind power in 2008.Global installed wind power capacity (MW) Global Wind Energy Council 6.2.2008 In 1987, after the Chernobyl disaster, a large majority of Italians passed a referendum opting for phasing out nuclear power. The government responded by closing existing nuclear power plants and completely putting a halt to the national nuclear program. Italy also imports about 16% of its electricity need from France for 6.5 GWe, which makes it the world's biggest importer of electricity. Due to its reliance on expensive fossil fuels and imports, Italians pay approximately 45% more than the EU average for electricity.\\"Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries .\\" Australian Uranium Association.

As part of the agreement, ENEL received a 12.5% stake in the project and direct involvement in design, construction, and operation of the plants. In another move, ENEL also bought 66% of the Slovak Electric utility that operates six nuclear reactors. As part of this agreement, ENEL will pay the Slovak government EUR 1.6 billion to complete a nuclear power plant in Mochovce, which has a gross output of 942 MWe.

Japan The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident since 1986, displaced 50,000 households after radiation leaked into the air, soil and sea. Radiation checks led to bans of some shipments of vegetables and fish. Prior to the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011, and the nuclear disasters that resulted from it, Japan generated 30% of its electrical power from nuclear reactors and planned to increase that share to 40%. Nuclear energy was a national strategic priority in Japan, but there had been concern about the ability of Japan's nuclear plants to withstand seismic activity. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant was completely shut down for 21 months following an earthquake in 2007. The European Parliament's Greens-EFA Group ‚Äì The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2007 p. 23. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused the failure of cooling systems at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on March 11 and a nuclear emergency was declared. 140,000 residents were evacuated. The total amount of radioactive material released is unclear, as the crisis is ongoing. On 6 May 2011, Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordered the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be shut down as an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher is likely to hit the area within the next 30 years. Problems in stabilizing the Fukushima I nuclear plant had hardened attitudes to nuclear power. As of June 2011, \\"more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are anti-nuclear and distrust government information on radiation\\". As of October 2011, there have been electricity shortages, but Japan survived the summer without the extensive blackouts that had been predicted. An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says \\"public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged\\" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power. Many of Japan's nuclear plants have been closed, or their operation has been suspended for safety inspections. The last of Japan's 54 reactors (Tomari-3) went offline for maintenance on May 5, 2012., leaving Japan completely without nuclear-produced electrical power for the first time since 1970. Despite protests, on 1 July 2012 unit 3 of the ≈åi Nuclear Power Plant was restarted.

Burrell died at the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick, whilst still in prison custody on 4 August 2016, aged 63, from lung and liver cancer. Legal cases=Murder of Kerry Whelan Kerry Whelan was last seen getting into a Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel-drive with Burrell leaving the Parkroyal Hotel in Parramatta during May 1997, the day after which Whelan's husband Bernie Whelan received a $1 million ransom note. Whelan's body has never been found The kidnap and conviction became one of Australia's most infamous crimes. Burrell, who had been a friend and former employee of the Whelan family, was charged in 1999, which were subsequently dropped, but re-instated in 2002, after a formal inquest. The first trial in 2005 ended with a hung jury, but Burrell was convicted on the second trial in 2006. Burrell was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and 16 years‚Äô jail for the kidnapping charge. Burrell was unsuccessful in an appeal against his conviction and sentence to the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, constituted by the Chief Judge at Common Law, Peter McClellan and Justices Sully and James.. The Court of Criminal Appeal discovered it had made factual errors in its judgment and purported to reopen the appeal, heard from the parties before confirming its orders dismissing the appeal.. On 31 July 2008 the High Court held that the Court of Criminal Appeal had no power to reopen the appeal after the orders had been formally recorded and that the error in the judgment on 16 March 2007 meant that those orders must be set aside and the matter remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal, Beazley JA, Grove and Howie JJ dismissed the appeals.. Dorothy Davis Dorothy Davis was a 74-year-old wealthy widow living in Lurline Bay, Sydney. On 30 May 1995, Davis left her apartment to visit Burrell's wife. She was never seen again. Burrell was charged with Davis's murder and later found guilty by a jury, stating financial gain as a motive.R v Burrell - Dorothy Davis - LIAC Crime Library - Research guides at State Library of New South Wales Burrell was sentenced to 28 years in prison with a non parole period of 21 years.

During its career the band released five studio albums and one demo, the latter being released while the band was still called Flegeton. HistoryYearning official myspace Yearning was formed in 1994 under the name \\"Flegeton\\". The original line-up consisted of Juhani Palom√§ki on guitars and vocals and Toni Kristian on drums. The band started to write own music and soon Tero Kalliom√§ki joined the band as a guitarist. Soon after, Flegeton made a 4-track tape titled \\"Through the Desolate Lands\\", but it was never widely distributed. In July 1995, Flegeton, with a new bass player, Mr. Woodland (aka Petri Salo), went into MDM studios to record their demo \\"The Temple of Sagal\\". The demo received praise from enthusiasts of melancholy music. It also got the attention of the French record company Holy Records, which Flegeton contracted with for two full- length studio albums. In February 1996, the band went into Tico-Tico Studios to record some new material. At this point, the band was renamed Yearning, since the band believed that their old name didn't fit their music anymore. They also recorded the song \\"Autumn Funeral\\" during these sessions. ‚ÄùAutumn Funeral‚Äù appears on the Holy Records compilation album The Holy Bible. Between September 16 and September 29, 1996, Yearning recorded their first album, With Tragedies Adorned in Tico-Tico Studios. The album was engineered and produced by Ahti Kortelainen.Juhani Palom√§ki interview @ visions-underground.comWith Tragedies Adorned @ discogs.com The album was released on February 28, 1997 and during the following spring the band was busy promoting their newly released album and performing live. The band went into the same studio again on October 18 and October 19, 1997 to record a cover of the Paradise Lost song \\"Eternal\\" which would appear on a Paradise Lost tribute album released by Holy Records. Afterwards, Yearning did their first European tour in December 1997 and January 1998. They toured along with the bands Nightfall and Sup. In August and September 1998, Yearning entered Tico-Tico studios again to record their second studio album, Plaintive Scenes. It would eventually be released in February 1999. The year 1999 would also mark the departure of three members, guitarist Tero Kalliom√§ki, bassist Mr. Woodland, and flutist and female vocalist Lady Tiina Ahonen. They left because of personal and musical disagreements. After several big fights, Yearning's line-up now consisted of Juhani Palom√§ki handling vocal, guitar, bass guitar, and keyboard duties, while Toni Kristian was still on percussion. The stripped line-up went into Tico Tico Studios in May 2000 to record their third studio album Frore Meadow. Along with the change in line-up, the music changed as well, taking more influence from progressive rock, gothic metal, and classical music. Frore Meadow was released through Holy Records on January 15, 2001. Due to changes in line-up, Yearning had to recruit musicians to play live, ending up with Matti S. on guitar, Jani Loikas on bass, and Jouni Jormanainen (Jouni Huttunen since 2007) on keyboards. The live line-up would remain unchanged for the next 9 years. In 2001 Yearning also toured France with labelmates Gloomy Grim and Misanthrope. Yearning did not perform actively during 2002 but new material was composed and arranged very carefully during the time of silence. The outcome would result in Yearning's fourth studio album, Evershade. The album was recorded during June 2003 in Astia Studios with Anssi Kippo as a co- producer. Evershade was released at the end of September 2003. Yearning performed live twice after the release of this album, one concert in Helsinki, and another in Riihim√§ki, the band's hometown. With the release of Evershade, the contract with Holy Records came to an end, leaving Yearning without a record company. The band negotiated with several labels, including Holy Records, on upcoming releases, but many of these negotiations were unproductive and none led to a satisfactory result. During this time Yearning was rather inactive, performing live only occasionally ‚Äì partially because the band's drummer and other founding member Toni Kristian had developed a serious addiction problem. Still, during this seemingly quiet period, new material was being written and contract negotiations were being held. Eventually, Toni Kristian was replaced with Aki Kuusinen and a one-album contract offer from Holy Records was accepted. With a new contract in pocket, Yearning headed into D-studio in Klaukkala, Finland with musical engineer Olli Haaranen (also known as the guitarist for Colosseum) to record their fifth studio album Merging into Landscapes. Recording took place between March 3 and March 23, 2007. The album was mixed by Jarno H√§nninen and mastered at Elektra Mastering. Guest musicians on the album included Tiina Sitomaniemi, who sang also on Plaintive Scenes, and Tuukka Koskinen, lead vocalist of Saattue and Let Me Dream. Merging into Landscapes was released July 1, 2007. Juhani Palom√§ki died on May 15, 2010.A memorial page for Juhani Palom√§ki on Facebook Juhani was the primus motor and the only remaining full-time founding member of Yearning, hence the band no longer exists after his death. The other members (official or live) have decided not to perform as Yearning nor play Yearning material without Juhani.
