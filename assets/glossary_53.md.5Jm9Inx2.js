Her role as a campaigner began in 2014 after her 11-year-old son Luke Batty was murdered by his father Greg Anderson. As a campaigner, she has spoken publicly about her experiences as a survivor of domestic violence to raise public awareness and advocate for social changes. Batty is considered to have had a significant influence on national public attitudes, philanthropy, government initiatives and funding, support services and police and legal procedures related to domestic violence in Australia. In 2016, then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said of domestic violence in Australia that \\"cultural change requires a great advocate and Rosie has been able to do that in a way that I think nobody has done before\\". On 10 June 2019, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the general division as part of the Queen's Birthday 2019 Honours recognition for her \\"distinguished service to the community as a campaigner and advocate for the prevention of family violence\\". Background Batty was born in England and raised on a farm in Laneham in the English county of Nottinghamshire by her father along with her three brothers. When Batty was six years old her mother died, and she was raised by nannies and her maternal grandmother. Batty says that her mother's death had a long term impact: \\"I have not really formed permanent relations with anybody; I have never been married and neither have my two other brothers. I think it really traumatises you from having key relationships because of that fear that they are going to leave you.\\" After high school she completed a secretarial course and worked as a bank clerk and as a nanny in Australia. Batty settled in Australia in 1988 on a partner visa following an initial visit in 1986.  Batty's story of domestic violence  Batty met Anderson in 1992 when they worked together at a recruitment company and the two began a romantic relationship that lasted two years. Batty has said that Anderson showed signs of sexual violence whilst they were together, including allegedly attempting to rape a friend of Batty's, after which Batty ended the two-year relationship. Almost eight years later she initiated contact with him and resumed a brief sexual relationship, which led to Batty's pregnancy. She says she had never planned to have a child, given her lifelong fear of loss, and that her son was an accident. Their son Luke was born on 20 June 2002. Batty has said that Anderson's abuse began shortly after they met and increased when she fell pregnant. Batty has expressed that Anderson was a loving father to Luke and she defended his right to have contact with their son. In the 2014 coronial inquest into Luke's death it was reported that Anderson may have had an undiagnosed mental illness. He struggled to maintain a job and a place to live and has also been described by those who knew him as unstable, manipulative and aggressive. Soon after Luke was born, Anderson physically assaulted Batty, prompting her to end their relationship, although Anderson remained in contact. From June 2004 until February 2014, Anderson physically assaulted Batty and threatened to kill her on numerous occasions, leading to a number of arrests, charges and intervention orders. In November 2012, Anderson was caught accessing child pornography at a public computer in a Melbourne library. In January 2014, Anderson threatened to kill one of his flatmates, leading to the flatmate seeking an intervention order and Anderson being arrested but released shortly after. Because of privacy laws, Batty was not immediately made aware of these events. In April 2013, Anderson wielded a knife at Luke when they were alone inside his car, reportedly telling him that \\"it could all end with this.\\" Batty decided that she could no longer support Anderson having contact with Luke. After she reported the incident to police, the court ordered that Anderson could have no further contact with his son, and an intervention order naming both Batty and Luke as protected persons was granted. In July 2013, Anderson challenged the decision in a court hearing and was granted access to Luke in public when he was playing sport. = Murder of Luke = On 12 February 2014, Anderson murdered eleven year old Luke Batty at cricket practice on a sports oval in the outer Melbourne suburb of . Although parents and children were present, as people began to leave and were some distance away, Anderson managed to isolate Luke inside a cricket net, where he struck his son on the head and stabbed him to death. Anderson resisted arrest and threatened ambulance workers with his knife. He later died in hospital from police gunshots and self-inflicted stab wounds. In the coronial inquest, police officers, child protection services and Rosie Batty stated that they never believed that Anderson would harm Luke, as although he had a history of violence against Rosie Batty, he was not violent toward his son. Campaign against domestic violence Batty speaking at an Australian Human Rights Commission panel discussion in July 2015. Batty began speaking publicly about her experience after addressing the media the morning after Luke's murder. She became an advocate for domestic violence survivors and victims, and sought to address perceived systemic failures in responses to domestic violence in Australia. She has spoken about a lack of communication between services, about public perceptions of domestic violence, about a lack of funding, and about police and legal procedures that she felt disempowered her ability to protect herself and her son. In 2014, Batty established the Luke Batty Foundation to assist women and children affected by domestic violence. Batty was appointed 2015 Australian of the Year, awarded the Pride of Australia’s National Courage Medal in 2014, awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of the Sunshine Coast, and was ranked number 33 in the list of the World's Greatest Leaders 2016 by Fortune magazine. In April 2014, she responded to a comment from journalist Joe Hildebrand on Ten Network's Studio 10, a TV panel show. In discussing proposed Victorian laws for compulsory reporting of child abuse cases, Hildebrand said that being \\"scared for your own safety, I’m sorry, it is not an excuse.\\" In response, Batty said that she was shocked at the notion, and had thought that after her son's death, she had hoped that \\"something would come out of this that would actually show the difficulty women have in abusive relationships.\\" In 2015 Batty was the subject of a portrait by Jacqui Clark named Meeting Rosie Batty, which was selected for the 2015 Portia Geach Memorial Award. In September 2015 she called on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to close Australian immigration detention facilities due to the incidence of rape and sexual assault.Allard, Tom Rosie Batty takes on Malcolm Turnbull over detention centres: 'They must be shut down' 2 October 2015 Sydney Morning Herald Batty's story was instrumental in the establishment in 2015 of the Royal Commission into Family Violence in her home state of Victoria. It was tabled in Parliament on 30 March 2016. The report is a culmination of a 13-month inquiry into how to effectively prevent family violence, improve early intervention, support victims, make perpetrators accountable, better coordinate community and government response, and evaluate and measure strategies, frameworks, policies, programs and services. The report includes eight volumes, and is founded on 227 recommendations made by the Commission to improve, guide and oversee a long- term reform program that deals with family violence. This includes the establishment of the Family Violence Protection Act, which provides a detailed definition of family violence, the relationships in which it can arise, and a reinforcement of the sound objectives and principles of the Act. In late 2016, Batty wrote to Federal Immigration Minister Peter Dutton in support of Dr. Chamari Liyanage, who had bludgeoned her husband to death with a hammer in his bed while he slept in 2014, claiming that Liyanage should be allowed to remain in Australia after her release from prison, stating that this would \\"demonstrate a compassionate Australian Government that truly understands the plight of family and domestic violence victims.\\" On 16 February 2018, Batty announced that she would step down as the chief executive of the Luke Batty Foundation, and eventually shut down the foundation. On the same day, the Foundation stopped receiving donations. In October 2018 Batty was named in the social enterprise and not-for-profit category of The Australian Financial Review 100 Women of Influence awards. On 10 June 2019, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia as part of the Queen's Birthday 2019 Honours recognition.

Design Touch Arcade notes \\"AirAttack departs from the traditional 2D platform of vertical shoot-em-ups and opts for a fully realistic 3D world\\", creating a point of difference from other similar games of this nature. Gameplay AirAttack is an action video game played from top-down perspective and three-dimensional environment. At the beginning of the game, the player starts with three planes, resembling the F4U Corsair, P-38 Lightning and P-40 Tigershark. They must choose one from the three and start their fight. The latter planes also use flamethrower and fireball. A flamethrower is used to burn all types of enemies while the fireball serves the plane as deflection from crashing into another planes with swift pivotal circulation. The player's plane has a primary weapon that fires continuously at a constant velocity that can attack aerial enemies, land enemies except the train, and certain buildings. The plane is manipulated by moving it along screen, possibly using mouse, tilting the device, joypad and relative touch (manual input sensitivity). Double tapping the screen drops a bomb that can destroy land enemies and buildings in order to collect coins. Shop also appears throughout the level. Player can enter it to buy gadgets such as homing rockets, super rockets, turrets, shields, side planes, lightnings, bombs that can destroy wider area, extra lives, cannons, and timewraps (provides slow motion technique).

Hartenstein uses various terms to describe the various innovations in the design, including config-ware, flow-ware, morph- ware, and \\"anti-machine\\". The Xputer represents a move away from the traditional Von Neumann computer architecture, to a coarse-grained \\"soft Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)\\" architecture.Field-Programmable Logic: Architectures, Synthesis and Applications, Reiner W. Hartenstein, Springer Science & Business Media, 24-Aug-1994 Parallelism is achieved by configurable elements known as reconfigurable datapath arrays (rDPA), organized in a two- dimensional array of ALU's similar to the KressArray.Compilation Techniques for Reconfigurable Architectures, Springer Science & Business Media, 02-Apr-2011Designing Embedded Processors: A Low Power Perspective, Springer Science & Business Media, 27-Jul-2007 Architecture  The Xputer architecture is data-stream-based, and is the counterpart of the instruction- based von Neumann computer architecture. The Xputer architecture was one of the first coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures, and consists of a reconfigurable datapath array (rDPA) organized as a two-dimensional array of ALUs (rDPU). The bus-width between ALU's were 32-bit in the first version of the Xputer. The ALUs (also known as rDPUs) are used for computing a single mathematical operation, such as addition, subtraction or multiplication, and can also be used purely for routing. ALUs are mesh-connected via three types of connections, and data-flow along these connections are managed by an address generation unit. *Nearest neighbour (connections between neighbouring ALUs) *Row/column back-buses *Global bus (a single global bus for interconnection between further ALUs) Programs for the Xputer are written in the C language, and compiled for usage on the Xputer using the CoDeX compiler written by the author. The CoDeX compiler maps suitable portions of the C program onto the Xputer's rDPA fabric. The remainder of the program is executed on the host system, such as a personal computer. rDPA A reconfigurable datapath array (rDPA) is a semiconductor device containing reconfigurable data path units and programmable interconnects, first proposed by Rainer Kress in 1993, at the University of Kaiserslautern. Instead of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) having single bit configurable logic blocks (CLBs), rDPAs have multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bit path width) reconfigurable datapath units (rDPUs). Each rDPU can be configured to perform an individual function. These rDPUs and interconnects can be programmed after the manufacturing process by the customer/designer (hence the term \\"reconfigurable\\") so that the rDPA can perform whatever complex computation is needed. Because rDPUs are multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bits), we talk about coarse-grained reconfigurability - in contrast to FPGAs with single-bit wide configurable logic blocks, called fine-gained reconfigurable. rDPAs are structurally programmed from \\"config-ware\\" source code, compiled into pipe- networks to be mapped onto the rDPA. rDPAs are not instruction-stream-driven and have no instruction fetch at run time. rDPUs do not have a program counter.Reconfigurable System Design and Verification, CRC Press, 17-Feb-2009 References Category:Computer architecture Category:Reconfigurable computing ","title":"Xputer"},{"id":"45203445","text":"Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less.

His first appearance in the historical record is in Brescia, when he is commissioned for a cycle of twelve Angels for the main dome of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Brescia. He delivered only ten, which were executed approximately at the same time as Gasparo Cairano's cycle of twelve Apostles, and paid for on 24 December 1489.Archivio Storico di Santa Maria dei Miracoli, cart. A, fasc. 3 In general, all the lapidary work during the construction of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli that followed the Apostle cycle and in the interior of the building was due to Cairano and his workshop. It is assumed that the early work on the sculptural cycles was a prelude for the right to continue the work in the church, and resulted in a competition between Tamagnino and Cairano. The cycle of the Angels by Tamagnino is of higher quality than Cairano's, not only for the relative modernity of the former's style which followed the neo-classicism of the Venetian artist Antonio Rizzo, but also for the superior technical quality demonstrated. It is likely, therefore, that Cairano's capture of all subsequent lapidary work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli stemmed from some local support, which enabled him to sideline Tamagnino. In addition to the Angels, Tamagnino also delivered three of four busts for the pendentives of the main dome, and Doctors of the ChurchHistorical sources for the attribution of these works are not unanimous. The Martinengo memorial of 1731 (see Guerrini 1930, pp. 189–218) ascribe the three medallions of St. Ambrose, St. Augustine and St. Jerome to Tamagnino, while Sala (see Sala, p. 90.) attributes the fourth, San Gregorio, although critical stylistic analysis excludes it. See also Zani 2010, p. 98, note 59, and p. 121. as well as two smaller roundels for the frieze in the nave: for these five artefacts, three of which were very large, and for the twelve Angels, Tamagnino was compensated less than Cairano was for his Apostles.Gasparo Cairano is paid nine lire for each statue of the Apostles, for a total of 108 lire, while Tamagnino receives 106 lire for the twelve Angels and the five reliefs. See the transcription by Guerrini 1930, pp. 209–210, of the lost document in Archivio Storico di Santa Maria dei Miracoli, cart. A, fasc. 3. This discrimination serves as a plausible explanation for Tamagnino's departure from Brescia, even while the work on the Santa Maria dei Miracoli continued. Tamagnino found his work undervalued and underpaid in comparison to Cairano, who at the time was less proficient than him. Tamagnino received the prestigious contract for the facade of the Certosa di Pavia, which was to be performed under the direction of Father Amadeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The compact between the artist and the two sculptors was further tightened in May 1492, and created a unique training for Tamagnino as well as a remarkable leap in his career. In 1499, the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, causing a diaspora of artists from the city throughout northern Italy and beyond. This possibly explains Tamagnino's return to Brescia, as well as the contract for the decorative stonework for the Loggia palazzo, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. The palazzo which had opened in 1492 following Tamagnino's first departure from Brescia was at the time in the firm control of Gasparo Cairano, who had for some years become the sculptor of choice for the Brescian elite, both public and private. Before Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano had already delivered at least five different Caesars and other stonework, but in that year there is only a record of a payment for a single protome virile, since the Cairano's attention was completely absorbed by the two giant trophies he had recently started work on. In November 1499, Tamagnino was seen to be very active: he delivered four Caesars and three leonine protome, showcasing his skills and his calibre. But in the following seven months, Cairano records successive advances and balances for trophies in full production mode that does not affect his other works, whereas Tamagnino only realises two Caesars and seventeen leonine busts. The creation of leonine busts was considered repetitive and could be consigned to low calibre stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid much less than the average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.By way of comparison, note that twenty soldi made a Venetian lira; on 27 May 1500, Tamagnino was paid forty-five soldi (just over two lire each) for his eight leonine protome. For the same artefacts, Gaspare da Carsogna, a stonecutter, received three lire each, Iacopo Campione received two lire, and Girolamo di Canonica got three lire, while Gasparo Cairano was paid eight lire for each protome virile delivered. See Zamboni. Tamagnino's Caesars, six in total and of fine workmanship, are virtually relegated to the south and west flanks, and to the back of the building, which was much less frequented. Faced by the depreciation of his work, it is likely that Tamagnino's sixth Caesar, of far poorer quality than the rest of the cycle was meant to taunt Cairano and their clients, who for the second time had sabotaged the success, or at least the proper recognition of Tamagnino's talent. After these events, Tamagnino abandoned Brescia, probably forever, leaving Gasparo Cairano as the chief exponent of the Brescian sculptural scene. Tamagnino's Bust of Acellino Salvago, his masterpiece, is preserved in the Bode Museum in Berlin.

He co-founded the Thai Silk Company in 1948. The son of a prominent Delaware family, Thompson graduated from Princeton University in 1928 and studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. From 1931 to 1940, he worked as an architect in New York City, designing homes for East Coast high society. In 1941, Thompson quit his job and enlisted with the Delaware National Guard, serving as an operative in the Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency) during World War II. After the war, he was assigned to the U.S. legation in Bangkok, Thailand. He embarked on his silk weaving career after leaving the military in 1946. Disappearance Thompson disappeared from Malaysia's Cameron Highlands while going for a walk on Sunday, 26 March 1967. Prior to his disappearance, he left Bangkok to spend a day in Penang with Constance \\"Connie\\" Mangskau, his long- time acquaintance. On Friday, 24 March, they headed for the Highlands to holiday at the \\"Moonlight\\" bungalow (now the Jim Thompson cottage). Their hosts were Dr. Ling Tien Gi, a Singaporean-Chinese chemist, and Mrs. Helen Ling (née Dalling), his Caucasian American-born wife. Malay: Jalan Kamunting). The place is still a draw for the many who have had an interest in the life and disappearance of Jim Thompson. On Sunday, all four got up early to attend the morning services at All Souls’ Church. While the rest were preparing themselves for the service, Thompson informed them he would be taking a walk down Jalan Kamunting, the bungalow's access road. After walking about two kilometres, he reached the main road. This was the first time he was alone for approximately 20 minutes. Later, he met up with the others and they all drove on to church. Malay: Jalan Kamunting). It is about 1.5 kilometres from the \\"Moonlight\\" bungalow. Driveway leading to the Lutheran Mission bungalow: When Thompson left the Lutheran home (background), he came into contact with the driver of a white car (foreground). After a brief exchange of words, the driver drove off. The Easter services lasted for more than an hour. When it ended at noon, the group returned to \\"Moonlight\\" for lunch. At 1:30 pm, he left the bungalow for an afternoon stroll. Before leaving, he waved goodbye to Mrs. Ling and Mrs. Mangskau. They saw him depart the estate via the only access road, Jalan Kamunting. Thompson was in the \\"Kamunting\\" precinct for more than two hours. At around 4 pm, a cook from the Lutheran Mission bungalow () saw him when he visited the chalet. He did not stay, but failed to return to \\"Moonlight\\" () before 6 pm. An intense search was conducted after the police declared he was lost. More than 500 people were involved in the hunt. They included the army, the Malaysian police field force, Orang Asli trekkers, Gurkhas, reward hunters, tourists, residents, mystics, scouts, missionaries, adventure seekers, American school students and British servicemen convalescing at the resort. At the end of the hunt, Thompson was not to be found, and no clues were unearthed. The official search lasted for 11 days, and sporadic additional searching went on for months. The case generated worldwide publicity and intense speculation, with most press reports and analysts contending that Thompson had been kidnapped (although no ransom note was forthcoming); had been murdered (although no body was ever found); had voluntarily left to do secret work in resolving the Vietnam War (although no evidence was presented); or was eliminated by business rivals (although no evidence on this emerged). Recent information One researcher believes the clue to Thompson's mystery may lie in some bone fragments that were found at the Cameron Highlands in 1985. The remains, without the skull, were discovered by Orang Asli settlers in a grave at the edge of a vegetable plot off the main road in Brinchang. Captain Philip J. Rivers, a master mariner, said he learned of the discovery from a health officer while researching Thompson's disappearance in 2007. The police collected the fragments but no connection was made to Thompson's disappearance in Tanah Rata, as they were found in Brinchang. \\"The probability is that his body lay undiscovered in the thick under bush, hidden in an unmarked grave after a hit-and-run accident. A DNA test on the bones might possibly provide a fuller answer,\\" said Rivers at a lecture organised by the Perak Academy in Ipoh, Perak, West Malaysia on Friday, 26 March 2010. To date, there has been no confirmation that the bones belong to Thompson. According to Rivers, however, \\"the bones are presently kept in a safe and secure place\\".  Search-and-rescue analysis  In 2015 an analysis, report and four news articles were done (by Llewellyn (\\"Lew\\") Toulmin; see ) of the 1967 search for Jim Thompson from a search and rescue (SAR) and scientific point of view. This analysis drew on interviews with a leader of and participants in the search; on interviews with other actors; on principles and mathematical formulae developed by the US National Association for Search and Rescue (NASAR); on reviews of FBI, OSS, CIA and US Department of State material on the case and on Thompson; and on various other sources. This analysis concluded that: # The 1967 search delivered about 1448 person- days of searching, a substantial number, but likely not enough to cover all the 17.7 square miles that were estimated in 1967 to be the target segment in the Cameron Highlands area. # The \\"probability of success\\" (as defined by NASAR) of the 1967 search, calculated by the \\"probability of area\\" (likelihood that Thompson was in the searched segment vs. some other nearby segment) times the \\"probability of detection\\" (likelihood of finding the subject in the searched segment) was in the range of 43 to 30 percent or less, meaning that there was a fairly high chance that the search missed Thompson's body, if it was in fact present in the general search area. # Various possible, likely or certain errors in search tactics and execution reduced the quality of the search effort; and the massive nature of the search made it almost certain (and even arguably provable mathematically) that just because it was the \\"biggest land search in Malaysian history,\\" it was almost certainly not the \\"best search in Malaysian history\\". # Three bloodhound-type dogs searched the Moonlight Bungalow (the \\"last known point\\" or LKP) for scent trails of Thompson, and did not find any going down the only access road or into the jungle, and this led the Malaysian Police early on to conclude that Thompson left the area in a car, thus breaking the scent trail (this bloodhound search detailed information was not revealed previously); but this evidence is not conclusive. # A possible sighting of Thompson in Tahiti did take place several months after the disappearance, but this sighting is not certain. # Remains called \\"the bones of Jim Thompson\\" did exist, in that some unknown bones were at one time in the Tanah Rata District Medical Office, but the bones were never proved to be human, were not probably connected to the Thompson case, and have since disappeared in an office move. # Of the 25 possible causes for the disappearance cited by the press in 1967, about half can be eliminated as not credible. # Of the eyewitnesses who may have seen Thompson after he left the LKP, two can be impeached as being too far (as measured on Google Earth) from Thompson to be credible, and the rest are of fairly low to very low credibility. # The literature on the decomposition of bodies in various climates shows that if Thompson's remains are in the jungle, they are likely to be spread over 1 to 4 square miles, due to predation. The Toulmin report concludes that the probability (but not certainty) is that Thompson's remains are still in the Cameron Highlands, and that a possible way to move the case forward is to use proven SAR techniques of detailed scenario development, \\"Mattson voting,\\" and human remains detection (HRD) or \\"cadaver dogs.\\" Mattson voting is a standard SAR technique in which SAR field staff (and/or experts on a case) rank search segments (areas to be searched, developed in the scenario development phase) using a secret ballot, in priority order. These individual rankings are then summed and the group results used to allocate SAR resources. The Toulmin analysis also reviewed the brutal, still unsolved murder of Jim Thompson's sister in Chester County, PA, just a few months after Thompson disappeared. The analysis drew on an interview with the Pennsylvania State Police cold case officer; on a review of the wills and estate administrations of Thompson, his sister, and his sister's son; on interviews with neighbors and residents; and on contemporary (1967) news sources. The analysis concluded there is no provable link between the Jim Thompson disappearance and the murder of his sister; that the two cases are unlikely to be related; and that several persons of interest (POIs) can be named but there is no proof against any of them. The Toulmin report (see ) contains over 500 pages of primary source material on the Jim Thompson disappearance and the murder of his sister; this is the only such compilation available. The material includes CIA, OSS, FBI and US Department of State material, maps of the search area, 200 pages of previously unpublished letters from Thompson to a former lover and fellow art collector, detailed interviews with various actors, photos and exact latitude and longitude of all the key locations (including possible witness locations), and other items.

The revolts were triggered by the entry of the conservative Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) into the Spanish government. Most of the events occurred in Catalonia and Asturias and were supported by many Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and General Union of Workers (UGT) members, notably Largo Caballero. Historians have argued that the incident sharpened antagonism between the political Right and Left in Spain and was part of the reason for the later Spanish Civil War.Keeley Rogers & Jo Thomas, Causes of 20th Century Wars, Page 228  Prelude The elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederación Español de Derechas Autónomas (\\"CEDA\\"), but president Alcalá-Zamora declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead, he invited the Radical Republican Party's Alejandro Lerroux to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year. After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. However the entrance of CEDA in the government, despite being normal in a parliamentary democracy, was not well accepted by the left. The Socialists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months. A general strike was called by the UGT and the PSOE in the name of the Alianza Obrera. The issue was that the Left Republicans identified the Republic not with democracy or constitutional law but with a specific set of left wing policies and politicians. Any deviation, even if democratic, was seen as treasonous.  Preparation of the revolution  1934 was a year of constant class clashes, established on the basis of small incidents and short general strikes, which allowed the movement to arrive on the eve of October in the fullness of its strength, with great confidence and extraordinarily united.Las diferencias asturianas. Octubre 1934. Edit.Siglo veintiuno.Madrid 1985. Pág. 235 The rebels had a considerable stock of rifles and pistols on them. Most of the rifles came from a shipment of arms supplied by Indalecio Prieto, a socialist party moderate. The rifles had been landed by the yacht Turquesa at Pravia, north-east of Oviedo; Prieto swiftly fled to France to avoid arrest. Other weapons came from captured arms factories in the region and the miners also had their dynamite blasting charges, which were known as \\"la artillería de la revolución.\\"Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Hachette UK, 2012.  Asturias  The rising in Asturias was well prepared with headquarters in Oviedo. In several mining towns in Asturias, local unions gathered small arms and were determined to see the strike through. It began on the evening of 4 October, with the miners occupying several towns, attacking and seizing local Civil and Assault Guard barracks. At dawn on October 5, 1934 the rebels attacked the Brothers' school in Turón. The Brothers and the Passionist Father were captured and imprisoned in the \\"House of the People\\" while waiting for a decision from the revolutionary Committee. Under pressure from extremists, the Committee decided to condemn them to death. Thirty-four priests, six young seminarists with ages between 18 and 21, and several businessmen and civil guards were summarily executed by the revolutionaries in Mieres and Sama, 58 religious buildings including churches, convents and part of the university at Oviedo were burned and destroyed. The same day saw columns of miners advancing along the road to Oviedo, the provincial capital. With the exception of two barracks in which fighting with the garrison of 1,500 government troops continued, the city was taken by October 6. The miners proceeded to occupy several other towns, most notably the large industrial centre of La Felguera, and set up town assemblies, or \\"revolutionary committees\\", to govern the towns that they controlled. Within three days the center of Asturias was in the hands of the rebels. The revolutionary soviets set up by the miners attempted to impose order on the areas under their control, and the moderate socialist leadership of Ramón González Peña and Belarmino Tomás took measures to restrain violence. However, a number of captured priests, businessmen and civil guards were summarily executed by the revolutionaries in Mieres and Sama, and churches, convents, the Bishop's Palace and much of the University at Oviedo were destroyed, including the library. Taking Oviedo the rebels were able to seize the city' arsenal gaining 24,000 rifles, carbines and light and heavy machine guns.Recruitment offices demanded the services of all workers between the ages of eighteen and forty for the 'Red Army'. Thirty thousand workers had been mobilized for battle within ten days. In the occupied areas the rebels officially declared the proletarian revolution and abolished regular money. The government was now facing a civil war. Franco, already General of Division and aide to the war minister, Diego Hidalgo, was put in command of the operations directed to suppress the violent insurgency. Franco and General Manuel Goded Llopis advised Hidalgo to bring in the battle-tested 'Army of Africa', composed of the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Moroccan Regulares. Historian Hugh Thomas asserts that Hidalgo said that he did not want young inexperienced recruits fighting their own people and he was wary of moving troops to Asturias leaving the rest of Spain unprotected. Bringin in the army of Africa was not a novelty, in 1932 Manuel Azaña had also called the Tercio and the regulares from North Africa. The war minister, Diego Hidalgo wanted Franco to lead the troops, but President Alcalá Zamora, aware of Franco's monarchist sympathies opted to send General López Ochoa to Asturias lead the troops against the miners hoping that his reputation as a loyal Republican would minimize the bloodshed. Troops of the Spanish Army of Africa carried this out, with General Eduardo López Ochoa as commander in the field. After two weeks of heavy fighting (and a death toll estimated between 1,200 and 2,000), the rebellion was suppressed. As a deterrent to further atrocities, López Ochoa had summarily executed a number of legionnaires and Moroccan colonial troops for torturing prisoners and hacking them to death.Preston, Paul. The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth- Century Spain. Norton, 2012. p 269 Historian Javier Tussel argues that although Franco had a leading role, giving instructions from Madrid, that does not mean he took part in the illegal repressive activities. According to Tussel it was the Republican General, López de Óchoa, a republican freemason who had been appointed by President Alcalá Zamora to lead the repression in the field, that was unable to prevent innumerous atrocities. According to Hugh Thomas, 2,000 persons died in the uprising: 230-260 military and police, 33 priests, 1,500 miners in combat and 200 individuals killed in the repression. Stanley Payne estimates that the rebel's atrocities killed between 50 and 100 people and that the government conducted up to 100 summary executions, while 15 million pesetas were stolen from banks, most which was never recovered and would go on to fund further revolutionary activity.  Catalonia  In Catalonia the revolt was triggered by the Government of Catalonia led nationalist leader Lluis Companys, who proclaimed the Catalan State. The Catalonian uprising began and ended the same day, it lasted only ten hours, in the so-called \\"Events of 6 October\\". In October 6, Lluís Companys decided to declare the Catalan Republic within the \\"Spanish Federal Republic\\",Preston, Paul. The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, revolution & revenge. Harper Perennial. London. 2006. p.78 and numerous heavily armed squads occupied the streets of Barcelona and other towns, supporting the initiative and capturing public offices. Lluis Companys appeared on a balcony of the Palau de la Generalitat (Government Building) and he told the crowd that \\"monarchists and fascists\\" had \\"assaulted the government\\", and went on: > In this solemn hour, in the name of the people and the Parliament, the > Government over which I preside assumes all the faculties of power in > Catalonia, proclaims the Catalan State of the Spanish Federal Republic, and > in establishing and fortifying relations with the leaders of the general > protest against Fascism, invites them to establish in Catalonia the > provisional Government of the Republic, which will find in our Catalan > people the most generous impulse of fraternity in the common desire to erect > a liberal and magnificent federal republic. Lluis Companys asked Manuel Azaña, who happened to be in Barcelona during the events, to lead a newly proclaimed Spanish Republican government, a proposition that Azaña rejected. Lluís Companys also telephoned General Domènec Batet, asking him for support. Domènec Betet who was deployed in Catalonia as chief of the IV Organic Division remained loyal to the central government and gained some time demanding a written request. While Companys wrote the request, Batet prepared the Army, Guardia Civil, and Guardia de Asalto troops. At 9 pm General Batet declared martial law. He moved against trade union and militia headquarters, both of whom surrendered quickly, then brought light artillery to bear against the city hall and the Generalitat.Payne (2006), pp. 87–8 Fighting continued until 6am, when Companys surrendered. In the failed rebellion forty-six people died: thirty-eight civilians and eight soldiers. More than three thousand people were imprisoned, most of them in the \\"Uruguay\\" steamer, and placed under the jurisdiction of the councils of war. The International Marxist Tendency movement classified Lluis Company's actions as the \\"worst betrayal of the movement\\", according to this movement Companys surrendered without resistance and his “Estat Catala” did not challenge private property nor the current social establishment he just wanted to place \\"the leadership of the struggle in the hands of the petty bourgeoisie represented by the ERC (Catalan Republican Left)\\". Although the vast majority of the events happened in Asturias and Catalonia, strikes, clashes, and shootings happened also in the Basque country, north of Castile and León, Cantabria, or Madrid.  Aftermath  The insurgency in Asturias sparked a new era of violent anti-Christian persecutions, initiated the practice of atrocities against the clergy and sharpened the antagonism between Left and Right. Franco and López Ochoa (who, prior to the campaign in Asturias, had been seen as a left-leaning officer)Preston, p. 103 emerged as officers prepared to use 'troops against Spanish civilians as if they were a foreign enemy'.Preston, Paul (2010) \\"The Theorists of Extermination\\", essay in Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p. 61. University of Notre Dame Press, Franco described the rebellion to a journalist in Oviedo as, 'a frontier war and its fronts are socialism, communism and whatever attacks civilisation in order to replace it with barbarism.' Though the colonial units sent to the north by the government at Franco's recommendationThomas, p. 132 consisted of the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Moroccan Regulares Indigenas, the right wing press portrayed the Asturian rebels as lackeys of a foreign Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.Balfour, Sebastian (2002). Deadly Embrace: Morocco and the Road to the Spanish Civil War, Oxford University Press. pp. 252–254. . At the start of the Civil War, López Ochoa was assassinated. Some time after these events, Franco was briefly commander-in-chief of the Army of Africa (from 15 February onwards), and from 19 May 1935, on, Chief of the General Staff. After the \\"miners\\" had surrendered the investigations and repression were carried out by the brutal Civil Guard Major Lisardo Doval Bravo who applied torture and savage beatings. Several prisoners died. The independent journalist “Luis de Sirval” was arbitrarily arrested and shot dead in prison by a Bulgarian Legionnaire named Dimitri Ivan Ivanoff. Due to martial law and censorship, little or no information was officially made public, a group of Socialist deputies carried a private investigation and published an independent report that discarded most to the publicized atrocities but that confirmed the savage beatings and tortures. In Catalonia Lluis Companys and his government were arrested. So too was Manuel Azaña, despite having taken no part in the events; he was released in December.The Statute of Autonomy was suspended indefinitely on 14 December, and all powers that had been transferred to Barcelona were returned to Madrid. The soldiers who had taken part of the insurrection, the commander Enrique Pérez Farrás and the captains Escofet and Ricart, were condemned to death, their sentence being commuted to life imprisonment by the President of the Republic, Alcalá Zamora, in spite of the protests of both the CEDA and the Republican Liberal Democrat Party of Melquiades Álvarez, who demanded a strong hand.Casanova (2007), p. 139 Martial law was in place until January 23, 1935. The government tried to be and was reasonable in dealing with insurrects in most cases, but in Asturias justice was uneven and the police administration was allowed to continue with excesses. On February 23, 1935, the Mayor of Barcelona and the detained councilors were provisionally released. In June 1935 The President and the Government of the Generalitat were tried by the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal and were sentenced for military rebellion to thirty years in prison, which was carried out by some in the Cartagena prison and others in the Puerto de Santa María.Casanova (2010), p. 114 The government of Lerroux unleashed \\"a harsh repressive wave with the closure of political and trade union centers, the suppression of newspapers, the removal of municipalities and thousands of detainees, without having had a direct action on the facts\\", which showed \\"a punitive will often arbitrary and with vengeance components of class or ideological\\". Ramón Gonzáles Peña the prominent leader of the Oviedo Revolutionary Committee was sentenced to death. One year later, however, he was reprieved. Gonzáles later served as the president of Unión General de Trabajadores, in which he was in conflict with Largo Caballero. He was also a Member of Parliament and was the Minister of Justice 1938–1939.Goethem, Geert van. The Amsterdam International: The World of the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), 1913-1945. Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006. p. 76Kraus, Dorothy, and Henry Kraus. The Gothic Choirstalls of Spain. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1986. p. 37 After the Spanish Civil War González Peña went to exile in Mexico, where he died on 27 July 1952. There were no mass killing after the fighting was over, completely different from the massacres that had taken place in similar uprisings in France, Hungary or Germany; all death sentences were commuted aside from two, army sergeant and deserter Diego Vásquez, who fought alongside the miners, and a worker known as \\"El Pichilatu\\" who had committed serial killings. Little effort was actually made to suppress the organisations that had carried out the insurrection, resulting in most being functional again by 1935. Support for fascism was minimal and did not increase, while civil liberties were restored in full by 1935, after which the revolutionaries had a generous opportunity to pursue power through electoral means. Following the Spanish general election of 1936, the new government of Manuel Azaña released Companys and his government from jail. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, López Ochoa was in a military hospital in Carabanchel and was awaiting trial, accused of responsibility for the deaths of 20 civilians at a barracks in Oviedo. Given the violence occurring throughout Madrid, the government attempted to move Ochoa from the hospital to a safer location but was twice prevented from doing so by large hostile crowds. A third attempt was made under the guise that Ochoa was already dead, but the ruse was exposed and the general was taken away.

Four arêtes radiate from its summit towards the north, east, south and southwest. To the southeast is the glacier of Nilkees and, to the northeast, is the Hexenkees. The Großer Eichhamkees to the northwest and the Kleiner Eichhamkees to the southwest have shrunk to insignificant slabs of ice. On the North Arête is a rock tower, the Eichhamturm (). Along the continuation of the arête lies the Großer Hexenkopf (), which is roughly 600 metres as the crow flies from the Hoher Eichham. On the East Arête is the Niederer Eichham (\\"Lower Eichham\\", ). From this subpeak a ridge branches southeast linking it with the Sailkopf; the lowest notch on this arête being the Sailscharte (). The Hoher Eichham may have first been climbed during a military survey using triangulation in the 1850s.Eduard Richter: Die Erschließung der Ostalpen, Vol. III, Berlin, 1894, p. 142 The first visit to the summit by tourists was on 16 July 1887 by Berlin alpinists, Carl Benzien and Hermann Meynow using the South Arête. They were led by the Zillertal mountain guide, Hans Hörhager, from Dornauberg.Mittheilungen des Alpenvereins, Munich, 1887, p. 192  Ascent  The mountain is usually ascended from the Bonn-Matreier Hut. Here, the climber initially heads for the Sailkopf using its normal route, then drops about 130 metres of height along its northwest arête to the Sailscharte. Next the Nilkees is crossed, heading westwards to the Eichhamscharte notch(). Alternatively one can start at the Nilljoch Hut () heading straight up the Niltal valley to the Nilkees glacier and the Eichhamscharte. From the Eichhamscharte the route now climbs the southern flank up to about 3,200 metres. The climbing route that now follows involves a short, steep section of rock face and a descent into a notch just before the summit block (grade II). The route is very exposed but may be secured by climbing bolts. From the Bonn- Matreier Hut to the top takes about 3½ hours. In crossing the Nilkees, the risk from crevasses is quite low, however, depending on the conditions, crampons and an ice axe may be useful.Willi End: Alpenvereinsführer Venedigergruppe, Munich, 2006, pp. 312 ff., Rz 1145 ff.

He assumed the name of \\"Luigi of the Consolata\\" after he entered that order. He was cleared for beatification after a miracle was found to have been attributed to his intercession and he was beatified on 2 May 2015 in Turin by Cardinal Angelo Amato on behalf of Pope Francis. Biography Bordino was born in 1922 and was the third of four sisters and four brothers. His parents provided for his education and attended kindergarten that Sister Ernestina ran. He didn't excel in his studies but increased his commitment to them. In the summers he would assist his father in his work with his older brother Risbaldo. At the age of eighteen in 1941 he was named as the president of the local branch of Catholic Action. In January 1942, he was drafted at the age of nineteen into the military of the Cuneo Alps. There, Bordino accompanied his comrades into Poland and later into Ukraine where Bordino provided for his fellow soldiers. On 26 January 1943, Bordino and his brother were taken as prisoners by the Soviet Union soldiers. He was to contract typhus, and was later transferred to Siberia, surviving a year of the disease. He was later released from his imprisonment, and allowed to return home. He became a member of the Brothers of Saint Joseph Benedict Cottolengo and assumed the name of \\"Luigi of the Consolata\\". He worked for those hospitalized and also worked with those who had mental illnesses. He contracted leukemia in 1975. After learning this he approached the superior general of the order and stated: \\"I am sorry because I can no longer do much for the sick, not even for the family of the Brothers; I can no longer help; for everything else, it is the will of God to the end, and I want to do it cheerfully. These are the moments of faith\\". He underwent treatment and after he was released went to recover. He would return for more tests and treatment at the hospital each month. His condition declined in at the beginning of 1977 and continued to worsen in February. Bordino requested to leave the hospital realizing that his end was near. He received the Anointing of the Sick and went to visit the Cardinal Archbishop of Turin Michele Pellegrino on 26 February. He was offered the choice of travelling to the United States of America for special treatment, but declined stating: \\"I will not make such a long journey on a stretcher and dying in America: I have duties to my community\\". His sister Pia rushed to his bedside where he died on 25 August 1977. Beatification The cause of beatification commenced on 17 November 1990 on a local level and he was declared a Servant of God. On 12 April 2003, Pope John Paul II declared him to have lived a life of heroic virtue and named him Venerable. On 3 April 2014, Pope Francis approved a decree that recognized a miracle attributed to his intercession which cleared the way for his beatification. The beatification was celebrated by Cardinal Angelo Amato on 2 May 2015 in Turin.

It is an active Roman Catholic parish church in the diocese of Salford. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was built between 1846 and 1849 to replace a smaller chapel on a different site. The church was designed by Weightman and Hadfield in Decorated style, and a chapel was added to it in 1879. History Until the 19th century the Roman Catholics in the Burnley area worshipped in a chapel in Towneley Hall. St Mary's parish was founded in 1819 when a chapel known as Burnley Wood Chapel, or St Mary's Chapel, was built near the entrance lodge to Towneley Hall. The present church was built between 1846 and 1849, and was designed by Weightman and Hadfield. It was opened in August 1849, the sermon being preached by Cardinal Wiseman. In 1879 a north chapel, known as the Towneley Chapel, was added to the church. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone with slate roofs, and is in Decorated style. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, north and south transepts, a chancel with a north and south chapels, and a west tower. The tower is uncompleted, and has two stages. It stands on a moulded plinth with angle buttresses and a northeast canted stair turret. There is a west doorway, above which is a large five-light window. At the top of the window is a canopied niche containing a statue. In the clerestory are two-light windows, and along the sides of the aisles are buttresses and three-light windows. In the second bay of each aisle is a gabled porch. The transepts are also buttressed, and they contain windows with varied tracery; the south transept also has a circular window. The east window in the chancel has five lights, above which is a tripartite niche with a crocketed surround, containing a statue of the Virgin Mary. =Interior= Inside the church, the aisle arcades are carried on alternate round and octagonal piers. The richly carved altar dating from the 1860s is by E. W. Pugin. The Towneley Chapel contains dark panelling and painting on a gold surround, and has ironwork gates. In the nave is a scheme of stained glass windows from the late 19th century by Mayer of Munich. The two-manual pipe organ was built by Gray and Davidson in 1855, and has been awarded a Historic Organ Certificate. Associated structures Attached to the north and south sides of the church are cast iron railings, divided by standards with fleur-de-lis heads. On the north side is a gateway with stone piers in Gothic style between which are elaborate cast iron gates. To the east of the church are a Franciscan convent containing a chapel, and a presbytery. Appraisal St Mary's Church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 29 September 1977. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to buildings that are \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". The railings and gate piers are included in this listing. The Franciscan convent and the presbytery were also designed as Grade II listed buildings on the same date.

Early career Bimal Bose made his first-class debut for Bihar in the 1940-41 season as a left-arm medium-paced opening bowler, and was seldom out of the team for the next 23 seasons. He batted low in the order, and made his highest score of 66 against Bengal in his second match. Bihar needed 264 to take the first- innings lead, which in a drawn match, as this one seemed likely to be, effectively counted as a victory. Bose went in at 149 for seven, and was last man out, caught on the boundary going for the six that would have taken Bihar into the lead.Sujit Mukherjee, Autobiography of an Unknown Cricketer, Ravi Dayal, Delhi, 1996, p. 68. In the 1948-49 Ranji Trophy match against Delhi he took 7 for 42 in the first innings, then when Delhi needed only 78 in the second innings to win he and his captain Shute Banerjee dismissed them in 21 overs for 48, Bose taking 4 for 25. Captain of Bihar In his first match as captain in 1953-54 Bose took 3 for 71 and 6 for 65 in a drawn match against Bengal. In his next match, in 1954-55, he led Bihar to victory over Assam, taking 6 for 16 and 6 for 31 at Jorhat. In the 1957-58 season he took 8 for 43 (the other two batsmen were run out) and 2 for 36 against Assam in an innings victory, 4 for 32 and 7 for 31, bowling unchanged through both innings, in another innings victory over Orissa, and 5 for 87 off 46 overs in an innings loss to Bengal. His 8 for 43 remained the best-ever innings figures for Bihar; his overall record of 205 Ranji Trophy wickets is also the highest for Bihar.Wisden 1997, p. 1399. He took 26 wickets at an average of 8.80 in that season. Later career Bose's most successful season came two seasons later in 1959-60, when at the age of 41 he took 34 wickets at 14.29 in four matches. He began with 5 for 42 and 3 for 11 against Assam, then took 6 for 42 and 5 for 137 to give Bihar their first-ever victory over Bengal at the twenty-third attempt, and take Bihar into the Ranji Trophy semi-finals for the first time.Mukherjee, p. 69. They lost to Mysore in the semi-final on Bihar's home ground, Keenan Stadium in Jamshedpur, but Bose took 6 for 78 and 6 for 95, bowling 51 overs out of 108 in the second innings. He played his last match in 1963-64.

Synopsis The novel is about Barbara Parker, Miss Blackpool of 1964, who decides to abandon the idea of becoming a beauty queen. She heads for London, determined to make her mark as a television comedian, inspired by her idol Lucille Ball. After finding a job on a cosmetics counter in a London department store, she meets a theatrical agent, Brian Debenham, who finds her an audition for a television sitcom pilot based around the domestic life of a newlywed couple. Taking the name Sophie Straw, she becomes a star thanks to the leading role in the fiction Barbara (and Jim). Reception The Guardian praised the consistency of the lighthearted tone of the novel with the style of British comedy television in the 1960s, which Hornby defends resolutely. Similarly, The New York Times comments positively the position of the author towards pop culture, defining Hornby \\"competent and humane\\". The Independent criticized the change of focus in the novel, stating: \\"[...] it's a shame that Hornby abandons his funny girl halfway through for more of his hapless men.\\" Both the Los Angeles Times and the Library Journal report a level of flatness in the writing.

He was a senior Pakistani maritime pilot and port manager, and the first Indian to be appointed as a pilot in British India. A Master in the British Merchant Navy, he was appointed Pilot by the Karachi Port Trust in 1931. During World War II he was commissioned by the Royal Indian Navy and worked as Dock Master in Karachi, where after the war he was made Harbour Master. In 1949 the Government of Pakistan requisitioned his services for the development and expansion of Chittagong Port in East Bengal (later East Pakistan, now Bangladesh). In 1950 he was responsible for organizing and overseeing the establishment of a second port in East Bengal, at Chalna. Chalna Port would be Pakistan's third port, and the first to be established after the country's independence. Bhombal subsequently served as Port Director and Conservator at Chalna. Bhombal obtained his training in the Royal Indian Marine, after which he obtained his Foreign-going Second Mate Certificate. In 1929 he obtained his Foreign-going Master Certificate in the United Kingdom. He joined the British Merchant Navy and within a short while reached the rank of Chief Officer and then Master of the Vessel. He possessed a British Extra Master Certificate. Assignments at Karachi Port In 1931 Bhombal was appointed by the Karachi Port Trust in what was reported to be the first appointment in India of an Indian pilot. Being the only Indian among applicants for the post, his application was the subject of much discussion among members of the Trust. After being considered at four separate meetings that were repeatedly adjourned, the decision was finally taken on 23 October 1931, after some European members voted in favor of Bhombal. During World War II he was commissioned by the Royal Indian Navy and worked as Dock Master at Karachi Port Trust. After the war he was made Harbour Master at Karachi. Assignments at Chittagong Port In July 1949 the Pakistan Ministry of Communications requisitioned Bhombal's services as a special officer for the development of Chittagong Port in East Pakistan. However within two weeks of his arrival he was given the duties of Deputy Conservator, in which capacity he was to pilot ships in and out of the port and to train men. In addition to these duties, Bhombal completed the laying of five heavy first-class moorings which greatly increased the capacity of Chittagong Port, allowing it to take double the amount of foreign-going vessels. Previously the port had only six jetty berths and one mooring. In addition to the five heavy moorings, he also succeeded in laying numerous light moorings to accommodate small coastal vessels in the Karnaphuli River. Assignments at Chalna Port Following surveys of the Pasur River in 1948, the Pakistani government decided to establish an auxiliary anchorage to Chittagong at Chalna. The Communications Ministry selected Bhombal to organize and launch this new project. The Government announced the target date for the opening of Chalna Anchorage to be 8 December 1950. Bhombal arrived in Khulna on 4 October. With the work of Bhombal and his team, the port was informally opened on 11 December. Bhombal became Port Director and Conservator of the new port, with the designation \\"Officer-in- Charge\\". In 1954 the Port Directorate was shifted a few miles downstream to Mongla.

There was a church on this site in Saxon times. It was largely rebuilt in the 19th century. Early history The church stands on the site of Roman baths; it is thought there was originally a Saxon church here. Three churches in Dover are mentioned in the Domesday Book, and it has been supposed that these are St Mary's, St James' and St Peter's. The oldest parts of the existing building are the tower and three bays of the arcades, which are Norman architecture of the early 12th century.St \\"A History of St. Mary's Parish Church\\" Official site, accessed 28 September 2019.St Mary's Church Dover Town Council, accessed 3 April 2015.

The church was closed in 1537, at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but opened in 1544 as a parish church, after a petition of the townspeople. From 1581 it was the official church of the Mayor and corporation instead of St Peter's Church (which stood on the northern side of the market square and was in disrepair; it was demolished soon afterwards).St Mary's Church Old Dover in words and pictures, accessed 24 January 2015.\\"Market Square\\" Dover, Lock and Key of the Kingdom, accessed 27 February 2012. Via Wayback Machine. Rebuilding The nave of the church In 1843–1844, during the incumbency of Canon John Puckle, the church, except for the tower, was rebuilt in Early English style. The work was carried out by J. C. & C. Buckler. The church was enlarged and clerestory windows were added. The tower was restored in 1897. The church was damaged during the Second World War, but was not directly hit. Many of the stained glass windows were destroyed. Windows have been installed since the war to commemorate important relations between the church and the town. Bells The church has eight bells, originally made by Samuel Knight in 1724. In 1898, at the time the tower was restored, the bells were rehung in a new frame by John Warner & Sons, who recast the treble bell. The bells have since then been rehung twice, in 1947 and 2002.\\"Dover, St Mary the Virgin\\" Church Bells of Kent, accessed 20 March 2016. Via Wayback Machine.

Construction began in 1939, but was delayed by the onset of the Second World War, and was not completed until 1948. It has stabled three generations of trains, Standard stock, 1962 stock and 1992 stock. It has also housed trains of the experimental 1960 stock, both when it was conventionally controlled and during trials of Automatic Train Operation (ATO) in preparation for the construction of the Victoria Line. Some of the 1967 stock destined for the Victoria Line was also stabled at the depot while its ATO equipment was tested and commissioned on the Woodford to Hainault Branch. Until the advent of the 1992 stock, the depot faced a particular problem caused by the Hainault loop, and the fact that underground stock was handed. Trains could enter the depot from the Woodford direction or the Newbury Park direction. To prevent operational problems caused by the handedness, trains normally had to re-enter service in the same direction as they had left service, and reforming of trains within the depot was complicated by trains facing in both directions. In addition to service trains, the depot hosted a train of 1960 stock, owned by Cravens Heritage Trains, during the 1990s, and still hosts a train of 1962 stock, owned by the same group. The 1960 stock train was moved to Ruislip depot when the Central Line was upgraded for Automatic Train Protection and a new system of ATO in 1996, but the 1962 stock is being restored at Hainault. History Following its formation in 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board introduced a five- year New Works Programme, due to run from 1935 to 1940. A major part of this was extensions to the Central Line, both in the west to Ruislip, and in the east, to Leytonstone, Woodford, Epping and Ongar, partially using tracks which belonged to the London and North Eastern Railway. The extensions, which would create a route mileage of , meant that new depots would be required for the extra trains needed, and they were to be located at Ruislip and Hainault. Work began, but none of the Central Line extensions were completed before the outbreak of the Second World War, leaving the partially completed Hainault depot detached from the railway it was designed to serve. During the hostilities, the depot was used by the War Office and the U.S. Army Transportation Corps assembled rolling stock there between 1943 and 1945. It was also used as a temporary storage location for 190 cars of standard stock, which had been displaced by deliveries of 1938 stock during the war years. After the war, there was a shortage of money, materials and labour, and the rebuilding of the housing stock took priority over the remainder of the New Works Programme. However, the extensions to the Central Line were given top priority, and over the next four years, most were completed, with electric trains reaching Hainault and its depot from Newbury Park on 31 May 1948, and from Woodford on 21 November 1949. Although tracks had been laid by 1939, the entire depot, which was designed to handle 344 cars, had to be equipped and electrified. Parts of it became operational in 1947, and it was fully operational in 1948. The New Works Programme had included the purchase of 1,121 cars of 1938 stock, none of which were scheduled for use on the Central Line. All of the platforms on the Central Line had been lengthened to take 8-car trains, as part of the Programme, and the intention was that as the 1938 stock was delivered to the Northern and Bakerloo lines, the displaced standard stock would be refurbished at Acton Works for use on the Central Line. The transferred rolling stock was formed into 7-car trains. As traffic on the extended line built up, it soon became obvious that 7-car trains did not have adequate capacity for peak hour crowds, and some 8-car trains were assembled. The purchase of the 1949 stock released further cars so that there were 52 8-car trains working on the line, and the arrival of London Underground 1959 Stock enabled this process to be completed, so that by September 1960, Hainault had its full complement of 43 8-car trains. Hainault depot faced a particular problem, because it is located on the Hainault loop, and all Underground trains prior to 1960 were \\"handed\\". They had an \\"A\\" end and a \\"D\\" end, and in normal operation, an \\"A\\" end of one train can only be coupled to a \\"D\\" end of another. Problems can arise in an emergency if there is a mix of \\"right way\\" and \\"wrong way\\" trains, and in order to minimise this, Hainault station acted as a terminus for trains arriving from Newbury Park and from Woodford. Despite this, in the depot it was necessary to ensure that trains re-entered service in the same direction as they had been stabled, so that a train leaving service from the Woodford direction had to re-enter service in that direction. The presence of trains facing both directions also presented problems when re-forming trains in the depot, which was minimised by carrying additional spare rolling stock. The 1960 stock was designed to solve the problems of handedness, as extra wires were provided in the electrical couplers to make them fully reversible. Twelve motor cars were ordered and were assembled into six 4-car units, by modifying 2 extra standard stock trailers for each 4-car train. It was expected that these would be the first of 350 motor cars and the same number of converted trailers, for the complete upgrade of the Central Line, but the standard stock was proving to be increasingly unreliable, and there was insufficient time to assess the new prototypes. Instead, 57 trains of newly built 1959 stock were diverted from the Piccadilly line as an interim measure, and increased from seven cars to eight by ordering an extra 57 non-driving motor cars. Many of these were stabled at Hainault depot, until the delivery of 1962 stock, which was virtually identical to the 1959 stock. A total of 87 and a half 8-car trains were ordered, the first entering service on 12 April 1962, and by 17 May 1964, all of the 1959 stock had left the depot and been returned to the Piccadilly Line. The 1962 stock was still handed, with \\"A\\" and \\"D\\" ends, and so the problems of stabling them and managing them in the depot remained. Following initial trials of automatic train control on the District Line in 1963, five of the six 4-car units of 1960 stock were altered for a full-scale trial on the Woodford to Hainault branch. The intention was to ensure that such control was reliable by the time it was introduced on the Victoria Line, then under construction. Part of the conversion process involved the provision of a trip valve instead of a trip cock for emergency stopping of the train, but the trip cocks were retained, so that the trains could operate on tracks which were not equipped for automatic train operation, and the train stops on the Woodford to Hainault branch were retained, as conventional trains still had to use the branch to reach Hainault depot. The five units were stabled in the depot, and a maximum of four were used on the Woodford to Hainualt experiments at any one time, with the first train running on 5 April 1964. By 1974, the standard stock trailers were becoming a maintenance liability, and three of the units had their two trailers replaced by a single modified 1938 stock trailer. Because of the cost of the conversion, the trailers of the remaining two units were refurbished, which included repainting in white, rather than aluminium, at the depot. The depot also stored 1967 stock when it was first delivered. 4-car units arrived at Ruislip depot from the manufacturers, and were prepared for service there. They were then transferred to Hainault depot, where they were tested on the Woodford to Hainault branch. Once this was completed, the trains were transferred from the depot to Northumberland Park by battery locomotives, using the connection to British Rail's Eastern Region at Leyton. Units of 1967 stock were occasionally stabled at the depot after the Victoria Line had opened, to allow modification or overhaul of the 1960 stock. The next change occurred between 7 April 1993 and 17 February 1995, as the 1962 stock was withdrawn, to be replaced by 1992 stock. This consisted of four types of car, driving motor cars, designated as type 'A', and three variations of non- driving motor cars, designated as types 'B', 'C' and 'D'. These are formed into 2-car units, initially A+B, B+C or B+D, and 8-car trains are formed of four units, made up of any combination of available units, with a driving motor car at the outer ends. Crucially for the operation of the depot, all 2-car units are fully reversible, like the 1960 stock, enabling 8-car trains to be assembled with units facing in either direction, while trains entering the depot from the Woodford direction can re-enter service towards Newbury Park without causing operational difficulties. The depot has also been used for the stabling of other types of stock from time to time. In 2002, four 4-car units of 1972 Mk 1 stock were stored there following withdrawal from the Northern Line, pending a decision on their future. A 3-car unit was also stored there, prior to scrapping. Preservation In addition to the operational stock for the Central Line, two trains of privately owned stock have been based at the depot. Cravens Heritage Trains bought a 3-car train of 1960 stock, and this was stabled at Hainault following its use as the final train on the Epping to Ongar branch. Maintenance work on it was undertaken at the depot, and a series of rail tours were run on the eastern end of the Central Line during 1995 and 1996. It was moved to Ruislip depot, when the Central Line signalling was upgraded for Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Train Operation, which meant that the preserved unit could no longer operate on the Central Line, as it was not compatible with the new system. Cravens Heritage Trains also own a 4-car unit of 1962 stock, which remains at the depot, where it is being restored. Geography Hainault depot from the air, looking towards the north. 2018. Having run broadly west to east from Roding Valley through Chigwell to Grange Hill, the Hainault loop turns to the south to reach Hainault station. The depot is situated to the west of the loop, with the northern entrance turning off from the Central Line a little to the south of Grange Hill. Access to the loop at the southern end of the depot is to the north of Hainault station. The border between the county of Essex and the London Borough of Redbridge runs along the line of the railway from Grange Hill, and then runs along the western perimeter fence, before turning to the west before reaching the southern end of the site. Part of the depot site was in Essex until boundary alterations in 1998. The basic layout of the depot has changed very little throughout its history. In 2002, there was a train washing line immediately to the west of the service lines, followed by fifteen open-air sidings for stabling trains. To the west of those was a 9-road shed for stabling, and a couple of sidings near the administration block. Four of the carriage shed lines were only accessible from the northern end, while the westernmost five were through roads, which converged to run through a 3-road cleaning shed, further to the south. A second train washing machine was located to the south of that on one of the exit roads. The 1938 Ordnance Survey map shows the carriage shed, with the tracks at the northern end, and some of the stabling sidings next to the carriage shed. The structure of the cleaning shed is shown, but no tracks are connected to it.

It was established in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1865 and existed until 1931. In 1928, there were 5,497 Congregational churches in the U.S. with a membership of 939,130. These churches were served by 5,648 ministers. The Congregational churches originated from the Puritans of colonial New England. Congregationalists were traditionally Calvinists strongly committed to congregational polity, from which the denomination took its name. In 1931, the Congregationalists merged with the Christian Connection to form the Congregational Christian Churches. The National Council is a predecessor body to several American denominations, including the United Church of Christ, the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, and the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference. History American Congregationalism grew out of the Puritan migration to New England in the 17th century. The Congregational church was the established church of Connecticut until 1818 and Massachusetts until 1833. The Puritans and their Congregationalist descendants had much in common with Presbyterians. Both denominations shared a Reformed theology; however, Congregationalists practiced a more decentralized form of church governance described in the Cambridge Platform. In this, Congregationalists were similar to Baptists, but where Baptists practiced believers baptism by immersion, Congregationalists practiced infant baptism. Largely through the influence of Jonathan Edwards, Congregationalists came to adopt a moderate form of Calvinism known as New England theology and in a more radical form as New Haven theology. By the 19th century, Congregationalists were forming voluntary organizations for mutual cooperation and support among churches called associations. In some places, state-wide general associations were organized. In 1801, the Congregationalist churches of New England entered into a formal agreement with the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America called the Plan of Union. It remained in effect until 1852. By that time, Congregationalists had developed a greater denominational consciousness, which ultimately led to the first National Council in 1865. In 1927, motivated by the ecumenical movement, Congregationalists united with the Evangelical Protestant Church of North America. This was a pietistic denomination of Swiss and German origin with about six thousand members. The Evangelical Protestants were easily absorbed into the National Council. They shared with the Congregationalists an affinity for liberal theology, social activism and congregational polity. Beliefs In 1913, the National Council adopted the Kansas City Statement of Faith. This confessional statement affirmed belief in the Trinity and the Bible's role in revealing God's will. It also affirmed the \\"freedom and responsibility of the individual soul, and the right of private judgment.\\" The church's mission was described as \\"to proclaim the gospel to all mankind, exalting the worship of the one true God, and laboring for the progress of knowledge, the promotion of justice, the reign of peace, and the realization of human brotherhood.\\" The Social Gospel flourished among Congregational churches, and the National Council pledged itself to work for a society that guaranteed a decent wage and denied privileges for the wealthy. In 1925, the National Council adopted a Statement of Social Ideals, which outlined a progressive \\"Christian social order\\". The five ideals include universal education, support for labor unions, the preservation and support of rural communities as well as price controls on agricultural products, the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, and the abolition of all national armed forces except for internal police. Organization Interior of Old South Church in Boston, built in 1873 The Congregational churches adhered to congregational polity where local congregations remained legally autonomous and independent. Congregations managed their own internal affairs through church meetings where all church members were entitled to vote. The church meeting elected the congregation's minister and deacons. At the same time, congregations voluntarily cooperated together in district associations and state conferences. Meetings of the National Council occurred every two years. Each district association elected one delegate to the Council, and each state conference elected two delegates, one of which had to be a woman. District associations with more than 10 churches were entitled to send one delegate for each additional 10 churches. State conferences with membership greater than 10 thousand were entitled to send two delegates for each additional 10 thousand members, and half of these additional delegates had to be women. The purpose of the National Council was to provide a forum to coordinate common programs and organizations of Congregational churches, such as managing a pension fund for Congregationalist ministers. A moderator presided over sessions of the Council. An Executive Committee elected by the Council was responsible for overseeing the work of the various agencies of the Council in between biennial sessions. Day-to-day affairs were managed by a full-time Secretary of the National Council. Mission societies Church of the Covenant, in Boston Coordinating missionary work was one of the primary functions of the National Council. Many of the National Council's affiliated societies were originally interdenominational when founded. Foreign missionary work was carried out by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, an organization that predated the creation of the National Council. In 1928, the American Board sponsored 718 missionaries throughout the world. Several missions agencies operated within the United States under the umbrella of the Church Extension Boards. The Congregational Home Missionary Society (org. 1826) was a church planting agency that as of 1930 was responsible for four out of every five American Congregational churches in existence. In 1927, the society sponsored 1,539 missionaries. The Congregational Church Building Society (org. 1853) raised funds for grants and loans to build churches and parsonages. The Congregational Sunday School Extension Society (org. 1917) was responsible for establishing and maintaining Sunday schools in addition to recruiting college students to staff them. The American Missionary Association, which also predated the National Council, was primarily focused on education and evangelism among African Americans, Appalachia residents, Native Americans, and Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chinese and Japanese communities.

He was also a distinguished army officer, long-serving cabinet minister, Ambassador to the United States, member of Churchill's War Cabinet, and Governor of Bengal. Casey was born in Brisbane, but moved to Melbourne when he was young. He studied engineering at the University of Melbourne and then went on to Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1914, Casey enlisted as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force. He saw service in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front, reaching the rank of major and winning the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross before becoming a Chief Intelligence Officer in 1920. Casey joined the Australian public service in 1924 to work at Whitehall as a liaison officer with the British administration. He reported directly to the prime minister, Stanley Bruce, with whom he developed a close relationship. In 1931, Casey was elected to federal parliament for the United Australia Party. He served as Treasurer from 1935 to 1939 (under Joseph Lyons and Earle Page), and then as Minister for Supply and Development from 1939 to 1940 (under Robert Menzies). During World War II, Casey was Ambassador to the United States from 1940 to 1942, and then joined Winston Churchill's War Cabinet as its representative in the Middle East. In 1944, Churchill appointed him Governor of Bengal, where he handled the recovery from the 1943 famine and civil unrest in the lead-up to independence. Casey returned to Australia in 1946. He was federal president of the fledgling Liberal Party from 1947 to 1950, and re-entered parliament at the 1949 election. Casey was reappointed to cabinet shortly after, again serving under Robert Menzies. He held various national development portfolios from 1949 to 1951, and then served as Minister for External Affairs until his retirement from politics in 1960. In 1965, Menzies named Casey to replace Lord De L'Isle as governor-general. He served for just under four years; the only major constitutional issue during his tenure was the disappearance of Harold Holt in 1967. The City of Casey was named in recognition of Richard Casey. Early life and education Casey was born in Brisbane, Queensland, as Richard Gavin Gardiner Casey, but he dropped the \\"Gavin\\" in later life. His father, also named Richard Gardiner Casey, was a wealthy pastoralist and Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly of Irish descent. His mother, Evelyn, was the daughter of George Harris, another wealthy pastoralist and Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. His father moved the family to Melbourne in 1893 and became a rich company director. Casey was educated at Cumloden School, St Kilda, and at Melbourne Grammar School. He enrolled for engineering at the University of Melbourne, where he was a resident student at Trinity College in 1909 and 1910, but then travelled to England, entering Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1913, graduating with second-class honours in the mechanical sciences tripos. By the custom of Cambridge, this was translated to a Master of Arts in 1918. Military and early career At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Casey joined the Australian Imperial Force, receiving a commission as a lieutenant in the 3rd Infantry Brigade on 14 September. He was a member of the first convoy on board the Orvieto, and was the responsible officer looking after the German prisoners from the SMS Emden following the Battle of Cocos until the ship reached Colombo. He was appointed an aide-de-camp on 27 February 1915, and was appointed a staff captain on the brigade staff on 20 August, receiving the corresponding promotion to captain from the same date. He served at Gallipoli as aide-de-camp to Major General Sir William Bridges. Casey was standing next to Bridges when Bridges was shot by a sniper (he died three days later). A statue of Casey being rescued by a Turkish soldier has pride of place in the Gallipoli battlefields. Later he served in France, where he observed operations and sifted information, earning the Military CrossLondon Gazette: (Supplement) no. 29886, page 44, 29 December 1916 and promotion to brigade major of the 8th Brigade. This position involved dangerous visits to the front line and he received a Distinguished Service Order in 1918.London Gazette: (Supplement) no. 30450, page 28, 28 December 1917 He resigned his commission in June 1919 and transferred to the Reserve of Officers, serving as a part-time intelligence officer in Melbourne. Casey's father died in 1919 and he returned after the war to Melbourne to take over his father's business interests including engineering and mining firms. He did this until 1924, when Prime Minister Stanley Bruce appointed him his political liaison officer in London, a position he held until 1931, sending home confidential reports on political and economic matters, both for Bruce and for his Labor successor, James Scullin. In 1926 he married Ethel Marian Sumner (Maie) Ryan, daughter of Sir Charles Snodgrass Ryan, with whom he had two children. Political career Casey in his office as Australian Minister to the United States. In 1931 Casey returned to Australia and was elected to the House of Representatives as the United Australia Party (UAP) Member for the Geelong-based seat of Corio. Prime Minister Joseph Lyons appointed him an assistant minister in 1933, and in 1935 he became Treasurer. In 1939 Robert Menzies became Prime Minister for the first time. He saw Casey as a rival, and moved him to the lesser portfolio of Supply and Development. In 1940 Casey resigned from parliament when Menzies appointed him as the first Australian Ambassador to the United States. This was a vital posting in wartime, but it also served to remove Casey from domestic politics. Casey was in Washington, D.C. when the US entered the war, and played an important role in establishing the alliance between the US and Australia.R.G. Casey (2008) A Delicate Mission: The Washington Diaries of R.G. Casey 1940-42/ Edited by Carl Bridge, Canberra, National Library of Australia, In this effort he engaged the services of public relations counselor Earl Newsom. Richard Casey, Minister Resident in the Middle East, stands on the far right; Lebanon, 1942 Casey moved to Cairo in 1942 when Winston Churchill appointed him Minister-Resident for the Middle East, to the annoyance of Prime Minister John Curtin and some in the British Foreign Office. In this role he played a key role in negotiating between the British and Allied governments, local leaders and the Allied commanders in the field. In 1944, when the Middle East ceased to be a military theatre, the British government appointed Casey as the Governor of Bengal, in India, a post which he held till 1946. During his tenure he had to deal with the aftermath of the devastating Bengal famine of 1943. He also had to deal with the ever more vocal demands for independence from Britain by Indian patriots, represented politically by the Indian National Congress. In 1946 Casey returned to Australia in the hope of being elected to parliament in the 1946 election and becoming the leader of the new Liberal Party that Menzies had formed in 1944, as part of his reorganisation of conservative politics in Australia. Casey had turned down the offer of a British peerage to preserve his political chances. However, he was too late to organise his pre- selection for a seat. He was persuaded to become Federal President of the Liberal Party in September 1947 and proved to be a very effective fundraiser, partly as a result of his past social and business connections. Although Menzies still saw Casey as a rival, and although Casey undoubtedly saw himself as a future Prime Minister, they formed an effective partnership. The Liberals won the 1949 election, and Casey returned to the House of Representatives as Member for the outer Melbourne seat of La Trobe. Menzies appointed him Minister for Supply and Development and Minister for Works and Housing. In March 1950 he became Minister for National Development, gaining functions from Eric Harrison's abolished portfolio of Postwar Reconstruction and losing supply to Howard Beale. In 1951, when the Minister for External Affairs, Percy Spender (another Menzies rival), was dispatched to the Washington embassy, Casey succeeded him. Casey held the External Affairs post during the height of the Cold War, the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War and other major world events. He formed close relations with Anthony Eden, John Foster Dulles and other leaders. Casey was also Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) from March 1950, and he was committed to its success. On 16 May 1960 Casey was created a life peer of the British House of Lords, on the recommendation of the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, taking the title Baron Casey, of Berwick in the State of Victoria in the Commonwealth of Australia and of the City of Westminster;Sir David Smith, What shall we do with ex-Governors-General? next month he resigned from the ministry and parliament. For most Australians, Britain was still the mother country, but it was by then becoming something of an anomaly that an Australian should be appointed to another country's parliament. Lord Casey made annual trips to London and put in appearances in the House of Lords, but he had no obvious constituency. He was also appointed to the executive of the CSIRO in 1960. Governor-General Government House, Calcutta, during World War II Casey as Governor-General in 1965 In 1965 the Queen, on Menzies' recommendation, appointed Lord Casey Governor-General to succeed Lord De L'Isle. This was the first time a non-Labor prime minister had recommended an Australian for the post, but it also marked the end of the appointment of non- Australians to the office of Governor-General. He was initially reluctant to accept the post, but when he did accept, he asked for a two-year appointment instead of the usual five years, subject to extension should he wish to continue. In the event, he served for three and a half years. According to William McMahon, Prime Minister Harold Holt (Menzies' successor) considered having Casey dismissed from the governor-generalship, and went as far as to have the necessary documents drawn up. This was because Casey had twice called McMahon into Yarralumla to give him a \\"dressing down\\" over his poor relationship with Deputy Prime Minister John McEwen, which he believed was affecting the government. Holt agreed with McMahon that this was an improper intervention in the political process, but no further action was taken. In April 1967, during the Wave Hill walk-off, the Gurindji strikers drafted a petition to Casey, asking for a lease of around Daguragu, to be run cooperatively by the Gurundji as a mining and cattle lease. The petition said \\"We feel that morally the land is ours and should be returned to us\\". However, in June 1967 Casey refused the lease. One of the arguments against appointing an Australian, particularly a former politician, had always been that they would be too closely involved with Australian personalities and issues to perform their constitutional role impartially. This became an acute issue for Casey in December 1967, when Holt disappeared, presumed drowned. Casey could have commissioned McMahon, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, as acting Prime Minister or Caretaker prime minister, but instead he appointed John McEwen, the leader of Liberals' coalition partner, the Country Party. In this he was following a precedent set in 1939, when Sir Earle Page was appointed Prime Minister following the death of Joseph Lyons. But it was later alleged that Casey appointed McEwen to prevent McMahon having an advantage in the Liberal Party's ballot for a new leader, since he shared the view of some Liberals that McMahon would not be a suitable successor. This matter was aired in a 1969 book, The Power Struggle, by veteran political journalist Alan Reid. Casey's biographer, W.J. Hudson says (in his 1986 book Casey) that Casey was concerned to preserve the Liberal-Country Party coalition, and that he knew (because McEwen had told him) that the Country Party would not serve under McMahon. (McEwen publicly confirmed his party's position on McMahon the day after his swearing-in.) If this was his motive for commissioning McEwen rather than McMahon, it suggests that he did take political considerations into account in making his decision. On the other hand, if the coalition were to disband, there would have been no party that could command a majority in the parliament and it could well have become unworkable. Casey's Official Secretary throughout his term was Murray Tyrrell, who was knighted in 1968. Casey left office in 1969 and he and his wife retired to their farm at Berwick in Victoria. Casey never fully recovered from a car accident in 1974, and died on 17 June 1976 at St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, survived by his wife, daughter and son. He is buried in Mount Macedon cemetery. Arms Casey received a Military Cross, was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order and was twice Mentioned in Despatches during the First World War. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1944. In 1960, he was created \\"Baron Casey, of Berwick in the State of Victoria and the Commonwealth of Australia, and of the City of Westminster\\", becoming the second (and last) Australian politician (after Stanley Bruce) to be elevated to the House of Lords (Sir John Forrest is sometimes mentioned in such lists, however his peerage was never formally established). He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1965, and a Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) in 1969. In 1969 also, he was named Australian of the Year. The municipality which includes Berwick is now called the City of Casey. There is also federal Electoral Division of Casey (in a different part of Melbourne). The Canberra suburb of Casey and Casey Station, a base in the Australian Antarctic Territory, were named in Casey's honour. The R. G. Casey Building in Canberra is the headquarters of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Since 2003 the airport only features a grass runway used mostly by ultralight aircraft and general aviation aircraft. This is located next to a closed formerly military runway. The airport was planned by the Norwegian Army Air Service as a main air station during the late 1930s, but the plans were stopped by the break-out ofh the Second World War. Haslemoen was built as a labor camp in 1943 and then taken over by Luftwaffe, who built the airport. Opening in August 1944, its main purpose was to station a squadron of Focke- Wulf Fw 200 Condors. Haslemoen was rebuilt and opened as the base of the Artillery Battalion in 1955. Operation of the airport resumed in 1960 with the delivery of Cessna O-1 Bird Dog observation aircraft. They remained in service with the artillery until 1992. The grass ultralight runway was established in 1990 and was sold to Våler Municipality in 2007. History The interest to establish an airfield and military base at Haslemoen was first articulated by the Norwegian Army Air Service in the late 1930s. Their two main air stations in Eastern Norway, Kjeller and Gardermoen, were both too small. They therefore proposed that the relatively flat, forested areas at Haslemoen would be a suitable site for a main air station. Grants to expropriate was granted by Parliament in February 1940. Clearing of was completed by April. A planned meeting om 9 April concerning further construction was, however, interrupted by the German invasion.Gamst: 121 Haslemoen was built in 1943 as a camp for conscripted labor services, serving in the Våler area. Haslemoen served in this capacity until the end of the year, when it was taken over by Luftwaffe. They were concerned about an attack on Norway and wanted to establish a reserve airport for Gardermoen, located far from the coast. Construction began in late 1943. Originally the airport was proposed to also have a water airport on the lake Gjesåssjøen, using water during summer and the ice and runway during winter.Gamst: 122 The airfield was taken into use in late 1944, although minor works continued until the end of the war in May 1945. Both a runway, measuring , and a taxiway were built, along with auxiliary buildings, barracks, hangars, storehouses and workshops. The concrete for the runway was of poor quality and caused problems with frost heaving.Gamst: 123 The airport saw little during the remainder of the Second World War, after its opening in August 1944.Hafsten: 316 From 21 November it served as a base for a squadron of the remaining Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors in Norway, reaching 28 aircraft by 28 December. Thereafter their numbers dwindled as they were transferred to the Continent. They squadron was disbanded on 7 March 1945, by which time only two Condors remained in Norway.Hafsten: 307 Haslemoen was also home to a target tug squadron. The aerodrome was taken over by the Royal Norwegian Air Force after the war ended on 8 May 1945. Initially Haslemoen was used as a transit camp for German soldiers before being repatriated. RNoAF allocated Haslemoen to a light bomber squadron, which was to be operated on a repetition- and mobilization basis.Arheim: 48 Soon the air force decided to re-prioritize its fleet procurement,Arheim: 49 and by 1948 it was clear that Haslemoen would not be used as an air station.Arheim: 50 Haslemoen Base was, however, rebuilt for the Artillery Battalion and opened on 24 April 1955. The Air Force took delivery of the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog in 1960, and those allocated to Southern Norway were stationed at Haslemoen Airport. These were used for aerial observations to support the artillery. They remained in service until 1992.Arheim: 175 A government commission considered Haslemoen in 1988 as a potential main air station for Eastern Norway. Although there was ample space available and the area relatively flat, the airport was cut early in the process. The main concern was that its proximity to Sweden meant that operations would cause problems for the self-imposed no-fly zone for allied aircraft. The runway needed to be shifted east, meaning that little of the existing infrastructure could be used.Ministry of Defence: 32 Solungen Mikroflyklubb was established in 1990. In cooperation with the military it built a parallel, grass runway to the east of the concrete runway. A second proposal for Haslemoen Airport came in 1992, during the retirement of the Bird Dogs. The Air Force proposed replacing the observation services with helicopters. While the Army preferred basing them with the artillery at Haslemoen, the Air Force preferred basing them at either Rygge Air Station or Bardufoss Air Station. In the end no replacement aircraft were bought for the Bird Dogs. The artillery was moved to Rena Base in 2003 and Haslemoen subsequently closed. The property was bought by Våler Municipality for 46 million Norwegian krone in 2007. The military abandonment saw the airport facilities being used for motor sports. The pinnacle was hosting 2007 Rally Norway. The municipality changed the focus away from motor sports and instead initiated a program to cultivate of the former base, including the airport area. Facilities The airport consisted of a concrete runway which measured . It also had a series of taxiways and aircraft shelters for a squadron of aircraft. This consisted both of taxiways to the shelters and a parallel taxiway located west of the runway. The control tower was situated between the runway and parallel taxiway. The workshop and communications center were located close to the garrison, west of the aerodrome. The current runway consists of a grass cover measuring . It is used by ultralight and general aviation aircraft and is operated by Solungen Mikroflyklubb.

Current is then passed between the two edges of the steel to heat the steel to a point at which the edges are forced together to form a bond without the use of welding filler material. Initially this manufacturing process used low frequency A.C. current to heat the edges. This low frequency process was used from the 1920s until 1970. In 1970, the low frequency process was superseded by a high frequency ERW process which produced a higher quality weld. Over time, the welds of low frequency ERW pipe was found to be susceptible to selective seam corrosion, hook cracks, and inadequate bonding of the seams, so low frequency ERW is no longer used to manufacture pipe. The high frequency process is still being used to manufacture pipe for use in new pipeline construction. The Poplar Pipeline was built in the 1950s using pipe made with low-frequency electric resistance welds as was the Pegasus Pipeline.

He is best known for his legal efforts to end racial segregation in Austin schools. Overton was born in Maha in the rural southeast of Travis County. He served in the Marines in World War II, then in the Army Reserves, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. After World War II, he attended Tillotson College (now part of Huston-Tillotson University from 1947 to 1950 where he earned a B.S. degree in chemistry with a minor in math. He also met his wife, Warneta while studying there. They had four children, who were often involved in Overton's civil rights work; their daughter DeDra was named the plaintiff in the federal lawsuit he led to desegregate Austin schools. The lawsuit lasted a decade and Overton, backed by the NAACP Legal Defense, the U.S. Justice Department and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, ultimately prevailed.  Career  Volma Overton served in the Marine Corps for two years and the United States Reserves for twenty-eight years, then retired. He joined the National Postal Service and later joined the National Alliance of Postal Workers due to unfair treatment to minorities. Overton then served as a civil rights activist and president of the NAACP Austin chapter. He then focused his career on confronting zoning and busing issues within AISD, to ensure that they were made without segregation in mind. Following his life of military and civil action, he then became the first black member of the First Baptist Church of Austin, Texas in 1963 and became a deacon of the church in 1967.  The AISD Desgregation Plan  Although Volma Overton was truly interested in the brutal fight over how to write the Desegregation Plan for the Austin School System, he remained a bystander for most of the time. However, whenever the local branch NAACP attorney, Sam Biscoe needed help or information on certain topics, Mr. Volma consult with Biscoe to the best of his ability. What were some of the key milestones? All schools in the Austin area were segregated by race, meaning African-Americans were separated from the whites and while it wasn't specifically mention in the Jim Crow laws that Mexican Americans should be segregated, they still were put apart from the whites. After the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, Volma along with AISD Board of Trustees still were not pleased with the treatment of minorities. In 1968, The H.E.W (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) decided that the AISD was not following the rules of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that more changes needed to be made. The first reaction was to create \\"one-way busing\\" for students of color which started in 1971. Judge Jack Roberts ordered the one-way busing of African-American students which was then reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. They decided that \\"...no race should have to bear the burden of busing.\\" On April 15, 1973, the Austin School Board came up with an agreeable desegregation plan after being turned down four times. Some saw this as a huge leap forward while others such as Gus Garcia, a trustee of the School Board, thought that the final product seemed like it was just agreed upon, not truly written. To some, including Volma, it was believed that it did not address the issues that they wanted but that it benefited minorities \\"...in a way that can be healthy.\\" Two-way busing was introduced in 1979 and lasted till 1986. Mr. Overton and the NAACP did not only pay attention to the mistreatment of African-Americans, but they extended their advocacy to Mexican-Americans to begin to provide a more diverse childhood school experience for more students. In 1976, Volma reached the 14 year milestone as president of the Austin branch so February 13 was declared \\"Volma Overton Appreciation Day\\". It was held on a Friday at the Stephen F. Austin Hotel in downtown Austin.  NAACP Activities  Volma Overton became the NAACP president of the Austin chapter in 1962. Overton marched alongside Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Selma to Montgomery march in 1965. Overton received the Arthur B. DeWitty Award from the NAACP in 1967. While working with the NAACP Overton received many complaints about racial bias in the Austin area and was asked for help. For example, John. G. Evans, Jr wrote a letter to Overton and the NAACP Austin Chapter to let them know of his discrimination case against the Veterans Administration, Data Processing Center, Austin, Texas. In his case Mr. Evans claimed that the VA had discriminated against him by denying him a promotion based on race. Mr. Evans had also requested the help of the N.F.F.E Local union 1745 actually legally represented him in the matter.Courtesy Huston- Tillotson University Archives, Austin, TX, USA. Letter from John. G. Evans to Mr. Volma R. Overton, Box 2, Folder 4, Huston-Tilotson University Archives, Downs-Johns Library, Huston-Tilotson University, Austin, TX  Legacy  Volma Overton left behind a lasting legacy in Austin, from having an elementary named after him in 2006 and an award from the NAACP named after him, which is currently known as the DeWitty/Overton award. Overton established the first credit union in east Austin, and created an annual golf tournament in which the proceeds would provide scholarships for talented minorities. The Overton House was turned into a community center for African-Americans in Austin. The house, which was located on Springdale Road continued to be a beacon to others for help in their struggle for justice and goal to overcome prejudice. Overton was influential in the mentoring program at Oak Spring Elementary, who's goal was to serve mainly low-income minority students.  Awards  * NAACP Arthur B.

He held several prominent legal appointments. He was the younger son of the Episcopalian cleric and author Archibald Alison. His elder brother was the physician and social reformer William Alison. Background He was born at the parsonage at Kenley, Shropshire, to the Rev. Archibald Alison and his wife Dorothea Gregory, daughter of John Gregory, and granddaughter of James Forbes, 17th Lord Forbes. In 1800 his parents moved the family back to Edinburgh, as his father thought that he could give his sons a better education and more independent careers in Scotland.Stephen, Leslie (1885). \\"Alison, Sir Archibald (1792–1867).\\" In: Dictionary of National Biography, Vol. 1. New York: Macmillan & Co., p. 286–7. After studying under a private tutor, and at the University of Edinburgh, he was, in 1814, admitted to the Faculty of Advocates, at which he ultimately attained some distinction, becoming in 1834 Sheriff of Lanarkshire. In 1853, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law by the University of Oxford.

According to the record, he benefited from a payment of £4,081,18s,10d, an approximate £346,000 in 2015, made by the government of United Kingdom and Great Britain as recorded by the Slave Compensation Commission and the records held at the National Archives in London.

This multi-volume set is usually regarded as Alison's chief historical work and is considered to be the first scholarly English-language study of the French Revolution. Published in ten volumes between 1833 and 1843, History of Europe was revised and reprinted many times throughout the century, including numerous foreign language editions.\\"It was by far the best-selling history of the French Revolution in England and America almost to the end of the century, and was translated into most European and several oriental languages.\\" — Ben Israel, Hedva (1968). English Historians of the French Revolution. London: Cambridge University Press, p. 152. The work is one of vast industry, \\"contain[ing] a wealth of information communicated in a vigorous though wordy style.\\" Disraeli satirises the author in Coningsby as Mr. Wordy, who wrote a history to prove that Providence was on the side of the Tories.Disraeli, Benjamin (1844). Conningsby, Vol. 1. London: Henry Coulburn, p. 265. Such criticism notwithstanding, History of Europe proved to be a huge commercial success. By 1848 100,000 copies had been sold in the United States. It was translated into French, German, and even Arabic, in which language 2,000 copies were published \\"under the auspices of the Pasha of Egypt.\\"Stephen (1885), p. 289.

He was elected Lord Rector successively of Marischal College, Aberdeen, and of the University of Glasgow. On 25 June 1852 he was created a baronet, during Lord Derby's administration. Family and death In 1825, he married Elizabeth Glencairn Tytler (1799-1874), the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Duff Tytler (1760-1849); the children from the marriage were Archibald, Frederick and Ella Frances Catherine who married James Charlemagne Dormer. Both sons became distinguished British military officers. The 1st Baronet's autobiography was published in 1883; his portrait was painted by Robert Scott Lauder. Alison died at Possil House, Glasgow, at the age of 74, and was interred in Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh. He enjoyed great popularity in Glasgow. His funeral was attended by a crowd of from 100,000 to 150,000 people.Stephen (1885), p. 290.

He also slammed inefficient loss making state-owned enterprises as they have created losses in state banks while giving a \\"free ride\\" to private banks as they exploit significant lending spreads by the government banks and proposed to make public enterprises more efficient so that the banking system can be more efficient and make the economy grow faster. =Government bonds Scam and nepotism and insider information leakage = In February 2015 CBSL advertised the sale of Rs. 1 billion in 30-year government bonds at a coupon of 12.5% though several accounts erroneously cite an indicative rate of 9.5%. The sale was oversubscribed with 36 bids of totaling Rs. 20 billion. The majority of bidders, 26, bidded for Rs. 100 million or less at a rate of 9.5%–10.5%. However, a few bidders, including Perpetual Treasuries Limited, wanted interest rates of 11%–12%. On 27 February 2015 the CBSL accepted Rs. 10 billion in bids at rates of 9.5%–12.5%. The issuing of ten times the advertised bonds, and at a higher than expected rate, was alleged to cost the Sri Lankan government an additional Rs. 1.6 billion ($10.6 million), though this alleged loss was disputed by the Leader of the House of Parliament. A petition was lodged in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka contesting the methodology used to allege such a loss. Perpetual Treasuries was issued, directly and indirectly, with Rs. 5 billion in bonds at 12.5%. Perpetual Treasuries was one of the primary dealers in the sale and is owned by Mahendran's son-in-law Arjun Aloysius. The primary dealer had also appointed the sister of the former Central Bank Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraal onto the Board of its holding company. This situation became a controversial political issue in Sri Lanka as the newly elected Sri Lankan Government of President Maithreepala Sirisena came to power with a slogan of good governance in the country. A three-member Committee of eminent lawyers was appointed to investigate the issue and the report produced by the committee claimed that there was no direct involvement by Mahendran in the deal. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka did not grant leave to proceed in a fundamental rights case that requested a separate inquiry into the bond issue, as no laws were broken.Court cannot direct CB Governor as no law has been broken: Counsel  The Sunday Times Sri Lanka. Sundaytimes.lk (10 May 2015). Retrieved on 19 November 2015. Mahendran denied any wrongdoing in the controversial bond auction and asserted that he was ready to face any inquiry to prove his innocence. He also said he had been made a victim due to his own transparency.I’m a victim of my own transparency – CB Governor Mahendran http://nation.lk/online/2015/06/13/im-a- victim-of-my-own-transparency-cb-governor-mahendran.html On the other hand, former governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ajith Nivard Cabraal who preceded Mahendran charged that a higher hand was involved in the scandal given the scale of the cover-up attempts by the Sri Lankan government.INTERVIEW: Higher hand involved in bond scam http://nation.lk/online/2015/06/20/major-mission-to-cover-up-bond-scam.html Cabraal himself is the subject of several investigations by the law enforcement authorities on alleged misconduct during his tenure as Governor. On 28 October 2016 the Committee on Public Enterprises, after a lengthy investigation, found Mahendran responsible for the Bond Issue Scam and recommended legal action be taken against the above.Mahendran responsible for CB Bond scam: COPE report http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Mahendran- responsible-for-CB-Bond-scam-COPE-report--118266.htmlMahendran responsible for CB Bond scam: COPE report http://newsfirst.lk/english/2016/10/cope-report- former-cbsl-governor-arjuna-mahendran-found-accountable-bond-scam/153007 However President Maithripala Sirisena has announced that he has appointed a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry to further investigate the case. This commission consisted of commission's chairman Justice K. T. Chitrasiri and members Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and retired Deputy Auditor General, V. Kandasamy. During the inquiry, Mahendran defended his actions before the Commission stating that he had not acted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the Government. The commission handed over the report on Central Bank bond issuance to the President Maithripala Sirisena on 30 December 2017 and the Presidential Secretariat made available the full report in PDF form from its website for public viewing. In the findings of the report, Arjuna Mahendra was held directly responsible for causing a loss of LKR 11,145 million to public institutions. However, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced that 'No financial loss will be caused to the government on account of the Central Bank Bond issue since the government will recover the Rs 9.2 billion involved from Perpetual Treasures Ltd. according to the procedure recommended by the Presidential Commission. The Central Bank functioning under the Ministry of National Policy has already blocked and retained a fund of Rs 12 billion belonging to the Perpetual Treasures Ltd' The prolonged nature of the inquiry may be linked to a growing rift between Sri Lanka's President and Prime Minister and the two political parties they each represent in an increasingly fraught coalition government. A group of ministers from the President's party along with opposition MPs failed in a recent attempt to pass a motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister in Sri Lanka's Parliament. A key issue in the motion was the Prime Minister's alleged interference in the Central Bank. The President has subsequently had to prorogue Parliament =Arrest order quashed= On 15 March 2018 Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court issued an arrest warrant on Arjuna Mahendra on charges of criminal breach of trust for allegedly providing confidential information of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to Perpetual Treasuries Limited, a primary dealer connected to and owned by his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius who was arrested on 4 February 2018 along with Kasun Palisena, who was the CEO of Perpetual Treasuries Limited. Mahendra did not surrender himself to the court. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka had earlier rejected a similar petition. News reports state that Mr Mahendran has challenged the order through the International Police (Interpol). Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made a statement in the Sri Lanka Parliament on 5 June 2018 stating that the Singapore government has refused to arrest Mahendran Lawyers of the accused have made submissions to court contending that the presentation of the Commission of Inquiry CCOI) report in a court of law as evidence is not admissible as the COI does not formally follow the judicially recognised law of evidence. On 28 June 2019, a case was filed at the Permanent High Court Trial at Bar by the Attorney General against Mahendran accused in the Central Bank Treasury Bond Scam and lost multi billions from Sri Lankan's public money. On 16 June 2020, the attorney general of Sri Lanka alleged that, according to Interpol, Mahendran had changed his name to Harjan Alexander.

It is a redundant Anglican parish church, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. Holy Trinity is a Commissioners' church designed by Lewis Vulliamy in Early English style. The church was extended in 1871–72, but closed in 1990, and has been converted into flats. History Holy Trinity was a Commissioners' church, the Church Building Commission awarding a grant of £1,168 towards the cost of its construction. Its total cost was £2,918. The church was designed by Lewis Vulliamy and was built in 1835–36. The chapelry district of Holy Trinity, Habergham Eaves was assigned in 1843. In 1871-72 the chancel was enlarged and a vestry was added, probably by William Waddington. The church was declared redundant on 1 January 1990. By the following year it was derelict, having been damaged in a fire, but it was restored and converted into flats in 1993. Its benefice has been united with that of St Matthew, Burnley. Architecture The church is constructed in punch-dressed sandstone ashlar, and has slate roofs with inserted skylight windows. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a four-bay nave without aisles, a two-bay chancel with a north chapel and a south vestry, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages, with clasping buttresses, and contains paired west doorways, a clock face in a diamond-shaped surround, and pairs of louvred bell openings. At the top of the tower is an embattled parapet with octagonal corner pinnacles, and there are more pinnacles at the angles of the nave. The bays of the nave are separated by buttresses, and each bay contains a corbel-table and a pair of lancet windows. The sides of the chancel also contain paired lancet windows, and the east window consists of a triple stepped lancet in a blank arch. The north chapel is gabled, and contains a wheel window. The interior has been remodelled, but originally it contained a three-sided gallery on cast iron columns. Appraisal Holy Trinity Church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 29 September 1977. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to buildings that are \\"nationally important and of special interest\\".

Life =Early years= Hugo Gräf was born in a small village some 20 km (12 miles) south of Erfurt in the southern part of what was then central Germany. His father was employed in the building trade: his mother worked in domestic service and agriculture. Gräf worked as a farm labourer from 1902, later undertaking a training as a pipefitter which enabled him to become an itinerant labourer. He became a member of the German Metal Workers' Union in 1907 and joined the Social Democratic Party on 1 May 1910. =Military life and politics= He was called up for military service in 1912 which would normally have lasted for two years, but the outbreak of war in August 1914 saw him conscripted into the war-time army. In 1916 he was badly wounded and sent home without his left leg. In 1916/17 he was conscripted to work in a gun factory in Erfurt. Here, in 1917, he joined the newly formed Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD / Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) which had broken away from the mainstream SPD primarily over the existing party's continued support for the war. He also joined the Spartacus league in 1917 or 1918. In January 1918 he played a leading role in the organisation in Erfurt of the mass strikes which took place in much of Germany that month. Membership of the USPD and the closely associated Spartacus League led naturally to the newly emerging Communist Party (KPD), and on 26 December 1918 Gräf was a co-founder of the Erfurt branch. In June 1920 Gräf was thrown out of the Communist Party for \\"anti-parliamentarianism\\" because he had refused to put his name forward as a candidate for membership of the Reichstag (national legislature) in that year's General Election. It was not the last time he would become embroiled in dispute with his party. He was \\"rehabilitated\\" and allowed back into the KPD in 1923. One organisation that retained his services throughout this period was the International League of Victims for Victims of War and of Work (IB / Internationalen Bund der Opfer des Krieges und der Arbeit): he had helped to found the Erfurt branch at the start of 1919. In April 1927 he took over from Karl Tiedt the national presidency of the IB, which he would continue to lead till it was banned by a new government early in 1933. In the 1928 Reichstag election Hugo Gräf stood as a Communist Party candidate and was elected to represent the Dresden-Bautzen electoral district. He continued to sit in the Reichstag, winning his seat again in the election of 5 March 1933, but the Nazi government immediately (and under existing legislation still illegally) cancelled the election results in respect of seats won by the Communist candidates. =Arrest, imprisonment and exile= Legislation was passed less than three weeks after the March election which had the effect of establishing one-party government in Germany. Parties other than the Nazi party were banned and Communist Party politicians from the Weimar period were at the top of the new government's hit list. On 13 March 1933 Gräf was arrested in Dresden. He was held till 24 June 1935 in \\"protective custody\\" in concentration camps, starting with an interrogation camp in Dresden and then, from November 1933 at Colditz where his hearing was permanently damaged and 19 of his teeth were knocked out. He was transferred in May 1934 to Sachsenburg, where he headed up the book-binding workshop. Here in February 1935 he had a frosty exchange with a government visitor called Heinrich Himmler, who had recently taken on responsibility within government for the concentration camps. Four months after his release, Hugo Gräf managed to escape to Czechoslovakia in October 1935. Earlier in 1935 he also spent time studying in Moscow. Otherwise he remained in Czechoslovakia till the annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, when he moved on the Great Britain, joining up with other exiled members of the German Communist Party. He continued with his political activities, and also headed up locally the Rote Hilfe humanitarian organisation which had been banned back in Germany in 1933. From the British perspective the Second World War broke out in September 1939: one government response involved identifying large numbers of German political exiles as enemy aliens and arresting them. Between July 1940 and October 1941 Gräf was exiled to the Isle of Man where he was detained until the government had been able to reassess their priorities. He later organised an \\"Emigrants' Club\\" in Glasgow where he took a job as a toolmaker. In Britain he joined an exiles' organisation called the \\"Free German Cultural Association\\" (Freier Deutscher Kulturbund), and later, on 25 September 1943, became a founding member of the British affiliate of the UK based \\"Free Germany movement\\" ( Freie Deutsche Bewegung). =The German Democratic Republic= After the war ended in May 1945 Gräf returned home in August 1946. Home was now in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. During the next few years, under Soviet Military Administration, the region would become the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, formally founded in October 1949, but in reality the creation of the new state was an iterative process. Already in April 1946, the merging of the old Communist Party (KPD) and more moderately left wing SPD into the new SED created the basis for a return to one-party government. Hugo Gräf arrived back as a long- standing member of the Communist Party, now no longer illegal in Germany, and like thousands of others, lost no time in signing over his membership to the new Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). In 1946 he became a spokesman/consultant of the health department of the Central Secretariat with the interim administration, having become a department head by 1948. He was one of the founders of the Health Service of the Trade Union Federation (FDGB / Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund), and on 5 July 1949 he was appointed its first president, serving in this position till 1951. He joined the executive of the FDGB in 1950. In Thuringia he was a senior regional administrator (Landrat), based in Gotha between 1951 and 1953. However, he resigned on health grounds in May 1953 following a clash with the local party leadership over proposals for a redevelopment of the municipal theatre in Gotha which had been rendered unusable by allied bombing some years earlier. He nevertheless returned to political engagement locally, serving as a member of the Party Regional Leadership in Gotha from 1955 till 1958.

Supplementary music for the game's downloadable content The Last of Us: Left Behind was composed by Santaolalla, Andrew Buresh, Anthony Caruso and Jonathan Mayer. Both soundtracks were produced by Santaolalla, Mayer, and Aníbal Kerpel, with separate segments recorded in both Los Angeles and Nashville. Santaolalla, known for his minimalist approach to composing, was excited to work on the soundtrack due to the game's focus on the characters and story. He began composing the music early in the game's development, with few instructions from the development team on the tone that they intended. In collaboration with each other, the team and Santaolalla aimed to make the soundtrack emotional, as opposed to scary. Santaolalla used various instruments to compose the score, including some that were unfamiliar to him. The soundtrack album for The Last of Us was released on iTunes in June 2013. Additional compositions, including some composed for Left Behind, were released on a second soundtrack in February 2014. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected appropriately with the gameplay. In particular, critics felt that the minimalist approach of the soundtrack's composition matched the gameplay. The game's music was nominated for numerous awards. Several tracks became popular and begot cover versions and live performances.  Production and composition  During the initial development of The Last of Us, creative director Neil Druckmann and game director Bruce Straley compiled musical tracks that they found inspirational. When searching for a composer to work on the game's music, they realised that Gustavo Santaolalla composed many of their compiled tracks. Straley described Santaolalla's music as \\"organic instrumentation, minimalist, dissonance and resonance with the sounds\\". The composer agreed to work on the game's soundtrack when contacted by Sony. After hearing the game's pitch, Santaolalla was excited to work on the game; he had previously wanted to compose for video games, but refused to work on those without a focus on story and characters. alt=A 56-year-old man with dark gray hair talking into a microphone, looking at something beneath the camera. Santaolalla began work on The Last of Us early in its development. Druckmann did not give him specific directions but offered him the game's stories and themes. Santaolalla appreciated this freedom and felt it assisted his process. He felt the need to \\"go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic\\", when composing. The composer prefers to compose as he records, as he has little knowledge of reading and writing sheet music. To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments that were new to him, giving \\"an element of danger and innocence\\". For some tracks, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique sounds, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen. The title track was composed on a variety of charango called a ronroco. The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical for video game action music, stating that it is \\"relatively low-key\\", and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it. The game's theme, \\"The Last of Us\\", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed. With the music, the team aimed to \\"get emotion\\", as opposed to \\"horror\\". Inspired by the sparing use of music in the film No Country for Old Men (2007), the team used music judiciously and tried to find other ways to \\"make your palms sweaty\\". The orchestral portions of the score were recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville by the Nashville Scoring Orchestra. Aside from the official soundtracks, licensed tracks also appear in the game. In the main game, during the section titled \\"Alone and Forsaken\\", Joel and Ellie listen to the songs \\"I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive\\" and \\"Alone and Forsaken\\", both by Hank Williams. In the downloadable expansion pack The Last of Us: Left Behind, Ellie and Riley dance to the Etta James cover of the song \\"I Got You Babe\\".

The unique feature of the Can Tho stadium is that the stands use the form of the surrounding landfill to form the pan basin. At the top of the stage, a 6-meter wide walkway provides access. The ground was covered with soil, so trees were planted to form natural shade. The surface of the field is 120m x 90m, utilizing a high- quality grass surface to ensure good performance during heavy rain. The yard has two technical rooms for television stations and other press agencies; running eight lines, modern electronic scoreboards and four lamp posts for matches and evening events.

It ceased to exist around 1654. The Violieren and Olyftack merged in 1660, and survived until 1762. History The Goudbloem had particular links to the urban aristocracy (patricians) and officeholders, while the Violieren was associated with artists and intellectuals (and had ties to the Guild of St Luke) and the Olyftack primarily consisted of merchants and tradesmen. The earliest mention of the society is of a performance in 1490, after which the city magistrates granted the chamber an annual subsidy of £3 Brabant (the same amount received by the Violieren). The chamber competed in the Landjuweel (a rhetoric competition open to contenders from throughout the Duchy of Brabant) in Mechelen in 1515, in Diest in 1521, in Brussels in 1532, in Mechelen in 1535, in Diest in 1541 and in Antwerp (hosted by the Violieren) in 1561. Of the three Antwerp chambers it was the one most closely associated with Protestant sympathies, and it took the longest to recover from the neglect and suppressions that followed the Fall of Antwerp in 1585. The chamber was officially reinstituted in 1616, and took part in the rhetoric competition hosted by the Peoene (Peony) in Mechelen on 3 May 1620, taking first prize for most triumphant decoration, second prize for most triumphant arrival through the streets, and third prize for best recitation.Jan Thieullier, ed., De schadt-kiste der philosophen ende poeten (Mechelen, Henry Jaye, 1621), p.

Opened in 2009 as a bus terminus only, the railway tracks from the old \\"Norte\\" station (distant a few meters from there) were extended to connect both terminals in 2011 by architect Claudio Luis Lucarelli, adding new platforms to receive trains from Buenos Aires. Station facilities include 42 bus garages, 5 railway platforms, 50 shops, 3 restaurants, 51 ticket offices, parking lots and accessible toilets. < Train services are operated by State- owned Trenes Argentinos Operaciones.Buenos Aires - Mar del Plata service on Trenes Argentinos Operaciones History The original Mar del Plata station (\\"Norte\\"), opened in 1886 On 26 September 1886, the first train arrived to the Mar del Plata railway station, built and operated by British-owned BA Great Southern. The city of Mar del Plata was the main tourist destination in Argentina during summer season. By 1910 Mar del Plata remained as the main beach city of Argentina, receiving a huge number of tourists during the summer. Due to the intense traffic of passengers, the railway station exceeded its capacity and the Municipality demanded the company to increase the facilities. The company had always denied to this request alleging that the station was only overcrowded during two months per year (the period of summer season in Argentina). In June 1908, the Congress promulgated Law 5.535, authorizing the BAGSR to build a new station in Mar del Plata. Works began in 1909 and were finished one year later, when the station building began to be constructed. The new station in Mar del Plata (named \\"Mar del Plata Sur\\") was opened on December 1, 1910, although the main building was not still finished, so a provisional wooden-structure was opened to the public for the 1910–11 summer season. Platforms of Norte station, out of service since 2011 As the old station (renamed \\"Mar del Plata Norte\\") remained active, the new station would be only used during the summer seasons. After the entire railway network was nationalised, the Sud station was closed in 1949 to reduce costs. It then become a bus station. In 2009, the bus terminus moved to a new building, very close to active Mar del Plata station in the centre of the city. It was also announced that the old building would be preserved as a cultural centre, alongside a new shopping mall: Paseo Aldrey, named after Florencio Aldrey Iglesias, a multimedia and which was inaugurated November 28, 2015. Two years later, the station became a railway and bus terminal after tracks from the old \\"Norte\\" station (distant a few meters from there) were extended to connect both stations, adding new platforms to receive trains arriving from Constitución in Buenos Aires. During the inauguration, it was announced that the terminus was able to operate 1,200 bus services and 11 trains, with a transit of 2,200,200 passengers per day. The buses section was built at a cost of $19.5 million while the trains section cost $117.4. Likewise, train units made by Spanish company Talgo were also featured in the inauguration. A total of two trains (consisting of 1 diesel locomotive and 9 coaches each) were acquired by the Government of Argentina. The Talgo units had a capacity of 214 passengers, all of them provided with air conditioning and TV. Time estimated for the journey was 5 and a half hours. CSR locomotive in the station, Nov 2014 Nevertheless, in 2012 the Talgo trains were retired from service. The Government alleged that trains maintenance and service costs were too expensive. Ministry of Transport said that the contract with Talgo had been revoked. A total of 6 trains had been purchased although only two of them were running. In 2014, CNR CKD8 trains manufactured by Chinese company CSR were acquired by the National Government to run luxury services to Mar del Plata. The first CSR unit arrived to Mar del Plata station in November 2014. Those trains have a capacity for 565 passengers.

It lies on the Zillertal main ridge which forms the border here between the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian province of South Tyrol. Its great size makes it the dominant mountain in the area. Seen from the northwest it appears like a firn-covered dome; but from the northeast as a regularly shaped cone of rock. Prominent arêtes radiate from the peak to the northwest, east and south. The mountain is easily ascended from the Furtschaglhaus and is often visited as a result. It was first climbed on 16 June 1865 by G. H. Fox, Douglas William Freshfield and Francis Fox Tuckett with mountain guides, François Devouassoud from Chamonix and Peter Michel from Grindelwald, as well as two unknown bearers.Douglas William Freshfield in: The Alpine Journal, Vol. VII, London, 1875, p. 281  Surrounding area  The Großer Möseler is part of the Zillertal main crest, a dominant mountain chain of peaks over 3,000 metres high. Its neighbouring summits are: the subpeak of Möselekopf (3,390 m) to the south and separated by the Westliche Möselescharte notch; the Breitnock (Dosso Largo, 3,215 m) further along the Southwest Arête and separated by Nöfes Saddle a crossing at 3,029 metres; the 3,188-metre-high Furtschaglspitze on the North Arête; and the 3,304-metre-high Roßruggspitze and the Turnerkamp (Cima di Campo, 3,418 m) to the east, separated by the 3,240-metre-high Östliche Möselescharte (\\"Eastern Mösele Notch\\"). The Möseler is surrounded by the glaciated areas of the Schlegeiskees and Furtschaglkees to the west, the Waxeckkees to the north and the West Nevesferner (Westlicher Nevesferner) and East Nevesferner (Östlichen Nevesferner) to the south.  Climbing history  In the first half of the 19th century, it was believed that the Schwarzenstein was the highest mountain in the Zillertal Alps. But when, in 1858, the Austrian alpine researcher and geographer, Anton von Ruthner, stood on the summit of this mountain, he realized that the Möseler, which he called the Schneeberg, to the west had to be significantly higher. On 12 August 1863, von Ruthner attempted an ascent of the Möseler with two guides from Breitlahner in the Zemmgrund, but in thick fog only reached the Nöfes Saddle, which they initially thought was the Möseler. When, later, the fog lifted, they realized their error. However, they were not the first to have used this well-trodden, ancient crossing. Not until the tour by Englishman, Francis Fox Tuckett on 16 June 1865, with his Swiss mountain guides and local bearers, did someone successfully conquer the mountain. That tour began in South Tyrol's Lappach in the Lappach valley (now part of the municipality of Muehlwald) at four clock in the morning and headed north to the East Nevesferner. After crossing the glacier, they reached the South Arête of the Möseler in fog, but only got as far as the southern subpeak, the significantly lower Möselekopf. As the fog lifted, they realized that they had not climbed the main peak; instead the highest point appeared to the northeast as a broad rocky summit. Finally, crossing the icy South Arête they reached the Great Möseler after two and a half more hours at 12.30 pm. As the weather cleared, Tuckett now realized that even the tediously conquered Großer Möseler was not the highest mountain in the Zillertal Alps. To the west, an icy summit towered even higher above them. An angle measurement brought unwelcome confirmation: this ice pinnacle, later called the Hochfeiler, had to be the long-sought after, highest point of the mountain range. The mountaineers descended northwards to Schlegeistal valley and at around 9 pm they finally reached the Alpine hut at Breitlahner.Carl Diener in Eduard Richter (ed.): Die Erschliessung der Ostalpen, III. Band, Verlag des Deutschen und Oesterreichischen Alpenvereins, Berlin, 1894, pp. 18 ff. Historic photograph about 1890  Bases and tours  *The present-day western normal route to the Großer Möseler is a combined ice and rock tour (mountain tour) in four hours from the Furtschaglhaus (2,295 m) over the heavily crevassed Furtschaglkees and the West Arête to the summit (according to the literature the icy summit ridge is often underestimated and problematic). Alpine experience and equipment for glacier crossing are essential. *The southern normal route (in the late summer heat often clear of ice) takes also about four hours from the Chemnitzer Hut (Rifugio Giovanni Porro at 2,419 m) along the Neves Ridgeway (Neveser Höhenweg) and the scree field of Großer Trog to the top. *Another possible ascent is via the Edelraut Hut (Rifugio Passo Ponte di Ghiaccio, 2,545 m) and the Neves Ridgeway.

In 2016 a second self-portrait was found, dating from around 1653. Though Leyster looks very relaxed, the composition is to some extent an artificial confection. She is dressed in what must have been her best clothes, which in reality she is unlikely to have risked near wet oil paint, and the figure she is painting is borrowed from a different work, and was perhaps never actually painted as a single figure. Critics have found a sense of \\"Baroque closeness\\" in this painting. The artist and the viewer are very close in space. Many of the elements in the painting are foreshortened in order to feel closer and like they are coming into the viewer's space. Selfportrait around 1653  Background  = Artist = For women during this time, being a painter was unusual. Judith Leyster, however, was a working artist at the age of eighteen. She became the first successful woman painter in the Netherlands during the height of Dutch art, known as the Dutch Golden Age. She taught students while running her own workshop and selling her works. Leyster specialized in genre scenes, along with portraits and still lives. She would sign her paintings with a star because her last name translated to \\"leading star.\\" Judith Leyster was also the first woman member of the Haarlem painters' guild which was dominated by men. Unfortunately after her death, her artistic reputation became nonexistent and this painting was misattributed to Frans Hals. = Misattribution to Frans Hals = It is unclear whether or not Leyster was a student of Frans Hals, but her style did share characteristics with his. This explains why some of her paintings were misattributed to him. The influence of Caravaggio, playing with dramatic contrasts between light and shadow, is seen in many of her works. The illusion of illumination along with soft, broad brushstrokes were shared by both Leyster and Hals. Both of their works included light, airy brushstrokes and same subject matter. Judith Leyster's work had been forgotten after she had died which led to the misattribution to Frans Hals. Because she did not sign many paintings, art historians would misattribute those to Frans Hals or other male Dutch painters during that time. Her Self-Portrait, was supposed to be executed in the 1620s by Hals and may have been among those sold as \\"Daughter of the artist\\" in early sales catalogs. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, collectors and dealers often forged Frans Hals's signature on her paintings and covered up hers. The painting was sold by the Ehrich Galleries of New York on 9 May 1929 to Mr. and Mrs. Robert Woods Bliss, of Washington, D.C for 250,000 dollars.Gratama, Gerrit David. \\"Het Portret van Judith Leyster door Frans Hals.\\" Oud Holland 47 (1930): 71-75 In 1928 W.R. Valentiner declared it a portrait of Leyster by Hals. In 1930 Gerrit David Gratama asserted that the painting was by Leyster herself, declaring that it was done while she was making a study of her painting, The Merry Trio. = Masterpiece = Judith Leyster entered into the Saint Luke's Guild of Haarlem as an independent master in 1633. This was rare, since women were excluded from joining the guild. Being a part of the guild was extremely important to be successful. It was extremely hard to sell artworks or have a studio where one can teach unless a part of this guild. Leyster even became a master in the guild. It was at the time she was applying to be a master that she created this painting as her \\"masterpiece.\\" In this painting she is showing off her skills. She painted herself in a huge lace collar and silk sleeves which would have been extremely expensive and probably her best clothese. It is unlikely that she ever actually painted wearing these. Like most sitters for portraits, she wanted to be shown at her best. They also allowed her to show off her skill at depicting the different textiles. On the easel there is a laughing fiddler in progress, a typical example of the sort of genre painting subject she mostly painted.  Description  Judith Leyster Merry Trio = Subject Matter = Continuing in the tradition of sixteenth-century artists who pushed to have painting seen as a profession as opposed to a craft, Leyster chose to depict herself wearing lace cuffs, rich fabric and a huge collar, which would not have been suitable for painting, but instead draw attention to her wealth and success. She also portrayed raw paint on her palette. This demonstrates her skill as an artist because she carefully placed painted raw paint on her palette. In doing this, she both distinguished herself from less skilled artisans and showcased her technical abilities. While it is unclear whether Leyster studied under Hals, the loose brush strokes and casual pose echo his stylistic choices. Although this is a self portrait of the artist, it is a unique approach to a self portrait. Leyster painted herself but not just herself. Judith Leyster painted herself doing what she is good at. She shows herself working on a figure who appears in another surviving painting of hers, The Merry Trio. Similar to other paintings of hers Leyster's self-portrait has a momentary quality to it—she is turned partially to the viewer with her lips parted as if to speak. It has been said that her lips parted as if she was speaking is in reference to poetry and how the arts had a connection to that. Leyster also paints herself with her arm propped up resting on the chair that mimics the casual and free confidence she had in her skill. She also is looking towards the viewer, as if to invite them into her studio. This, along with the fistful of brushes and inclusion of the fiddler from her later painting The Merry Trio, suggest that this piece was calculated to advertise her abilities. This is also another way of the artist letting the viewers know that she was capable of creating a portrait as well as creating genre scenes. = Composition = According to Hofrichter, x-ray analysis shows that the figure on the easel was initially a portrait of a young girl, and that it would be in keeping with the tradition of other masterpieces of Leyster's day to show off her artist's expertise by changing this to show that she was also capable of painting figures in theatrical poses as well as portraiture. Instead of it being a self portrait of herself creating a self portrait, the artist chose to take another opportunity to display her skill and her success as a painter, incorporating a popular painting of hers.

The beaterio was founded by Dionisia de Santa Maria Mitas Talangpaz and Cecilia Rosa de Jesús Talangpaz, two Filipino sisters, both in blood and spirit, who hailed from barrio San Miguel of Calumpit, Bulacan. The convent's name was later changed to Beaterio de San Sebastian de Calumpang, but presently, it is now popularly known as the Congregation of the Agustinian Recollect Sisters. It is one of the three continuing congregation founded for native women in Asia after the Amantes de la Croix, was founded in Vietnam in 1670, and the Beaterio de la Compania de Jesus, now the Congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary, was founded in Manila in 1684. The original site of the beaterio was located inside Saint Rita College - Manila, one of the first three houses of the Agustinian Recollect Sisters, before it got damaged. History of the Convent The two Talangpaz sisters, who belonged to a religious lineage, decided to leave their comfortable life in pursuit of their spiritual calling even after their request for permission to wear the habit of mantelata were repeatedly turned down. When they heard that the Recollects admitted Filipino women into the Third Order, they proceeded to the Shrine of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel in the Church of San Sebastian in Manila and rented a nipa hut in Bilibid Viejo behind the church apse in which two other native beatas soon joined them. By the help of Fray Juan de Santo Tomas de Aquino, OAR, they revealed to the priests their desire to don the habit of mantelata. After their credentials were carefully checked and their petition for the habit was approved, they were incorporated as tertiaries of the Order. They received the habit on the 16th day of July 1725. The nipa hut they rented together with the other beatas was the start of the formation of the congregation. An unexpected crisis happened in the beaterio when it drew the attention of more aspirants than it could manage. To resolve the crisis, Fray Diego de San Jose, OAR, the prior of San Sebastian, impulsively demanded back the habits he had bestowed on the Talangpaz sisters and ordered them to vacate the house in the convent garden and immediately demolished the house. The sisters later sought out the prior himself to assure him with these words: \\"Fray Diego, please bear with us. Now you spurn us and send us away, but you can be certain that later, you will be pleased to receive us back and grant us the holy habit again, and not only the two of us but others as well whom Our Lady of Carmel will call to give us company. We have great hopes that she will grant us this favor to our deep joy and that of the Recollect fathers, too. But for now, we have to be patient and suffer till Our Lord and his Most Holy Mother will have mercy on us.\\" Haunted by the words of these women of faith, the Prior requested the Provincial of the Order that they be granted with the habit of mantelatas and that the community of beatas, henceforth, be assisted by the Recollects in accordance with the Sacred Constitutions of the Order. Consequently, the rites of the re-investiture of the Talangpas Sisters were held in the year 1728, probably on the feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel. They re-adopted the respective names they took in 1725, namely – Sor Dionisia de Santa Maria and Sor Cecilia Rosa de Jesus. =Construction of the Convent= Spanish steel grill gate, the oldest remnant of the old Beaterio. In 1731, the Beaterio achieved its formal foundation. Fray Andres de San Fulgencio undertook the construction of a more permanent building to house the Recollect Tertiaries, the first religious women. Fray Benito de San Pablo, Superior of San Sebastian at that time, solicited donations from benefactors such as Brother General, Sergeant Major D. Jose Beltran de Salazar and Don Jose Barreto. The construction continued until 1747. The Convent had a long, spacious living room divided into cells. At the end was a kitchenette and bathroom made of concrete materials. The sisters lived in this building until 1907. To respond to the growing needs of the Church, the Beaterio expanded and established their first three houses: Saint Rita College - Manila, Colegio de Santa Monica – Cavite City and Colegio de San Jose – Cuyo, Palawan. Renovations The first house where the first sisters or beatas resided were made of cane and nipa. The second house, which was bigger than the first, became roofless after the 1880 Luzon earthquakes. The third house was made of strong foundation, now part of Saint Rita College - Manila and is still standing today. A Chapel was built on June 1, 1907.

Verkruijsse (eds.), De Nederlandse en Vlaamse auteurs van middeleeuwen tot heden met inbegrip van de Friese auteurs (Weesp, 1985), p. 422. He registered with the schoolmasters' guild in 1644, becoming dean of the guild during the 1650s. He wrote comedic moralities for performance by the chambers of rhetoric (civic poetry and drama societies) the Violieren and the Olijftak. First performances were often on the Feast of St Luke (18 October), as the rhetoricians had a close association with the Guild of Saint Luke (the guild of painters, illuminators, printmakers and booksellers). When the Olyftack and Violieren merged in 1660 Ogier took a leading role as \\"Factor\\" of the reinstituted chamber. He died in Antwerp on 22 February 1689.

He rode most frequently in professional races in England, but was considered an amateur rider in his native France. He was the French national sprint champion in 1881 and 1882, and the national stayer champion in 1886 and 1887. In 1883, he won the 50-mile Championships in Leicester, which were reported in some newspapers as deciding the champion of the world. Life and career Frédéric de Civry was born in Paris on 21 August 1861. He received his education in England, and spent much of his cycling career in that country. He was generally considered to be an amateur cyclist in France, and frequently competed in that category, but Hugh Dauncey, in French Cycling: A Social and Cultural History, suggested that he was financially dependent upon the sport, and was considered a professional by the English press. He competed in the 1881 Grand Prix of Angers, finishing as the overall champion, and the sprint champion. In the same year, he became the French National Sprint Champion and was second overall at the Blois road race. In late 1881, he competed twice against the English champion, John Keen. In the first race at The Crystal Palace, de Civry was given a one-minute head start, and won when Keen retired halfway through. The second was a scratch 20-mile race at the same venue. Keen again retired, after 11 miles, and De Civry completed the race in 1 hour 4:21, beating the professional record by just over five seconds. De Civry repeated his successes in Angers and at the French national championships in 1882, and later that year, he competed in a 25-mile race in Leicester, dubbed the \\"championship of the world\\" in the English press. Twenty miles into the race, de Civry tried to break away from the other riders and establish a lead, but failed, and retired with three laps of the race to go; R Howell of Wolverhampton won the race. The following year on 24 March 1883, de Civry competed in a 50-mile race, once again in Leicester, variously entitled the \\"Championship of England\\", or the \\"Fifty Miles Professional Bicycle Championship of the world\\". Ten miles into the race, de Civry opened a lead of half a lap, and continued to increase it throughout the race. He won, completing the distance in 3 hours, 13:40, over three minutes ahead of the next competitor. The following Monday, he took part in the 10-mile race, but retired shortly before reaching half distance. The 50-mile championship was held again in August of the same year, in which de Civry lost his title to F. Wood of Leicester. In April the following year, de Civry competed for the 50-mile championship once again, but was involved in a collision with Wood, which took them both out of the race. He also took part in the one and ten mile championships, but did not win either. During 1885, de Civry won the Grand Prix of Angers once again, and finished second in the French national sprint championships. He competed without success in the championships in England. In each of 1886 and 1887, he was the French National Stayer Champion. Two years later, he was arrested in France in relation to gambling debts incurred in Monaco and Paris. He died on 15 March 1893 from tuberculosis, aged 32. During his cycling career, he won 211 of his 331 races.

It was serialized by Media Factory in its Monthly Comic Alive magazine between November 2009 and June 2017. The series was compiled into thirteen volumes between 2010 and 2017. The series is published in French by Bamboo Édition's Doki-Doki imprint. An anime adaptation was greenlit and aired from July 2016 to September 2016. The manga has been licensed for release in English by Yen Press. Plot After saving a homeless man from some thugs, Seigi receives a strange tattoo from the man as a gift. This act leads to a series of events that will pull Seigi into the middle of a conflict between a special U.S. Army unit and the Kingdom of Selinistan, as both are scrambling to collect powerful \\"spell crests\\" called Power Crests, weaponized ancient artifacts of great power which can shift the balance of power in the world. Characters =U.S. forces and allies= ; : :Seigi has a strong sense of justice and ends up receiving a mysterious, cursed brand on the palm of his hand after rescuing a homeless man. Seigi has trained in the Akatsuka-style of jujitsu since childhood under the supervision of his enthusiastic grandfather. His Power Crest is called Void Maker, that allows him to create black holes and regenerate from injuries, and it doesn't require a trigger like the other tattoos. Due to his parents having \\"weird ideas\\" when he was born, his given name is written in kanji but pronounced as the English word. Seigi preferentially goes by his nickname, the traditional Japanese pronunciation of his given name. ; : :Bluesy, aka \\"Izzy\\", is a mysterious girl who appears before Seigi. Izzy has overwhelming physical power thanks to her Power Crest, which gives control over air. She's a U.S. Army lieutenant in charge of recovering the tattoos in Japan. Despite appearing to be of high school age, Izzy is older than Tom, a side effect of her Power Crest stopping her aging. She later loses her left arm during a battle with Cal. ; : :Touko is Seigi's classmate and childhood friend who clearly loves him. She's rather well- developed for her age. After being possessed by Iltutmish, she accidentally gets a Power Crest in her forehead which, like all Power Crests, increases her physical abilities when activated. She is later killed and devoured by a monstrous Iltutmish causing Seigi to fall into despair. ; : :An otaku who loves moe characters, and who works with Izzy as his subordinate. He has a copy Power Crest that allows him to negate the powers of other users. Because of his lacking fighting prowess, he's injured on every confrontation. ; : :The commander of the Curse Unit of the U.S. Army, and good friends with Izzy. Nicknamed \\"Foxfire\\", her Power Crest allows her to create explosions using the components in the air, she often teases Izzy about her small bust. ; : :A U.S. Army Brigadier General who prefers to be called colonel, he is a patriot who is a leading member of the tattoo program. He loses his right arm, both legs and his vision in the fight against Cal, but refuses to let his new disabilities hold him back. ; : :A soldier from the Japan Self-Defense Forces and one of the few Japanese Power Crest users, who offers help to Seigi, Izzy and Tom. He's also an otaku and befriends Tom because of that. He even proposes to his also Otaku girlfriend, despite knowing that could rise up a death flag. Nicknamed 'Bull Demon', his power crest allows him to warp dimensions close to his body and accelerate at enormous speed, ignoring the damage to his body. =Independents= ; : :A highly skilled combatant whose motives are unclear. He's an old acquaintance of Izzy and a defector from both U.S. and the Kingdom. He also possesses a Void Maker Power Crest, but the power is slowly killing him. He becomes a mentor of sorts towards Seigi but later sacrifices himself to save Seigi and Izzy, with his soul and memories transferred to Seigi. ; : :A renegade American scientist who absconded with a special tattoo which he gave to Seigi. He also assists Brad Blackstone to access and modify the source code of his tattoo. =Kingdom of Selinistan= ; : :The princess of the Kingdom of Selinistan. A nationalist who desires world domination, she seized power in a coup d'état which killed both of her peace- minded parents. She admits to Seigi that she wishes to change the world to suit her own ends regardless of what others may think or feel. She strikes a beautiful figure, and comports herself with dignity, but her love of games is unequaled. Her Power Crest doesn't require a trigger and is linked to the source of all Power Crests, which means she can use any of its powers at will. Created as a tool to control the Power Crests, once she found out about the abuse and cruel experiments perpetrated by the king, her resentment towards humanity drove her to want to rewrite the world. ; : :A girl member of Brahman, who has pledged her allegiance to Arya. Nicknamed \\"Schrödinger's Cat\\", her Power Crest allows her to be anywhere as long as someone acknowledges her presence. She and Lurker have a pet capybara named Mickey and also adopts a stray cat. With Arya's power, she can turn into a giant saber- toothed tiger-like creature. ; : :A loyal servant to her sovereign, and a close aide to the princess Arya. She's the Vice-Commander of the Brahman. Nicknamed Aegis Armadillo, her Power Crest allows her to create powerful barriers that can cut nearly anything and she's also a deadly swordswoman. Despite her serious demeanor, she's easily frustrated by Arya's antics. She also admits to being in love with Brad but he turns her down in favor of Izzy. ; : :A man who works under Arya. A member of Brahman, and a sadistic whip- wielder, who develops an obsession with Izzy because of his lolita complex. ; : :One of Arya's \\"clone\\" sisters who doesn't hate humanity like her. She explained BB the origins of Arya and why she wants to remake the world. Media =Manga= =Anime= An anime adaptation produced by J.C.Staff was announced. It was initially slated to premiere in 2015, but it broadcast between July 4, 2016 and September 19, 2016. The anime was released across six Blu-ray volumes.

It was previously operated on the darknet as a Tor hidden service, by a person known on the internet as nachash. Since its takedown in 2014, nachash has stepped down and relinquished his ownership to a predecessor that used the username, king oren, when interviewed. He told in an interview that he is hosting the Doxbin on public access, referring to World Wide Web, as well as on darknet and Tor hidden service websites, although he would not release the link to either of them, saying, \\"The people that use the service, know how to find it, that's what keeps it secure and out of the reach of incompetent people using it for malice things\\". Due to the illegal nature of much of the information it published, -such as social security numbers, bank routing information, credit card information, all in plain-text- it was one of many sites seized during Operation Onymous, a multinational police initiative, in November 2014. The website was restored under different ownership in the same month.  History  Doxbin was established to act as a secure, anonymous venue for the publication of dox first established by people by the usernames of nachash, king oren, CGOD, and Phocus. Dox being a term in Internet culture which refers to personally identifiable information about individuals, including social security numbers, street addresses, usernames, emails, and passwords, obtained through a variety of legal and illegal means. In November 2012, Doxbin's Twitter handle @Doxbin was attributed to an attack on Symantec, coordinated with Anonymous's Operation Vendetta. It first attracted attention in March 2014 when its then-owner hijacked a popular Tor hidden service, The Hidden Wiki, pointing its visitors to Doxbin instead as a response to the maintenance of pages dedicated to child pornography links. In June 2014, their Twitter account was suspended, prompting the site to start listing the personal information of the Twitter founders and CEO. In October 2014, Doxbin hosted personal information about Katherine Forrest, a federal judge responsible for court rulings against the owner of Tor-based black market Silk Road, leading to death threats and harassment. Doxbin and several other hidden services were seized in November 2014 as part of the multinational police initiative Operation Onymous. Shortly thereafter, one of the site's operators who avoided arrest shared the site's logs and information about how it was compromised with the Tor developers email list, suggesting it could have either been the result of a specialized distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) or exploited mistakes in its PHP code. The site was then transferred to new owners who reclaimed it from authorities and restored it just a week after it went down. Following this raid, the site is no longer run by nachash, but it has been reopened by a predecessor known as king oren who is currently hosting the Doxbin on public access internet, along with deep web links that he would not release during an interview. Following nachash's raid, he has since then gone on to write a darknet market vendor guide entitled \\"So, You Want To Be a Darknet Drug Lord…\\". Media Coverage Doxbin was mentioned by South China Morning Post because police officer names were shared on the website.

Belgrade, 1808), known as Petar Čardaklija (Петар Чардаклија), was a diplomat in the First Serbian Uprising.  Early life  Novaković was born somewhere on the present-day border of Macedonia and Albania, possibly in the village of Leunovo, close to Gostivar.Документи за борбата на македонскиот народ за самостојност и за национална држава, том два, Униврзитет Кирил и Методиј - Факултет за философско - историски науки, Скопје, 1981 His early life is shrouded in mystery. In all probability he ran away from his native village northwards into Serbia (the Sanjak of Smederevo) and started working as an innkeeper in Belgrade. During the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91), he joined the Serbian Free Corps, volunteer units made out of local Serbs, where he rose to the rank of captain. After the Austrian retreat he went to Vienna and then to Buda where he managed to establish close connections in aristocratic circles. His wife was an acquaintance or serving Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna, sister of the Russian emperor Alexander I; princess Alexandra was married to Archduke Joseph, Habsburg governor of Hungary, and lived in Buda. It was in this period that Čardaklija got the title of Rittermeister.N. Bogunović, Sva nada u ruskog cara, Večernje novosti, 2. 7. 2013. http://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:441991-Sva- nada-u-ruskog-cara  In the First Serbian Uprising  Čardaklija was keeping in touch with notable Serbs from Hungary hoping for the overthrow of Ottoman power in Serbia. When he learned about Karadjordje’s uprising he sent his wife off to Kharkov and then, in July 1804, he crossed into Serbia and put himself at the service of Karadjordje. As the Serbian insurrectionists decided to seek international support for their cause they first turned to Vienna but were refused. Čardaklija advised them to petition the Russian tzar since he would be more inclined on supporting them. Čardaklija persuaded Karadjordje that the best way to do this would be to send a delegation to St Petersburg. Karadjordje agreed and on September 1 a Serbian delegation made out of Mateja Nenadović, Jovan Protić and Čardaklija started its journey. In Saint Petersburg they met with Russian foreign minister Prince Czartoryski, who listened to them and handed their petition to the Tsar. Prince also advised them to form a Serbian government and promised that Russia would help Serbian cause influencing the Sultan. The delegation returned to Serbia in mid- December 1804. Čardaklija next took part in the national assembly in Pećani. In April 1805 he was again in a diplomatic delegation (together with Aleksa Lazarević, Jovan Protić and Stevan Živković) that was sent to Constantinople. However, once there the deputies were ill-treated and had to escape to the Russian consulate and then flee from the city fearing for their lives. Čardaklija and Lazarević embarked on a Russian ship and escaped to Odessa. From there they journeyed to Saint Petersburg and then back to Belgrade. When in 1807 Russia decided to militarily help the Serbs, Čardaklija (together with Avram Lukić and Jeremeija Gagić) was sent to the HQ of the Russian expeditionary force which was stationed in Wallachia. There they asked for a man that would return with them to Belgrade to act as a Russian plenipotentiary in Serbia; their wish was granted. Čardaklija resided in Belgrade until his death in 1808. He was buried in Belgrade's Orthodox cathedral church. Speech at his funeral was held by his friend, the famous writer Dositej Obradović, at the time minister of education in Serbia.Dr H. Polenaković, \\"Dositej Obradović kod Makedonaca\\" in Dositej Obradović (ed. M. Leskovac), Belgrade 1962 Obradović also wrote the epitaph on his tombstone in which he glorifies Čardaklija as an \\"immortal Serb\\".  Family  Čardaklija had a brother, Jovan, who also crossed to insurrectionist Serbia and worked as a government clerk until the Ottoman return in 1813. Jovan then fled to Russia with other notable Serbs. That is also where he died. See also * List of Serbian Revolutionaries  References  Sources  External links * Konstantin N.

Establishment and operations, February–March  The Epirus Army Section was established on 14 February 1941, with the I Army Corps and II Army Corps fighting on the western and central sections of the Albanian front. Until that point, the two corps had been under the direct control of the General Field Headquarters at Ioannina, led by the Greek commander-in-chief Lt. General Alexandros Papagos. However, the increasing possibility of a German attack through Bulgaria necessitated the relocation of GHQ back to Athens and the establishment of a new higher command. The first commander of the Epirus Army Section was Lt. General Markos Drakos, who until then had commanded the Eastern Macedonia Army Section. After vehement disagreements with GHQ on the future course of operations, on 6 March Drakos was retired along with his two corps commanders, Lt. Generals Panagiotis Demestichas (I Corps) and Dimitrios Papadopoulos (II Corps). Markos was replaced by the commander of the Western Macedonia Army Section, Lt. General Ioannis Pitsikas. I Corps went to V Corps commander Lt. General Panagiotis Demestichas and II Corps to 3rd Infantry Division commander Major General Georgios Bakos. From II Corps faced successive attacks in the Italian Spring Offensive in the Klisura sector, which were repulsed. At the end of March, the Epirus Army Section comprised I Corps, with the 2nd Infantry Division, 3rd Infantry Division and 8th Infantry Division (three Evzone and eight standard infantry regiments) plus a cavalry regiment, and II Corps with the 1st Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division, 5th Infantry Division, 6th Infantry Division, 11th Infantry Division, 15th Infantry Division and 17th Infantry Division (21 infantry regiments).  German invasion and collapse  Following the start of the German invasion of Greece on 6 April and the rapid progress of the German troops with the capture of Thessaloniki three days later, on 12 April GHQ in Athens gave the order of retreat to the Greek forces on the Albanian front. The decision came too late. The Greek commanders were aware that, given the continued Italian pressure, the lack of Greek motor transport and pack animals, the physical exhaustion of the Greek army and the poor transport network of Epirus, any retreat was likely to end up in disintegration. They had pressed in vain for a retreat already before the start of the German attack but now they petitioned Pitsikas to surrender. Although Pitsikas forbade such talk, he notified Papagos of these developments and urged a solution that would secure \\"the salvation and honour of our victorious Army\\". Indeed, the orders to retreat, coupled with the disheartening news of the Yugoslav collapse and of the rapid German advance, led to a breakdown of the morale of the Greek troops, many of whom had been fighting without reprieve for five months and were now forced to abandon hard- won ground. By 15 April, the divisions of II Army Corps, beginning with the Cretan 5th Division, began to disintegrate, with men and even entire units abandoning their positions. On 16 April, Pitsikas reported to Papagos that signs of disintegration had also begun to appear among the divisions of I Corps and begged him to \\"save the army from the Italians\\", i.e. to be allowed to capitulate to the Germans, before the military situation collapsed completely. On the next day, the Western Macedonia Army Section (Lt. General Georgios Tsolakoglou) was renamed to III Army Corps and placed under Pitsikas' command. The three corps commanders, along with the metropolitan bishop of Ioannina, Spyridon, pressured Pitsikas to unilaterally begin negotiations with the Germans. When he refused, the others decided to bypass him and selected Tsolakoglou, as the senior of the three generals, to carry out the task. Tsolakoglou delayed for a few days, sending his chief of staff to Athens to secure permission from Papagos. The chief of staff reported the chaos in Athens and urged his commander to take the initiative in a message that implied permission by Papagos, although this was not in fact the case. On 20 April, Tsolakoglou contacted Sepp Dietrich, the commander of the nearest German unit, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) brigade, to offer surrender. The protocol of surrender was signed at 18:00 of the same day between Tsolakoglou and Dietrich. Presented with the fait accompli, Pitsikas was informed an hour later and resigned his command.

The game is now out of print, and the US trademark on the game was cancelled in 1983.US Trademark Serial Number 73090597 Game :Source: Gambler official rules The game consists of players taking turns rolling dice to move around the game board. Each player starts with $100 of in-game money. The object of the game is to be the first player to win $1,000 of in-game money. Events giving players a chance to win money can happen when a player lands on a space, draws cards, or rolls doubles. A roll of doubles give the option for the roller to call a Sweepstakes or the roller may attempt a second roll of doubles. The Sweepstakes uses a special \\"Dice Shaker\\", a device containing six dice with an area to shuffle the dice and a narrow handle that holds each of the dice in a line. All players make some type of bet and then a player shakes the Dice Shaker and moves the dice into the handle. The order of the dice in the handle determines which (if any) player wins the sweepstakes. It is possible that multiple players could cross $1000 simultaneously, particularly in a sweepstakes. If this happens, the winner is whoever has the most money. A player may borrow money from the bank if he runs out of money. He or she receives an IOU. The IOU may be paid off during the game. A player with an IOU cannot win the game. If a player runs out of money while in possession of an IOU, he or she is eliminated. =1975 edition= *There is a jackpot, which starts at $100 at the start of the game. The jackpot can grow and shrink as the game progresses. One square called \\"slot spot\\" wins the jackpot.

Bank cards may be lottery tickets, \\"wild ivories\\" (extra dice that a player can add in a sweepstakes), a series of \\"good news or bad news\\" cards, and a series of \\"lucky you\\" cards. *There are \\"raffle tickets\\", which can be purchased if the player lands on a \\"buy raffle ticket\\" square. The cost is a multiple of a die roll and cashed when the holder reaches a \\"charity bazaar\\" square. *There is a \\"kitty\\" which receives proceeds from raffle ticket sales. There is also a \\"lucky boxcars\\" square where everyone adds $20 to the kitty. The Kitty is won when a player rolls a 12. If the Kitty has no money when a 12 is rolled, the player wins no money. The Kitty can also be won on a \\"lucky you\\" Bank card. *An IOU is taken out with $100. An IOU is paid off when the holder gets his or her next win.

He served as an apprentice in the Naval Dockyard and gained a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Science. After graduating he was recommended to Dr Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti by Professor John Perry, which resulted in Hall joining Ferranti in 1902. Alber Hall (engineer) Early years Dr Ferranti was convinced that the future prime mover for electricity generation would be through a turbine engine employing very high temperatures. Hall's experience in thermodynamics was crucial to the development and patenting of materials able to withstand these high temperatures and stresses. Their collaboration eventually resulted in them producing nickel-protected soft steel turbine blades and machinery for their manufacture.Intellectual Property Office British Patent GB190401409 Dr Ferranti had already been working for some years with J & P Coats of Paisley on cotton spinning improvements and it was here that Hall developed a small air-lubricated turbine to replace individual spindle motors, increasing the spindle speed from 6000 rpm to more than 20,000 rpm. According to J F WilsonFerranti and the British Electrical Industry J F Wilson (P 88) Coats financed this and also agreed to co-finance the turbine development with Vickers of Sheffield, with Hall supervising the main projectsLife and Letters of Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti. G Z de Ferranti and Ince (P179) (Williams & Norgate 1934) while commuting between Paisley and Sheffield. World War I In 1915 Hall was requisitioned by Lord Chetwynd to enter the service of the Ministry of Munitions to act as his assistant. Hall was to help design and build the Largest Shell Factory in England for the manufacture of Amatol and the filling of shells and bombs. During his time as chief engineer there, he lived on site in Orchard Cottage and survived a massive explosion, the cause of which was never determined. Hall's work in Chilwell was acknowledged in 2012 when a commemorative plaque was placed on the re-built property.\\"Beeston and District Civic Society\\" Return to Ferranti In 1919 after the war, he returned to Ferranti and also remained in a consulting capacity to Lord Chetwynd and as a technical adviser to the British Mannesmann Tube company. Around 1922 Dr Ferranti became interested in the science of Radio and sound reproduction; it followed that Hall had to become interested too. His knowledge of operational calculus was well suited to dealing with the mathematical equations encountered in that field and allowed him to make the transition into Radio. At that time manufacturers paid royalties for each valve-holder that they fitted to a radio receiver, so they looked for ways to circumnavigate these royalties wherever they could. With this in mind, it also made sense to manufacture radio components for sale to other radio manufacturers and Hall soon became busy with this too. He was instrumental in designing and producing the AF family inter-valve audio frequency transformersFerranti Packard: Pioneers in Canadian Electrical Manufacturing Norman R Ball, John N Vardalas (P97) for use in radio receivers.Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1926 GB248429 He also worked on valve (vacuum tube) development, producing several patents relating to Radio and component manufacture.Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1927 GB273484Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1928 GB295414Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1930 GB329689Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1930 GB331541Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1936 GB443956Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1931 CA309505Intellectual Property Office British Patent 1940 GB526621 In order to augment the sales of components to the amateur home constructor, Hall wrote a bookThe True Road to Radio Publisher: Ferranti : Hollinwood Eng. : Ferranti; Third Edition (reprint) edition (1932) ASIN: B001OWU6CA that covered mathematical formula, radio-frequency amplification, loud speakers, power supplies and included many practical suggestions. At the annual Olympia Exhibition in 1929, Ferranti unveiled their first radio developed by Hall marketed as The Standard Model 21 In 1931 Hall was responsible for employing Kenyon Taylor, who went on to become one of Ferranti's prolific inventors. Death During World War II, Ferranti were involved in various aspects of radar development and on 11 February 1941, while travelling to an AA gunnery radar site, Hall and his assistant Gilbert Newbigging were killed when the car they were travelling in collided with an army convoy in thick fog.

Built in 1932 when Bar Harbor's summer scene was at its height, it is one of only two Art Deco theaters in the state of Maine. The theatre has in recent years struggled for financial solvency but was purchased in 2014 by a nonprofit organization. After a major renovation, the theater reopened for business in May 2015. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Architecture The theater building occupies of frontage on Cottage Street, which houses the theater's entrance and two storefronts, and directly abuts the adjacent buildings. Its marquee is a typical Art Deco, projecting over the sidewalk in front of the recessed entry. The flanking storefronts originally also had Art Deco style elements, but these have been lost. The building is deep, with its front section one story in height, while the rear, housing the auditorium, is two stories. The lobby area of the theater opens to the full width of the building behind the stores. The capacity of the theater is 877 seats in the main floor and balcony. The Art Deco decoration of the interior was executed by D.H. Pickering of Boston, Massachusetts. Backstage spaces include six dressing rooms and equipment for mounting theatrical productions. History The Criterion was built in 1932, at a time when Bar Harbor was at its height as a summer resort area catering to the very wealthy. It opened on June 6, 1932, featuring vaudeville performances and movies. During the height of prohibition, the basement of the Criterion was operated as a speakeasy, serving Canadian alcohol smuggled into the United States. Over the years the theater's fare was reduced to showing films during the summer. A succession of owners broadened its offerings to include live performances, but none were financially successful, and the building has since 2000 suffered from a lack of maintenance and problems with mold.

The same source also claimed that the Army repelled a rebel attack on Al-Atash village. Two days later, the Army launched a counter- offensive on Brigade 82, claiming that it recaptured the Oxygen Plant and Niqta Al-Masarat and advanced to the base's northern entrance in its outskirts.

He was born at Clevedon, Somerset and died at Longniddry, East Lothian, Scotland. Educated at Uppingham School, Jupp played most of his cricket in Scotland where he was a civil servant in the Office of Works.

The museum is an Anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage. Context Knappenrode is a monument to brown coal. Around 1914 the natural landscape of heathland and coniferous forest was replaced by this vast open cast brown coal mining operation and briquetting plants. The workers dwelt in a specially-erected housing outside the factory gates. This was a true factory village- the company owned the houses, the store, a guest house, a community centre and a railway station. It provided the village with a company owned cemetery. The workers and families used the factory bath-house so the houses needed no bathroom. When retired, they came back and used the bathhouse on Saturday nights- and this remained a social event. History A briquetting plant was built in 1914. It was called \\"Eintracht Werke\\".It was managed by Joseph Werminghoff. Production began in October 1918, and two other plants were then built. After 1945 the plant was renamed \\"Glückauf\\", some equipment removed and production continued. In 1965 the plant turned out more than one and a half million tons of briquettes. Modernisation was neglected and the plant stagnated and closed in 1993, leaving a legacy of historic machines that form the nucleus of a museum collection.

A permit for to conduct engineering surveys for the Turkish offshore section was granted in July 2015. Also in July 2015, a memorandum of understanding between Greece and Russia was signed for the construction and operation of the TurkStream section in the Greek territory. In November 2015, after the Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown, the project was unilaterally suspended by Russia. In late July 2016, following a reconciliation meeting in Moscow, both sides brought the project back to the table. On 10 October 2016, Russia and Turkey officially signed the intergovernmental agreement in Istanbul to execute the project. A contract with an offshore contractor Allseas for laying the first line was signed on 8 December 2016 and the contract for the second line was signed on 20 February 2017. Laying of the first line in the Russian offshore section started on 7 May 2017. The ceremony of completing construction of the offshore section was held in Istanbul on 19 November 2018. The offshore section of the pipeline was filled with gas in November 2019. Gazprom began shipping gas via TurkStream, including to Bulgaria and North Macedonia, on 1 January 2020, replacing supplies via the Trans-Balkan pipeline through Ukraine and Romania. The pipeline was inaugurated on 8 January 2020 by presidents Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Technical features The pipeline is estimated to cost €11.4 billion. The pipeline has two lines with a total capacity of of natural gas. The first line supplies Turkey and the second line transport natural gas further to South East and Central Europe. Both lines are using pipes with an outer diameter of , manufactured by Europipe GmbH of Germany, Vyksa Steel Works of OMK and Izhora Pipe Mill of Severstal of Russia, and a consortium of Marubeni, Itochu and Sumitomo of Japan. Pipes have a wall thickness of and a concrete coating of . The internal pressure of the pipeline is . The pipeline is installed in water depths up to . Route TurkStream begins at the Russkaya compressor station near Anapa. It runs approximately offshore, of which approximately is located in the Russian maritime zones and approximately is located in the Turkish waters. The landing point in Turkey is Kıyıköy, a village in the district of Vize in Kırklareli Province at northwestern Turkey. From there, the section of the first line continues to the distribution center in Lüleburgaz. The section will connect the Lüleburgaz distribution center with Ipsala on the Turkey–Greece border. Alternatively, the second line will continue from Kıyıköy to Malkoçlar on the Turkey–Bulgaria border, where it will be connected to the existing Trans-Balkan pipeline system. The further extension of the pipeline in South-East and Central European countries are responsibilities of involved countries. For the gas transport both—existing infrastructure and construction of new pipelines—will be used. For Gazprom the preferable option is to export gas from the second line to Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria. The route in Bulgaria starts on the Bulgaria–Turkey borders and runs by a reverse mode to the compressor station in Provadia, north-east of Bulgaria. From there, a new pipeline will run to the Bulgaria–Serbia border. New compressor stations will be built in Provadia and Rasovo. The Serbian part of the gas transport route begins near Zajecar on the Bulgaria–Serbia border and cross the Serbia–Hungary border near Horgoš. A connecting branch from Belgrade to the Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Herzegovina is planned. The Hungarian section will be only long. The other planned follow-on projects included also the Tesla pipeline, to run from Greece to North Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, ending at the Baumgarten gas hub in Austria. Contractors The project was implemented by South Stream Transport B.V., a subsidiary of Gazprom, which was originally established for the South Stream project. In the near-shore areas the offshore pipeline was laid by the pipe-laying vessel Audacia. For the deep part of the Black Sea, the pipe-laying vessel Pioneering Spirit was used. The contractor for the Turkish section was Petrofac and the subcontractor for the construction of the receiving terminal in Turkey was Tekfen. Contractor for the onshore section to the Turkey–Bulgaria border was TurkAkim Gaz Tasima A. S. will carry out construction of the land section, a joint venture of Gazprom and BOTAŞ. Impact TurksStream changes the regional gas flows in South-East Europe by diverting the transit through Ukraine and the Trans Balkan Pipeline system.

Built c. 1880 by Jabez Hathaway, this large barn was an optimistic expression of the future prospects of the dairy industry in the area, which were ultimately not borne out. The barn is part of a farmstead complex whose other elements have not maintained historical integrity; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The Hathaway Barn is a bank barn, set on the west side of Nortons Corner Road, as part of a farmstead located just north of Hathaway Brook. The main house, a typical rural New England connected farmhouse, was built c. 1857 by Jabez Hathaway, who established a farm. The farmhouse, along with its ell and small barn, has been significantly modified, including conversion into two apartments, and no longer has historical integrity. The large barn is estimated, based on construction techniques and materials, to date to about 1880, and was apparently built by Hathaway in anticipation of increased demand for dairy products, occasioned by a boom demand for cheese and butter in Maine markets in the 1870s. The barn is similar in plan to one built at the University of Maine at Orono in 1873 (no longer extant), and was apparently promoted by the state as an ideal dairy barn. The barn is an timber frame structure, set on a high granite foundation, and faces roughly northeast. A retaining wall on the east side further supports the barn as the ground drops away to the south, providing ground-level access to the basement. The building is at the northwest to a carriage barn, whose gable runs perpendicular to that of the barn, and with their facades roughly flush. This extended facade has three sliding barn door entrances and one personnel entry. At the rear there is a hinged door providing access to the basement; a ramp that once provided access to the main floor has been removed. The gabled roof is metal, topped by a square gable-roofed cupola. The building is framed with large timbers fastened by pegs, and smaller structural elements are fastened with wire nails, a clue to the building's construction date. The framing method is also similar to local innovations in the 1880 construction of a mill complex to provide larger open spaces inside the structure.

It was originally called the Örebro Church () because it was the only Church of Sweden building in town until the early 20th century. Örebro Nikolai parish is in the Diocese of Strängnäs of the Church of Sweden. Saint Nicholas Church interior History Construction began in the late 13th century and is supposed to have been completed by the mid 14th century. Large parts of the church are built in the limestone. There are Romanesque styles in the oldest parts and therefore Gothic style in the newer. The oldest is the choir area from around 1275–1300. The current look of the church dates from the great restoration in 1863–1900 when the church's Gothic style was emphasized. The restoration proposal had been made by Carl Georg Brunius (1793–1869) and was completed by Axel Herman Hägg (1835–1921) and associate professor Adolf Kjellström (1834–1932). Partial renovations took place in 1936 under the direction of architect Erik Fant (1889–1954) and in 1962–64 after drawings by architect Kurt von Schmalensee (1896–1972).

It was first developed by J. David Johnson and has been utilized by a variety of disciplines including Library and Information Science and Health Communication. The CMIS has been empirically tested in health and organizational contexts.Johnson, J. D., & Meischke, H. (1993). Cancer-related channel selection: An extensionfor a sample of women who have had a mammogram. Women & Health, 20, 31-44.; Johnson, J. D., Donohue, W. A., Atkin, C. K., & Johnson, S. H. (1995). A comprehensive model of information seeking: Tests focusing on a technical organization. Science Communication, 16, 274-303. It has inherent strengths for studying how people react to health problems such as cancer.Johnson, J. D., Andrews, J. E. & Allard, S. (2001). A Model for Understanding and Affecting Genetics Information Seeking. Library and Information Science Research 23(4): 335-349. It specifies \\"antecedents\\" that explain why people become information seekers, \\"information carrier characteristic\\" that shape how they go about looking for information, and \\"information seeking actions\\" that reflect the nature of the search itself. Design The Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking The CMIS has been quantitatively tested and performs well when it comes to health information seeking behaviors (HISB). There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are: Antecedents, information field, and information seeking actions. The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information. Those factors are: Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs. These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process. The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities. This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information. A person’s understanding is developed through the information field. The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field. The final schema involves information seeking actions. This is what the consumer does as a result of the first two schemas through information seeking. There are three major dimensions: the scope, depth, and method of information seeking. Antecedents The CMIS antecedents—demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs—are factors that determine an individual's natural predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers. Certain types of health information seeking can be triggered by an individual's degree of personal experience with disease.Johnson, J. D. (1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press. In the CMIS framework, two personal relevance factors, salience and beliefs, are seen as the primary determinants in translating a perceived gap into an active search for information. Salience refers to the personal significance of health information to the individual, such as perceptions of risk to one's health, which are likely to result in information seeking action. However, people also may be motivated to gather information to determine the implications of health events for themselves and/or others related to their future activities, a factor directly related to the rapidly growing field of genetics. An individual's beliefs about the nature of a particular disease, its impacts, and level of control, all directly relate to self-efficacy, one of our key variables, and one that plays an important role in information seeking and people's more general pattern of actions related to health.Johnson, J. D.(1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press. Information Carrier Characteristics The information carrier characteristics are drawn from a model of Media Exposure and Appraisal (MEA) that has been tested on a variety of information carriers, including both sources and channels, and in a variety of cultural settings. Following the MEA, the CMIS focuses on editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. In the CMIS, characteristics are composed of editorial tone, which reflects an audience member's perception of credibility, while communication potential relates to issues of style and comprehensiveness. Utility relates the characteristics of a medium directly to the needs of an individual, and shares much with the uses and gratifications perspectives. For example, is the information contained in the medium relevant, topical, and important for the individual's purposes? In general, utility is very important for health information seeking. Information Seeking Actions There are several types of information seeking actions that can result from the impetus provided by the factors identified by the CMIS. For example, search behavior can be characterized by its extent, or the number of activities carried out, which has two components: scope, the number of alternatives investigated; and, depth, the number of dimensions of an alternative investigated. There is also the method of the search, or channel, as another major dimension of the search. For instance, an individual might choose the method of consulting a telephone information service, decide to have a narrow scope by only asking questions about smoking cessation clinics, but investigate every recommendation in detail, thus increasing the depth of the search. Stages in the CMIS A key concept from the CMIS is the notion of “stages,” or “cancer involvement”. According to the CMIS, an individual may be at one of four stages regarding a cancer threat, and thereby have differing information needs and behaviors. The first stage, Casual, is characterized by a general lack of concern or interest. At this stage, individuals are not purposive in their search for cancer-related information; rather, their search is accidental and aimless, even apathetic. The second stage is Purposive-Placid. This is characterized by the question, “What can I do to prevent cancer?” Individuals here might have some passing interest in cancer or genetic information, but are generally still not affected or directly concerned. The third stage is Purposive-Clustered. Here, an individual will be in closer proximity to cancer. This is the point at which a person is motivated to look for practical information that will address the specific problem. For example, a first- degree relative of a recently diagnosed breast cancer patient may seek genetic screening or BRCA 1/2 testing. The person could clearly benefit from such information- seeking behavior since medical authorities acknowledge that early detection of cancer leads to earlier treatments and better treatment outcomes. The fourth stage, Directed, includes individuals who have been diagnosed as having cancer. Such individuals need knowledge for making informed decisions about treatment and management of the disease.

Location and area  The Hoher Sonnblick seen from the north The mountain rises at the head of the Hüttwinkltal valley, the upper part of the Raurisertal, on the Alpine divide. It is a mighty massif with a characteristic rock pyramid on the summit block and a great North Face above Kolm-Saigurn. The highest summit of the Goldberg Group is not the Hoher Sonnblick, however, but the 3,254-metre-high Hocharn to the north. On the steep summit, at a height of 3,106 metres, is a meteorological observatory, the Sonnblick Observatory, and an Alpine refuge hut, the Zittelhaus (also written Zittlhaus). At a height of 2,718 metres is the Rojacher Hut and at 2,175 metres is the Schutzhaus Neubau. Both huts are managed during the summer months. On 1 January 1905, a temperature of was recorded at the summit, the lowest temperature recorded in Austria at that time. In the area of the Sonnblick there are historical gold mines, which gave their name to the mountain range around the Sonnblick, the Goldberg Group. On the mountainsides still stand the ruins of the gold diggings, Kulm-Saigurn is an ancient mountain mining settlement.

Construction began in 1941 and the airport opened the following year, featuring a wood and concrete runway. It served mostly as a reserve airport for Bodø Air Station. Rognan Airport was abandoned as a military airbase after the end of the war. History An airport in Rognan was first considered by the Royal Air Force during the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940, although the plans were never carried through. Instead, construction was carried out by Luftwaffe. Preliminary work started in late 1941 and the airport was completed the following year. It received a runway measuring , with a combined wooden and concrete surface. The Luftwaffe used the airport little, and it was mostly retained as a reserve airport for Bodø Air Station.Hafsten: 317 For a period a squadron of Junkers Ju 52 transporters were stationed at Rognan.Hafsten: 225 After the war the airport was taken over by the municipality and has been used for general aviation. A contributing factor has been the high load on Bodø Airport, which has caused restrictions on use by recreational aircraft. Especially sailplane activities were allocated to Rognan. Saltdal Flyklubb was established as a local aviation club in 1993. It took over the responsibility for operating the airport, although it remained owned by the municipality. Facilities South view of the airport's runway Rognan Airport is located in the village of Rognan, west of population center. It is situated north and west of the river Saltelva and the Nordland Line. The airport consists of a grass runway measuring . It is aligned 01/19, roughly north–south.

After the break-up of the T-Bones, Farr pursued a solo career that resulted in three studio albums and a handful of singles, none of which were commercially well received. Later he collaborated with other musicians (some of whom had been members of British band Uriah Heep) and released one album under the name Lion. Following this project, Farr made no more official music recordings.  Early life  Farr was born the third child of Tommy Farr (a famous Welsh champion heavyweight boxer) and Muriel Montgomery Germon in Worthing, Sussex, England;. He was the youngest among his siblings, sister Rosalind A. Germon (born June 1941) and brother Thomas Rikki Germon (known better as rock music promoter Rikki Farr, born December 1942). Growing up, Gary developed a love of blues and folk music, which greatly influenced his eventual musical career.  With the T-Bones  Farr began playing with the T-Bones around Sussex in 1963, as part of the British rhythm and blues scene, and eventually gaining enough of a local reputation to inherit the Yardbirds' Friday night slot at the famous Marquee Club in London as well as establishing themselves at the also- noteworthy Crawdaddy Club. In 1965 Gary Farr and the T-Bones recorded an EP titled Dem Bones Dem Bones Dem T-Bones, released in the UK by Columbia and produced by Giorgio Gomelsky. The group released some additional singles around the same time as the EP. None of the T-Bones' work landed on the UK charts, but the band managed to secure an appearance on the American television program Shindig Goes to London in August 1965, where they performed a cover of \\"Wooly Bully\\" alongside more famous groups such as The Moody Blues and The Animals. Following the television appearance, the T-Bones' drummer, Brian \\"Legs\\" Walkley, met and jammed with organist Keith Emerson (who would go on to fame with The Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer), which resulted in Emerson joining the band in its final days. They recorded a single titled \\"Together Forever\\" with Emerson, but the song was never released, as the T-Bones proceeded to break up shortly thereafter.  Solo career  Farr's career slowed down after the demise of The T-Bones, but by May 1968 he had released one single, \\"Everyday\\" b/w \\"Green,\\" with fellow artist Kevin Westlake. By 1969 Farr had begun to establish his career as a singer- songwriter; he began writing his own material, mostly of an acoustic-folk style rather than the blues and R&B; that characterised his years with The T-Bones. His first release was the album Take Something With You (Marmalade), featuring British group Mighty Baby as his session musicians. \\"Green\\" ended up appearing on the album. Along with the full-length album, he recorded a single, \\"Hey Daddy\\" (a non-album track). In August of the same year he appeared at the Isle of Wight Music Festival. In 1970 Farr recorded his second solo effort, Strange Fruit (CBS), which again featured members of Mighty Baby. A UK single on CBS was released from the album which was called Revolution of the Season/Old Man Boulder with catalogue number S5430. His live performances were mainly limited to low-key folk music clubs, but due to his familial connection to promoter Rikki Farr, he was able to perform at the famous 1970 Isle of Wight Music Festival, of which Rikki was the promoter. Still having no real success in his solo career, Farr was out of the music scene until 1973, when he recorded his third and final solo record, Addressed to the Censors of Love (ATCO). This album was the only one of his to be recorded in the United States and was produced by Jerry Wexler. One single, \\"Mexican Sun,\\" was released from the album; the A-side was a stereo version of the track, and the B-side a mono version. Neither the single nor the album was a commercial success, and Farr's career once again ground to a halt.  Lion  In 1980 Farr was back in the studio, this time accompanied by other musicians including Robin Le Mesurier and John Sinclair of Uriah Heep. Performing under the name Lion, Farr was in a band setting for the first time since the T-Bones broke up. One album was recorded and released by A&M; Records under the Lion name: Running All Night. After this project failed to garner any attention, Farr retreated from the music business and moved to the United States.

Early career She attended Miss Beret's School for Ladies in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and went on to earn her A.B. at Vassar College in 1907; She then taught history until 1914 when she became the YWCA industrial secretary in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. In this capacity she traveled through the south in order to organize women workers in industry. After earning an A.M. in economics at Columbia University in 1927 she decided to organize the Southern Summer School for Women Workers. Leonard recruited a faculty from women's colleges. It was modeled on the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry originated by Hilda Worthington Smith. She viewed workers' education as a means for social change.Klotter, James C. The Human Tradition in the Old South. Wilmington, Del: SR Books, 2003. Writing in Vassar Quarterly about her work she commented, \\"these awakening workers of the South have a chance to get worker's education,The Story of Philosophy as they demand social and economic enfranchisement.\\" To the South The first Southern Summer School met at rented facilities in 1927 at Sweet Briar College in Virginia. It never had permanent quarters, and moved each year. The 25 students each year were carefully chosen and all white, but the philosophy that Louise espoused made no difference between faculty and student, emphasizing \\"there is no line drawn between faculty and student as there is in academic life.\\" The students were chosen to represent all the typical industries of the south and Leonard was intent on teaching the \\"social attitudes appropriate to the machine age\\". In 1930 Louise Leonard married Myron McLaren, a professor at St.Johns college in Maryland. When he lost his job during the depression she supported them both. The couple was childless and she devoted herself to the work, under her charge more than 300 working class women came to summer residence, being trained as leaders in their fields. In 1938 men were included in the residence program and by 1940 half of the students were men. She had the support of the labor unions and had a commitment to the tenets of workers' education. Later career In 1944 Louise McLaren moved to New York City where she served as organizer for the Congress of Industrial Organizations Political Action committee. She held various positions eventually retiring from a teaching and research position with the American Labor Education Service. She was part of a network of reform-minded women that met in the 1920s and later became academic social scientists (including Marie Algor, Hilda (Jane) Smith, Mary C. Barker, Ernestine Friedmann, Alice Shoemaker, Amy Bruce, and Eleanor G. Coit). Some were former YWCA industrial and executive secretaries whom went on to establish summer schools, taught workers' education programs, did research and field work, and also held seminars and conferences for workers' education. Throughout the years of cooperative work in the field they managed to stay in touch and this resulted in lasting friendships. She died in East Stroudsburg, Pa. in 1968 of heart disease at age 83. She had a vision of industrial society and with an unfailing sense of optimism and with hard work and dedication inspired several generations of southern working women.

He is most notable for his leadership in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41.  Life  Dimitrios Papadopoulos was born on 15 December 1889Note: all dates until March 1924 are Old Style to the military doctor Spyridon Papadopoulos (1853–1930) and his wife Eleni (1857–1949). He was born in Nafplio, where his father was director of the Akronafplia military hospital. He had five siblings, the older brother Ioannis (1887–1913), and the younger brothers Angelos (1893–1973) and Athanasios (1900–1971) and two sisters. = Early military career = Like his older brother Ioannis, after completing his schools studies Dimitrios entered the Hellenic Army Academy on 10 October 1907, graduating as an Artillery 2nd Lieutenant on 26 June 1912. The Balkan Wars erupted a few months later, and the young artillery officer participated in them as a gun troop leader in the 3rd battery, 1st battalion, of the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment under the command of Colonel Leonidas Paraskevopoulos. During the Battle of Pechovo on 15 July 1913 during the Second Balkan War, his brother Ioannis fell in battle. On 25 September 1913 he was promoted to lieutenant. In 1915 he received the Silver Cross of the Order of the Redeemer (1 January), and was successively promoted to captain 2nd Class (25 March) and Captain 1st Class (5 October). In 1917–18 he fought in the Macedonian front of World War I as commander of a mountain artillery battalion. During the war he was promoted to major (13 December 1917) and received the Greek War Cross, the French Croix de Guerre and the Belgian Croix de Guerre. He also participated in the subsequent Asia Minor Campaign as commander of a field artillery battalion. For his service during the war, he earned the Cross of Valour in Gold. On 26 August 1923 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, but was soon implicated in the Leonardopoulos–Gargalidis coup d'état attempt (22 October) against the military-led \\"revolutionary government\\". As a result, on 28 November he was dismissed from the Army, and was not rehabilitated until 2 June 1927, when a number of officers removed for political reasons were re-admitted into the armed forces. He was promoted to colonel on 31 December 1927, retroactively dated to 18 September 1925. He attended studies at the Centre for Higher Military Training in Athens, founded and functioning under the auspices of a French military mission and was then sent to France for studies at military academies there. Returning to Greece, as Colonel he served as commander of an artillery regiment, Chief of Artillery to the II Army Corps and head of the Artillery Directorate in the Ministry of Military Affairs. Promoted to major general on 21 March 1934, he served as Chief of Artillery to the Athens-based I Army Corps until 1935. He then held a succession of divisional commands, before being named Inspector of Artillery in 1938. On 30 January 1940 he was promoted to lieutenant general and placed in command of II Army Corps at Larissa. = World War II and occupation = The Greek counteroffensive (13 November 1940 – 7 April 1941) With the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War, II Corps under Papadopoulos took position in the central section of the front, initially under Lt. General Ioannis Pitsikas' Western Macedonia Army Section. II Corps participated in the operations to hold the initial Italian offensive and in the Greek counter-offensive, capturing Ersekë and Borovë (21 November). From 30 November, II Corps passed under the direct control of General Headquarters under Lt. General Alexandros Papagos. Përmet was captured on 5 December, the fortified Çorovodë–Vërzhezhe–Dobruzhe line was overcome on 26 December, and the II Corps' offensive culminated in January in the capture of the strategically important Klisura pass and the capture of Mount Trebeshinë in early February. On 14 February 1941, II Corps was placed under the newly constituted Epirus Army Section of Lt. General Markos Drakos. On 4 March, he was awarded the Greek War Cross, 1st Class. In the first days of March, however, even though preparations were under way to face the oncoming great Italian Spring Offensive, a leadership crisis erupted during a conference of the commanding Lieutenant Generals at Athens on March 5. When asked on their opinion regarding the country's stance against the looming German invasion of Greece, Papadopoulos, along with generals Drakos and Georgios Kosmas (I Corps), voiced objections to the presence of a British expeditionary force, which would have been inadequate to defend Greece against the Germans but sufficient to give the Germans a casus belli. Their opposition led to their dismissal on the next day and their retirement on the day after that. Following the German attack, the capitulation of the Greek army and the Axis occupation of Greece in April, on 20 May 1941 Papadopoulos was reinstated in the army by the new collaborationist government's Minister of Defence, Major General Georgios Bakos, and led the Supreme Military Council that reviewed the war records of the officer corps in respect to awards, promotions etc. On 20 May 1943, he became a founding member of the \\"Military Hierarchy\\" (Στρατιωτική Ιεραρχία), a group of generals led by Alexander Papagos that tried to organize the officer corps into the Greek Resistance. The group's activities quickly became known to the Germans, however, and on 20 July the leadership of the organization was arrested and deported to Germany. Of the leading Lieutenant Generals, only Papadopoulos remained at large, although the Germans were aware of his role; as the leader of what was left of the organization, he was placed under constant watch, and possibly served as a bait for other officers who might wish to contact the group. The group survived through the occupation and many of its members came forth to man the Attica Military Command which took over control of Athens and its environs upon the retreat of the German troops in October 1944. = Later life and death = On 5 March 1945, along with the bulk of the remaining military leadership of the war of 1940–41, Papadopoulos was placed on the inactive list. On 30 October he received the Medal for Outstanding Acts and his second Cross of Valour in Gold. He retired on 13 May 1946.

It served the Rockport Branch of the Newburyport/Rockport Line. A short-lived stop, it was open from 1977 to 1985. History The path from the apartment complex to the station photographed in May 2012 Harbor station opened in December 1977 to serve a new apartment complex (now The Heights at Cape Ann) located on a bluff above the tracks. Several short turn trains (which had formerly terminated at Manchester but ran to an interlocking just west of Gloucester to switch tracks for the inbound journey) were extended to Harbor at that time. Several trips, including the short turns, were cut in September 1979. On January 30, 1981, service to nearby West Gloucester was discontinued during a round of budget cuts, leaving Harbor as the only station serving the area. The station was never heavily used - an April 1983 count showed just 35 daily boardings. On November 16, 1984, a fire destroyed Beverly Draw, which connects Salem and Beverly Depot on the line. A shuttle train continued to operate from Rockport to Beverly until January 7, 1985, when it was replaced by bus service. The locomotives used were then trucked to Danvers so they could be repaired at the MBTA's main maintenance facility. When service was restored on December 1, 1985, Harbor station remained closed. West Gloucester, which had more room for parking, reopened instead. Harbor station consisted of a small shelter with no platforms; passengers boarded from a clearing next to the tracks. A paved path led from the rear of the apartment complex to the station area. Only the path and a small clearing around the concrete base of the shelter are still extant.

She is best remembered for writing lyrics to popular songs, in collaboration with composer and Richmond radio announcer Carl Stutz. Early writings Before joining the newspaper, Edith Lindeman wrote two children's books used in Jewish Sabbath schools, Bible Tales for the Very Young (1930) and Bible Tales for Young People (1934). Based on Old Testament stories, Lindeman wrote these at the request of her father- in-law, Rabbi Edward Nathan Calisch. She also wrote a one-act play (The Jews Who Stood by Washington) and also collected Jewish legends in Fairy Tales from Grandfather's Big Book (1938) and Three Score and Twenty: A Brief Biography of Edward Nathan Calisch (1945). Newspaper career She joined the Times- Dispatch in 1933, serving mostly as a film and theater critic, but also as a writer and editor on entertainment. She retired in 1964, estimating that she had seen 6,000 films during her 31-year stint at the paper. Her executive editor said \\"Edith Lindeman made a tremendous contribution to the cultural life of this community.... She'll be remembered especially for the strong coverage she provided for the area's regional theaters in their formative years.\\" Songwriting Collaborating with composer Carl Stutz, she wrote several dozen popular songs in the 1950s. She said she took up songwriting while driving through Kentucky with her husband. While listening to music on the radio, she said to her husband \\"I could write better lyrics than that.\\" Her husband, who believed that she could do anything she set her mind to, replied \\"Well, why don't you?\\" The result was her first lyric, \\"Curves in Kentucky\\", which she took to Stutz, then an announcer at powerhouse radio station WRVA. The song never amounted to much, but Lindeman was convinced that she could write something better. Her better work included \\"Little Things Mean a Lot\\", which, as recorded by Kitty Kallen, was the top song of 1954, and \\"Red Headed Stranger\\", which became a top hit when recorded by Willie Nelson. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. She also wrote the lyrics for \\"Blackberry Winter\\", which became a back-door million-seller as the B-side of Mitch Miller's recording of The Yellow Rose of Texas, which became a #1 hit in the U.S. in 1955. Edith Lindeman was honored by the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1977. She died in Richmond on December 22, 1984.

The architect for the library was Waddy Butler Wood. In 1922, the Thomas Balch Library was constructed in Leesburg, Virginia as a memorial to historian Thomas Balch, a Leesburg native. Thomas Willing Balch (1866-1927) and Edwin Swift Balch (1856-1927), sons of Thomas Balch, originally endowed the subscription library. The Library is part of the Leesburg Historic District. The Thomas Balch Library operated for fifty years under a private Board of Trustees. The library was staffed by volunteers and part-time employees. In 1960 the library dropped its subscription and became a free, though segregated, public library. It was desegregated in 1965. In 1973, the Loudoun County Public Library system was established. The Thomas Balch Library joined as a full service public library branch in 1974, alongside the Purcellville, Purcellville Bookmobile and Sterling libraries. In 1994, ownership of the Thomas Balch Library was transferred from the Loudoun County Public Library system to the Town of Leesburg. Under the Town of Leesburg, the library began operating as a history and genealogy library.Leesburg, Virginia: Thomas Balch Library The Martin L. Cook photograph collection was acquired by the library in 2008. Cook was commissioned after training at the Tuskegee Army Flying School and went on to serve in the U.S. Navy in the Department of Defense as an aeronautical engineer. In 2003 a Palladio Award in the category \\"Traditional Buildings\\" was given to Bowie Gridley Architects for a \\"sympathetic\\" addition to the Library building. The addition doubled the size of the 1922 building. In 2013, the state legislature passed a special bill enabling the Library to receive a gift of $618,000 left to it by Virginia L. Bowie, a Leesburg resident and longtime library volunteer. The Library also holds an annual fundraising event at various local historic sites. Services The Thomas Balch Library offers patrons many services. Reference services include general collection research, and also manuscripts, archives and rare book research. Internet access is available on specified computer terminals. Interlibrary loan services are also available to patrons, with a small fee. Reproduction services are also offered. These services are either self-serve or employee-assisted when special handling is required for specific materials. Reproduction services include both written information and photographs.

She was the mother of his successor Kumaragupta I, and was most probably same as Dhruva-svamini, who has been mentioned as a queen of Chandragupta and the mother of prince Govindagupta in a clay seal inscription. According to the Sanskrit play Devi- Chandraguptam, which is now partially lost, Dhruvadevi was originally a queen of Chandragupta's elder brother Ramagupta, who decided to surrender her to a Shaka enemy after being besieged. Chandragupta entered the enemy camp disguised as the queen, and killed the enemy. A reconstruction of the play, based on other literary and epigraphic evidence, suggests that Chandragupta later killed Ramagupta, and married Dhruva-devi. The historicity of this narrative is debated among modern historians, with some scholars dismissing it as a work of fiction.  In Gupta records  The word \\"Dhruva\\" literally means unchangeable or constant, and is the Sanskrit name for the pole star. According to the Gupta records, Dhruva-devi was the mother of Chandragupta's successor Kumaragupta I. The Basarh clay seal of Govindagupta mentions Dhruva- svamini as a queen of Chandragupta, and the mother of Govindagupta. It is unlikely that Chandragupta had two different queens with similar names: it appears that Dhruvasvamini was most probably another name for Dhruvadevi, and that Govindagupta was a uterine brother of Kumaragupta.  In Devi- Chandraguptam  According to the Sanskrit play Devi-Chandraguptam, which is now available only in form of some fragments, Dhruvadevi was originally a queen of Chandragupta's elder brother Ramagupta. Once, Ramagupta was besieged by a Shaka enemy, who demanded Dhruva-devi as part of a peace agreement. Ramagupta agreed to surrender Dhruva-devi to the enemy, but Chandragupta went to the enemy camp disguised as the queen, and killed the enemy. The rest of the story is not clear from the surviving fragments, but based on later literary and epigraphic references, it may be reconstructed as follows: Ramagupta's public image suffered as a result of his decision to surrender his wife to an enemy, while Chandragupta was regarded as a hero by the subjects. Ramagupta grew jealous of his brother, and tried to persecute him. Chandragupta feigned madness to escape his brother's enmity, but ultimately killed him, became the new king, and married Dhruva-devi. The historicity of the Devi-Chandraguptam plot has been doubted by several modern historians. For example, according to historian D. C. Sircar, the only historical facts in the play are that Dhruvadevi was a queen of Chandragupta and that the Shakas held power in western India: everything else is the author's own imagination or \\"some current popular legends embellished by his imagination\\". Several later texts and inscriptions allude to the events described in the play (see ), but these sources may be based on the play itself, and thus, cannot be conclusively regarded as evidence corroborating the play's historicity. Chandragupta and Dhruvadevi are known to be historical persons, and Ramagupta's existence is also believed to have been proved by the discovery of some inscriptions and coins attributed to him (see ). However, this does not necessarily confirm the historicity of the events described in Devichandraguptam.

He privately studied composition under Jaroslav Řídký (1946–50). In 1959 he passed the state examination in violin.

After finishing his university studies, he taught music education at the Pedagogical Grammar School in Znojmo (1950-1951).

The company was founded in 1979 and opened its retail website in 1995. Leibish & Co. offers a wide range of natural fancy color diamonds that are found in any one of 12 colors, with over 90 secondary hues, 9 intensity levels, and over 230 color combinations. The company’s head office operates out of the Israel Diamond Exchange, and they have main offices in New York City and Hong Kong. The company also has hubs in the UK, India, Australia, Belgium, and most recently Shanghai, and Shenzhen.  History  The company now known as Leibish & Co. began in 1979 when Leibish Polnauer sold his first brown diamonds to Garrard, the British Royal Crown Jeweler. He spent the next decade growing and establishing his reputation in the diamond industry. In 1990, Leibish, who specialized from the start of his career in manufacturing fancy shaped goods, started a 15 year partnership with Joske Herskovits. The business they formed focused on fancy colors and fancy shapes. In 1995, when the website was first launched, Leibish & Co. became one of the first diamond companies to launch an online portal. At the time, the website was called www.fancydiamonds.net. Their goal was to utilize the Internet as a marketing, customer service, and sales tool in order to reach a wider spectrum of international customers. In 2005, Leibish split with Herskovitz and took the company under his wing, together with his children forming the company as it is today. In September 2011, Leibish introduced a jewelry insurance to protect the purchase of its customers. In April 2013, Leibish & Co. partnered with El Corte Inglés, the biggest department store group in Europe and ranked fourth worldwide as their supplier of fancy color diamond jewelry. In 2014, Leibish & Co. rebranded their company and changed the website to www.leibish.com. In that same year, the company partnered with Chinese ecommerce platform Kela to launch a website in Chinese.  Operations  Leibish & Co. offers a large privately owned collections of natural fancy color diamonds online. The company also manufactures and sells their in-house designed color diamond jewelry and gemstone jewelry. Leibish & Co.’s business model is divided between the traditional diamond trade and their core business operations through the Leibish website. Through the website, users can utilize the Design Your Own tool, which enables the client to custom design their own unique jewelry orders. Leibish & Co. is a certified member of the WFDB (World Federation of Diamond Bourses), NCDIA (Natural Color Diamond Association), IDE (Israel Diamond Exchange), IDI (Israel Diamond Institute), RapNet, IDEX, and GemIT. Leibish & Co. diamonds are all sourced from conflict-free, legitimate sources (in compliance with the KPCS Resolutions), including Argyle in Australia, and vast mines in Africa, India and Russia.

It was released on March 24, 2015 through Thrill Jockey record label. The first single off the album, \\"Quetzalcoatl\\" was released digitally on January 20, 2015. Background Following the release of the band's second album, Aesthethica, Liturgy toured as a duo, only featuring the band leader Hunter Hunt-Hendrix and guitarist Bernard Gann. During this period, Hunt-Hendrix planned the album by herself for a couple of years and expressed a desire to move away from its standard “transcendental black metal” style, to incorporate more “electronic elements.” In 2014, the former band members, bassist Tyler Dusenbury and drummer Greg Fox, rejoined the band to record the upcoming third studio album. The Ark Work was announced on January 20, 2015 and the press release of the album describes it as featuring \\"cross-fertilizing hardstyle beats, occult-oriented rap, and the glitched re-sampling of IDM.\\" Reception The album received polarised receptions from critics and fans alike. Consequence of Sound gave the album a B- and said it was \\"triumphant and interesting enough to keep fans satisfied\\", though also noted the album will raise \\"the question the band has prompted before: Is this even black metal?\\" The A.V. Club, which awarded the album a B+, called the album \\"more progressive and polarizing than ever\\" and \\"a singular musical achievement\\". The New York Times suggested that the album found the band truly developing its own sound and, while not free of criticisms, observed, \\"The band knows its virtues and works them hard\\". NPR stated that with this album, Hunt-Hendrix \\"[has] come closer than ever to realizing\\" her goal of creating transcendental black metal. PopMatters shared this opinion; while they criticised the album's lyrics, they effusively praised other aspects of the album, saying, \\"it manages to capture Hunt-Hendrix’s aesthetic vision without feeling like it’s reaching to tack on a philosophy to its adventurous music. The record truly feels like Transcendental Black Metal\\". Pitchfork Media gave it a mixed review, rating the album at 6.4 out of 10 and praising Greg Fox' performance and the first five songs but criticising Hunt-Hendrix' vocals as monotonous and the album as overlong.

Like in the analysis of \\"ordinary\\", sequential, algorithms, one is typically interested in asymptotic bounds on the resource consumption (mainly time spent computing), but the analysis is performed in the presence of multiple processor units that cooperate to perform computations. Thus, one can determine not only how many \\"steps\\" a computation takes, but also how much faster it becomes as the number of processors goes up. The analysis approach works by first suppressing (or abstracting away) the number of processors. The next background paragraph explains how the abstraction of the number of processors first emerged. A so- called work-time (WT) (sometimes called work-depth, or work-span) framework was originally introduced by Shiloach and Vishkin for conceptualizing and describing parallel algorithms. In the WT framework, a parallel algorithm is first described in terms of parallel rounds. For each round, the operations to be performed are characterized, but several issues can be suppressed. For example, the number of operations at each round need not be clear, processors need not be mentioned and any information that may help with the assignment of processors to jobs need not be accounted for. Second, the suppressed information is provided. The inclusion of the suppressed information is, in fact, guided by the proof of a scheduling theorem due to Brent, which is explained later in this article. The WT framework is useful since while it can greatly simplify the initial description of a parallel algorithm, inserting the details suppressed by that initial description is often not very difficult. For example, the WT framework was adopted as the basic presentation framework in the parallel algorithms books (for the Parallel random-access machine PRAM model) and , as well as in the class notes . The overview below explains how the WT framework can be used for analyzing more general parallel algorithms, even when their description is not available within the WT framework. Overview Suppose computations are executed on a machine that has processors. Let denote the time that expires between the start of the computation and its end. Analysis of the computation's running time focuses on the following notions: * The work of a computation executed by processors is the total number of primitive operations that the processors perform. Ignoring communication overhead from synchronizing the processors, this is equal to the time used to run the computation on a single processor, denoted . * The depth or span is the length of the longest series of operations that have to be performed sequentially due to data dependencies (the critical path). The depth may also be called the critical path length of the computation. Minimizing the depth/span is important in designing parallel algorithms, because the depth/span determines the shortest possible execution time. Alternatively, the span can be defined as the time spent computing using an idealized machine with an infinite number of processors. * The cost of the computation is the quantity . This expresses the total time spent, by all processors, in both computing and waiting. Several useful results follow from the definitions of work, span and cost: * Work law. The cost is always at least the work: . This follows from the fact that processors can perform at most operations in parallel. * Span law. A finite number of processors cannot outperform an infinite number, so that . Using these definitions and laws, the following measures of performance can be given: * Speedup is the gain in speed made by parallel execution compared to sequential execution: . When the speedup is for input size (using big O notation), the speedup is linear, which is optimal in simple models of computation because the work law implies that (super-linear speedup can occur in practice due to memory hierarchy effects). The situation is called perfect linear speedup. An algorithm that exhibits linear speedup is said to be scalable. * Efficiency is the speedup per processor, . * Parallelism is the ratio . It represents the maximum possible speedup on any number of processors. By the span law, the parallelism bounds the speedup: if , then: \\\\frac{T_1}{T_p} \\\\leq \\\\frac{T_1}{T_\\\\infty} < p . * The slackness is . A slackness less than one implies (by the span law) that perfect linear speedup is impossible on processors. Execution on a limited number of processors Analysis of parallel algorithms is usually carried out under the assumption that an unbounded number of processors is available. This is unrealistic, but not a problem, since any computation that can run in parallel on processors can be executed on processors by letting each processor execute multiple units of work. A result called Brent's law states that one can perform such a \\"simulation\\" in time , bounded by :T_p \\\\leq T_N + \\\\frac{T_1 - T_N}{p}, or, less precisely, :T_p = O \\\\left( T_N + \\\\frac{T_1}{p} \\\\right) . An alternative statement of the law bounds above and below by :\\\\frac{T_1}{p} \\\\leq T_p \\\\leq \\\\frac{T_1}{p} + T_\\\\infty. showing that the span (depth) and the work together provide reasonable bounds on the computation time.

Overview In December 2014, it was announced that Anand J. Bodas and his copresenter Ameya Jadhav, who claim that aircraft more advanced than today's versions existed in ancient India, would be allowed to speak at the Indian Science Congress and present a paper on aviation in the Vedic age. During an interview, scientists claimed that such aircraft were huge and could fly to other planets. Scientists also claimed that those planes could fly backwards, left, or right, contrary to modern aircraft that can fly only forward. Bodas, who was a principal at a pilot training school in Kerala and Jadhav, currently a lecturer at the Swami Vivekanand International School and Junior College in Mumbai, cited a text called Vaimanika Prakaranam (also called Vaimānika Shāstra) as evidence. Scientists from the Indian Institute of Science studied the text in 1974, concluding that \\"craft is a decided impossibility” and that the Vaimānika Shāstra was written no earlier than 1904. Bodas stated that modern science rejects anything that it cannot explain. He claimed that of the 500 guidelines described in the text, only 100 to 120 survive today. He attributed this loss to the passage of time, foreign rulers of India and artefacts which had been stolen from India, during that time. The five-day conference was held at the Kalina Campus of the Mumbai University starting on 3 January 2015. The paper was presented on 4 January, as a part of the larger symposium on \\"Ancient Sciences Through Sanskrit\\". Other papers presented in the symposium were \\"Engineering applications of Ancient Indian botany\\", \\"Neuro-science of yoga: understanding the process\\", \\"Advances in surgery in Ancient India\\" and \\"Scientific principles of Ancient Indian architecture and civil engineering\\". Criticism and protests In late December 2014, Ram Prasad Gandhiraman, a scientist at the NASA's Ames Research Center, started a petition to prevent the paper from being presented at the conference. By 31 December, 220 scientists and academicians had signed the petition. Gandhiraman criticized the paper as pseudo-science and said that mythology should not be mixed with science. S. M. Deshpande, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, who has written a paper with four others on aircraft in Sanskrit texts, said that we should not reject such claims as pseudo-science outright but examine them with intellectual curiosity. His paper, however, states that the aircraft described in the Vaimānika Shāstra text would not be capable of flying and the text itself cannot be traced to any date before 1904. H.S. Mukunda, another professor at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, who was a co-author of the paper, criticized the organizers and said that both sides of the debate should be presented. He asked why had there been no working models made if the persons who presented the paper were convinced that they were right. Roddam Narasimha, director of National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), said that there is no credible evidence that aviation existed in ancient India. He added that the Vaimānika Shāstra text has been studied scientifically and the consensus is that descriptions in the text are unscientific. Noted Indian astrophysicist and founding director of the Inter- University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Pune, India, Jayant Narlikar reacted to the controversy saying that it was good to be proud of ancient Indian science but scientists should not make claims about things they did not have proof of. He commented, \\"We can boast of things but it should be restricted to what we have proof of. But we shouldn't claim things of which there is no evidence or proof as it reduces the credibility of what our scientists have achieved in the past.\\" He further asserted, \\"Even the West recognizes the knowledge of mathematics held by Indians. If we start making outlandish claims, the scientific community of world will not look up to us as it does now\\". Economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen commented that some evidence is required in the controversial claims made in the Indian Science Congress regarding the achievements of ancient Indians. He said, \\"The idea that human beings can fly is known to human beings from birth. The idea that human beings might be able to be on the air has been talked about a lot. If that was true, then we would like to find some evidence.\\" Further, he elaborated, \\"As our epics show, Indians have thought about flying for a long time. But it would be fanciful to say that India invented the aeroplane. If ancient India had airfare technology, we would like to see some evidence. I agree there are a lot of claims that have nothing to do with achievements.\\" Support Gauri Mahulikar, the head of the department of Sanskrit at Mumbai University, said that the paper would have been easily dismissed if it had been presented by Sanskrit professors. But, since Bodas was a pilot and Ameya Jadhav had a Master of Technology and Master of Arts in Sanskrit, it cannot be rejected easily.

The house is located at 11700 Tom Patton Lane, Berlin, Maryland, 21811, within walking distance of the Assateague Island Visitor Center at Assateague State Park, Maryland. Built of Flemish bond brick with random glazed headers, the house would have been \\"one of the most impressive gentry dwellings in the region\\" in the 18th century. The plantation house is one of a small number of remaining tidewater dwellings from colonial times, and may be the only one of its kind and vintage in the Mid-Atlantic region that is open to the public.  History  The earliest known inhabitants of the area around Rackliffe House were the Assateague Indians, who maintained a hunting camp there. In 1679, a grant for 2200 acres of land, an area reaching from Southpointe to Mystic Harbor, was given to Charles Rackliffe and his brother-in-law Edward Wale. Originally known as Genezeer, it is the oldest property owned by colonists in Northern Worcester County. The two-story and the half story 38-by-32-foot house were built of double pile bricks around 1752, by Captain Charles Rackliffe. With large windows, set on an elevated location, the Rackliffe's \\"Manor Place\\" offered its inhabitants views of Sinepuxent Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, allowing them to keep an eye on shipping traffic. The kitchen was separate, connected to the main two-story house by a hyphen. African-American slaves on the plantation raised tobacco, corn and wheat. A 1790 inventory of Rackliffe's \\"possessions\\" included 10 slaves, 9 horses, 220 head of cattle, 120 head of sheep, 62 hogs, and 28,000 pounds of tobacco. The Rackliffe House survived the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War. Local folklore claims that upper stories of the house sustained fire damage in an attack during the Revolutionary War. In the early 19th century the house changed hands several times. A fire gutted the house in 1929. It was later rebuilt, with a white stucco exterior over the original brick. In 1996, the state of Maryland acquired the house and 114 acres.  Rackliffe House Trust  The Rackliffe House Trust was created in 2004, by Tom Patton, a descendant of the Rackliffe and Wale families. Patton, the founding President of the Rackliffe House Trust, envisioned the House as a site for coastal heritage interpretation. Patton died in October 2010, before the house was opened, but work has continued under Trust president Joan Jenkins. An extensive review of the site, the construction of the buildings, and the house's history was completed as part of its restoration plan in 2007. The Trust is now operating the structure and surrounding three acres of property as a Coastal Maryland Heritage Center, under a 50-year lease from the Maryland Department of Natural resources. The three-acre site is part of 110-acre tract that is contained within Assateague Island State Park. The Trust has worked with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the Assateague State Park to raise more than $800,000 in funding for the restoration of Rackliffe House and archeological examination of the property. The main areas restored include the colonial residence, its attached kitchen, and the milk house. The work done has included removal of 1920's interior woodwork, reconstruction of four original fireplaces, construction of a new roof in the architectural style of the mid-1700s, and repair and repointing of damaged walls with period bricks. Areas of the walls were 18 inches thick at the base and a foot at the top. Wiring, heating, air conditioning and plumbing have also been installed. The house first opened for public tours in 2012, attracting than 1,100 visitors.  Archaeological work  The area is a potential site for both prehistoric and early 1700s archaeological work. A number of additional buildings were located, at various times, on the property. A graveyard is also believed to have been nearby, but its exact location is unknown. There are fears that important sites may already be lost, due to long-term changes in climate and shoreline, and more recently to golf course development. An initial three-week dig in 2010, led by archaeologists Aaron Levinthal and Ryun Papson, mapped the site by digging 300 small holes to take soil samples. They used that information to identify three-foot square units to examine in more detail. \\"Three-quarters of the property has archaeological integrity, which means the soils haven't been severely disturbed.\\" Among their discoveries were pieces of pre-1650 Native American pottery, a possible dumping ground in a swampy area, and a buried brick walkway. More than 40 volunteers were involved in working at the site. Executive Director Jim Rapp hopes to see archaeological excavation at the site to locate such structures. \\"I hope we can get seasonal excavations going again with our archaeologist and board member, Aaron Levinthal... He said this site is wonderful and rare because it hasn't been disturbed over the years and people just loved seeing an archaeological excavation under way.\\" Access As part of Asateague State Park, the Rackliffe property is open during the day from dawn to dusk. Year-round, visitors can explore the grounds and see the exterior of the house and milk house. They are requested to park at the Assateague Island Visitor Center. From there, they can walk to the House along Tom Patton Lane. New hiking trails are being planned to offer a more scenic path. The house itself is only open for tours on specified days during the summer.

He is a pioneer known for inventing the Nano Artificial Nose (NA-NOSE) for detection of disease from exhaled breath, by which he was highlighted as MIT's Innovators under 35; and which is widely used for sniffing out diseases' biomarkers in labs and industries. He has many contributions in multidisciplinary fields such as Nanotechnology, Nanosensors, , Volatile Biomarkers, and Molecular Electronics.  Personal life  Haick was born into an Arab Christian familyYoung Israelis of the year: Dr. Hossam Haick, 34: Sniffing out cance in Nazareth. Haick graduated from a Catholic school St. Joseph Seminary & High School at Nazareth. Academic life Haick is a Full Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology and an expert in the field of nanotechnology and non-invasive disease diagnosis. He was born in Nazareth. In 1998, he received his B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering from the Ben-Gurion University, and in 2002, he got his Ph.D. in a direct track from the Technion. He spent two years (2004-2006) as a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology-Caltech, after spending two years at the Weizmann Institute of Science (2002-2004). He went back to the Technion and became an assistant professor in 2006. He is now a full-academic professor in the department of Chemical Engineering and the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute(RBNI), and the director of the Laboratory of Nanomaterials-based Devices(LNBD) at the Technion. Research The research interests of Hossam Haick include nano-array devices for screening, diagnosis and monitoring of disease, nanomaterial-based chemical (flexible) sensors, electronic skin, breath analysis, volatile biomarkers, and molecule-based electronic devices. He adapted novel spectroscopy and spectrometry techniques and carried out in-vivo, in-vitro, and ex-vivo experiments as well as single-cell analysis to gain new understanding about the volatile biomarkers. In his early discoveries, he showed, for the first time ever, that cancer has a unique (volatile) molecular print through exhaled breath samples. Later, his group showed that each disease has its own unique volatile molecular print and, therefore, the presence of one cancer would not screen out others – a prerequisite for developing new generation(s) of biomedical devices for personalized screening, diagnosis, and future screening of various diseases in a noninvasive, inexpensive and portable manner. These results serve as the main milestone towards formal recognition of a new field of biomarkers, so-called “volatolomics” (the omics of volatile biomarkers). From basic science to point-of-care reality, Haick's group has developed and patented a new technology termed Artificially Intelligent Nanoarray that allows diagnosis of more than 23 disease states through exhaled breath using a non-invasive, inexpensive, fast method. Such artificially intelligent nanoarray is easily portable and affordable in the developing countries as well as in developed countries. He also found a unique balance of diversity and commonality in the different (functionalized) nanomaterial systems his group fabricated to enable a response that is amenable for analysis mimicking the olfactory system, with successful implementation of analyzer devices from the fabricated nanomaterial-based sensor arrays which have been put to practical evaluation in more than two dozen hospitals worldwide. Such nanoarays were tested for various types of cancers, chronic and acute kidney disease, hepatic disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension and more. His group has been able to discriminate even between sub-categories of a specific disease as well as between volatile organic compounds that are associated with genetic mutations of important disease states (P53, K-RAS, EGFR, and ALK). His team has also developed and characterized artificially-intelligent systems called \\"smart patches\\" that imitate the human skin, in the sense they can simultaneously feel pressure (or touch), humidity, temperature and chemical analytes. These self-healable smart patches can equip computers, robots and smart objects with the sense of touch, enabling them to feel their surroundings. The patented technology has very high tactile resolution and fast readout times that match, and even exceed, human fingertip touch sensation. Such patches require smaller data readout volumes, low power consumption, low operating voltage and can be fabricated using low-cost printed electronic manufacturing processes. These features have opened new technological and business opportunities, such as touch-sensitive robots and medical devices, prosthetic limbs with tactile feedback, as well as, wearable smart patches for sports and rehabilitation. The technologies developed by his team have led to the production of more than 42 patents and patent applications – exchanging so many collaborations and partnerships between the Technion and international entities. He led the emergence of spin-offs, such as NanoVation-SG Ltd. and FeelIT Ltd. Achievements and Honorary Titles Hossam Haick was elected by the Senate to hold the prestigious “F.M.W Academic Chair\\" position at the Technion. He has made significant marks through his development of artificially intelligent nanoarray technology to detect diseases in non-invasive manner, which earned him a wide variety of prestigious grants and awards: Marie Curie Excellence Grant, ERC, Bill & Melinda Gates Award, coordinator of FP-7 consortium (LCAOS; 2011-2015), coordinator of a EuroNanoMed consortium (Volgacore; 2014-2017), coordinator of Horizon2020 ICT consortium (SniffPhone; 2015-2019), and many more. The device is named as \\"Na-Nose\\", also called \\"E-Nose.\\" He also has several patents and contributions for creating artificial electronic skins used for prosthetics and robotics applications. He is the recipient of dozens of international honors and recognition for his efforts - more than 72 prizes and awards - including a Knight of the Order of Academic Palms (conferred by the French Government) - first established in 1808 by Napoleon Bonaparte; the “List of the World’s Top 35 Young Scientists;\\" the “Bill & Melinda Gates” Award; the \\"Innovation and Entrepreneurship\\" Prize in Chemical Engineering; the Humboldt Senior Research Award; the EU’s Electronic Components & Systems (ECS) Innovation Award; \\"top-100 innovators in the world\\" (2015-2018); the “Michael Bruno” award; the \\"Order of the Merit of Tikun Olam\\" title of the Leo Baeck Education Center; the Al-Khwarizmi Decoration for Educational Contribution for Primary Schools; the \\"YMCA\\" Award; the \\"Lion's Club\\" Award; the “Tenne Prize for Excellence in the Science of Nanotechnology;\\" Halevy Award for Innovative Applied Engineering, and many others. Besides his recent and past achievements in research, he had excellent achievements as a lecturer, expressed by a wide variety of prizes that he received for (constant) excellence in teaching (top 4%). He is also the recipient of the prestigious \\"Yanai Prize for Academic Excellence\\", which is given for exceptional and significant contribution in teaching and academic education. He also was appointed to be a board member of the “Scientific Reports.\\" As an active innovative scientist and educational developer in his society, he attracted the attentions of the world's billionaires such as Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt, and he's been in collaboration with Bill and Melinda Gates foundation in the diagnostics of diseases arena.

This project was selected recently as one of the MOST influential projects in the world for 2015-2018 several organizations and has received the EU’s Innovation Award for 2018. • Horizon2020 Health consortium (VOGAS; 2019-2022): This consortium includes 8 academic partners, 4 hospitals and 2 SMEs from both Europe and Latin America, to develop and validate breath analyzer for the detection and classification of gastric diseases. • Horizon 2020 ICT consortium (A-Patch; 2019-2022): This consortium includes 3 academic partners, 2 international companies, 2 SMEs, 1 hospital, and 1 non-profit foundation, for the development of ultra-thing sensory patch for the detection of infection disease from skin. Additionally, Haick has co-led the establishment and operation of an International Associate Centre between his group at the Technion and INSERM999 (Paris, France). Currently he is a co- director of this center. Education and Teaching Haick's very tight schedule hasn't blocked him from teaching young students and researchers. He has regularly been awarded the Technion’s Excellence Award in Teaching (top 4%) as well as the prestigious “Yanai Prize for Academic Excellence.” He loves teaching and believes on the idea of mentoring the young. In 2014, he designed and developed the first Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in the Technion, in a title of \\"Nanotechnology and Nanosensors\\" and, for the first time in the world, in two languages: Arabic and English (https://www.coursera.org/course/nanosensors). These MOOCs focused on the newly-emerged field of non-invasive diagnosis as well as personalized medicine approaches. Societal Involvement A few times a week, Haick visits, on a voluntary basis, different places throughout his country (including primary schools, high schools, and non-profit organizations), sharing his own ideas about advances in science and technology, chatting on, especially with the young, the urgent need for advanced education and excellence in science. So far, his voluntary efforts have been appreciated and evidenced by a list of awards and decorations from all over the world Publications Since Haick joined Technion in 2006, he and his colleagues have compiled more than 220 publications in top-level journals in the field of nanotechnology, and advanced/applied materials/chemistry. Despite being educated as an engineer, he has published his ideas in leading clinical journals. The advances he pioneered led to the production of ten book chapters in books of leading publishers. His articles have gained > 11,000 citations, 35 articles of his are with >100 citations. Haick has an H-index = 61.

She worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Nobel laureate Alfred Gilman at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Austin, TX, then in the lab of Criss Hartzell at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, where she also held her first faculty position. She moved her lab to Simon Fraser University in 2000. Quarmby's research has been aimed at understanding the signals and mechanisms of deflagellation, the process by which cells shed their cilia into the environment. Cilia are found on most eukaryotic cells and on most cells in the human body, and defects in a cell's ability to form or maintain its cilia can cause diseases known as ciliopathies, that may include symptoms such as cystic kidney disease, blindness, and obesity. Through her research using the single- celled ciliated green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model organism, Quarmby identified members of the NIMA-related family of serine/threonine kinases that function in deflagellation as well as in the assembly and maintenance of cilia. Her group went on to show that NEK8 localizes to cilia, and that mutations in NEK8 interfere with its ciliary localization and cause a severe juvenile cystic kidney disease known as nephronophthisis, underscoring the important link between cilia and cystic kidney disease. Quarmby's work has been funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), and the Kidney Foundation of Canada (KFoC). In 2011 NSERC recognized Quarmby's research program by awarding her a Discovery Accelerator Supplement, a funding program reserved for researchers who show strong potential to become international leaders within their field. Quarmby is known for outstanding undergraduate teaching, and received a SFU Teaching Excellence Award in 2011. Quarmby was the co-recipient of the 2015 Nora and Ted Sterling Prize in Support of Controversy. Personal life Quarmby lives in Burnaby, British Columbia. She is a painter, and her science-inspired art has been featured in the magazine The Scientist. Her adult son, Jacob Sheehy, lives in Toronto Ontario, where he runs a company called PressureNET. Advocacy and politics In May 2010, Quarmby wrote an op-ed in the Ottawa Citizen on gender equality in Canadian science and technology, after the Canada Excellence Research Chairs program did not select any women scientists for the nineteen awards it handed out. This prompted the Vancouver Sun to name her one of 100 BC \\"Women of Influence\\" in 2010. She has been an active member of the American Society for Cell Biology's Women in Cell Biology Committee throughout her career. Quarmby has maintained a blog called The Crux on which she has written on the process of science and the state of science funding in Canada, with guest posts on a variety of science and climate issues. Her work has been featured on the literary blog Numero Cinq. More recently, Quarmby has been an advocate for action on climate change. In May 2012, she joined the group Voters Taking Action on Climate Change (VTACC) in an anti-coal protest in which they blockaded a coal train carrying coal from Wyoming to Deltaport for export overseas. Thirteen protesters, including Quarmby, were arrested for trespassing under the Railway Safety Act. She was a featured speaker at the People's Climate March in Vancouver, BC. In November 2014, while Quarmby was involved in the protests of the Trans Mountain Oil Pipeline, she was arrested for civil contempt. The charges were dismissed after it was discovered that she and other protestors had not actually crossed the line prohibited by the court because of a mix-up about GPS coordinates used in the relevant court order. In December 2014, Quarmby announced that she would be seeking the Green Party of Canada nomination in Burnaby North—Seymour for the upcoming federal election. She was confirmed as the candidate in January 2015, and placed fourth, with five percent of the vote.

Having served for most of his career as a Physical Training Instructor, he was the Chief of the Air Staff's Warrant Officer from 2014 until 2016. He was, therefore, the most senior member of the other ranks of the RAF. Early life Martland was born in 1968. He was educated at Fulwood High School and W. R. Tuson College in Preston, Lancashire. After leaving school, he wanted to either become a Physical Education teacher at a school or a Physical Training Instructor in the military. Military career Martland joined the Royal Air Force in January 1986, aged 17. He completed basic training, and then undertook trade training at RAF Cosford to become a Physical Training Instructor. His first posting was to RAF Church Fenton in North Yorkshire. This was followed by postings to RAF Cosford in Shropshire and RAF Hereford in Herefordshire, and abroad to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. He completed sub-specialisation training as an Exercise Rehabilitation Instructor (ERI) in August 1995. He was then posted to the Defence Medicine Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at RAF Headley Court, Surrey; this would be first of three tours of duty at the DMRC. Having been promoted to sergeant in May 1997, he was posted to the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC) in Colchester. Next, he was posted to RAF Shawbury, where he served as SNCO of the Physical Education Flight. During this latter posting, he also completed an operational tour to the Falkland Islands. He was promoted to flight sergeant in 2005. He then returned to Headley Court where he worked as a teacher of exercise therapy and kinesiology. In June 2007, he moved to RAF Brize Norton to take command of the base gymnasium. During the posting, he completed a Bachelor of Science Honours degree in sports rehabilitation. Martland was promoted to warrant officer in June 2010. He then returned for a third time to Headley Court, this time as a Trade Specialist advisor to the centre's Exercise Rehabilitation Instructors. During this posting, he was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick. In October 2012, he returned to RAF Brize Norton as the station warrant officer (SWO). On 20 October 2014, he took up the appointment of Chief of the Air Staff's Warrant Officer (CASWO). The holder of this appointment is the most senior warrant officer, and therefore other ranks, of the Royal Air Force; and accordingly, the most senior airman in the country. He stepped down as CASWO in 2016 and was succeeded by Jon Crossley. =Commissioned officer= On 13 October 2016, Martland was granted a commission and made a flight lieutenant. He was promoted to squadron leader on 14 May 2018. Honours During his posting to RAF Brize Norton between 2007 and 2010, Martland was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.

During this time, he also participated in an oceanographical expedition to the North West Indian Ocean, in the Egyptian Steamer 'Mabahiss'. 1938-1943 Moved to Denmark with Hildur and their son Ingolf Crossland (1929-2020, born in Paea, Tahiti), continuing scientific work at the University of Copenhagen's Zoological Museum until his death. Crossland discovered over one hundred new species; two genera and around twenty-five species are named after him. Including small notes, he published about fifty titles, thirty of which are purely scientific in nature. Crossland's interest in protozoa, begun during his years as assistant to McIntosh, continued throughout his career. He published seven papers on protozoa, all concerning species from the Red Sea, East Africa, Zanzibar the Maldives and the Cape Verde Islands. However, Crossland is best known for his influential work on corals and coral reefs, including his important paper 'On Forskals's Collection of Corals in the Zoological Museum of Copenhagen', and his ecological studies of Zanzibar, Tahiti and the Red Sea.

Accessed February 22, 2020.\\"Marsh Creek – Ancient Stratigraphy at a Windmiller site – April 2010.\\" Sacramento Archaeological Society, Inc. Accessed March 5, 2017. History Archaeologists have found that Native Americans lived in the East Contra Costa County area at least 7,000 years ago. Some of the groups identified with the area are the Volvone and the Miwoks. Excavations have turned up human remains and other historical items that confirm this. Some burial sites have been identified. The park planners intend to protect these cultural sites that lie within the park boundaries. State Park Senior Archaeologist, Rick Fitzgerald, led a group of Sacramento archaeologists on a tour of a Marsh Creek archaeology site on April 10, 2010. According to the Marsh Creek State Park General Plan and Program Environmental Impact Report, \\"The archaeological resources at Marsh Creek State Park are some of the most unique and important within the California State Park System. Research has indicated that the first inhabitants occupied the area by at least 7,000 years ago. At about 4,000 years ago the Windmiller culture made its first appearance at Marsh Creek. The Windmiller people represent one of the most sophisticated and advanced pre-historic cultures of aboriginal California. They lived up and down the Central Valley, with their heartland being the Delta region. These findings are important because they shed light on a rare and unique manifestation of a pre-historic culture in California seldom seen in the archaeological record. Statewide, less than ten Windmiller sites have been identified and fewer have been excavated. The Windmiller occupation eventually gave way to what is called the Meganos people, who carried on the Windmiller culture until about 1,000 years ago. Evidence of these people also exists at the Park.\\"Marsh Creek State Park General Plan and Program Environmental Impact Report,\\" California Department of Parks & Recreation/City of Brentwood, California, January 2012.

John Marsh House, ca. 1856 John Marsh house, ca. 1870 A highlight of the park is the home of John Marsh, which was begun in 1853 and completed in 1856, and which has been undergoing extensive renovation for several years. Marsh was the first non-Hispanic white settler to live in the county. The property encompassed by Marsh Creek State Park was part of Rancho Los Meganos, (Los Meganos is a Spanish phrase meaning \\"sand dunes\\"), which Marsh acquired in 1838. Initially, Marsh lived in a four-room adobe house which had been built on the property for him by local Miwok Indians. Marsh apparently got along well with the Miwoks and had even provided them with free medical care. In return, the tribesmen built the adobe house. Hartley, Samie. \\"Polishing East County’s hidden jewel.\\" Brentwood Press. August 21, 2012. Retrieved January 29, 2015. After he married Abby Tuck in 1851, he retained San Francisco architect Thomas Boyd to design a grand new mansion. Many of the features apparently were stipulated by Marsh himself. John's wife, Abby, had selected the site for the house along Marsh Creek. The new Gothic Revival style house was three stories high and had an observation tower that rose into the air. Marsh built the tower so that he could see the approach of strangers from a great distance. Rustlers and marauders frequently came to his ranch to steal cattle or steal other valuables. However, the stone tower proved vulnerable to earthquakes. The original tower collapsed during the 1868 Hayward earthquake. It was rebuilt with wood, but the replacement collapsed again after the 1906 quake. Images from the Historical American Building Survey (HABS) collection in the Library of Congress shown here depict the differences in the two structures. This house is the earliest substantial building in Contra Costa County that was not built entirely of adobe. The Marsh mansion soon became known as the \\"Stone House\\" because the walls were covered with locally quarried sandstone. Abby died in 1855, before the house was finished. It was still not quite complete when John moved from the adobe house into one of the upstairs bedrooms in the new house about the first of September in 1856. John was murdered while returning from a trip to Martinez, California on September 24, 1856.Colbruno, Michael. \\"Lives of the Dead: Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.\\" December 12, 2009.

Charles was John's son by John's first marriage. Neither Charles nor Alice lived in the house after the parents died; the building began to suffer from neglect.

Neither company had any particular use for the house and spent little on maintenance. The south wall collapsed more than 20 years ago, and a part of the west wall collapsed more recently. Cracks suggested that the north wall could fall soon, and that stabilization of the house was a priority, if the house were to be saved. The roof also needed to be replaced.Metz, Gene. \\"Saving the John Marsh House:Part II.\\" Delta Living Magazine. July – September 2013. pp. 26–27. Retrieved February 1, 2015. In 1960, Henry Cowell donated the house to Contra Costa County. In 1979, ownership passed to the California State Parks Department.

Description of Marsh House The Marsh house is in area by to the ridge of the roof. The roof has four large dormers, so that the third story is full height. The tower is tall. A wide portico surrounds the house on three sides. Full-length French windows allow access from the portico to each room on the first and second floors. The house has an exterior wall covered with buff-colored sandstone. Inside the stone there was a void, then another wall built of adobe brick. The first floor contained a stair hall that ran from the front door to the rear door, a parlor, dining room, office and kitchen. The parlor is by high. The second level has the master bedroom located directly above the parlor and accesses to the top level of the portico. There are two other bedrooms and a bath on the second level that access the stair hall. Another stair leads to the third level, which contains three more rooms. A ladder leads from the third floor hall to the tower parapet. Development plans Marsh Creek Reservoir in the park. Creation of a visitor center, trailheads, picnic areas, parking, equestrian facilities, campsites and accommodations for special events, such as a farmers market are all under consideration for future development. Restoration of the Stone House will soon begin, largely funded by the California Cultural Historic Endowment and matching donations from the John Marsh Historic Trust. Construction of a replica of Marsh's original four-room adobe house is also under consideration.\\"About us: Our Vision.\\" Retrieved January 28, 2015. The park land contains some historic Native American burial sites. Larry Myers, a representative of the California Native American Heritage Commission, urged state park officials to keep the burial sites off-limits to the public. The General Plan calls for of trails, an Primary Historic Zone that contains the Stone House, the replica of Marsh's adobe house, and the replica Ohlone village (representing that which was originally located near Marsh's adobe house.)

In 1923, the GNoSR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway and at nationalisation in 1948 became part of British Railways. The line was recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" and closed on 6 May 1968. History =Background= In 1881, the Great North of Scotland Railway put a bill to parliament to extend its Portsoy line along the Moray Firth as far as Buckie. In 1882, the Great North of Scotland applied for permission to build a line from Portsoy following the coast to Buckie and then running on to Elgin. =Great North of Scotland Railway= The GNoSR station opened as 'Portknockie' on 1 May 1886 with the central section of the coast line, served by through Aberdeen to Elgin trains.

Only two were built but one was still flying over sixty years later. Design and development Despite sharing the name Pinocchio, the CP-20 was a completely different design from Claude Piel's first aircraft, the CP-10 Pinocchio. The CP-20 is a conventional low wing cantilever monoplane whereas the CP-10 was a Pou-du-Ciel style tandem wing design; it did inherit the CP-10's rudder, wheels and firewall. The centre section of the Pinocchio's wing is rectangular in plan and the outer panels are semi-elliptical. It has broad-chord ailerons but no flaps. The fuselage is almost flat sided and bottomed but with raised, rounded decking behind the single seat cockpit and canopy. A view of the fuselage during a reconstruction project The empennage is conventional, with tapered horizontal surfaces mounted near the top of the fuselage and a curved fin carrying a broad, balanced rudder. The rudder extends down to the keel, so the elevators are cut away to allow its movement. The Pinocchio has a wide track tail wheel/skid undercarriage with main wheels on vertical, cantilever legs from the wings. Only two Pinocchios were built. The first had a converted Volkswagen litre engine. The second, built by Pierre Bordini, was originally designated the CP-210 and was powered by a Salmson 9 AD engine. In July 1961 it became the CP-211, with the same Salmson engine but with a one-piece sliding canopy and more raked screen, faired landing legs and a tailwheel rather than a skid, greater fuel capacity, and a cropped vertical tail. Its time as the CP-211 was brief, for at the end of 1961 it became the CP-212, fitted with a Continental A-65 air-cooled flat-four engine. Operational history In 1951 the CP-20 won the 4th RSA Cup, flown at Montargis. During the 1960s the CP-212 had several owners but its certificate expired in 1970. In the 1990s it was restored and eventually re-registered in October 2001 as the CP-215. It remained on the French civil register in 2014.

Fought between 13 and 16 December 1960, the battle ended with General Phoumi Nosavan winning control of the Kingdom of Laos with the aid of the Royal Thai Government and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Vientiane was left devastated by the fighting, with about 600 civilian dead, about the same number of homes destroyed, and 7,000 left homeless. The losing Forces Armées Neutralistes under Captain Kong Le retreated onto the strategic Plain of Jars, to begin an uneasy coexistence with the Pathet Lao and the invading People's Army of Vietnam. With the northeastern quarter of Laos under communist control, the United States and the Kingdom of Thailand deepened their involvement in the Laotian Civil War. Overview Beginning on 23 December 1950, the United States began military aid to the French administration of the Kingdom of Laos as they fought the First Indochina War. U.S. support would increase to the point of underwriting the Lao budget in its entirety. The rationale behind the support was that it was in American interests to combat the communist insurrectionists in Laos. Banned by treaty from stationing an overt Military Assistance Advisory Group in Laos, in December 1955 the U.S instead chose to establish a \\"civilian\\" military aid office within the U.S. embassy in Vientiane. The Programs Evaluation Office was charged with channeling the materiel to the Lao military.Castle, pp. 9–20. Of the 68 ethnic minorities that comprised the Lao population, the Lao Loum numerically predominated. They dwelt along the Mekong River Valley along the southern border with the Kingdom of Thailand. The King of Laos and most of the ruling class of Laos were Lao Loum. About 20 of these influential lowland Lao families actually controlled Laos.Castle, pp. 5, 20, 141. Background Capital Kong Le was an American-trained paratrooper considered one of the more aggressive Lao officers. On 29 July 1959, he led his unit, Bataillon Parachutistes 2 (Paratroop Battalion 2) in a futile attempt to reinforce other Royalist troops engaged with the Pathet Lao in armed disputes over Royalist outposts in Xam Neua Province. Kong Le and his men were disgruntled by the RLA's failure to pay them while they were on the combat sweep.Conboy, Morrison, p. 31. Subsequently, on 25 December 1959, Kong Le and his disaffected paratroopers would supply the muscle for General Phoumi Nosavan's coup. Phoumi became the Defense Minister and the de facto ruler of Laos. When matters worsened for the airborne troops, Kong Le led his mutinous paratroop battalion in a nearly bloodless coup on 9 August 1960. Once he gained control of his national capital of Vientiane, he deposed the Royal Lao Government. The Minister of Defense, General Phoumi Nosavan, was his only real opposition. As the captain solidified his grip on the Kingdom of Laos, Phoumi settled into Savannakhet in southern Laos to gather forces to support a counter- coup.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 32–38. Prelude =Movement to contact= At 08:00 on 21 November 1960, Phoumi Nosavan's army moved from Savannakhet into the offensive. Its mission was to march northward on Route 13 along the eastern bank of the Mekong River some hundreds of kilometers and seize the capital. Groupement Mobile B (Mobile Group B) led off, with two M-24 tanks and six armored cars, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tiao (Prince) Ekarath Souvannarot. In trail to GMB was Groupement Tactique (Tactical Group), a mixed force of paratroopers from Bataillon Parachustistes 1 (Paratroop Battalion 1), two infantry battalions, a volunteer battalion, and a contingent of artillery from 1st Field Artillery Group. A third contingent, Major Siho Lamphouthacoul's Groupement Mobile Special 1 (Special Mobile Group 1) containing Bataillon Speciale 11 (Special Battalion 11) and Bataillon Speciale 33 (Special Battalion 33) boarded landing craft to be transported northward on the Mekong River. On 22 November, the Central Intelligence Agency flew in five five-man commando teams from the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit (PARU). Each team contained two officers, a medic, and two radiomen. PARU Teams A and B would join the head of the column. Teams D and E would trail the movement. Team C would flank the movement to the east, at Khamkeut. They supplied added communication and control capability to the column, and advised on ways to circumvent any opposing strongpoints.Warner, p. 29.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 37–42. By 25 November, the three Groupements converged on Thakhek, approximately 135 kilometers north of Savannakhet.Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 21 January 2015. They continued north toward Paksan, some 190 kilometers further.Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 22 January 2015. On 5 December, they blasted their way across the Nam Kading (Kading River) just south of Paksan without opposition. At the same time, PARU Team C and Bataillon Volontaires 32 (Volunteer Battalion 32) shifted eastward to their flanking position at Khamkeut. Elements of Kong Le's Bataillon Parachutistes 2 had chased pro- Phoumi forces from Paksan on 22 September and still occupied it.Conboy, Morrison, p. 36. Faced with a new threat to this bastion, Kong Le rushed additional troops from Vientiane some 150 kilometers to Paksan to reinforce it against the arrival of Phoumi's troops.Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 22 January 2015. Some residual anti-Kong Le forces led by Colonel Kouprasith Abhay emerged in the power vacuum this left, bidding for control of the capital, and the parachutist reinforcements had to be returned to the capital. As a result, Phoumi's assault element suffered no serious opposition, and rolled into Paksan. At the same time, the BP 1 paratroopers who were on Phoumi's side were airdropped on the Royal Lao Army headquarters at Chinimao, on the verge of the capital. Suspicious of Kouprasith's ambitions, Phoumi appointed Brigadier General Bounleut Sanichanh as commander-in-chief of the counter-coup forces. At 10:30 on 10 December 1960, representatives of Kong Le departed for Hanoi to formalize a pact between Kong Le's Forces Armees Neutralistes (Neutral Armed Forces) and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). At 09:00 the following day, a dozen PAVN artillery advisers landed in Vientiane and unloaded half a dozen 122mm mortars and four 105mm howitzers to reinforce FAN, thus beginning a Soviet-backed airlift. Meanwhile, a scratch force of Phoumists launched a flanking movement from Savannakhet through Thailand to Chinimao. Kong Le spent 11 and 12 December trying to whip up the Vientiane citizenry's support for FAN. Phoumi's forces had pushed through Paksan and were crossing the Nam Ngum (Ngum River) only 50 kilometers from Vientiane. GMS 1 was slated to circle north of the capital and close in on Wattay Airbase in Vientiane's western outskirts. GM B would drive straight down Route 13 to hook up with Kouprasith's troops in Chinaimo.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 40–43. Battle =Fighting for Vientiane= The battle for Vientiane began at 13:20 on 13 December 1960 with an advance by Phoumi's forces. They launched an infantry battalion into the capital even as they linked up with the troops at Chinamao. Simultaneously, Kouprasith's loyalists were led by BP 1 paratroopers in an attack on the city that stalled at the city limits under inaccurate howitzer fire. Both of the Phoumist columns stalled at the eastern municipal limits under heavy-weapons fire from FAN troops. Both sides failed to close for combat, settling on direct fire by crew served weapons and point-blank artillery. Entire neighborhoods of local huts were set aflame. When night came, the two sides settled in under a moonless sky.Warner, p. 33. The following day's fighting would severely damage Vientiane. PAVN shelling in the morning of 14 December pushed Kouprasith's troops back into Camp Chinamiao, where Kouprasith languished in a sickbed. With PAVN artillery support, Phoumi's troops forced Kong Le's troops to the western and northern fringes of the city. By 15:00, the central district was in ruins; fallen trees and loose electrical wires littered the street. The National Treasury had been looted and burned. The post office and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma's office were flattened. Wattay Airbase fell under Phoumi's control, and the Soviet military aid airlifts to Kong Le's forces halted.Anthony, Sexton, p. 34. During the battle, the Ministry of Defense came under fire; both .50 caliber machine guns and a recoilless rifle were among the weapons engaged. The American embassy next door took an artillery shell in the ceiling of its old chancellor building, setting the CIA office afire.Ahern, p. 23. Based on reports of the fighting, American Joint Task Force 116, afloat in the South China Sea, was placed on four-hour alert. The U.S. 2d Airborne Battle Group was also alerted, for possible seizure of Lao airfields. Uneasy darkness again fell on Vientiane. All was quiet except the dueling radio stations broadcasting propaganda from both sides. That night, four Royal Thai Army 105mm howitzers were smuggled across the Mekong into Chinamiao, with one of them becoming embarrassingly stuck in Mekong sand until it was freed at dawn. At 11:30 on 15 December, GMS 1 entered Vientiane from the north, only to be stopped by PAVN artillery and small arms fire from Wattay. At 13:30, Kouprasith sent 80 troops in an attempted amphibious landing to cut off Kong Le's retreat, but the waterborne force overshot its objective. Meantime, BP 1 paratroopers loyal to Phoumi moved door to door hunting down Kong Le's BP 2 paratroopers who had been isolated, but continued to snipe away. As evening came, a calm fell again, again broken only by the radio broadcasts. On 16 December, the contending forces warred incoherently over individual blocks of buildings and single streets. The two sides distinguished themselves from one another by the color of scarfs worn with their uniforms; now and then, the combatants switched scarves and sides. However, by afternoon, Phoumi's and Kouprasith's superior weight of forces prevailed. Kong Le's men were pushed back into Wattay. PAVN gunners wanted to level the entirety of Vientiane. Instead, Kong Le loaded up his 1,200 troops and retreated northwards toward the Plain of Jars, accompanied by the PAVN artillerists, a single tank, and a few captives. A couple of sections of 60mm mortars covered the withdrawal, holding up the Phoumist advance until late in the day. The devastated city they left had suffered at least 600 houses destroyed, about an equal number of citizens killed, and 7,000 left homeless; however, the Neutralists' fighting ability remained intact. Kong Le's forces had suffered only 17 killed.Savada, pp. 51–52 =Retreat to the Plain of Jars= As victors Phoumi and Kouprasith kept a suspicious eye on one another, cholera threatened the Lao city's populace. A 19 December airlift began medical aid flights to obviate the menace of a cholera epidemic. Concealed within this air contingent was a C-47 from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. Colonel Nguyễn Khánh and Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu spent a day discussing possible joint South Vietnamese/Lao operations against the PAVN on Route 9 in the Lao panhandle, concluding that the situation was too unsettled to conclude anything. Kong Le continued his northward withdrawal on Route 13 with his forces; they blew up the bridge over the Nam Lik (Lik River) to cover their retirement. His Pathet Lao allies sent 1,000 men southward on Route 13 to Moung Kassy, some 40 kilometers north of his position at Vang Vieng. However, Kong Le drove his convoy of vehicles past them to capture the Route 13/7 intersection at Sala Phou Khoun, leaving the Pathet Lao at Vang Vieng as a rear guard. Faking a feint up Route 13 north to assault Luang Prabang, Kong Le instead led FAN eastwards onto the Plain of Jars, surmounting the obstacles of fallen trees blocking Route 7. As FAN approached the all-weather airfield at Muang Soui, the Hmong guerrilla company that had felled the trees dispersed into the countryside. Their commanding officer radioed that two battalions of paratroopers were drifting down upon the airfield; then he also fled.Anthony, Sexton, p. 39. For two weeks after Kong Le left Vientiane, the American embassy urged Phoumi to take up pursuit. On 30 December, he outlined a plan prophetic of the future Operation Triangle.Conboy, Morrison, p. 111. Not knowing that FAN had departed from the Route 7/13 junction, Phoumi planned to have columns closing in on it from all three directions: from Luang Prabang to the north; from Vientiane on the south; from the Plain of Jars to the east.Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 22 January 2015. By this time, Kong Le's column was spilling onto the Plain of Jars from Muang Soui. Further east on Route 7, on 31 December, at Nong Het on the Vietnamese border, 60 Pathet Lao soldiers backed by PAVN cadre attacked a single company Royalist garrison from Bataillon Volontaires 21 (Volunteer Battalion 21). The garrison's call to Headquarters Military Region 2 for reinforcements somehow become a MR 2 report of a seven battalion communist invasion force. Royalist battalions residing near Route 7 on the Plain of Jars drifted south out of FAN's path, avoiding battle.Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 22 January 2015. Only Lieutenant Colonel Vang Pao's irregular military offered resistance as they withdrew in an orderly fashion. By the end of the first week of 1961, FAN had linked up with about five PAVN battalions invading Laos. Aftermath On 19 January 1961, as U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower turned over his office to the newly elected John F. Kennedy, he was influenced to brief the incoming president about the importance of Laos to the domino theory.Anthony, Sexton, p. 40. Kong Le and his newly formed Forces Armee Neutraliste (Neutralist Armed Force) would succeed in withdrawing northward to the strategic Plain of Jars and capturing it, suffering only three killed and ten wounded in the process.Conboy, Morrison, p. 45. The vital road junction of Routes 7 and 13 remained in FAN custody.Ahern, p. 52. The central position of the Plain of Jars in northeastern Laos granted Kong Le effective control of the countryside from Vang Vieng to Xam Neua. The Royalists and their American backers were left with two possible methods of resisting FAN—air power and Hmong guerrillas. Operation Millpond was established to supply the air power;Castle, pp. 34–35. ten AT-6 Texans for the Royal Lao Air Force, and training for pilots to man them, would be jointly supplied by the Thais and Americans.Anthony, Sexton, p. 35. Eventually, the first Thai mercenary pilots were included in this program.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 37, 39. A training program for Hmong guerrillas was also established via the CIA.Ahern, pp. 27–34. When a Thai request to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for intervention was declined on 27 March 1961, the Thais would begin wholesale training of Lao troops within Thailand.Castle, pp. 36–37.

Well known in many lands through their fine performances and records, they have adopted a philosophy to their music which, apart from technique, relies to a large extent on instinct. The Celtic 'More', or instinct, one link with the ancient past which can guide the treatment of an old song today. Their interpretations are creative in the broadest sense, and sincere, in that they compose what they feel is 'naturally' right. They take their music seriously, but are not afraid to have a good laugh with their audience. People are important to them and if they have brought an audience down with a sad ballad, will cheer them up again with something else. This after all is what music is about; expression, entertainment, stories told, battles recalled, bizarre, situations recounted and above all the enjoyment of doing it.

Until 2009, he played for the Gibraltar national football team before they were members of UEFA, playing in unrecognised friendlies as well as the Island Games.BBC SPORT  Football  Madeira win small nations event He briefly came out of retirement in the 2016–17 season to play for Olympique 13 in the Gibraltar Second Division, making 7 appearances for the club before leaving in March 2017 after accepting an offer from the Gibraltar FA to manage the newly established Gibraltar national under-21 football team, ahead of their debut appearance in the upcoming qualification campaign for the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Italy and San Marino. Aaron Asquez is a member The Gibraltar FA veterans teams, which takes part in charity games, primarily against British military teams stationed on the overseas territory. Management career Upon his initial retirement from football in 2010, Asquez was appointed as assistant manager at Manchester 62 F.C. He remained in the role for 3 years until becoming manager for the 2013–14 season. However, after two seasons in charge, he stepped down from management to return to his role as assistant to David Ochello. In 2016, he was appointed as assistant manager at Olympique 13 while also registering as a player for the first time in 6 years. In 31 March 2017 it was announced that Asquez, who holds a UEFA B coaching license was to be the first manager of the newly established Gibraltar national under-21 football team, with Michael Felice as his Assistant. The Gibraltar FA had been eligible to enter a team since its admittance to UEFA in 2013, however they had opted not to field a side in this age group for undisclosed reasons until 2017. In his first two games as manager of the new Gibraltar age group, he oversaw two 3–0 defeats, to Austria and Armenia. However, on 10 October he became the first manager to win a competitive game with Gibraltar at any level of international football since joining UEFA, when he oversaw a 1–0 win over Macedonia.

It uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos. It can also be used to make one-to-one voice and video calls, and the Android version can optionally function as an SMS app. Signal uses standard cellular telephone numbers as identifiers and secures all communications to other Signal users with end-to-end encryption. The apps include mechanisms by which users can independently verify the identity of their contacts and the integrity of the data channel. All Signal software is free and open-source. Its clients are published under the GPLv3 license, while the server code is published under the AGPLv3 license. The non-profit Signal Foundation was launched in February 2018 with initial funding of $50 million. History =2010–2013: Origins= Signal is the successor of the RedPhone encrypted voice calling app and the TextSecure encrypted texting program. The beta versions of RedPhone and TextSecure were first launched in May 2010 by Whisper Systems, a startup company co-founded by security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson. Whisper Systems also produced a firewall and tools for encrypting other forms of data. All of these were proprietary enterprise mobile security software and were only available for Android. In November 2011, Whisper Systems announced that it had been acquired by Twitter. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed by either company. The acquisition was done \\"primarily so that Mr. Marlinspike could help the then- startup improve its security\\". Shortly after the acquisition, Whisper Systems' RedPhone service was made unavailable. Some criticized the removal, arguing that the software was \\"specifically targeted [to help] people under repressive regimes\\" and that it left people like the Egyptians in \\"a dangerous position\\" during the events of the Egyptian revolution of 2011. Twitter released TextSecure as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license in December 2011. RedPhone was also released under the same license in July 2012. Marlinspike later left Twitter and founded Open Whisper Systems as a collaborative Open Source project for the continued development of TextSecure and RedPhone. =2013–2018: Open Whisper Systems= Open Whisper Systems' website was launched in January 2013. In February 2014, Open Whisper Systems introduced the second version of their TextSecure Protocol (now Signal Protocol), which added end-to-end encrypted group chat and instant messaging capabilities to TextSecure. Toward the end of July 2014, they announced plans to unify the RedPhone and TextSecure applications as Signal. This announcement coincided with the initial release of Signal as a RedPhone counterpart for iOS. The developers said that their next steps would be to provide TextSecure instant messaging capabilities for iOS, unify the RedPhone and TextSecure applications on Android, and launch a web client. Signal was the first iOS app to enable easy, strongly encrypted voice calls for free. TextSecure compatibility was added to the iOS application in March 2015. From its launch in May 2010 until March 2015, the Android version of Signal (then called TextSecure) included support for encrypted SMS/MMS messaging. From version 2.7.0 onward, the Android application only supported sending and receiving encrypted messages via the data channel. Reasons for this included security flaws of SMS/MMS and problems with the key exchange. Open Whisper Systems' abandonment of SMS/MMS encryption prompted some users to create a fork named Silence (initially called SMSSecure) that is meant solely for the exchange of encrypted SMS and MMS messages. In November 2015, the TextSecure and RedPhone applications on Android were merged to become Signal for Android. A month later, Open Whisper Systems announced Signal Desktop, a Chrome app that could link with a Signal mobile client. At launch, the app could only be linked with the Android version of Signal. On September 26, 2016, Open Whisper Systems announced that Signal Desktop could now be linked with the iOS version of Signal as well. On October 31, 2017, Open Whisper Systems announced that the Chrome app was deprecated. At the same time, they announced the release of a standalone desktop client (based on the Electron framework) for Windows, MacOS and certain Linux distributions. On October 4, 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Open Whisper Systems published a series of documents revealing that OWS had received a subpoena requiring them to provide information associated with two phone numbers for a federal grand jury investigation in the first half of 2016. Only one of the two phone numbers was registered on Signal, and because of how the service is designed, OWS was only able to provide \\"the time the user's account had been created and the last time it had connected to the service\\". Along with the subpoena, OWS received a gag order requiring OWS not to tell anyone about the subpoena for one year. OWS approached the ACLU, and they were able to lift part of the gag order after challenging it in court. OWS said it was the first time they had received a subpoena, and that they were committed to treat \\"any future requests the same way\\". In March 2017, Open Whisper Systems transitioned Signal's calling system from RedPhone to WebRTC, also adding the ability to make video calls with the mobile apps. =2018–present: Signal Messenger= On February 21, 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is \\"to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal’s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous.\\" The foundation was started with an initial $50 million in funding from Acton, who had left WhatsApp's parent company Facebook in September 2017. According to the announcement, Acton is the foundation's Executive Chairman and Marlinspike continues as the CEO of Signal Messenger. Between November 2019 and February 2020, Signal added support for iPads, view-once images and videos, stickers, and reactions. They also announced plans for a new group messaging system and an \\"experimental method for storing encrypted contacts in the cloud.\\" Signal's popularity in the United States has reportedly increased substantially due to the George Floyd protests, particularly among organizers and activists. In June 2020, Signal Foundation co-founder Moxie Marlinspike announced the release of a feature that enables users to blur faces in photos. This new feature was launched after U.S. authorities increased their efforts to monitor the protests. Features Signal allows users to make one-to-one voice and video calls to other Signal users on iOS, Android, and desktop. All calls are made over a Wi-Fi or data connection and (with the exception of data fees) are free of charge, including long distance and international. Signal also allows users to send text messages, files, voice notes, pictures, GIFs, and video messages over a Wi-Fi or data connection to other Signal users on iOS, Android and a desktop app. The app also supports group messaging. All communications to other Signal users are automatically end-to-end encrypted. The keys that are used to encrypt the user's communications are generated and stored at the endpoints (i.e. by users, not by servers). To verify that a correspondent is really the person that they claim to be, Signal users can compare key fingerprints (or scan QR codes) out-of-band. The app employs a trust-on-first- use mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent's key changes. On Android, users can opt into making Signal the default SMS/MMS application, allowing them to send and receive unencrypted SMS messages in addition to the standard end-to-end encrypted Signal messages. Users can then use the same application to communicate with contacts who do not have Signal. Sending a message unencrypted is also available as an override between Signal users.https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/212535548-How-do-I-send-an- insecure-SMS- TextSecure allowed the user to set a passphrase that encrypted the local message database and the user's encryption keys. This did not encrypt the user's contact database or message timestamps. The Signal applications on Android and iOS can be locked with the phone's pin, passphrase, or biometric authentication. The user can define a \\"screen lock timeout\\" interval, providing an additional protection mechanism in case the phone is lost or stolen. Signal also allows users to set timers to messages. After a specified time interval, the messages will be deleted from both the sender's and the receivers' devices. The time interval can be between five seconds and one week long, and the timer begins for each recipient once they have read their copy of the message. The developers have stressed that this is meant to be \\"a collaborative feature for conversations where all participants want to automate minimalist data hygiene, not for situations where your contact is your adversary\\". Signal excludes users' messages from non-encrypted cloud backups by default. Signal has support for read receipts and typing indicators, both of which can be disabled. Signal allows users to automatically blur faces of people in photos to protect their identities. Limitations Signal requires that the user provides a phone number for verification, eliminating the need for user names or passwords and facilitating contact discovery (see below). The number does not have to be the same as on the device's SIM card; it can also be a VoIP number or a landline as long as the user can receive the verification code and have a separate device to set up the software. A number can only be registered on one mobile device at a time. This mandatory connection to a phone number (a feature Signal shares with WhatsApp, KakaoTalk, and others) has been criticized as a \\"major issue\\" for privacy-conscious users who are not comfortable with giving out their private phone number. A workaround is to use a secondary phone number. The option to choose a public, changeable username instead of sharing one's phone number with everyone they message (or share a group with) is a widely requested feature, which as of June 2020 has not yet been implemented. Signal in 2019 announced plans to implement this feature, overcoming the challenges associated with storing users' social graphs by using what they called Secure Value Recovery (SVR). This allows users to client-side encrypt their Signal contacts with an alphanumeric passphrase (which Signal calls a PIN) and uses Intel SGX to limit the number of passphrase guesses, alleviating the risk of server-side brute-force attempts. Cryptography expert Matthew D. Green described this method as \\"sophisticated work,\\" but also expressed concerns that the data the system was protecting should not rely on the security of SGX, which has been repeatedly broken. Using phone numbers as identifiers may also create security risks that arise from the possibility of an attacker taking over a phone number. This can be mitigated by enabling an optional Registration Lock PIN in Signal's privacy settings. =Android- specific= From February 2014 to February 2017, Signal's official Android client required the proprietary Google Play Services because the app was dependent on Google's GCM push-messaging framework. In March 2015, Signal moved to a model of handling the app's message delivery themselves and only using GCM for a wakeup event. In February 2017, Signal's developers implemented WebSocket support into the client, making it possible for it to be used without Google Play Services. =Desktop-specific= Setting up Signal's desktop app requires that the user first install Signal on an Android or iOS based smartphone with an Internet connection. Once the desktop app has been linked to the user's account, it will function as an independent client; the mobile app does not need to be present or online. Users can link up to 5 desktop apps to their account. Usability In July 2016, the Internet Society published a user study that assessed the ability of Signal users to detect and deter man-in-the-middle attacks. The study concluded that 21 out of 28 participants failed to correctly compare public key fingerprints in order to verify the identity of other Signal users, and that the majority of these users still believed they had succeeded, while in reality they failed. Four months later, Signal's user interface was updated to make verifying the identity of other Signal users simpler. Before version 4.17, the Signal Android client could only make plain text-only backups of the message history, i.e. without media messages. On February 26, 2018, Signal added support for \\"full backup/restore to SD card\\", and as of version 4.17, users are able to restore their entire message history when switching to a new Android phone. On June 09, 2020, the Signal iOS client added the ability to transfer all Signal information from an old iOS device to a new one. The transfer is done wirelessly over a local connection between the two devices and is end-to-end encrypted. Architecture =Encryption protocols= Signal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol (formerly known as the TextSecure Protocol). The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and a Triple Diffie-Hellman (3XDH) handshake. It uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC- SHA256 as primitives. The protocol provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy (aka future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity. It does not provide anonymity preservation, and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material. The Signal Protocol also supports end-to-end encrypted group chats. The group chat protocol is a combination of a pairwise double ratchet and multicast encryption. In addition to the properties provided by the one-to-one protocol, the group chat protocol provides speaker consistency, out-of-order resilience, dropped message resilience, computational equality, trust equality, subgroup messaging, as well as contractible and expandable membership. In October 2014, researchers from Ruhr University Bochum published an analysis of the Signal Protocol. Among other findings, they presented an unknown key-share attack on the protocol, but in general, they found that it was secure. In October 2016, researchers from UK's University of Oxford, Queensland University of Technology in Australia, and Canada's McMaster University published a formal analysis of the protocol. They concluded that the protocol was cryptographically sound. In July 2017, researchers from Ruhr University Bochum found during another analysis of group messengers a purely theoretic attack against the group protocol of Signal: A user who knows the secret group ID of a group (due to having been a group member previously or stealing it from a member's device) can become a member of the group. Since the group ID cannot be guessed and such member changes are displayed to the remaining members, this attack is likely to be difficult to carry out without being detected. , the Signal Protocol has been implemented into WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype, and Google Allo, making it possible for the conversations of \\"more than a billion people worldwide\\" to be end-to-end encrypted. In Google Allo, Skype and Facebook Messenger, conversations are not encrypted with the Signal Protocol by default; they only offer end-to-end encryption in an optional mode. Up until March 2017, Signal's voice calls were encrypted with SRTP and the ZRTP key-agreement protocol, which was developed by Phil Zimmermann. , Signal's voice and video calling functionalities use the app's Signal Protocol channel for authentication instead of ZRTP. Authentication To verify that a correspondent is really the person that they claim to be, Signal users can compare key fingerprints (or scan QR codes) out-of-band. The app employs a trust on first use mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent's key changes. =Servers= Signal relies on centralized servers that are maintained by Signal Messenger. In addition to routing Signal's messages, the servers also facilitate the discovery of contacts who are also registered Signal users and the automatic exchange of users' public keys. By default, Signal's voice and video calls are peer-to-peer. If the caller is not in the receiver's address book, the call is routed through a server in order to hide the users' IP addresses. Contact discovery The servers store registered users' phone numbers, public key material and push tokens which are necessary for setting up calls and transmitting messages. In order to determine which contacts are also Signal users, cryptographic hashes of the user's contact numbers are periodically transmitted to the server. The server then checks to see if those match any of the SHA256 hashes of registered users and tells the client if any matches are found. The hashed numbers are thereafter discarded from the server. In 2014, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that it is easy to calculate a map of all possible hash inputs to hash outputs and reverse the mapping because of the limited preimage space (the set of all possible hash inputs) of phone numbers, and that a \\"practical privacy preserving contact discovery remains an unsolved problem.\\" In September 2017, Signal's developers announced that they were working on a way for the Signal client applications to \\"efficiently and scalably determine whether the contacts in their address book are Signal users without revealing the contacts in their address book to the Signal service.\\" Metadata All client- server communications are protected by TLS. In October 2018, Signal deployed a \\"Sealed Sender\\" feature which encrypts the sender's information using the sender and recipient identity keys, and includes it inside the message. With this feature Signal's servers can no longer see who is sending messages to whom. Signal's privacy policy states that any identifiers are only kept on the servers as long as necessary in order to place each call or transmit each message. Signal's developers have asserted that their servers do not keep logs about who called whom and when. In June 2016, Marlinspike told The Intercept that \\"the closest piece of information to metadata that the Signal server stores is the last time each user connected to the server, and the precision of this information is reduced to the day, rather than the hour, minute, and second\\". The group messaging mechanism is designed so that the servers do not have access to the membership list, group title, or group icon. Instead, the creation, updating, joining, and leaving of groups is done by the clients, which deliver pairwise messages to the participants in the same way that one- to-one messages are delivered. Federation Signal's server architecture was federated between December 2013 and February 2016. In December 2013, it was announced that the messaging protocol Signal uses had successfully been integrated into the Android-based open-source operating system CyanogenMod. Since CyanogenMod 11.0, the client logic was contained in a system app called WhisperPush. According to Signal's developers, the Cyanogen team ran their own Signal messaging server for WhisperPush clients, which federated with the main server, so that both clients could exchange messages with each other. The WhisperPush source code was available under the GPLv3 license. In February 2016, the CyanogenMod team discontinued WhisperPush and recommended that its users switch to Signal. In May 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that federation with the CyanogenMod servers had degraded the user experience and held back development, and that their servers will probably not federate with other servers again. In May 2016, Moxie Marlinspike requested that a third-party client called LibreSignal not use the Signal service or the Signal name. As a result, on 24 May 2016 the LibreSignal project posted that the project was \\"abandoned\\". The functionality provided by LibreSignal was subsequently incorporated into Signal by Marlinspike. =Licensing= The complete source code of the Signal clients for Android, iOS and desktop is available on GitHub under a free software license. This enables interested parties to examine the code and help the developers verify that everything is behaving as expected. It also allows advanced users to compile their own copies of the applications and compare them with the versions that are distributed by Signal Messenger. In March 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that, apart from some shared libraries that are not compiled with the project build due to a lack of Gradle NDK support, Signal for Android is reproducible. Signal's servers are also open source. =Distribution= Signal is officially distributed through the Google Play store, Apple's App Store, and the official website. Applications distributed via Google Play are signed by the developer of the application, and the Android operating system checks that updates are signed with the same key, preventing others from distributing updates that the developer themselves did not sign. The same applies to iOS applications that are distributed via Apple's App Store. As of March 2017, the Android version of Signal can also be downloaded as a separate APK package binary from Signal Messenger's website. Reception In October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide. In November 2014, Signal received a perfect score on the EFF's secure messaging scorecard; it received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn't have access to (end- to-end encryption), making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondents' identities, having past communications secure if the keys are stolen (forward secrecy), having the code open to independent review (open source), having the security designs well-documented, and having a recent independent security audit. At the time, \\"ChatSecure + Orbot\\", Pidgin (with OTR), Silent Phone, and Telegram's optional \\"secret chats\\" also received seven out of seven points on the scorecard. On December 28, 2014, Der Spiegel published slides from an internal NSA presentation dating to June 2012 in which the NSA deemed Signal's encrypted voice calling component (RedPhone) on its own as a \\"major threat\\" to its mission, and when used in conjunction with other privacy tools such as Cspace, Tor, Tails, and TrueCrypt was ranked as \\"catastrophic\\", leading to a \\"near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence...\\" Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden has endorsed Signal on multiple occasions. In his keynote speech at SXSW in March 2014, he praised Signal's predecessors (TextSecure and RedPhone) for their ease of use. During an interview with The New Yorker in October 2014, he recommended using \\"anything from Moxie Marlinspike and Open Whisper Systems\\". During a remote appearance at an event hosted by Ryerson University and Canadian Journalists for Free Expression in March 2015, Snowden said that Signal is \\"very good\\" and that he knew the security model. Asked about encrypted messaging apps during a Reddit AMA in May 2015, he recommended Signal. In November 2015, Snowden tweeted that he used Signal \\"every day\\". In September 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union called on officials at the U.S. Capitol to ensure that lawmakers and staff members have secure communications technology. One of the applications that the ACLU recommended in their letter to the Senate Sergeant at Arms and to the House Sergeant at Arms was Signal, writing: In March 2017, Signal was approved by the Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate for use by senators and their staff. Following the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak, Vanity Fair reported that Marc Elias, the general counsel for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, had instructed DNC staffers to exclusively use Signal when saying anything \\"remotely contentious or disparaging\\" about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. In February 2020, the European Commission has recommended that its staff use Signal. Concurrently with the George Floyd protests, Signal was downloaded 121,000 times in the United States between 25 May and 4 June in 2020. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey advised the public to download Signal as protests spread in the US. In July 2020, Signal became the most downloaded app in Hong Kong on both Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store after the passage of the Hong Kong National Security Law. As of 2020, Signal is one of the contact methods to securely provide tips to major news outlets such as Washington Post, The Guardian, New York Times and Wall Street Journal. =Blocking= In December 2016, Egypt blocked access to Signal. In response, Signal's developers added domain fronting to their service. This allows Signal users in a specific country to circumvent censorship by making it look like they are connecting to a different internet-based service. , Signal's domain fronting is enabled by default in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar. , Signal is blocked in Iran. Signal's domain fronting feature relies on the Google App Engine service. This does not work in Iran because Google has blocked Iranian access to GAE in order to comply with U.S. sanctions. In early 2018, Google App Engine made an internal change to stop domain fronting for all countries. Due to this issue, Signal made a public change to use Amazon CloudFront for domain fronting. However, AWS also announced that they would be making changes to their service to prevent domain fronting. As a result, Signal said that they would start investigating new methods/approaches. Signal switched from AWS back to Google in April 2019. Developers and funding The development of Signal and its predecessors at Open Whisper Systems was funded by a combination of consulting contracts, donations and grants. The Freedom of the Press Foundation acted as Signal's fiscal sponsor. Between 2013 and 2016, the project received grants from the Knight Foundation, the Shuttleworth Foundation, and almost $3M from the US-Government sponsored Open Technology Fund. Signal is now developed by Signal Messenger LLC, a software company founded by Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton in 2018, which is wholly owned by a tax-exempt nonprofit corporation called the Signal Technology Foundation, also created by them in 2018. The Foundation was funded with an initial loan of $50 million from Acton, \\"to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal’s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous.\\" All of the organization's products are published as free and open-source software.

Polish 3rd Legions Infantry Division, commanded by General Leon Berbecki, clashed with units of the Soviet 15th Army (General August Kork). The Battle of Brzostowica took place in initial stages of the much larger Battle of the Niemen River. On September 20, 1920, 3rd Legions Infantry Division, which was located on the right wing of Polish Second Army, was ordered to move its main forces to the area of villages of Brzostowica Wielka and Brzostowica Mala. On the second day of the planned Polish offensive, the division was to attack along the axis Brzostowica Wielka - Zaniemiensk, in order to capture bridges over the Niemen river, in Zaniemiensk and Lunna Wola, and create bridgeheads on the eastern bank. Furthermore, it was ordered to capture the rail junction at Mosty, and then to march towards Lida. The 3rd Legions Infantry Division had 7800 soldiers, 41 cannons and 215 heavy machine guns. Morale of the soldiers was very high, as Polish Army was on the offensive. Facing it was Soviet 15th Army of General Kork, with two rifle divisions (11th and 16th), altogether 11,000 soldiers and 60 cannons. In mid- September, Soviet forces in this area were reinforced with highly motivated Communists from St. Petersburg. On September 20, two Polish regiments (commanded by Władysław Bończa-Uzdowski and Wacław Scaevola-Wieczorkiewicz) began their assault on the 11th Soviet Rifle Division. At first Polish offensive was a success, but in the course of time, Soviet resistance hardened. By evening, Polish regiments were halted, unable to seize Brzostowica Wielka before the night. In the morning of September 21, 6th Legions Brigade surprised Soviet 16th Rifle Division, and captured all villages, except for Brzostowica Mala. Soon it was joined by 9th Legions Regiment and 7th Legions Regiment. Near Brzostowica Wielka, the Poles surprised the headquarters of the 11th Rifle Division, wounding its commandant, and capturing 300 prisoners. This paralyzed the division, which since then was unable to operate in a cohesive way. In the afternoon, the 3rd Legions Division regrouped and concentrated its main forces at Brzostowica Wielka. Fighting continued until the evening, when General Kork ordered Soviet 56th Rifle Brigade (3000 soldiers, 54 heavy machine guns) to join the forces near Brzostowica. The well-rested and well-equipped brigade was placed on the right wing of Soviet forces, as Kork wanted to regain the positions along the Swislocz river. The third day of the battle began with stubborn Soviet attacks. The enemy, whose forces were much stronger than Polish, recaptured the villages of Menki and Brzostowiczany. Near the road toward Wolkowysk, Soviet 56th Rifle Brigade entered the fray, attacking Polish 7th Legions Infantry Regiment. The Soviets managed to get into Polish trenches, only to retreat after Polish reinforcements had been called. At 6 p.m., after artillery barrage, Soviet 33rd Rifle Brigade attacked the Poles, but due to concentrated Polish fire, it suffered heavy losses and returned to the starting positions. Soon afterwards, Polish lines were broken near Brzostowica Mala, where 9th Legions Infantry Regiment, attacked by Soviet forces, retreated five kilometers back, towards Swislocz. At the same time, 23rd Infantry Regiment, which was located north of the 9th Regiment, managed to keep its positions, and Colonel Wladyslaw Boncza-Uzdowski prepared a counterattack, using 5th Legions Infantry Brigade. Since other Polish units joined the attack, by 6 p.m. the Soviets were in full retreat. In the morning of September 23, General Berbecki ordered his men to capture bridges over the Niemen. The assault at first surprised the Soviets, but in the course of the time their resistance stiffened, and the Poles had to return to their starting positions. In late afternoon, a bloody battle for the folwark of Stanislawow took place. In a desperate attempt, Boncza-Uzdowski threw all his forces into the fray, and by midnight, Poles reached the line Masalany - Sedejki - Werejki. On September 24, the Soviets carried out several counterattacks, trying to push the enemy behind the Swislocz river. All these attempts failed due to accurate fire of Polish artillery. Soviet losses were very high, and by September 25, they began to retreat. In the evening of that day, 6th Legions Infantry Brigade captured the bridge at Lunna Wola, and soon afterwards, partially destroyed rail bridge at Zaniemiensk was seized by 5th Legions Infantry Brigade. Total Polish losses during the Battle of Brzostowica were 223 killed, 1149 wounded and unknown number of missing. The Soviets lost app. 1000 killed, thousands were wounded and 2100 captured, together with 7 cannons and 40 heavy machine guns.

The task of the Poles was to close all roads leading to Switzerland, and to achieve this, General Prugar-Ketling divided his forces into two parts: southern (4th Warsaw Rifle Regiment, commanded by Colonel Aleksander Gembal), and northern (9th Kresy Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Stanislaw Bien). On 18 June, at about 1:30 pm, Polish forces exchanged fire with the advancing Wehrmacht. At 4 pm, two reinforced battalions of German infantry, supported by artillery, captured the town of Maiche. One hour later, Polish officers gathered at a meeting, during which they discussed possible evacuation to Switzerland or retreat to southern France. In the evening, however, the Poles were ordered to man the frontline between Saint-Hippolyte, Doubs and Swiss border near Charmauvillers. In the night of 18–19 June, Polish units moved to the new positions. German assault on Damprichard and Saint-Hippolyte began in the morning, after capturing both towns, the Germans moved towards Trevillers.

The battle took place near the village of , located between Przemysl and Lwów in the Second Polish Republic (now Lviv in Ukraine). On September 11–12, 1939, Polish 24th Infantry, commanded by Colonel , fought a bloody battle with advancing 2nd Mountain Division near Bircza. The Poles suffered heavy losses, and on September 12 in the evening, the Germans broke through Polish positions, forcing their enemy to retreat towards Olszany and Rokszyce. General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, who commanded Polish Southern Front, ordered General Fabrycy to march with his forces towards Lwow. 24th Division was to retreat behind the San river, but as a result of this, southern wing of the defence of Przemysl was uncovered. On September 14, all units defending Przemysl were withdrawn from the city (see Battle of Przemysl (1939)). On September 14, near Boratycze, 1st Battalion of 39th Polish Infantry Regiment attacked a reconnaissance unit of the 2nd Mountain Division, and forced it to retreat.

The sister series to Channel 4's Cucumber and the 4oD documentary series Tofu, Banana is a series focusing on LGBT youth in Manchester, around the narrative of Cucumber. Unlike Cucumber, which is a self-contained serial following the story of one gay man, Banana is an anthology series focusing on the wider LGBT spectrum. The series was nominated for the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Movie or Limited Series. Banana develops some of the storylines of characters featured in Cucumber as well as introducing many new characters. Banana is primarily a self-contained series, occasional overlapping with the Cucumber narrative. Cucumber, Banana, and Tofu are all named after the same scale of erection hardness, with Banana symbolising the middle of the scale from the flaccid Tofu to the fully erect Cucumber. Development Banana was commissioned in 2013 as a sister show to Davies' long-developed project Cucumber, along with the online documentary series Tofu. The three series refer to a urological scale of erection hardness, which consists of tofu, peeled banana, banana, and cucumber. Unlike Cucumber, which focuses primarily on middle-aged gay men, Banana focuses on LGBT youth in Manchester that are on the periphery of the Cucumber narrative. The two series are primarily linked through the crossover character of Dean Monroe (Fisayo Akinade), who appears as a major character in both series, and are contrasted by social acceptance of the characters; whereas Akinade's character is more \\"open and confident\\" about his sexuality, the characters of Cucumber are former activists whose sexuality had to be less open. Whereas Davies' 1999–2000 series Queer as Folk focused on gay men in the Canal Street club scene, Cucumber is a self-contained serial following the story of one middle- aged gay man, Henry Best (Vincent Franklin), Banana is an anthology series focusing on young characters across the LGBT spectrum. The show notably casts the first transgender actor in a transgender role in a UK television series, with comedian Bethany Black portraying Helen, a transgender woman. Davies insisted that a transgender actor be cast as Helen, going so far as to alter the script until Black was cast at the eleventh hour; Black was vocal in her praise for this, contrasting the decision with the casting of Jared Leto as a trans woman in the recent film Dallas Buyers Club, which she described as \\"a cisgender guy trying to play what he thought a trans woman would be like\\", and compared cisgender actors playing transgender roles to blackface portrayals in shows such as It Ain't Half Hot Mum. Helen's episode also features Cucumber character Cleo Wilkinson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), in a scene that symbolises a \\"passing of the baton\\" between Hesmondhalgh—the cisgender actress who portrayed the transgender woman Hayley Cropper in Coronation Street between 1998 and 2014—and Black and the wider trans community.
