She showed some promise in three starts as a juvenile in 2019 when she won one minor race and was narrowly beaten in the Montrose Stakes. On her first run as a three-year-old she won the Irish 1,000 Guineas. Background Peaceful is a brown filly with a prominent white star bred in Ireland by the Coolmore Stud. She is owned by the Coolmore partners Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier and Derrick Smith. Like many Coolmore horses she was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She was from the fifteenth crop of foals sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his tenth champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2018. His other progeny include Frankel, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found Minding and Ruler of the World. Peaceful's dam Missvinski showed good racing abiility, winning four times in France including two Listed races and finishing second in the Prix d'Astarte. She was a great-granddaughter of Careless Notion, the dam of Cacoethes and the Santa Susana Stakes winner Fabulous Notion. Racing career=2019: two-year-old season Peaceful was ridden by Seamie Heffernan when she made her track debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse on 15 August and started at odds of 10/1. After becoming upset in the starting stalls she was never in serious contention, and came home ninth of the fourteen runners, three and three quarter lengths behind the winner Ridenza. On 10 October the filly was partnered by he trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien when she started the 8/11 favourite for a maiden over one mile at Thurles Racecourse and recorded her first success as took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew away to win by seven lengths from Indian Lilac. For her final run of the season Peaceful was sent to England to contest the Listed Montrose Stakes on heavy ground at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 November and started the 3/1 favourite in a seven-runner field. With Donnacha O'Brien in the saddle she was among the leaders from the start and kept on well in the closing stages to finish second, beaten a neck by the 20/1 outsider Born With Pride. 2020: three-year-old season The flat racing season in Ireland was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Irish 1000 Guineas was run three weeks later than usual on 13 June behind closed doors at the Curragh. Ridden by Heffernan, Peaceful started the 3/1 second favourite behind Albigna in an eleven-runner field which also included So Wonderful (third in the Moyglare Stud Stakes), Fancy Blue and New York Girl (Weld Park Stakes). Peaceful settled in second place behind the outsider Valeria Messalina before gaining the advantage a furlong and a half from the finish and stayed on well to win by two lengths and a head from Fancy Blue and So Wonderful. After the race Aidan O'Brien said \\"Seamus has been delighted with her all the time. He rides her in all her work. Everything has gone very smooth with her. She will get further than a mile so a mile here on beautiful ground really suited her... She's a lovely filly.\\" On 5 July Peaceful was sent to France to contest the Prix de Diane over 2000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse in which she was ridden by Heffernan and went off the 3.9/1 second choice in the betting behind Alpine Star. After racing in mid-division she briefly struggled to obtain a clear run before finishing strongly to take third place, beaten a short neck and a head by Fancy Blue and Alpine Star.

The theatre presents a varied programme, including international classic drama, and new plays by contemporary playwrights. In addition to performances at the Nowy Theatre building, the Nowy Theatre tours productions at theatres across the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ region, Poland and abroad.  History  In 1949, the Young Actors' Group (Polish: Grupa M≈Çodych Aktor√≥w), with Kazimierz Dejmek as one of their leaders, organized a series of workshops during which those assembled worked on learning the Stanislavski's system. It was this group that went on to create the New Theatre. The theatre was initially collectively managed and in November of 1949 presented its first jointly directed premiere, a production of a Czech repertory play by Va≈°ek K√°≈àa titled Grinder Karhan's Work Brigade (Czech: Parta brusiƒçe Karhana). At this time, beginning with the January 1949 convention of the Polish Writers' Union held in the city of Szczecin, Socialist Realism became the governing aesthetic doctrine. In 1950 Kazimierz Dejmek assumed the position of intendat and artistic director of the institution and abandoned acting as a profession. He remained the theatre's director until 1962. Later he held that position between 1974 and 1979, as well as in 2002. In 2008 the New Theatre was named after him, but the full title is rarely used.

The unit was one of the Massachusetts regiments organized in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call on May 2, 1861 for volunteer troops to serve a term of three-years. The battery trained at Camp Chase in Lowell, Massachusetts. It was assigned to the Department of the Gulf under Major General Benjamin F. Butler and departed Boston by steamship on February 8, 1862. At that time, the unit comprised 145 men armed with two rifled and four smoothbore six-pounder field guns. The battery performed garrison duty at Ship Island off the Mississippi coast, which served as the staging point for Butler's expedition, until April 15. After proceeding on to New Orleans, the battery served garrison duty in that city until June. One section, consisting of two guns, was temporarily detached and took part in minor raids against Confederate cavalry west of New Orleans. On June 18, the battery was reunited in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Here the battery was again divided and two sections were deployed in demonstrations against Vicksburg, Mississippi for five weeks. Although only lightly engaged during their actions near Vicksburg, the battery suffered its first casualty in battle with one man killed. The battery was reunited in Baton Rouge in July. The battery was heavily engaged in the Battle of Baton Rouge on August 5, 1862 and took additional casaulties. The unit wintered in Thibodaux, Louisiana and in April 1863 took part in the First Bayou Teche Campaign in western Louisiana, being engaged in the Battle of Fort Bisland among other actions. At the close of this campaign, one section of the battery remained at Point Coupee, Louisiana while the other two participated in the Siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana in May and June. During the first assault on Port Hudson in May, the right section of the battery advanced to within 300 yards of the Confederate fortifications and remained in that position for the duration of the siege. During the latter part of 1863, the battery was consolidated to a four gun battery due to losses in combat and from disease. It was stationed at various points in western Louisiana during the fall including Vermillionville and went into winter quarters at New Iberia. In January 1864, 56 men (nearly the entire unit at that time) reenlisted for a second three-year term and returned to Massachusetts in April for a month's furlough. The 6th Battery returned to New Orleans in June and remained stationed there for the rest of the year, relatively inactive due to their small numbers. Over the course of the year, they received new recruits from Massachusetts until in January 1865 the unit numbered 169 men and was re- equipped with six guns. They remained on garrison duty in New Orleans until July 21, 1865 when they embarked for Boston. The 6th Massachusetts Battery reached Boston August 1 and was mustered out at Camp Meigs on August 7, 1865. During their service, the unit lost six men killed in action or mortally wounded and 51 men who died from disease.

Biography Daughter of Mary Moylan, a homemaker, and Joseph Moylan, a stenographer in Baltimore's criminal court and sometime employee of The Baltimore Sun, and a member of the Knights of Columbus. Had a younger sister, Ella, and a brother. She was given the middle name Assumpta because she was born on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary. Moylan graduated from the Catholic Mount Saint Agnes College High School in Mount Washington, and then studied nursing at the Mercy Medical Center (Baltimore, Maryland) School of Nursing, becoming a registered nurse and certified nurse-midwife. Inspired when she heard a speech by Tom Dooley, she went to Uganda in 1959 with the White Sisters of Africa (Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa) to work as a nurse midwife in a religious mission in Nkozi and later Fort Portal, also at one point teaching English in a secondary school. She did a second tour in Africa with the Women Volunteers Association. According to her friend, the scholar and theologian Rosemary Radford Ruether, she parted ways with the hospital in 1965 when she insisted on better training for the African personnel, including decision-making power. She remained in Uganda a few more months and then returned to Washington, DC, where she lived in a community run by the Archdiocese of Washington, and eventually in a community at 1620 S Street NW, where she met George Mische, another of the Nine. Her commitment to Catholicism waned but her activism increased. Moylan was also influenced by the teachings of Jesuit priest Richard McSorley and liberation theologian priest Camillo Torres Restrepo. (Peters 71-76) Catonsville Nine Moylan was one of two women on Catonsville Nine, the other being Marjorie Bradford Melville, and Moylan was the only native of Baltimore (Peters 4). They burned draft files with homemade napalm in the Knights of Columbus parking lot in Catonsville, Maryland. She and Melville flanked Tom Lewis and they entered first. She scuffled over a telephone with one of the clerks, Phyllis Morsberger, assuring her repeatedly \\"We won't hurt you\\" before relinquishing it, and walking away saying \\"It's all yours\\" (Peters 102-103). Morsberger claimed years later that the group screamed at her and called them all murderers, but others dispute that story. To show how voluntary their arrest was, she was able to slip out of the handcuffs easily because of her slender wrists, but she slipped them back on and allowed herself to be taken. In court she wore a tinkling bell on a chain one day, \\"a mere tinkle against the thudding gavel, a whispered plea against the insane clamor of war\\" (Peters 219). Years of exile She participated in the trial, receiving bail of $5,000 and a sentence of two years, but did not report to prison (Peters 6, 244). This triggered a national manhunt monitored by J. Edgar Hoover. She did not even attend her mother's funeral out of fear that the FBI would be waiting for her there. She described her life as one of nomadic poverty, often staying with friends and various women's communities. In part she went underground because, as she told a journalist, she wanted to prove a woman could do it, too. It was a pushback against what is still often seen as the \\"rampant clericalism and patriarchalism\\" (Peters 303) of the whole Berrigan phenomenon and the narratives of what happened at actions. After friends appealed unsuccessfully to President Jimmy Carter to pardon her as he had Patty Hearst, she surrendered in Baltimore in June 1979, after which she served a year in the women's prison in Alderson, West Virginia. Afterward she returned to nursing, first at the People's Free Medical Clinic, eventually working in Queen Anne's Hospital. With Jim Keck she was a founder of the People's Community Health Center, that closed in 2015. She was also affiliated with secular radical antiwar groups, at was at the edges of SDS, RYMII and others though ultimately not aligning with them and instead embracing feminism over all else. Personal She was portrayed by some friends as troubled because of her exile and the nature of her death, but George Mische objected to this image. Other friends remember her as argumentative, but a wit (Peters 72). Carl Schoettler of The Baltimore Sun reported that \\"Willa Bickham and Brendan Walsh, the couple who have devoted their lives to serving soup and love at their Viva House table, did keep in touch with Ms. Moylan during the years of her underground exile and afterward.\\" Viva House is part of the Baltimore Catholic Worker (https://www.catholicworker.org/communities/houses/md- baltimore-viva-house.html). Death She was found dead in April 1995. It was unclear the exact day she died. The Viva House Catholic Worker at 26 S. Mount Street held a wake for her. She was said to have stayed at Viva House, Baltimore Catholic Worker, before going underground. (The Baltimore Sun) See also *List of peace activists Sources * du Plessix Gray, Francine (1973).

History  The Cooperative was launched in 1969 with the help of assistance from Second E. M. S. Namboodiripad ministry. This cooperative came up as a result of workers' resistance against the exploitation of private capital. From the 1940s the organised labour movement in Kerala has demanded the implementation of special legislation to help beedi workers from the misery of exploitation. The initiatives of A K Gopalan pressurised the Nehru Government to introduce Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment Act) in 1966. However, the decision to implement the Act was left to the choice of state government. This Act was implemented by Second E. M. S. Namboodiripad ministry, hence Kerala became the first state to implement it. This provoked the private beedi companies like ganesh beedi and they shifted their operation from Kerala to Karnataka. This left thousands of workers unemployed. As negotiations with the company failed, the trade union movement in Kerala put forth the idea of developing a cooperative. As a result, the cooperative was inaugurated in 1969. The E.M.S. ministry invested Rs 1.35 million as share capital and sanctioned a huge working capital loan of Rs 7,00,000 to initiate the functioning of this cooperative. GK Panicker IAS, the then Joint Commissioner of Industries Department played a crucial leadership role in shaping the institution. In the mid-seventies, Dinesh Beedi achieved a significant portion of Indian tobacco market and they increased their profit from Rs 50,000 in 1969 to Rs 44 crore by 1994-95. With a 70 times increase in production it reached 6.85 billion beedis per year during the nineties.

Burnley Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Burnley, Lancashire, that was founded on 18 May 1882. The club became professional in 1883 ‚Äì one of the first clubs to do so ‚Äì putting pressure on the Football Association (FA) to permit payments to players. As a result, the club was able to enter the FA Cup for the first time in 1885‚Äì86 and was one of the 12 founding members of the Football League in 1888‚Äì89. The team struggled in the early years of the Football League; they were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1896‚Äì97 season. Burnley achieved promotion back to the First Division in 1913; the following year they won the FA Cup for the first ‚Äì and to date only ‚Äì time, defeating Liverpool in the final. In the 1920‚Äì21 campaign, Burnley were crowned champions of England for the first time. During that season they embarked on a 30-match unbeaten run, a then-English record. Burnley remained in the top tier of English football until 1930, when the team were relegated to the second tier and stayed there until 1947. Burnley won a second league championship in 1959‚Äì60 with a last-day victory over Manchester City. Between 1970 and 1983, Burnley were yo-yoing between the first and third tiers, and in 1985, they were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time. In 1987, a last-day win against Orient prevented their relegation to the Football Conference. The team won the fourth tier in 1992 to become the second team to win all four professional divisions of the English football league system. They were promoted to the second tier in 2000 and to the Premier League in 2009, 2014 and 2016.  Early years (1882‚Äì1912)  Lancashire Cup in the middle of the photo. On 18 May 1882, members of Burnley Rovers gathered at the Bull Hotel in Burnley to vote for a change from rugby to association football, following other sports clubs in the area that had changed code to football.Simpson (2007), p. 12 A large majority voted in favour of the proposed change of sport. The club secretary George Waddington met with his committee a short time later and forward a proposal to drop \\"Rovers\\" from the club's name, thereby \\"adopting the psychological high ground over many other local clubs by carrying the name of the town\\", to which the committee members unanimously agreed. On 10 August, Burnley Football Club played and won their first-ever match as an association football club against local team Burnley Wanderers 4‚Äì0. The team played the match in a blue and white kit, the colours of the former rugby club, at their home ground Calder Vale, which was also inherited from the rugby club.Simpson (2007), p. 586 The club's first competitive game was in October 1882 against Astley Bridge in the Lancashire Cup, which ended in an 8‚Äì0 defeat.Simpson (2007), pp. 18‚Äì19 In February 1883, the club was invited by Burnley Cricket Club to move to a pitch adjacent to the cricket field at Turf Moor;Simpson (2007), p. 574 both clubs have remained there since and only Lancashire rivals Preston North End have continuously occupied the same ground for longer. That same year saw the team win their first trophy. In January 1883, Dr Thomas Dean, Burnley's Medical Officer of Health, instigated a football tournament to raise funds for the town's proposed new Victoria Hospital; it was a knockout competition between amateur clubs in the Burnley area, the final of which was played at Burnley's new home ground. Burnley won the Dr Dean Trophy, a silver goblet, outright and their reserve team subsequently won the new Hospital Cup in 1884 and on multiple occasions in later years. By the end of 1883, the club had turned professional and signed many Scottish players, who were regarded as the best footballers.Simpson (2007), p. 20 As a result, Burnley refused to join the Football Association (FA) and its FA Cup because the association barred professional players.Simpson (2007), p. 22 In 1884, Burnley led a group of 35 clubs in the formation of the breakaway British Football Association (BFA) to challenge the supremacy of the FA. The threat of secession led to the FA changing its rule in July 1885, allowing professionalism and making the BFA redundant. Burnley's main rivals at this point were neighbours Padiham and matches between the two teams attracted up to 12,000 fans.Simpson (2007), pp. 20‚Äì21 Burnley made their first appearance in the FA Cup in 1885‚Äì86; however, most professionals were prohibited entry due to FA rules that year, so Burnley fielded their reserve side and lost 11‚Äì0 to Darwen Old Wanderers.Smith (2014), p. 3 In October 1886, Turf Moor became the first professional ground to be visited by a member of the Royal Family when Queen Victoria's grandson Prince Albert Victor attended a match between Burnley and Bolton Wanderers after he opened the town's new Victoria Hospital. When it was decided to found the Football League for the 1888‚Äì89 season, Burnley were among the 12 founder members of the competition and one of the six Lancashire-based clubs.Simpson (2007), p. 28 In the second game, William Tait became the first player to score a league hat-trick when his three goals gave Burnley their inaugural win in the competition. The club finished ninth in its first league season but only one place from bottom in 1889‚Äì90, following a run of 17 winless games at the start of the season.Simpson (2007), p. 36 That season, Burnley won their first Lancashire Cup after beating local rivals Blackburn Rovers 2‚Äì0 in the final.Simpson (2007), pp. 35‚Äì36 Nicknames at this point were \\"Turfites\\", \\"Moorites\\" or \\"Royalites\\", as a result of their ground's name and the royal connection. Burnley were relegated to the Second Division for the first time in 1896‚Äì97. The team won the division the next season, losing only two of 30 matches before gaining promotion through a four-team play-off series called test matches. The last game against First Division club Stoke was controversial; it finished 0‚Äì0 because both clubs needed only a draw to secure a promotion. The game was later named \\"The match without a shot at goal\\".Simpson (2007), p. 67 The Football League immediately withdrew the test match system in favour of automatic promotion and relegation; Burnley director and Football League management committee member Charles Sutcliffe had already proposed the discontinuation of test matches. The Football League decided to expand the First Division from 16 clubs to 18 after a motion by Burnley, meaning the other two teams (Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United) also went into the first tier. The team were relegated again in 1899‚Äì1900 and became the centre of a controversy when their goalkeeper Jack Hillman attempted to bribe opponents Nottingham Forest in the last match of the season, which resulted in Hillman's suspension for the whole of the following season. It is possibly the earliest-recorded case of match fixing in football. Burnley continued to play in the Second Division in the first decade of the 20th century; the side finished in last place in 1902‚Äì03 but were re-elected.Smith (2014), p. 4 Alarming performances on the field and a considerable financial debt saw manager Ernest Mangnall leave the club for Manchester United in October 1903. In 1907, 30-year-old Burnley supporter Harry Windle was invited onto the board to become a director and two years later, he was elected chairman. The club's finances improved under Windle's guidance.Smith (2014), pp. 3‚Äì5 The team reached the quarter-finals of the 1908‚Äì09 FA Cup but were eliminated by Manchester United in a replay. In the original match on the snow-covered pitch at Turf Moor, Burnley were leading 1‚Äì0 when the match was abandoned after 72 minutes.Smith (2014), pp. 20‚Äì27 In 1910, Mangnall's successor Spen Whittaker died after he fell off a train.Smith (2014), p. 34 Windle appointed manager John Haworth, who changed the club's colours from green to the claret and blue of First Division champions Aston Villa; Haworth and the Burnley committee believed the change might improve the club's fortunes. The team did improve the following season, when only a loss in the last game of the season prevented the club's promotion.Simpson (2007), pp. 124‚Äì125  Clarets' glory (1912‚Äì1946)  The FA Cup trophy is presented to Burnley captain Tommy Boyle by King George V in 1914. Burnley's form continued to improve; in the 1912‚Äì13 season they were promoted to the First Division and reached the FA Cup semi- finals but lost to Sunderland. The next season, the team consolidated their place in the top flight and won their first major honour, the 1914 FA Cup Final 1‚Äì0 against Liverpool.Simpson (2007), pp. 126‚Äì133 Bert Freeman, whose father travelled from Australia to see him play in the final,Smith (2014), p. 260 scored the only goal as Burnley became the first club to beat five First Division clubs in one cup season.Smith (2014), p. 343 This was the last final to be played at Crystal Palace. King George V became the first reigning monarch to attend an FA Cup Final and to present the cup to the winning captain, in this case to Tommy Boyle. 1920‚Äì21 season. The team finished fourth in 1914‚Äì15 before English football was suspended during wartime.Simpson (2007), pp. 134‚Äì135 Upon resumption of full-time football in 1919‚Äì20, Burnley finished second to West Bromwich Albion and for the first time won the First Division championship in 1920‚Äì21. Burnley lost the season's opening three matches before going on an unbeaten 30-match run, an English record for unbeaten league games in a single season that lasted until Arsenal went unbeaten through the whole of the 2003‚Äì04 FA Premier League season.Smith (2014), p. 309 Burnley could not retain the title and finished third the following season. In 1924, Haworth died of pneumonia, becoming the second Burnley manager to die while in the post.Smith (2014), pp. 329‚Äì331 In April 1926, Louis Page scored a club-record six goals in an away league match against Birmingham City. Thereafter the club's league position steadily deteriorated, attaining only fifth place in 1926‚Äì27, a respite from a series of near-relegations that culminated in demotion to the Second Division in 1929‚Äì30.Simpson (2007), p. 529 Burnley struggled in the Second Division and narrowly avoided further relegation in 1931‚Äì32 by two points. The years before the outbreak of the Second World War were characterised by uninspiring league finishes, which were broken only by an FA Cup semi-final appearance in 1934‚Äì35, and the arrival and swift departure of centre-forward Tommy Lawton. The team participated in the football leagues that continued throughout the war until professional English football was fully restored in 1946.Simpson (2007), pp. 226‚Äì240  Progressive era (1946‚Äì1976)  In the first season of post-war league football, Burnley took second place in the Second Division and gained promotion. The team's defence was nicknamed \\"The Iron Curtain\\"; the team conceded only 29 goals in 42 league matches. The season also saw a second run to the FA Cup Final, beating Aston Villa, Coventry City, Luton Town, Middlesbrough and Liverpool before losing 1‚Äì0 after extra time to Charlton Athletic at Wembley. The Burnley team made an immediate impact on the top division, finishing third in 1947‚Äì48 as they began to assemble a team that were capable of regularly aiming for honours.Quelch (2015), p. 207 Former Burnley player Alan Brown was appointed manager in 1954 and Bob Lord chairman a year later;Quelch (2015), p. 208 Lord was later described as the \\"Khrushchev of Burnley\\" as a result of his authoritative attitude. The club became one of the most progressive under their tenures.Quelch (2015), pp. 205‚Äì206, 208‚Äì209 Burnley was one of the first football clubs to set up a purpose-built training centre at Gawthorpe, which opened in July 1955. Gawthorpe was built on the outskirts of the town; as well as using paid labour, Brown helped to dig out the ground and \\"volunteered\\" several of his players to assist. The club also became renowned for its youth policy and scouting system, which yielded many young, talented footballers.Quelch (2015), pp. 203‚Äì204 An acclaimed employed by Burnley during this period was Jack Hixon, who was mainly based in North East England and scouted many players, including Jimmy Robson, Brian O'Neil and Ralph Coates. Brown introduced short corners and free kick routines.Quelch (2015), p. 201 In the 1955‚Äì56 season, Burnley reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they were knocked out by Chelsea after four replays. On his debut in 1956‚Äì57, 17-year-old Ian Lawson, a product of the club's youth academy, scored a record four goals against Chesterfield in the FA Cup third round. A tied club-record 9‚Äì0 victory over New Brighton in the next round followed despite missing a penalty. The following season, former Burnley player Harry Potts was appointed manager.Simpson (2007), pp. 281‚Äì284 His squad mainly revolved around captain Jimmy Adamson and the team's playmaker Jimmy McIlroy. Potts often employed the then-unfashionable 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation and implemented a Total Football playing style. The team endured a tense 1959‚Äì60 season, in which Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers were the other protagonists in the campaign for the league title. Burnley won their second First Division championship on the last day with a 2‚Äì1 victory at Manchester City and goals from Brian Pilkington and Trevor Meredith. Although Burnley had been in contention all season, they had not led the table until the last match was played. Potts used only 18 players during the whole season and John Connelly became their top scorer with 20 goals.Quelch (2015), p. 265 The squad cost ¬£13,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) in transfer fees‚Äî¬£8,000 on McIlroy in 1950 and ¬£5,000 on left-back Alex Elder in 1959.Quelch (2015), pp. 202‚Äì203 The other players were recruited from the side's youth academy. With 80,000 inhabitants, the town of Burnley became the smallest to have an English first- tier champion.Quelch (2015), pp. 199‚Äì200 After the season ended, the Burnley squad travelled to the United States to participate in the International Soccer League, the first modern American international football tournament. The following season, Burnley played in European competition for the first time in the 1960‚Äì61 European Cup, defeating former finalists Stade de Reims in the first round but being eliminated after losing to Hamburger SV in the quarter-finals.Simpson (2007), pp. 296‚Äì297 Burnley finished fourth in the league and lost the FA Cup semi-final to Tottenham. The team finished the 1961‚Äì62 First Division as runners-up to newcomers Ipswich Town after winning only two of the last thirteen matches, and had a run to the 1962 FA Cup Final but lost against Tottenham Hotspur. Robson scored the 100th FA Cup Final goal at Wembley but it was the only reply to Tottenham's three goals.Simpson (2007), pp. 302‚Äì303 Adamson was named FWA Footballer of the Year, however, with McIlroy as runner-up. Due to their success during this period, Burnley had several players with international caps, including for England's Ray Pointer, Colin McDonald and Connelly, for Northern Ireland's McIlroy and for Scotland's Adam Blacklaw.Simpson (2007), pp. 532‚Äì538 Although Burnley were far from a two-man team, the controversial departure of McIlroy to Stoke City in 1963 and Adamson's retirement in 1964 coincided with a decline in the club's fortunes.Simpson (2007), pp. 304‚Äì312 The impact of the abolition of the maximum wage in 1961, which meant clubs from small towns like Burnley could no longer compete financially with sides from bigger towns and cities, was more damaging. The club, however, retained its place in the First Division throughout the decade, finishing third in 1965‚Äì66 with Willie Irvine, the league's top goal scorer, and reaching the League Cup semi-final in 1968‚Äì69. Burnley also reached the quarter-finals of the 1966‚Äì67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, in which they were knocked out by West German side Eintracht Frankfurt. After 12 years in the post, Potts was replaced by Adamson as manager in 1970.Simpson (2007), pp. 546‚Äì548 Adamson hailed his squad as the \\"Team of the Seventies\\" but was unable to halt the decline and the club was relegated in 1970‚Äì71. It ended an unbroken top-flight spell of 24 consecutive seasons during which Burnley had often been in the top half of the league table. Burnley won the Second Division title in 1972‚Äì73, losing only four times in 42 matches. As a result, the team were invited to play in the 1973 FA Charity Shield, which they won against Manchester City, the reigning holders of the shield. In the First Division, led by playmaker Martin Dobson and Leighton James, the side finished sixth in 1973‚Äì74 and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, which they lost to Newcastle United. The following season, the team experienced a shock defeat in the FA Cup against Wimbledon, then in the Southern League, who defeated Burnley 1‚Äì0 at Turf Moor. Adamson left Burnley in January 1976 and the team were relegated from the First Division later that year. During this period, a drop in home attendances combined with an enlarged debt forced Burnley to sell star players such as Dobson and James, which caused a rapid decline in the club's fortunes.Quelch (2017), pp. 17‚Äì20  Decline and near oblivion (1976‚Äì1987)  Football League in 1888‚Äì89 to the present. Three nondescript seasons in the Second Division followed before relegation to the Third Division in 1979‚Äì80 for the first time. In 42 league games, Burnley won none of the first 16 or the last 16 games. In September 1981, the club was in the Third Division relegation zone and close to bankruptcy, and Lord decided to retire.Quelch (2017), p. 20 He was replaced by former Burnley player Brian Miller for remainder of the season, and the team saw three more defeats after October and were promoted as champions in their centenary year. This return to form was lasted only one year, a season in which the team reached the FA Cup quarter-finals and the League Cup semi-final, defeating Tottenham and Liverpool in the latter.Simpson (2007), p. 386 Burnley won 1‚Äì0 against Liverpool in the League Cup semi-final second leg but they were eliminated after losing the first leg 3‚Äì0. Managerial changes continued; in early 1983, Miller was replaced with Frank Casper, who was succeeded by John Bond before the 1983‚Äì84 season.Simpson (2007), pp. 550‚Äì554 Bond was the first manager since Frank Hill (1948‚Äì1954) without a previous playing career at the club; fans criticised Bond for signing expensive players, increasing Burnley's debt, and for selling young talents Lee Dixon, Brian Laws and Trevor Steven.Quelch (2017), pp. 24‚Äì39 The following season, Bond was replaced with John Benson, who was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time at the end of the 1984‚Äì85 season.Simpson (2007), pp. 550‚Äì554 It was the fifth relegation in the past 15 seasons; the club finished 21st in each of those five seasons. For the 1985‚Äì86 season, Burnley were managed briefly by Martin Buchan and then Tommy Cavanagh before Miller returned for the 1986‚Äì87 season,Simpson (2007), pp. 554‚Äì555 the last match of \\"the Orient Game\\". For the 1986‚Äì87 season, the Football League introduced automatic relegation and promotion between the Fourth Division and the Football Conference, the top tier of non-league football in England. Burnley's new local rival team Colne Dynamoes were rapidly progressing through the English non-league system.Simpson (2007), p. 413 Colne's chairman-manager Graham White made multiple proposals for a groundshare of Turf Moor and attempted to buy the club in early 1989; the Burnley board rejected these offers. In 1987, the Burnley board attempted to purchase almost-bankrupt Welsh club Cardiff City and relocate it to Turf Moor if Burnley were relegated; this would have been the Football League's first franchise operation.Quelch (2017), p. 62 During the 1986‚Äì87 season, Burnley had only 12 wins in 46 league games and a 3‚Äì0 FA Cup first-round defeat at non-league Telford United. Burnley went into the season's last match in bottom place and needing a win against Orient, needing Lincoln City to lose and for Torquay United to lose or draw. A 2‚Äì1 win before a crowd of over 15,000 with goals from Neil Grewcock and Ian Britton kept Burnley in the Fourth Division as Torquay drew and Lincoln lost.  Recovery (1987‚Äì2009)  Wade Elliott's goal earned Burnley a 1‚Äì0 victory over Sheffield United in the Championship play-off Final, which resulted in the Clarets reaching the highest level of English football for the first time in 33 years. In May 1988, Burnley were back at Wembley to play Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final of the 1988 Associate Members' Cup Final, which they lost 2‚Äì0. The match was attended by 80,000 people, a record for a game between two teams from the fourth tier. In 1990‚Äì91, Burnley qualified for the Fourth Division play-offs under manager Casper but were eliminated in the semi-final by Torquay United.Quelch (2017), pp. 104‚Äì106 Burnley became champions the following season under their new manager Jimmy Mullen in the last-ever season of the Fourth Division before the league reorganisation. Mullen had succeeded Casper in October 1991 and won his first nine league matches as manager.Simpson (2007), pp. 420‚Äì423 By winning the fourth tier, Burnley became only the second club to win all four professional divisions of English football after Wolverhampton Wanderers. In 1993‚Äì94, the team won the Second Division play-offs and gained promotion to the second tier. They won 3‚Äì1 on aggregate against Plymouth Argyle in the semi-final and faced Stockport County in the final. In front of approximately 35,000 Burnley supporters and a total attendance of 44,806, Burnley won the game 2‚Äì1 and two Stockport players were sent off.Simpson (2007), p. 428 Relegation followed after one season and in 1997‚Äì98, only a last-day 2‚Äì1 victory over Plymouth prevented relegation back into the fourth tier. Chris Waddle was player-manager that season with his assistant Glenn Roeder;Quelch (2017), p. 160 their departures and the appointment of Stan Ternent that summer saw the club make further progress. Burnley finished second in 1999‚Äì2000 and gained promotion to the second tier; the striker and lifelong Burnley fan Andy Payton was the division's top goal scorer. Burnley immediately became serious contenders for a promotion play-off place during the 2000‚Äì01 and 2001‚Äì02 seasons. In the latter season, the team missed the last play-off place by one goal.Quelch (2017), p. 198 In early 2002, financial problems caused by the collapse of ITV Digital brought the club close to administration again.Quelch (2017), pp. 197‚Äì202 By 2002‚Äì03, the club's on-field form had also declined despite reaching the FA Cup quarter- finals. Ternent's six years as manager ended in June 2004 after the club narrowly avoided relegation with a squad composed of many loaned players and some regular players who were not entirely fit.Quelch (2017), pp. 204‚Äì213 Steve Cotterill was then appointed as manager; His first year in charge produced two notable cup runs; the team beat Liverpool and Aston Villa in the third rounds of the FA Cup and the League Cup, respectively.Simpson (2007), p. 474 In 2006, Turf Moor and Gawthorpe were sold to Longside Properties for ¬£3 million (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to resolve the club's financial problems. Chairman Barry Kilby owned 51 per cent of the company's shares.Quelch (2017), p. 227 In the 2006‚Äì07 campaign, between December and March, Burnley went 19 consecutive games without a win. The sequence of draws and losses ended in April, when Burnley beat Plymouth 4‚Äì0 at home and a short run of good form saw them finish comfortably above the relegation zone, ensuring they remained in the Championship.Simpson (2007), pp. 482‚Äì483 The following season, a run of poor results led to Cotterill's departure in November 2007. His replacement was St Johnstone manager Owen Coyle. The 2008‚Äì09 season, Coyle's first full season in charge, ended with Burnley's highest league finish since 1976; fifth in the Championship. Burnley qualified for the Championship play-offs and defeated Reading 3‚Äì0 on aggregate in the semi-final. Sheffield United were defeated in the Championship play-off final, which meant promotion to the top flight after 33 years. Wade Elliott scored the only goal. Burnley also reached the League Cup semi-final for the first time in over 25 years after beating local clubs Bury and Oldham Athletic, and London-based clubs Fulham, Chelsea and Arsenal. In the semi-finals, Burnley played Tottenham but lost the first leg 4‚Äì1. After leading 3‚Äì0 at home after 90 minutes, the side were eliminated after Tottenham scored two goals in the last two minutes of extra time, preventing Burnley making two Wembley appearances in one season.  Premier League promotions, relegations and back in Europe (2009‚Äìpresent)  Manager Sean Dyche has guided Burnley to two promotions to the Premier League. After the team's promotion, Burnley became the smallest town to host a Premier League club. The team started the 2009‚Äì10 season well and became the first newly promoted side in the competition to win their first four home games, including a 1‚Äì0 win over defending champions Manchester United. Manager Coyle left the club in January 2010 to manage local rivals Bolton Wanderers, whom he said were \\"five or 10 years ahead\\" of Burnley. Coyle was replaced with Brian Laws, under whom Burnley's form deteriorated and the team were relegated after a single season in the Premier League. Laws was dismissed in December 2010 and replaced with Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, who in his first season guided the team to an eighth-place finish in the Championship, narrowly missing out on a play-off place. In October 2012, Howe left Burnley to rejoin Bournemouth for personal reasons. He was replaced the same month with Watford manager Sean Dyche. Before the start of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Turf Moor and Gawthorpe returned to club ownership after a seven-year period. Burnley were tipped as relegation candidates; Dyche had to work with a tight budget and a small squad, and Burnley's top goal scorer Charlie Austin had moved to Championship rivals Queens Park Rangers.Quelch (2017), pp. 318‚Äì319 In Dyche's first full season in charge, however, Burnley finished the season second and were automatically promoted back to the Premier League. The new strike partnership of Danny Ings and Sam Vokes had 41 league goals between them.Quelch (2017), p. 332 Dyche used only 23 players during the season, which was the joint-lowest in the division. Since his appointment, Dyche had paid only one transfer fee‚Äî¬£400,000 for striker Ashley Barnes. The club finished 19th out of 20 clubs and were again relegated to the Championship. In 2015‚Äì16, Burnley won the Championship title when they equalled their 2013‚Äì14 club record of 93 points and ended the season with a run of 23 undefeated league games. The new signing Andre Gray scored 25 goals for Burnley, becoming the league's top goal scorer. The side finished the 2016‚Äì17 season in 16th place, six points above the relegation zone, and were thus ensured to play consecutive seasons in the top flight for the first time in the Premier League era. In that season's FA Cup competition, Burnley were eliminated in the fifth round at home by National League club Lincoln City, who won the game 1‚Äì0; this was Burnley's second FA Cup home defeat against a non-league club while in the top flight since 1975. In 2017, the club's new Barnfield Training Centre, which replaced the 60-year- old Gawthorpe, was completed. Dyche was involved in the design and had willingly tailored his transfer spending as he and the board focused on the club's infrastructure and future. Burnley finished the 2017‚Äì18 season in seventh place, winning more points away than at home; it was their highest league finish since 1973‚Äì74. Burnley qualified for the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League, their first competitive European campaign in 51 years, but were eliminated in the play-offs against Greek side Olympiacos after defeating Scottish club Aberdeen and Turkish side ƒ∞stanbul Ba≈üak≈üehir in the previous qualifying rounds. The 2019‚Äì20 season was interrupted for three months because of the COVID-19 pandemic before being completed behind closed doors; in that period, Dyche's assistant manager Ian Woan tested positive for the SARS CoV-2 coronavirus. Burnley concluded the campaign in 10th place, five points away from the European places. Goalkeeper Nick Pope missed out on the Premier League Golden Glove award after conceding two goals against Brighton & Hove Albion in the last match.

It is now a military exercise terrain.  First Fort Cr√®vecoeur = Eighty Years War  Fort Cr√®vecoeur was founded during the Eighty Years' War. In 1587 the main campaign centered around the Siege of Sluis in Zeeland. A smaller part of the States' army under Philip of Hohenlohe came in action near 's-Hertogenbosch. Hohenlohe first took the Loon op Zand Castle, and plundered some villages. He then made a ship bridge over the Meuse and started to besiege the Sconce of Engelen. The Spanish Netherlands therefore sent Claude de Berlaymont lord of Haultpenne to the area with 42 companies of foot and 25 squadrons of cavalry. He attacked Hohenlohe in order to lift the siege, but was defeated. Haultpenne himself was wounded, and on 14 July he died from his wounds in 's-Hertogenbosch. Hohenlohe then conquered the Sconce of Engelen, and razed it. On the place 'where the battle was fought' Hohenlohe somewhat later constructed a new strong fortification that was named Cr√®vecoeur. The logic behind it was simple. The Dutch wanted to block any action from 's-Hertogenbosch to the Meuse, and in general the Republic was stronger on water. This made supplying a fortress on the Meuse easier than supplying a fortress on the Dieze at Engelen, where river transport could be blocked. The Spanish side reacted by rebuilding Fort Engelen. It seems that later the Spanish side reconquered Cr√®vecoeur. In 1590 the Dutch army reconquered Fort Cr√®vecoeur. On 29 June 1593 a Spanish army under Count Mansfeld appeared before Cr√´vecoeur. Somewhat before that, Floris van Brederode, lord of Cloetingen, had marched into the fort with reinforcements. Now the Dutch built a dam across the Dieze, causing all the surrounding lands to flood, and Mansfeld broke off the siege. 1594 started with the Dutch Republic attempting to surprise 's-Hertogenbosch, The attempt failed, but the subsequent Siege of Groningen (1594) succeeded.  Siege of 1599  The Spanish offensive against Zaltbommel On 4 May 1599 a Spanish army under La Barlotta crossed the Meuse between Kessel and Maren (east of Cr√®vecoeur) and invaded the Bommelerwaard. On 5 May a Dutch army under Prince Maurice moved to Zaltbommel. The Spanish then took Cr√®vecoeur after a short siege, and made a bridge over the Meuse. The Spanish then started a siege of Zaltbommel, which they abandoned on 3 June. However, the Spanish did found the Sconce Sint Andries, which controlled the Meuse and the Waal. Cr√®vecoeur was also expanded.  Siege of 1600  In early 1600 the Walloon and German garrison at Fort Cr√®vecoeur numbered about 200 men. The garrison of Fort Sint-Andries was 2,000 men strong. After the pay of some men in these garrisons fell 20 months into arrears and that of others for even longer, they mutinied in February 1600. On 16 February they seized their commanders and sent them to 's-Hertogenbosch. Maurice, Prince of Orange tried to profit from this opportunity. About 20 March he collected some troops, and sent them up the Meuse from Dordrecht to Cr√®vecoeur. On 24 March 1600 Fort Cr√®vecoeur was handed to him by treaty. Out of the four companies that formed the garrison, two were allowed to leave for St-Andries. Of the other two, some ended their mutiny and left for 's-Hertogenbosch. Of the others a new company was formed to serve in the States' army. On 8 May Fort Sint-Andries followed by a treaty that included a payment of 125,000 guilders to the losing garrison. Of the men that switched to the side of the republic, 11 companies were established. With Fort Cr√®vecoeur and Fort St Andries, the United Provinces reconquered an upstream part of the Meuse. Maurice added seven bastions to Fort Cr√®vecoeur. In 1601 Maurice besieged 's-Hertogenbosch, but could not take it due to frost. In 1602 he was successful in the siege of Grave, adding another 30 km of the Meuse to his control. In 1603 he made another attempt to take 's-Hertogenbosch.  The name Cr√®vecoeur  The early 1600s were the years that the name Cr√®vecoeur surfaced in writing. Cr√®ve-coeur, literally means 'heart pain', and is a name that has been used for other fortresses as well. An older guess why this fortress was so named, was that it gave pain to the citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch, who were cut off from the Meuse by this fortress. Cr√®vecoeur indeed cut off the city from communication upstream on the Meuse, but at the time the Dieze was a dead end. Other explanations could be that the fort almost permanently flooded the land around the city or that the Dutch used the fort to levy heavy taxes on shipping on the Dieze before they conquered 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629. Fort Cr√®vecoeur often seems to be depicted as a hamlet on old maps, but it never had any civilian population, even though it had a church.  The Twelve Years' Truce  During the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621) Fort Cr√®vecoeur was controlled by the republic. It hampered the recovery of 's-Hertogenbosch, because the flooding continued. The republic was prepared to negotiate an opening in the dykes near the fort. Negotiations failed in 1613, but succeeded soon after. Meanwhile the Protestant religion was celebrated in the fort and in Engelen. The religion and associated charity lured many from 's-Hertogenbosch to visit these places. After the truce had ended, trade continued. However, the United Provinces did not allow ships to sail up the Dieze past Cr√®vecoeur. In 1622 they also started to levy one-third higher taxes on goods to and from 's-Hertogenbosch than on goods from other places in the Spanish Netherlands. These extra taxes ended only in 1625.  The conquest of 's-Hertogenbosch  Cr√®vecoeur (top left) conected to the siege works During the first years after the truce, the Spanish appeared to have the upper hand after they took Breda in 1624. Somewhat later the Dutch took Oldenzaal in 1626 and Groenlo in 1627. In April 1629 the Dutch then started the campaign that would lead to the successful Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch. Just in time the commander of Cr√®vecoeur got orders to arrest some ships that were planning to bring supplies to the city. On 30 April 's-Hertogenbosch was closed in. Now a fleet of supply ships was sent to deliver everything that was needed for the siege to Cr√®vecoeur. Its role as a supply hub for the siege was further strengthened by making a ship-bridge across the Meuse. During the siege the fort had at least 18 cannon, but it was not in the front line. After 's-Hertogenbosch had been conquered by the Republic, Cr√®vecoeur continued to guard the Dieze. West of it, near Bokhoven a warship guarded the Meuse towards Holland.  Franco-Dutch War  During the Franco-Dutch War French troops under Turenne easily captured Nijmegen on 9 July, as well as Grave. On 14 July 1672 Turenne then closed in on Fort Cr√®vecoeur. On 16 July a bombardment from two batteries started. Later more batteries were added, and as the enemy approached the militia started to mutiny, leading to the surrender of the fortress on 19 July. Nevertheless, 's-Hertogenbosch stood firm. In late 1673 the French left Cr√®vecoeur. Apart from the church and the commander's house, they destroyed everything as much as possible. They blew up the gunpowder magazine by igniting 500 pounds of gunpowder amidst its foundations. In light of this result the States General decided that the fortress was more of a threat than a defense for 's-Hertogenbosch, and decided to completely destroy the fortress. This happened in 1674. Farmers from the vicinity of 's-Hertogenbosch were summoned to perform this work. This caused trouble, because it was far from their homes, and situated in the county of Holland. It was only the threat of prosecution that got it done. Of the first Fort, only the small church is left.  Second Fort Cr√®vecoeur = A Coehoorn design  Fort Cr√®vecoeur c. 1740 In 1701 the Dutch decided that a fortress was nevertheless needed at the mouth of the Dieze in order to control the inundations of 's-Hertogenbosch. A plan was made by Menno van Coehoorn. The high cost, and resistance by several land owners made that construction was severely delayed. By 1735 a smaller version of the Coehoorn design was completed. The fortress then had seven bastions named counter clockwise: Empel, Heel, Maase, Boeckhoven, Henri√´tte, Engelen, Dies. It had two guard houses, some bomb free shelters, one big and three smaller gun powder magazines, a house for the commander, a house for the staff operating the lock, a harbor with water gate, and the church that remained from the first fortress. The idea was that the Dieze would flow freely around the fort, but that in times of war, the Dieze would be blocked, and shipping would use the locks inside the fort.  War of the Austrian Succession  During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) the locks and Dam of Cr√®vecoeur were put into action after Flanders was lost to the French in 1746. That same year the locks in the Dieze that flowed through the fort were completed, and shipping was led through the fortress till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). At first ships could not use the canal through the fort because of strong currents. This was solved later on. From a military perspective the measures were quite effective. Surrounded by water on all sides 's-Hertogenbosch 'resembled an island'. Fort Cr√®vecoeur was later described as having barracks for the troops, a house for the commander, a church and a gun powder magazine. The church was still the same church and served as an arsenal. The gun powder replaced that which the French had blown up in 1673.  Siege of 1794  In mid 1794 the garrison of Fort Cr√®vecoeur amounted to 104 men and 30 gunners. On 16 September these were reinforced by the arrival of the Hessen-Darmstad fusileers, bringing the total garrison to 462 men. The fort had 2 24-pdr cannon, 9 12-pdr and 9 6-pdr and 14 3-pdr cannon, as well as 20 mortars. There was sufficient gunpowder. On 22 September 's-Hertogenbosch was closed in. The French wanted to take Cr√®vecoeur, because it controlled the inundations around 's-Hertogenbosch. The fort was only weakly defended by commander Colonel N.C. Tiboel. After a short siege it was handed over by treaty in the evening of 27 September 1794. Later Colonel Tiboel was court-martialed. He was acquitted after explaining that the fortress had not been properly prepared. There were no gabion baskets, nor other material to make gun ports, i.e. no people able to handle these. The cannon were not in working condition, and carriages could not be repaired. For the heavy muskets there were enough bullets, but cartridges were missing. Loading sticks to use these muskets with loose powder were missing. Furthermore there was flour, but no oven to make bread. Last, but not least, the soldiers had to sleep in the open air. Others claim that the fort did have cover for the soldiers, and questioned the speedy surrender, as well as the abilities and political opinions of the commander. The surrender of Fort Cr√®vecoeur enabled the French General Pichegru to open the lock. This somewhat lowered the inundations around the city, but ideas that these were simply drained by opening the lock at Cr√®vecoeur are false. The locks at the fort were crucial for hastening the inundation. However, most of the inundations were caused and controlled by stopping the Dommel and Aa in 's-Hertogenbosch itself (cf. the siege of 1629). If the inundations were already sufficient, the only effect of opening the lock at Cr√®vecoeur was that it opened up a way to attack the citadel from the north. Next the fortress was neglected for decades. On 14 December 1813 the fortress was surrendered by the French.  Early nineteenth century  Fort Cr√®vecoeur c. 1865 A whole new renovation plan was proposed in 1815, but it was not executed. After the Belgian independence some funds were allocated. In 1842 some urgent maintenance was done. From 1858 to 1860 extensive renovations to the fortress took place. Total cost amounted to 55,500 guilders.  Last phase as a fortress In 1870 the recently renovated Fort Cr√®vecoeur was mobilized on account of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1874 two batteries were added to the east, because the dyke of the new Utrecht-Boxtel railroad hindered the fortress' guns. In 1890 the Dieze canal was opened, which moved the mouth of the Dieze some kilometres to the west. It severely limited the ability of the fortress to control inundations in the area. On 28 May 1926 the government ended the status of Fort Cr√®vecoeur as a fortress. In 1937 two eastern bastions and the eastern moat were eliminated to create the national road from Hedel to 's-Hertogenbosch, which used the Hedel Bridge, opened in the same year.  Worl War II  In May 1940 the 159th AA battery of the 9th machine gun company was located at the fortress. Later in 1940 the Germans flattened Bastion Hedel in order to use a ship bridge instead of the blown-up Hedel Bridge. In 1944 the German army placed some FLAK batteries. On 8 December 1944 Fort Cr√®vecoeur was conquered by the Canadians.  Current Situation  Weir and fish ladder near Fort Cr√®vecoeur  Training grounds for the engineers  After World War II the Dutch corps of engineers came to use the grounds. The canal and locks were filled up. A small harbor remains from the canal, and another small harbor is situated to the east. During the Cold War, the fortress was equipped to quickly make a pontoon bridge across the Meuse if the Hedel Bridge was destroyed. To create cover for the long traffic jams that could be expected in such circumstances, the terrain was allowed to grow wild. This wilderness was cut down in the early nineties, and now the fort is an open space. Now and then there are plans for a restoration of the fortress.  Weir and fish ladder  The Dieze now splits right before the fortress and then continues south and west of it. This is kind of the same situation that existed in the early eighteenth century. However, the branch that used to flow through the fortress is now a dead end. Therefore all the water now flows west of the former fortress. Immediately after the split, there is a weir. It is a rather modest construction. In spite of the Dieze Canal being much wider, this weir controls most of the water level in the east of North Brabant. South of the weir a meandering water suggests an old bed of the Dieze. This is actually a fish ladder, built in 2012.  Further reading  *H.J.Bruggeman en Wim van den Oord, 1992, Rondom Cr√®vecoeur.

Prior to transitioning from female to male, he attended Bryn Mawr College as an undergraduate, graduating in 1995. He later enrolled in the Master of Divinity degree program at Harvard Divinity School. While there, he wrestled with gender identity, and made the decision both to transition from female to male, and to pursue ordination as an Episcopal priest. He notified his bishop, the Right Reverend M. Thomas Shaw, that he was transitioning, and was given support and approval to proceed in the ordination process in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. He was ordained in 2005. He completed a Doctor in Theology at Harvard Divinity School in 2008. At that time, Partridge served as a parish minister at St. Luke's and St. Margaret's Episcopal church in Allston/Brighton. In 2011, he became the first openly transgender chaplain at Boston University, serving as the Episcopal chaplain on campus. He also lectured at Harvard Divinity School. Partridge has been an outspoken advocate for the full inclusion of queer and transgender people in the Episcopal Church U.S.A., and within Christianity more broadly. Partridge has regularly participated in the Transgender Day of Remembrance held annually in the Boston area. He advocated for the Episcopal Church to include gender identity and expression as part of their non- discrimination policies, as part of a grassroots effort that led to the successful change in cannon law in 2012. On Sunday, June 22, 2014, Rev. Partridge was the guest preacher at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., at a morning service in celebration of Pride month. He was the first transgender priest to preach at the Cathedral.

The bill, numbered IL SR 1184, prompts the state of Illinois to examine the rise in opioid overdoses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill also urges the state to improve and increase access to naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug.  Background  In Illinois, almost 80 percent of deaths from drug overdoses involved opioid drugs (drugs such as heroin or the potent fentanyl). This amounted to a total of 2,169 deaths from opioid overdoses. However, deaths from heroin and prescription opioids declined to 1,050 and 539, respectively after 5 years of annual increases. The global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020 further complicated the crisis. The Illinois stay-at-home order ‚Äú‚Ä¶created a lack of physical access to addiction support and harm reduction groups during the COVID-19 epidemic,‚Äù which increases the risk of overdose death, according to SR 1184. All this adds to the United States opiate abuse and addiction epidemic that began in the late 1990s due to the over-prescribing of opioid painkillers. From 1999 to 2017, more than 399,000 people died from drug overdoses that involved prescription and illicit opioids. To stop or reduce this epidemic of mortality from opioid overdose, medical personnel can prescribe naloxone, a medication that quickly reverses an opioid overdose. It is an opioid antagonist, in ‚Ä†hat it reverses and blocks the effects of opioids. Opiate drugs suppress the body‚Äôs respiratory system, and overdoses are fatal when they stop someone‚Äôs breathing. Naloxone quickly restores a person to normal respiration.  Legislation  The bill acknowledges the severity and urgency of the worsening of the opiate crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill declares several facts. First, Illinois‚Äô stay-at-home order restricts access to addiction support groups and harm reduction groups, which increases the risk of overdose deaths. Second, the social isolation resulting from the stay-at-home order and social distancing policies puts further stress and strain in people suffering from opiate addiction and substance abuse issues. Third, because of the strain that COVID-19 is putting on hospitals and the healthcare system, there is a lack of capacity to deal with opiate addiction and overdose patients. And fourth, co-prescription of naloxone with high doses of opiates has already been approved in nine states, all of which saw a decrease in opiate overdose deaths. As a result of the facts (as they are stated in the bill), the legislation urges the State of Illinois, through the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Department of Human Services, to examine the increase in opiate overdose deaths within the state and urges those agencies to propose changes to the state‚Äôs prescription rules that would include co-prescription of naloxone to patients in high-risk groups of overdose.  Legislative action  The legislation was introduced in the 101st General Assembly session of the Illinois State Senate on May 21, 2020 by State Senator Melinda Bush. It was referred to the Senate Assignments Committee. In 2015, Bush sponsored related legislation that would allow licensed and trained pharmacists to prescribe anti-overdose drugs to family members of people at risk of overdose. The bill was nicknamed ‚ÄúLali‚Äôs Law‚Äù after Alex ‚ÄúLali‚Äù Laliberte died from an overdose.

In 2005, he was awarded the Hannes Alfv√©n Prize with Malcolm Haines and Valentin Smirnov for his contributions to the field.  Life and career  Sanford studied mathematics and physics at the University of Washington and obtained a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1965. He then went on to Columbia University, where he completed his master's degree in physics in 1967 and received his doctorate from Leon M. Lederman in 1973. Upon his graduation, he worked at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (with T. G. Walker), at CERN and at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (with Samuel C. C. Ting). In 1982, he was a member of Sandia National Laboratories and was involved in the development of the HERMES III (High Energy Radiation Megavolt Electron Source) electron accelerator, which was used to generate X-rays and gamma rays to simulate the effects of nuclear explosions. In 1991, he became a Distinguished Member of the laboratory.  Scientific contributions  Sanford further developed the Z-pinch with wire arrangements, which had previously been successfully tested in Russia by Valentin Smirnov, via the Saturn experiment to the Z-machine. It was the strongest X-ray source in the mid-2000s (2 megajoules in 6 nanoseconds with 200 terawatts of power), which also generated record temperatures of 2 to 3 billion Kelvin for a short time. Two cylindrical shells of wire assemblies, through which a high current (20 megaamps) is sent, implode onto a central target, where high-intensity X-rays are generated for inertial fusion experiments or other studies. This was studied with the dynamic hohlraum X-ray source.  Honors and awards  Sanford is a fellow of the American Physical Society since 2000.

Biography Antonio Fustella was born on 24 January 1913 in Pagnano di Merate, Italy, the fourth of nine children born to Guglielmo and Caterina. He completed his studies at the Pontifical Lombard Seminary in Rome, and earned a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained a priest on 5 April 1937 by Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, Archbishop of Milan. He then taught at the Archiepiscopal seminary of Milan and in 1948 became a parish priest in Motta Visconti. He was dean of the in Milan from 1955 to 1960. On 15 May 1960, Pope John XXIII named him Bishop of Todi. He received his episcopal consecration on 25 June 1960 from Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini, Archbishop of Milan. He participated in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, taking especial interest in questions of liturgical practice. On 1 October 1967, he became rector of the Pontifical Lombard Seminary in Rome. On 19 October 1967, Pope Paul VI named him titular bishop of Sebana. His two years at the seminary were \\"not without problems and headaches\\". On 19 June 1969, he was named Apostolic Administrator of Saluzzo sede plena, that is, with the right to succeed Bishop Egidio Luigi Lanzo, then 84 years old. He was welcomed in Saluzzo on 13 September 1969. Lanzo died on 29 January 1973 at the age of 87. On 22 May 1973, Pope Paul appointed Fustella Bishop of Saluzzo. His administration of the diocese focused on the reorganization of resources and personnel to support the population shifts associated with industrialization and rural depopulation. In addition to his local duties, including three complete rounds of visits to all the parishes in his diocese, he supported the missions in Cameroon and visited that country in 1975. Fustella died of a heart attack in Saluzzo on 5 February 1986 at the age of 73. His remains were interred in the crypt of the cathedral of Maria SS. Assunta in Saluzzo.

GMCDP is regarded as being influential in the social, cultural, economic, and legal policy debates on a national stage that have impacted on disabled people, grounded in the Social Model of Disability. The GMCDP magazine Coalition was referred to in these debates, its articles being cited in academic textbooks as well as within the community. The history of GMCDP has been a microcosm of the history of the radical disabled people's movement in the UK since the 1980s, with GMCDP members often involved centrally and nationally.  Origins  The first meeting, Strategies for a Coalition, was on Saturday 16 June 1984 with over 90 disabled people attending. It was an all-day meeting and held at the County Hall of the Greater Manchester Council (now an office block) on the corner of Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester. The printed programme for the day is here. This meeting elected a Steering Committee that was tasked with agreeing a constitution (the rules on how to run the group) and to start looking for funding. Much of the support work behind this event and the steering committee came from two community development workers employed at the Greater Manchester Council for Voluntary Service (later called GMCVO), Dorothy Whitaker and Val Suffolk. The idea for GMCDP came from a group called the Greater Manchester Disability Action Group which had discussions with radical disabled people like Ken Davis and Maggie Davis at the Derbyshire Coalition of Disabled People (1981-2018), and from regional events during and after the United Nation's International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981. The name of GMCDP was in use from July 1984 onwards and many of the founder members and early discussions are listed in minutes here and here. Around half of the founder members of GMCDP were also members of the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS, 1972-1990) and the Social Model of Disability was central to the design of GMCDP. Many of the UPIAS members who lived in and around Manchester also met together within the Manchester Disabled Athletes (MDA) sports club where further private discussions were possible concerning the formation of GMCDP.Source: private conversations with Lorraine Gradwell, Neville Strowger, Kevin Hyett, Ken Lumb. In particular, it was agreed that GMCDP would be registered as a company but not also as a charity, so that future campaigning would not be compromised. A funding application to the Greater Manchester Council for an Urban Aid grant of ¬£27,350 revenue and ¬£10,000 capital for a Greater Manchester Resource / Information Centre for Disabled People was drafted by the group, showing Lorraine Gradwell as the committee secretary. A basic typed leaflet describing GMCDP was also circulated in October 1984.https://tonybaldwinson.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1984-10-gmcdp- leaflet.pdf One example of the ways of working of the GMCDP Steering Group was the organising of an open meeting called, Politics of Disability, 7.30pm Friday 8 February 1985 at the Health Education Centre, Hardman Street, Manchester (now Spiningfields). Vic Finkelstein was noted as a speaker, as Chair of the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People (BCODP). The agenda-setting discussion was a few weeks earlier, 24 January 1985, between Kevin Hyett and Lorraine Gradwell while at the MDA club evening meet at Stretford sports centre. Because it was an open meeting it was decided beforehand that it would not be a policy-making meeting. Steering Group meetings were often held at the Health Education Centre at Hardman Street (one of the few accessible meeting venues at the time) each month on a Friday evening.Source: Lorraine Gradwell, Diary 1985 The Inaugural Meeting of GMCDP took place on Saturday 22 June 1985 at the County Hall of the Greater Manchester Council, at which point the Steering Committee ended and the first Executive Council was elected The meeting included a number of smaller discussion groups, including on education, access, and employment.  Membership  The GMCDP Steering Group decided at the outset that the membership would be only open to individual disabled people who support its aims, and not also to any disability organisations, to prevent GMCDP being overwhelmed by any larger, better-resourced organisations which were not following the social model of disability. Associate membership was allowed for non-disabled people, for organisations, and junior members aged under 16 years. It was also agreed that the Officers (Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, etc.) would be elected from the Executive Council and not from the full membership at an annual general meeting, which elected the Executive Council only. An extract from the draft constitution in August 1984 states: \\"The Coalition aims to promote the full participation of disabled people in ensuring that they have the necessary facilities and support to live independently; to have control of their own lives, and to support all measures that seek to ensure that disabled people have the means to be fully integrated into society.\\"  1980s  The first office was at 11 Anson Road, Rusholme, Manchester, in a temporary cabin in the car park of SERIS, the Special Education Resources and Information Service of Manchester City Council. There were three staff initially - a Clerical and Administrative Officer (Sue Stirling for a few weeks, then Thelma Tomlinson) and two Information and Publicity Workers (Ian Stanton, --- ), and a fourth worker recruited in 1986 as the Development Worker, later Team Leader (Lorraine Gradwell). GMCDP staff and members were heavily involved in the establishment and running of the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People (BCODP, 1981-2017), both before and after GMCDP had become established.  Coalition magazine  The first publication by GMCDP as a staffed organisation was in February 1986. This was an Information News-sheet, which soon had a name-change to become Coalition News and then Coalition from June 1989 onwards. By 2019 there had been over 70 editions of the Coalition magazine. An Information Bulletin was issued for details of events and other announcements.  Accessible public transport (mass transit)  When GMCDP was formed, it included people and committees from some pre-existing single-issue disabled people's organisations and these included ADAPT, Action on Disabled Person's Transport - Greater Manchester Branch (1979-1985). In 1982 in outline and then in 1984 in detail, the public transport planners in Greater Manchester proposed that a new tram network should be funded and built, which later became known as Metrolink. Disabled people in ADAPT described themselves in minutes as very concerned to find that the proposed trams would not be accessible to disabled people. The proposal was for retractable steps to slide in and out under the doors of the trams for (non-disabled) people to climb on when boarding a tram. A meeting was held between the authorities and around 70 disabled people on 22 November 1984 to protest, and one of the speakers was the visiting disabled activist Vic Finkelstein. The transport authorities continued to refuse these demands for a fully accessible tram system for three more years, up to another meeting with the authorities around May 1987, this time with over 100 disabled people protesting. By the summer of 1988 the principle of full access had been agreed and disabled people were invited to inspect a full-size mock-up vehicle and platform that had been built for consultation purposes.  Artability - protest and consequences  In July 1986 the Coalition magazine featured the campaign against and eventual cancellation of the Artability conference. The Carnegie Foundation had planned to hold a conference in Manchester on 22‚Äì24 September 1986 called, Artability - the way ahead for the arts and people with disabilities, to take forward the recommendations in the (Richard) Attenborough Report on the arts and disabled people. GMCDP and other organisations of disabled people had objected because they were not consulted, the venue for the conference was inaccessible, the philosophy of the conference was medical and therapeutic, and it was aimed only at non-disabled policy makers and excluded disabled people. When GMCDP persuaded Manchester City Council to withdraw its support for the planned conference, the Carnagie Council issued a statement and cancelled the event. Following this, GMCDP worked with Manchester City Council and others to plan and run a better, alternative event, the Manchester Disabled People's Arts Conference held on 26‚Äì27 March 1988 at Manchester Town Hall, and a 39-page conference report was published by GMCDP in August 1988.  Accessible venues  In May 1987 GMCDP in conjunction with the Greater Manchester Council for Voluntary Service (GMCVS) co-produced a 61-page booklet, the Venue Guide (digital copy here) for meetings and conferences in Greater Manchester, based on 500 questionnaires issued. It was intended to highlight the very limited number of accessible venues, to encourage their wider use by event organisers, and to inform inaccessible venue managers on ways to improve their own access. = Manchester Town Hall campaign = In the early 1980s Manchester Town Hall was inaccessible to disabled people. Every entrance had steps, there was one tiny lift once inside, no accessible toilets, no hearing aid induction loops, no Braille signage. Disabled people's organisations such the Manchester Disability Forum and GMCDP had called for full access to the 'corridors of power' but were being told it wasn't possible because the town hall was a listed building, which the groups considered to be an ill-informed response. The Manchester Town Hall Extension, built in the 1930s, was slightly better for access, though both the link bridges between the buildings contained steps, barriers to access.Source: https://tonybaldwinson.com/manchester- firsts/ GMCDP and Manchester Disability Forum believed that they had secured a political understanding with Manchester City Council that the council would commit to making the 'old' Town Hall fully accessible as soon as possible, and that in the meantime no public meetings would be held there. However, disabled people were angry to find that this agreement had been broken when an exhibition of the Trades Union Congress was held in the town hall alongside the TUC's annual conference nearby. When the exhibition organisers refused to use an alternative accessible venue, GMCDP organised a picket of disabled people at the town hall entrances, including placards saying which trade unions they belonged to, and many TUC delegates refused to cross the line. Kevin Hyett and others later said, this was the moment when elected councillors realised that GMCDP was as political as they were.  Benefits cuts and protests  Some members of GMCDP went to the major protest and rally of disabled people on 28 July 1988 at the Elephant and Castle, London, marching on the headquarters of the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) against the cuts by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher to disabled people's benefits. This campaign resulted in a u-turn on the cuts, and soon afterwards the creation of the Independent Living Fund. This major protest was celebrated by the disabled poet, Simon Brisenden, in The Battle for the Elephant and Castle. (Simon Brisenden was a founder member of Southampton Centre for Independent Living, now Spectrum CIL.)  1990s = First youth project  In 1990 GMCDP launched its first project specifically for young disabled people under 25 years old. GMCDP has run various Young Disabled People's Projects continuously since then, including young disabled people taking part in independent living skills training, drama workshops, the Kulture Klub social club and through information provision sessions. In July 1997 GMCDP and project funders published a training pack of a film (VHS tape) and paperback book, Independent Living Skills: A training manual for young disabled people, by Alison Blake, the project worker.  Disability Action Training  The GMCDP Disability Action Training (DAT, 1990-1994) project offered training to both disabled and non-disabled people in disability equality, job-seeking skills and training the trainers in order to build up a pool of quality trainers. The name was deliberately 'action training' not 'awareness training' to emphasise the changes that were expected from organisations as a result of receiving the training.  Block Telethon 92  GMCDP members played a part in the protest by over 1000 disabled people in London outside the LWT television studios used for the 18-19 July 1992 broadcast of the charity fundraising Telethon event, claiming that the methods being used were demeaning to disabled people. Ian Stanton, a GMCDP worker and disabled musician, performed the newly-written song, A Message From Telethon (to you) written by himself and Cathy Avison, another GMCDP member. Lorraine Gradwell, another GMCDP worker, had a letter published in The Guardian newspaper that morning calling on disabled people to support the protest. Natalie Markham, another GMCDP worker and disabled artist, spoke from the platform and wrote in Coalition that GMCDP organised two accessible coaches from Manchester to get members to the protest. Two of the main organisers of this protest (and the previous smaller protest against this Telethon in 1990) were Alan Holdsworth, and Barbara Lisicki, who also wrote on the Telethon protests in Coalition. With other disabled people involved in the 1992 protest they formed the Disabled People's Direct Action Network (DAN) in 1993.  \\"Thoughts and Reflections\\"  In 1996 a film (VHS tape) of interviews with members was completed, Thoughts and Reflections on the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People, to mark the 10th anniversary of the organisation. Those interviewed include: Ken Lumb, Dorothy Whitaker, Kevin Hyett, Lorraine Gradwell, Neville Strowger, Martin Pagel, Ian Stanton, Thelma Tomlinson, Angela Madeley, Linda Marsh, Brian Hilton, Audrey Stanton and Alison Blake. A digital copy of the film is embedded in the GMCDP website on the history page.  Anti-Discrimination Legislation  GMCDP was involved in the extensive campaigning in the first half of the 1990s for a new law to prevent discrimination against disabled people. This was a concerted effort for civil rights across a number of campaigning organisations, including the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People (BCODP) and Disabled People's Direct Action Network (DAN).  2000s = Disabled People's Refugee Project  One of the innovative projects run by GMCDP was the Disabled People's Refugee Project. This provided information, support and training in the areas of - services available from support organisations, building confidence, independent living, tech skills, peer support to participate in meetings to share experiences, and access to education and employment.https://hsm.manchester.gov.uk/kb5/manchester/directory/service.page?id=VwFkbRopOPM  Young Disabled People's Forum  This project worked with young people aged up to 25 years from across Greater Manchester, and it worked with its sister project, the Young Disabled People's Forum Drama Group.  Information and Advocacy Unit  The Information and Advocacy Unit was launched on 17 April 2004 at Manchester Deaf Centre, and specialised in providing a customised information and a signposting service to individuals and groups across Greater Manchester, on issues such as housing, benefits, rights, transport, and leisure activities. Disabled people who lived or worked in Greater Manchester could telephone an information line or ask questions by email to the project team. Information days were held across Greater Manchester, and a Consultancy Service was available to organisations, and an Advocacy Service was offered one-to-one advocacy support to disabled people in Greater Manchester.  2010s = Youth work  In 2010 GMCDP started a five-year Lottery funded project, Including Young Disabled People, and in 2016 this work continued, now being called Shaping Our Inclusion. Two youth projects were funded for the City of Manchester area only - the Manchester Young Disabled People's Project, and also the Manchester Young Disabled People's Forum which included Self Development and Well Aware. Two other projects were the Equality Forum and LOL - Living Our Lives.  Right to Control pilot  Around 2010 there were a number of funding sources which could be paid to disabled people for various needs at home and in work, but sometimes these funds worked against each other. The idea of a 'Right to Control' was to attempt to give some co-ordination to these funds, and to put the disabled person at the centre of their planning. In 2010 Greater Manchester was chosen as one of the pilot trailblazer areas to try to implement a new way of combining the funding streams, known as the Right to Control. One of these pilots was called the Manchester Area Partnership, which consisted of five of the ten local authorities (councils) in Greater Manchester: Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Stockport, and Trafford. These five councils in Greater Manchester and JobCentre Plus and disabled people's organisations met for three years to try to get a new way of person-centered working in place. A 12-month extension to the pilots into 2013 was agreed after consultation, however Oldham council decided it would withdraw its involvement and left on 12 December 2012, and the eventual conclusion was that the various authorities, especially the national agencies, were too inflexible and the pilots ended in 2013.  Austerity  The decade of 2010 to 2020 was identified in public funding terms as a period of spending cuts and austerity. This UK government policy impacted on disabled people for over a decade, and especially on those of working age because of political manifesto exemptions given against benefits cuts for elderly people, as well as the impact with reduced public sector funding generally. Many disabled people's organisations (DPOs) were forced to close as the years of austerity ate away at any reserves, and although GMCDP had to retrench and reduce staffing numbers drastically it did manage to survive the decade.  Independent Living Fund  In March 2014 the Coalition government announced its plans to close the Independent Living Fund (ILF) in June 2015 and transfer the responsibilities on to local authorities without protecting the budget, which GMCDP was convinced would lead to cuts because social care in England and the UK was already failing. The campaign to save the ILF was supported by * GMCDP (Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People) * ALLFIE (Alliance For Inclusive Education) * DPAC (Disabled People Against Cuts) * Inclusion London and * Equal Lives. Unfortunately the government continued with its plans and abolished the ILF despite these strong protests, and GMCDP continued with its campaigning for independent living for disabled people.  Disabled People's Manifesto  In 2017 GMCDP held an elections hustings event for the Greater Manchester inaugural mayoral candidates (those people wanting to be elected as a \\"metro mayor\\"), which focused on disabled people's issues. At the same time, GMCDP drafted a Disabled People's Manifesto alongside other disabled people's organisations throughout Greater Manchester which was sent to all candidates. In 2017 Andy Burnham was elected as the metro Mayor of Greater Manchester and in 2019 he set up a Disabled People's Panel (DPP) with GMCDP to continue the dialogue.  \\"Manchester Firsts\\"  In 2017 Lorraine Gradwell wrote an online article on the socially progressive roles taken by disabled people and allies in Greater Manchester within the wider disabled people's movement. She called it Manchester Firsts, (copy here) written in response to attending a disability history meeting held at a university which she felt included too many glaring errors.  2020s = Covid-19 and Disabled People  The COVID-19 pandemic has encompassed the world, and the impact in the UK has been particularly severe, especially for disabled people. Many disabled people are in one of the following three categories of people who are especially susceptible to death as a consequence of infection: # clinically extremely vulnerable (shielding) # clinically vulnerable (isolating) # non-clinically vulnerable (lock-down). While closing its office for staff safety reasons, GMCDP continued to work to support disabled people who might be increasingly isolated, and to support the campaigns of disabled people including on: * The disproportionately high number of deaths in care homes which includes many disabled people of all ages living in institutions, as well as elderly people - for example the \\"excess deaths\\" of disabled people with learning difficulties or autism was reported in June 2020 as 134% above the five-year average, around four times higher than the rate of \\"excess deaths\\" in the general population. * The lack of a British Sign Language interpreter at the daily news conferences at 10 Downing Street *The blanket issuing of Do Not (attempt to) Resuscitate (DNR) statements by a minority of GP doctors and care home staff. * The difficulties faced by disabled people in sourcing their own supplies of PPE (personal protective equipment) for carers and personal assistants (PAs) * The difficulties in sourcing food and medicines, especially in the initial weeks of the national lock-down * The additional mental health impacts on disabled people * The difficulties some Deaf and disabled people have with using face masks and with face coverings, for example in needing to lip-read * The difficulties some disabled people face when trying to maintain social distancing outdoors with some non-disabled people compromising the space needed.

Disabled People's Archive  GMCDP had moved offices a number of times in its first 15 years and the Executive Council were concerned that the growing number of older materials in boxes needed to be preserved and better stored. In September 2002 the Executive Council decided that an archive of the disabled people's movement \\"shall be a high priority for the organisation.\\" In January 2003 GMCDP, together with Birmingham Coalition of Disabled People and Muscle Power, applied to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) for a revenue grant and is successful, with GMCDP employing Brian Kokoruwe from April 2004 for twelve months. Catalogue files are created, and some of the boxes are put into secure storage at the Greater Manchester County Records Office (GMCRO). An application for a grant extension that included a desired new building for the archive was submitted but not approved, and later in June 2005 Brian Hilton was employed on a temporary basis with GMCDP's own funds. In 2006 GMCDP was revenue funded by HLF for an oral history project, Deaf and Disabled People from Ardwick, Manchester. This project produced 15 exhibition boards, each at A1 size. Over the years further boxes of unique older materials continued to accumulate, and in the summer of 2013 GMCDP was required to move out of its offices in Aked Close, a large building shared with other DPOs which had been an important hub but was being closed due to local authority cuts making the rent unaffordable. GMCDP moved to smaller premises at the Windrush Centre and also rented a storage room in an old textiles mill in east Manchester to hold the bulk of its archive of seven filing cabinets (28 drawers), 68 storage boxes and some large objects including banners. As part of Disability History Month 2015, the People's History Museum (PHM) was funded by Scope to run an exhibition, The Hidden History of Disabled People's Fight for Civil Rights, which had an accompanying article in The Guardian newspaper but using some GMCDP archive material. Following representations after this event, PHM agreed to work in future with GMCDP and disabled people under the banner, Nothing About Us Without Us. In May 2016 a GMCDP volunteer starts to make a high-level general list of the contents of each box and drawer, and to label each one. Later in 2016 staff in Archives+ (\\"archives plus\\") agree to take these organised materials into safe custody, adding to the previous boxes stored at the GMCRO. With the materials in a more manageable state, GMCDP employed Linda Marsh on a fixed-term contract to start making a detailed catalogue of the archive prior to opening it to the public. In June 2019 GMCDP produced an edition of the Coalition magazine entirely on its archive. GMCDP has stated it is committed to making this extensive archive fully accessible to activists and to researchers. In July 2020 the Executive Council of GMCDP agreed that the Archive Development Project should be renamed as the Disabled People's Archive to reflect the growth of the archive with around 30 other collections in addition to GMCDP's own materials.

The cadet branch was created in 1306 when Theodore Palaiologos, fourth son of Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, inherited the March of Montferrat through his mother, and Andronikos II's second wife, Yolande of Montferrat. The Aleramici, Yolande's house and the previous rulers of Montferrat, had ruled the Kingdom of Thessalonica, a crusader state established around the city of Thessalonica after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Though the resurgent Byzantines had reconquered Thessalonica in 1224, the Aleramici family still retained claims to the title. Because Andronikos II was eager to establish himself as legitimate in the eyes of Western Europe, he married Yolande in an effort to formally unite the claims of her family with his own de facto rule of Thessalonica, avoiding the potential future threat of a pretender launching an invasion against the empire. At the time of their marriage, Yolande was second-in-line to the throne of Montferrat, and when her brother, John I of Montferrat, died without children in 1305, rulership of Montferrat legitimately passed to Yolande and her children, Theodore being chosen to make the journey to Italy and establish himself there. Many of the more conservative parts of the Byzantine aristocracy feared that Theodore and his descendants would become 'latinized'; fears that were realized once Theodore adopted Western customs and converted to Roman Catholicism. Although the Montferrat Palaiologoi continued to use typical Greek names, such as Theodore or Sophia, from time to time, and a handful of marquises had Byzantine aspirations, they tended to pay relatively little attention to events and affairs in the eastern Mediterranean. The imperial branch of the Palaiologos family were displaced in 1453 through the Fall of Constantinople, but the Montferrat cadet branch continued to rule Montferrat for almost another century after that, being replaced by the House of Gonzaga in 1533 after the death of the last male member of the house, John George Palaeologus. The last female member, Margaret Paleologa, died in 1566, rendering the house extinct. Their descendants are still alive today, both in the form of branches descended from illegitimate children and through matrilineal descent in several Italian noble houses, such as the House of Savoy.  History = Background  Map of the Kingdom of Thessalonica, ruled by the Aleramici family of Montferrat, at its foundation in 1204, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade The ruling house of Montferrat, the Aleramici family, had been interconnected with the Byzantine Empire and its rulers for some time before the Palaiologoi gained Montferrat. In 1179, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos () married his daughter Maria Komnene to Renier of Montferrat, who was granted the city of Thessalonica to rule as a pronoia. Because of this family connection, Renier's brother Boniface, a leading figure in the Fourth Crusade, could claim and conquer the \\"Kingdom of Thessalonica\\" in 1204. Though the Byzantines of Epirus retook Thessalonica in 1224, the Aleramici still retained their claims to the city and the kingdom they had created around it. In 1284, Yolande of Montferrat, the daughter of the ruling Marquis of Montferrat, William VII, married Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire () and was given the titles associated with Thessalonica by her father as her dowry, though it is unclear if she was meant to possess them or if she was intended to transfer them to her husband, who actually ruled Thessalonica as part of his empire. Yolande retained her place in the Monferratian line of succession, second-in-line after her brother John, should he die without children. Upon her marriage to Andronikos, Yolande was given the Greek name Irene. The reason for Andronikos opting to marry Irene probably had to do with the emperor wishing to establish his legitimacy in regards to Western Europe. Although the Palaiologoi ruled the Byzantine Empire, which had controlled Greece and Anatolia since ancient times, many in Western Europe viewed them as usurpers, since they had supplanted the Catholic Latin Empire, established in 1204 after the Fourth Crusade. Through marriage alliances with western pretenders to the Latin Empire, or parts of it, Andronikos would have been able to achieve full recognition of his rule in the West. In addition to his own marriage to the pretender to Thessalonica, Andronikos also unsuccessfully attempted to marry his son, Michael IX Palaiologos, to Catherine of Courtenay, the recognized heir to the Latin Empire itself. In his marriage negotiations with William VII, Andronikos paid William 6,000 livres g√©nois, amounting to the revenue Andronikos and his father, Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (), had received from \\"the Kingdom of Thessalonica which belonged to the Marquis\\". Furthermore, Andronikos pledged 500 soldiers, stationed in Lombardy throughout William's lifetime, to aid the Marquis in his wars against the Angevins. The marriage between Andronikos and Irene had the unexpected result of giving the Byzantine imperial family the possibility of inheriting the throne of Montferrat.  Foundation  Gold coin of John George Palaeologus, the last Marquis of the Palaeologus-Montferrat line. The coin displays the double- headed eagle heraldry of the Palaiologos dynasty. In January 1305, John I of Montferrat, Irene's brother, died without children. John's will specified that in the absence of heirs of his own, Montferrat should go to Irene and her sons. In March, envoys left Montferrat to ask Irene, or one of her sons, to travel to Italy and claim their inheritance. After receiving the news, Irene and Andronikos clashed over which of their sons was to inherit Montferrat. The Emperor wanted to send their youngest son, Demetrios, but Irene preferred Theodore, who was older and from Thessalonica, and sent him instead. Irene had initially preferred the couple's oldest son John, also preferred by the envoys on account of primogeniture and his older age, but this suggestion was blocked by both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople, Athanasius I, since sending John, third-in-line to the Byzantine throne, to the West was seen as jeopardizing their own line of succession. Though the Byzantines in ages past would have welcomed the opportunity to send a member of the imperial family to establish a foothold in Italy, the Byzantines of the 14th century recognized that it was the Italians that would profit from a connection with the imperial family, and not the other way around. The possibility that the Italians would launch an attack on the empire as a result of the Monferrat inheritance was entertained by the Patriarch, who opposed the entire affair. Theodore did not arrive in Italy until the late summer of 1306, aged 15. Theodore himself ascribed the delay to Andronikos not finding enough ships nor enough time to make the necessary preparations for the journey. Another likely reason was that the Marquis of Saluzzo, Manfred IV, had attacked Monferrat, claiming that John I's widow, Margarita, was pregnant and that since an heir would thus be produced, a Byzantine prince was unnecessary. Theodore was not sent to Monferrat until Manfred's claim were uncovered to be a lie. Before leaving Byzantium, Theodore also married Argentina Spinola, the daughter of Opicino Spinola, a merchant and one of the \\"Captains of the People\\" of Genoa. Theodore's fate was a shock to some of the more conservative members of the Byzantine aristocracy; not only had a young Byzantine prince, born in the purple, been sent to live among, and rule over, Latin barbarians, but he had also chosen to marry not only a commoner, but a Latin commoner. Theodore's marriage to Argentina might have been payment to Genoa for Genoese assistance against the Catalans in Andronikos II's wars. Byzantine fears that Theodore would become \\"Latinized\\" were quickly realized. Theodore converted to Roman Catholicism and on his occasional journeys to Constantinople startled the Byzantines with his Western customs and his shaven face. In the 1320s, Theodore was one of the most directly involved and influential figures in Andronikos II's negotiations and hopes for a union between the Orthodox and Catholic churches. One of Theodore's preserved literary works, a treatise on war and government, expresses western feudal practices and ideas and is notably missing contemporary Byzantine ideas. Throughout his reign, Theodore was mainly preoccupied with maintaining his position within the March of Montferrat.  'Latinization' and attitude towards Byzantium  William IX Palaeologus, Marquis of Montferrat 1494‚Äì1518 Theodore founded the Palaeologus-Montferrat cadet branch of the Palaiologos dynasty, fusing and subsuming the Aleramici lineage with a succession that derived from Byzantium and carried the name of the Palaiologan emperors. which would rule Monferrat until the 16th century. Although the Palaiologoi of Montferrat were Latinized, there still had some ties to their homeland; notably reflected in several of them being given typically Greek names, such as Theodore and Sophia. Additionally, they held strong ties to Genoa. Though the Byzantines had seen Argentina Spinola as a mere commoner, her family held significant political power in Genoa. Theodore II of Montferrat, Theodore I's grandson, even managed to take control of the city in 1409, ruling there until 1413. Theodore I's successor as Marquis of Montferrat, his son John II Palaeologus, attempted to take advantage of the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì1347, between Andronikos II's great-grandson John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, in order to invade the empire and conquer Thessalonica. In his 1372 will, John II claimed that Andronikos II's deposition in 1328 by his grandson Andronikos III Palaiologos (John V's father) had been unlawful and thus disqualified Andronikos III and all his heirs from the legitimate line of succession to the throne of Byzantium. John II also pointed out that since Andronikos II had disinherited Andronikos III, John II was thus the rightful emperor as the only true heir to Andronikos II. John II even petitioned the Papacy to recognize his claims to Thessalonica and to the empire, and to help him conquer them. An expedition to \\"recover\\" these territories was never organized. Although John II's claims were theoretically inherited by his descendants, none of the marquises seriously pursued a policy of taking over the Byzantine Empire, most of them paying little attention to affairs in the East. In 1420, Sophia of Montferrat, the great-granddaughter of Theodore I, was chosen by Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and Pope Martin V to marry her distant relative, John VIII Palaiologos, then the heir to the Byzantine throne. Manuel II agreed to this marriage not because they were related, but because Sophia held connections to Montferrat and Genoa, valuable allies, and because she had been suggested by the Pope. Pope Martin V himself might have been interested in securing the allegiance of Montferrat by suggesting an imperial marriage. Their marriage was not a happy one, on account of John VIII finding Sophia unattractive, and Sophia left John VIII in 1426, returning to Italy. John remarried in the following year.  Extinction and descendants  Portrait believed to depict Margaret Paleologa, the last living member of the Palaeologus-Montferrat family The Palaeologus-Montferrat family repeatedly intermarried with the powerful House of Savoy. In 1330, Theodore I's daughter, Yolande Palaeologina of Montferrat, married Aymon, Count of Savoy, and in 1411, a daughter of Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy, Joanna, married John Jacob, Marquis of Montferrat. The marriage contract between Yolande and Aymon in 1330 specified that in the event of the extinction of the Palaeologus-Montferrat line, the House of Savoy was to inherit Montferrat. This contract must only have been a distant memory when the final Palaeologus Marquis, John George, Marquis of Montferrat, died in 1533. Though the then current Savoyard heir, Charles III, Duke of Savoy, made a claim to the title, the Montferrat territories were instead given to a rival contender, Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. In 1708, the House of Savoy, through Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, succeeded in claiming Montferrat, the acquisition of which was confirmed in 1713 through the Peace of Utrecht, which ended the War of the Spanish Succession. The House of Savoy, which ruled all of Italy 1861‚Äì1946, represents still-living descendants of the Palaeologus- Montferrat family. Federico II Gonzaga, who had succeeded the Palaeologus- Montferrat family in 1533, was connected to the family by marriage, being the husband of Margaret Paleologa, niece of John George. Federico had married Margaret on 3 October 1531 with the explicit goal of acquiring Montferrat. With Margaret's death in 1566, the Palaeologus-Montferrat family became extinct. Her and Federico II's descendants, with the Gonzaga name, ruled Montferrat until they were supplanted by the House of Savoy. A surviving lineage, called the Paleologo-Oriundi, are descended from Flaminio, an illegitimate son of John George.http://giorgioqp.blogspot.com/2015/05/roots- paternal-grandmother-ida-quintini.html The name \\"Montferrato-Paleologo\\" is recorded on the Greek island of Cephalonia until the 17th century.''''''

He was licensed in 1585, the date that appears on the canvas. This is the second public commission obtained by Annibale after the Crucifixion of 1583, now in the Santa Maria della Carit√†, Bologna.The Baptism is the only altarpiece made by the most famous of the Carracci before his move to Rome to have remained in its original location.  Description  The Baptism is the first important manifestation of the rediscovery of Correggio who, between 1584 and 1587, occupied the artistic interests of Annibale Carracci. The influence of Correggio is particularly evident in the upper part of the altarpiece, occupied by a choir of angel musicians, supported by material clouds, in the centre of which the Eternal Father appears. This part of the composition derives from Correggio's frescoes painted for the dome of Parma Cathedral. The lower part of the painting, where the main event takes place, instead, seems to be still linked to the late Mannerist style then dominant among Bolognese painters. This can be seen above all from the artificiality of the poses of some of the characters depicted and especially from that of the catechumen on the left - which shows the Lord taking off his shirt to be baptized in turn - whose twisting is strongly unnatural. In general, there is a fracture between the two parts of the canvas (also highlighted by the different luministic setting of the two sections) which is probably an indication of the uncertainties and the results of the young Annibale's research still in progress. In the composition, in addition to the depiction of Baptism, there is a reference to the mystery of the Trinity: the Father, the dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, and Jesus, the Son, are aligned on the middle axis of the painting. The Trinitarian allusion is echoed by the gesture of the onlooker's hand on the left (in a red coat) indicating the number three. The Canobbi chapel, in fact, was dedicated to both the Baptist and the Trinity. Already in this first important example of Carracci's attention to the art of Allegri we can see Hannibal's effort to update the style: the angelic choir at the top, though derived from Correggio, is characterized by its domestic spirit, \\"almost a concertino staged [...] like a family celebration\\". According to Malvasia, for this second public rehearsal, Annibale would have availed himself of the help of his more experienced cousin Ludovico.

His is now professor emeritus at the University of California, Irvine.Faculty Profile, University of California, Irvine accessed 14 June 2020. Biography Jaime E. Rodr√≠guez O. was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador during his father's military service. Rodr√≠guez O. is the son of Colonel Luis Rodr√≠guez Sandoval, who had been Chief of the frontier zone during the war between Ecuador and Peru. His mother was Mar√≠a Beatriz Ord√≥√±ez C√≥rdova. At age 8, he moved to the United States together with his mother, where he has resided permanently. He is married to Linda Alexander Rodr√≠guez. Education In 1965 he earned his B.A. in economics at the University of Houston and following year, he earned his M.A. in history also at University of Houston. In 1970, he completed his doctorate at University of Texas, Austin, under the direction of Nettie Lee Benson, with his dissertation on Vicente Rocafuerte and the rise of Latin American identity. Academic career He began teaching at California State University, Long Beach, remaining there 1969‚Äì1973. In 1974, he began his career at University of California, Irvine, where he taught until his retirement. Between 1980 and 1986, he was Graduate Dean and Vice Chancellor for Research. He was the founding editor of the peer-reviewed journal, Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, a bilingual, binational journal published jointly with the University of California and the National University of Mexico. In his published work, Rodr√≠guez O. contends that Latin America was not isolated from events in the rest of the western world, so that it was actively involved in the events of the Atlantic Revolutions. Although the American Revolution and the French Revolution were known throughout the confines of the Spanish monarchy, he argues that they did not directly influence the Spanish territories in the Americas. Rather, Rodr√≠guez suggests that the imprisonment of Ferdinand VII during the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and the subsequent institutional vacuum that this created were the direct causes of the collapse of the Spanish monarchy. It is in this context that countless Juntas succeed each other both on the Iberian peninsula and in Spanish America that sought to represent a government free from French influence, but faithful to the Spanish monarch and monarchy as an institution. The distrust of many Americans of peninsular-born Spaniards and that of many peninsulares in the Americans led to civil wars in which in many cases entire families were divided between insurgents and royalists. Rodr√≠guez O. has emphasized the importance of the influence of the 1812 Constitution of C√°diz on Spanish America, especially in New Spain and the Kingdom of Quito. He contends this constitution was much more representative and inclusive than many of its contemporaries, including ones from Latin America, which were much more traditional. He stresses the role of elections as a starting point for modern representative governance in Latin America and as one of the reasons why the wars for independence lasted at least a decade.

His documentaries tend to focus on bands who had attracted attention in their time but whose history had been lost; in particular he is regarded for his coverage of the early 1980s Cork music scene. McDermott has written for RT√â Culture, The Irish Times and the Sunday Independent, and is the host of \\"Songs to Learn and Sing\\" with Dublin City FM. Originally from Cork, he now lives in Dublin where he is Head of Media & Arts at Rathmines College of Further Education. In the mid-1990s, McDermott was the Information officer of the Cork Music Resource Co-op, established in 1994 to \\"provide information to [local] musicians and bands on all aspects of the music industry.\\"Power, Ed. \\"B-Side the Leeside: 'Ten by Ten' and Cork‚Äôs mid-90s indie soundscape\\".

They also organised the design and printing of posters and flyers, promoted series of gigs, and reached out to UK record labels. McDermott began to produce audio documentaries in the early 2000's. Describing \\"Get That Monster Off The Stage, parts I & II\\", broadcaster Mike McGrath-Bryan said that they \\"comprehensively cover both the legacy of Finbarr Donnelly and really the post-punk scene that was operating out of [Cork in the early 1980s]. [The documentaries] lead to an increased knowledge of the history of the Cork music scene; the relative ahistoricality has been shaken off\\". The documentary won the \\"Radio Production of the Year\\" award at the 2002 SMEDIA Awards. Myles Dungan, chairman of the judging panel, said: ‚ÄúThis is a fascinating snapshot of the vibrant Cork music scene of the 80‚Äôs. The producer constructed a compelling account of cult rock hero Finbarr Donnelly. The program itself is an excellent weave of music and the spoken word, and is unobtrusively informative.\\" The documentary was re-edited in 2008 to include contributions from band guitarist Ricky Dineen. In a later interview, Dineen that he had withdrawn from playing music until the revival of interest created by the documentary.

It is considered a major part of British cuisine.  History  In the early 1880s, Chinese food items and eating houses appeared in London and Liverpool, mainly visited by Chinese seamen and students. In 1884, Chinese food was made available as part of a 'restaurant' in the International Health Exhibition in South Kensington, London. In 1907 or 1908, the first recorded Chinese restaurant was opened in London. The rise in the number of Chinese restaurants in the UK only began after the Second World War, and has been attributed to returning service personnel from Hong Kong. The restaurants were operated by Hong Kongers who moved to the UK. In 2011, the Ming-Ai (London) Institute launched the British Chinese Food Culture project with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, aimed at exploring and tracking the changes in Chinese food throughout its history in the United Kingdom. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted many Chinese restaurants in the UK, with a number of restaurants in London's Chinatown in particular facing financial difficulty, due to lockdown restrictions and social distancing as well as prejudice against Chinese takeaways which the BBC describe as \\"unfounded\\".  Cuisine and regional variations  Chinese food is considered a major part of British cuisine. Restaurants increasingly offer authentic Chinese dishes. In 2017, over 80% of Londoners reported having been to a Chinese takeaway.

On 26 November 2003, soldiers from the UGP kidnapped car washer Ars√©nio \\"Cherokee\\" Sebasti√£o and threw him into the sea off the Mussulo peninsula where he would later drown. The reason for this was because of his singing of an anti-Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos rap, with his drowning in front of witnesses being seen as a type of lesson to others with similar sentiments. A beer vendor at the scene described the guards reasoning, recalling that the guards said that \\"the youth was a bandit, who spoke ill of the president and thus had to be killed.\\" The incident changed the local citizen's relationship with the UGP, with local media groups dubbing the guard as the Fedayeen a reference to the military groups willing to sacrifice themselves in service to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. According to the newspaper Jeune Afrique, in the course of the 2010‚Äì2011 Ivorian crisis, 92 soldiers from the UPG were sent to protect President Laurent Gbagbo in the presidential residence in Abidjan and repel the Republican Forces of C√¥te d'Ivoire fought.

It stars Sarita Choudhury and Erin McMurtry as Shareen Lightfoot and Claire Mayakovsky, two lesbian parents who are drawn into a corporate conspiracy involving the Fresh Kills Landfill. Fresh Kill was an official selection at the 1994 Berlin International Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival and is noted for its influence on hacker subculture, with an article about the film for the now-defunct hacker publication InfoNation containing one of the first uses of the term \\"hacktivism\\". Synopsis Shareen Lightfoot and Claire Mayakovsky raise their daughter Honey near the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island in New York City. Shareen works as a salvager recovering refuse from the landfill, while Claire works as a waitress at a sushi restaurant. The city is heavily contaminated with pollution that adversely affects local animals and food; Claire brings home contaminated fish from the restaurant that is eaten by Honey, who begins glowing green and then vanishes. Shareen and Claire discover that the multinational GX Corporation is responsible for the pollution and Honey's disappearance, and become involved in an effort to hack and expose the company with sushi chef and hacker Jiannbin Lui, and poet and dishwasher Miguel Flores. Cast * Sarita Choudhury as Shareen Lightfoot * Erin McMurtry as Claire Mayakovsky * Abraham Lim as Jiannbin Lui * Jos√© Z√∫√±iga as Miguel Flores * Laurie Carlos as Mimi Mayakovsky * Will Kempe as Stuart Sterling * Nelini Stamp as Honey * Rino Thunder as Clayton Lightfoot Production Fresh Kill was directed by Shu Lea Cheang and written by Jessica Hagedorn. The film bills itself as \\"eco cyber noia\\", the term \\"cyber noia\\" (or \\"cybernoia\\") having been coined by Cheang to describe \\"massive intrusions of networking technology into people's lives,\\" and what she foresaw as \\"a future where multinational media empires clash with hackers.\\" Cheang has stated that the film was motivated by a desire to depict the relationship between the media and environmental racism, drawing parallels between the dumping of industrial toxic waste in the Third World with \\"the dumping of garbage TV programs\\" into Third World countries. Hagedorn has stated that she wished to invert typical expectations and clich√© stock characters, though sought not to \\"reverse things for their own sake,\\" noting that Honey's parentage and the differing races of characters with direct biological relations are specifically never explained. Release The film premiered on April 23, 1994 at the USA Film Festival, and was an official selection at the 1994 Berlin International Film Festival and at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United States on January 12, 1996. Fresh Kill also screened at the Whitney Biennial in 1995, and at the Asian American International Film Festival in 2019. Critical response and legacy In a review for The Los Angeles Times, critic Kevin Thomas offered praise for Cheang's direction and Hagedorn's writing, noting that the film's \\"interaction of a deteriorating environment, burgeoning cyberspace and mounting urban paranoia [...] create a vividly contemporary background\\" for a \\"gentle lesbian love story.\\" The Quad Cinema, where the film had its U.S. premiere, called Fresh Kill \\"an underseen radical feminist gem\\" and favorably compared it to Brazil and Born in Flames. Conversely, Janet Maslin of The New York Times offered praise for the film's soundtrack but described Fresh Kill as \\"aimless, arty self-indulgence carried to a remarkable extreme,\\" while Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club surmised that the film was \\"too confused and disjointed to be anything but a well-intentioned, intermittently interesting failure.\\" The film is noted for its themes of solidarity by marginalized groups against racism and sexism; its condemnation of transnational capitalism; and its depiction of how \\"resistance circulates through networks originally designed to facilitate the exchange of labor, commodities, and capital.\\" In her analysis of Fresh Kill, Gina Marchetti notes how the film depicts \\"the emancipatory potential of the digital,\\" offering \\"hope for seizing the means of communication by reflecting on its own production and providing an image of radical media empowerment to inspire others.\\" The film is noted for its influence on hacker subculture, with a 1995 article about the film for the now-defunct hacker publication InfoNation containing one of the first uses of the term \\"hacktivism\\".

Biography  Calcraft was born in St George Hanover Square, London, the son of John Calcraft of Rempstone, Dorset, and Elizabeth Hales, daughter of Sir Thomas Pym Hales. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford University. While at Oxford, it was reported of him by John Stuart Wortley that, ‚Äòlittle Calcraft has been great fun lately'. Like his father and grandfather before him, Calcraft seemed to have had a passion for the theatre. He purchased a commission to the army in 1824 and was made an unattached captain in 1826. Having been elected to Brooks‚Äôs on the 21st of February 1825, it may have been he and not his brother, John, who carried to Lord Lansdowne a message from the Whig meeting at the club in April 1827 urging him not to break off negotiations for joining the Canning administration. However, it is possible he was out of the country at that time, as he certainly served abroad for a while with his regiment. On his return in 1828, Calcraft became enamoured of Sarah Emma Love, an actress who had joined the company at Drury Lane theatre from Covent Garden and was known for her role in Cobb‚Äôs comic opera, The Siege of Belgrade. In November 1828, they married at St. Pancras church. The marriage was kept secret from his father, who he thought would disapprove, and also from her mother for a brief period of time. Emma refused to cohabit for fear of losing her theatre contract, and within months of the marriage Robert Sherard, 6th Earl of Harborough, had renewed a former interest in her, even as Calcraft sought her assurance that she would join him. The husband and usurper did confront each other, whereupon Calcraft was said to have demanded satisfaction, but in July 1829 Emma eloped with Sherard while on tour in Nottingham and went to live in a cottage on his estate at Stapleford Park in Leicestershire. In February of 1830, Calcraft was granted a formal separation from her, and afterward brought a bill of divorce in the House of Lords. In the course of evidence, a servant stated that Emma had been, \\"afraid, or appeared to me to be afraid, Lord Harborough was seeking her, notwithstanding he knew she was married; that he was seeking to possess her; and she said she would rather sweep the Corners of the Streets than be his Mistress, if that was his Object.\\" The bill fell away following the dissolution of parliament, owing to Calcraft's inability to bear the expense, as he later claimed, and the marriage remained valid in law.  Role in Parliament  Calcraft was elected to the family constituency of Wareham in the 1831 general election, won by the Whig Party. The seat had previously been held by his father and by his older brother, John Hales Calcraft. He voted for the second reading of the Grey ministry‚Äôs reintroduced reform bill. He presented the petition from Wareham for its retaining one seat, but the following day he conceded that, although the borough was prosperous and almost viable in terms of population, it could not be saved from some degree of disenfranchisement under schedule A. He voted for swearing the original Dublin election committee. He divided for the passage of the reform bill and Lord Ebrington‚Äôs confidence motion. He voted for the second reading of the revised bill, to go into committee on it. He divided against the second reading of Hobhouse‚Äôs vestry bill. He voted for Ebrington‚Äôs motion for an address calling on the William IV to appoint only ministers who would carry the reform bill unimpaired and the second reading of the Irish reform bill. He divided in the minority for Buxton‚Äôs motion for a select committee on colonial slavery, and spoke and voted to abolish flogging in the army. Arriving late at the debate on adding Corfe Castle to the reprieved constituency of Wareham, he opposed the idea because it would give the nomination to the Bankes family, local Tory rivals. His only other known votes were with government for the Russian-Dutch loan. His older brother, with whom he differed in politics, had succeeded to the family estates after their father‚Äôs suicide in September 1831 and intended the remaining seat at Wareham for himself. In an address of 18 June 1832 Calcraft therefore declined to come forward as a Liberal at the impending general election because of his ‚Äòapprehension of a painful family collision‚Äô. He left the House at the dissolution later that year and never sat again. After living at a succession of London addresses, Calcraft was held to be insolvent In 1839, but successfully petitioned for release from the Fleet prison late that year. Little more is known of him until he turned up in the United States in 1847, with an appointment in New York as the British Government packet agent, procured through the influence of the marquess of Clanricarde. He seems to have moved in theatrical circles and was well known in the city. In 1852, he testified in the notorious divorce case of Edwin and Catharine Forrest, in which he twice declined to answer character questions in cross-examination regarding the identity of his wife and of an ex-actress, Mrs Robinson, he was alleged to have visited in uptown Manhattan one evening after leaving the Forrest house. The circumstances attracted great public interest, but the jury found that Mrs Forrest had not committed adultery with Calcraft. In January 1855, Calcraft died in New York and was buried in Greenwood cemetery.

A member of a wealthy mulatto family, Dereef was a prominent member of South Carolinian society but was subject to discrimination due to his race. He was considered one of the wealthiest black men in Charleston, South Carolina and served as a city alderman during the Reconstruction era.  Biography  Dereef was from a wealthy mulatto family in Charleston. Although well educated and wealthy, he was subject to discrimination due to his race. Unlike other freedmen, Dereef did not have to pay the Free Black Man's Tax, as he claimed Native American descent from his grandmother. In 1823 he and his cousin, John Cain, went to court and persuaded a Charleston magistrate that the Dereef and Cain families were legitimately descended from Native Americans, exempting them and their children from the tax. He and his brother, Joseph Dereef (1802‚Äì1876) worked as wood factors. The family business operated from Dereef's Wharf. He also owned rental properties on the East Side of Charleston, and some of his tenants were white people. He was considered one of the richest black men in Charleston. Dereef built a house in Wraggborough. He was a slave owner, and owned as many as sixteen to twenty slaves at a time. Dereef served as a city alderman, having been appointed by military authorities in 1868 during the Reconstruction era. He generally allied himself with Democrats. In 1872 he was elected to the standing committee of the Brown Fellowship Society. He left a will and testament upon his death.  Legacy  Dereef Court and Dereef Park in Charleston are named after him. In 2012, Dereef Park was slated to be developed with housing units despite protests. In 2017 a compromise was reached to incorporate a park and the historic praise house along with residential development.

The term is used to describe the economy of the Soviet Union and the economies of the Soviet Bloc which closely followed the Soviet model. In his 2004 book The Political Economy of Stalinism: Evidence from the Soviet Secret Archives, Paul Roderick Gregory argues that the collapse of the Soviet Union was due to the inherent drawbacks of the system, namely poor planning, low expertise of planners, unreliable supply lines, conflict between planners and producers and the dictatorial chain of command. Gregory writes that \\"the system was managed by thousands of 'Stalins' in a nested dictatorship\\". Once the enterprizes gained some freedom during perestroika, the rigid system imploded.\\"The Political Economy of Stalinism\\", a Hoover Institution press- release about Paul Gregory's book, January 23, 2004  History of the term  Already in 1985, John Howard's article \\"The Soviet Union has an administered, not a planned, economy\\" argued that the common description of the Soviet-type economic planning as planned economy is misleading. While central planning did play an important role, the Soviet economy was de facto characterized by the priority of highly centralized management over planning. Therefore, he writes the correct term would be \\"centrally managed\\" rather than \\"centrally planned\\" economy. The term administrative system was introduced by Russian economist Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov during the perestroika period in the Soviet Union as the title of a section in his 1987 article \\"From the Point of View of an Economist\\" Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov \\"From the Point of View of an Economist\\" ([S tochki zreniya ekonomista]), Science and Life, no. 4, 1987 which analyzed the novel of Alexander Bek, ' banned in the Soviet Union.

Career  Little has been published about Turner's decisions or activities while serving on the court. However, one news article noted that he had written a court opinion establishing that lands allotted by the government to former slaves (freedmen) in the Chickasaw nation were exempt from taxation. However, another case brought by freedmen of Garvin County to enjoin the collection of taxes on their allotments resulted in a claim that the government never actually allotted the land and, moreover, did not intend to compensate freedmen in the same way as their former owners. The Garvin judge awarded a demurrer based on this claim. By then (1914), Justice W. R.

Hay was also the co-organiser of the MGMS ‚ÄòQM/MM methods and applications‚Äô conference held in 2017.  Notable work  In 2012, Hay and Nigel Scrutton published a paper on how vibrations may affect enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The paper provided an insight to motions which may reduce the size of the energy barrier along the reaction coordinate which may aid hydrogen- transfer reactions. The roles of these comprehensive motions and the understanding of the structural origins to these motions were not previously researched, and indirect experimental evidence and computational simulations were used to aid provide the insight into these good vibrations or motions. In 2015, Hay also participated in research which first published a paper on a new, soluble, oxygen tolerant reductive dehalogenase enzyme. Organohalides in general contribute to a large proportion of environmental pollutants and the enzyme reductive dehalogenase is responsible for the biological dehalogenation in organohalide respiring bacteria. However, some of these enzymes are usually membrane associated and oxygen sensitive and therefore inhibits the process of dehalogenation, which the enzyme published upon was able to overcome.

The Leonidas Stone School is a work of art an embodiment of government work project during the Great Depression and a working school for over 8 decades. Current Use The School is a working school part of the Colon Public School System. It houses grades K‚Äì8. Building history The building that is now known as the Leonidas Stone School opened in 1935. Construction began on December 15, 1933. The building architect was Randall Wagner. It was part of President Franklin D. Rosevelt's New Deal Civil Works Administration. The building was built by two local stonemasons Charlie Blue and Laverne Harmon. These two were acclaimed fieldstone builders who were well known in Southern Michigan from the 1920-1950s. It is believed that all the stone is from fieldstone from local farms. Under the terms of the CWA project, the work had to be finished by Feb. 15, when construction only started in December. \\"The Leonidas village school district [had] submitted a proposal for a new school building. Plans call for cobblestone construction.\\" The Construction of the building was to be a building 60 by 60 feet with four rooms and a basement, it was to be one story high. 18 men were employed to build the building. The Stone school was replacing the Leonidas village school which was built in 1859 and only cost $1,000 to build. Charles Robinson was in charge of the carpentry work and Charles Blue of the Mason work. The interior of the stone school was an oak interior in the four-room schoolhouse. The School was just one of several CWA projects in St. Joseph County. From the passage of the CWA till March St. Joseph County had spent $121.601.14 for all projects including the Stone School. In the State of Michigan all 72,000 workers were issued a dismissal order as the funding for the CWA projects ended on April 1, 1934. The St. Joseph County Fairgrounds even saw improvements during the winter work of the CWA. All the buildings were painted a new track was built and other improvements made. School History In 1997, it was proposed that students would stop using the old fieldstone School and bus them to another location. The school chairman at the time of the opening of the Stone School was Mark Smith, with the teacher for junior high school as Walter Gorsline, and Miss Grace Jenkins as a teacher of the grade school. The Stone School celebrated its 60th Anniversary on May 27, 1995, where they invited all prior students, teachers and community members back to share in the school's history. History of the Stones Fieldstone is a nuisance for farmers and have to remove from the field during the nineteenth century they began to be used for construction. However, the stones can trace their roots in the Michigan area from Glacial deposits mostly from the last glacial period known as the Wisconsin Glaciation. Site of Interest The Stone School House is listed on several cites for Michigan History and architecture as a place to visit. The Stone School is sometimes including on Historic tours of the area.

Players control the protagonist Alucard as they explore Dracula's Castle. Upon defeating Shaft, a minion of Dracula, players are able to enter the Inverted Castle, an upside down version of the original castle. The Inverted Castle was included because the designers wanted to add more content without having to create new assets. The Inverted Castle served as inspiration for multiple games, 2014's Strider and Igarashi's Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. The Inverted Castle received generally mixed reception. Some critics, such as those for IGN, GamePro, and Edge felt it was one of the best gaming moments, citing how it is designed to be playable in both orientations. Staff for IGN and The Escapist felt it was an important factor to why Symphony of the Night was so good. Other critics, such as USgamer staff, were more critical; they felt that it was at times tedious and \\"annoying,\\" though senior editor Kat Bailey found the \\"meta aspect\\" fit with the \\"weird and chaotic\\" nature of Dracula's Castle. Summary The Inverted Castle appears in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, floating above the game's standard castle in the sky while obscured by clouds. It is hidden until the protagonist, Alucard, defeats Shaft, a minion of the castle's ruler, Dracula, using a pair of holy glasses to see him. If players do not have this item and defeat Richter Belmont instead (who is being possessed by Shaft), the game will end there. Alucard can then travel between these two locations. The Inverted Castle has the same layout of the regular castle, except upside down, and it is treated as a separate map. It contains new enemies and items to encounter, and Alucard must collect various relics of Dracula in order to do combat with him. At one point, he encounters zombies that assume the form of Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, and Grant DaNasty, all of whom appear in the video game Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse as his allies. Concept and creation The Inverted Castle was created for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which was directed by Koji Igarashi. According to Igarashi, it was created due to the designers wanting to add more content in a way that would be easier than creating new assets. The map of Symphony of the Night is designed in such a way that it works in both orientations. The open world and emphasis on exploration of Symphony of the Night takes inspiration from The Legend of Zelda, as well as the exploration- focused Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. Reception The Inverted Castle has received mixed reception; it is regarded as a significant video game secret. Developer Jonathan Blow talked about how it was a \\"cool\\" secret that \\"everybody freaked out about\\" and discussed how the Inverted Castle stood in contrast to modern game design. He stated that modern game design tends towards trying to push players into a certain play experience. GamePro staff listed the discovery of the Inverted Castle as the one of the greatest gaming moments, while Edge staff ranked Symphony of the Night as one of the best games to play today, citing the Inverted Castle as a key reason for why it is \\"genius.\\" IGN writer Marty Sliva called it a \\"triumph of level design\\" and that it \\"melted [players'] mind[s]\\" when they experienced it, and IGN staff regarded it as the greatest secret levels in video games. It was also included in IGNs list of the most memorable video game moments, with Sliva feeling that the Inverted Castle helped make Symphony of the Night one of the best video games. The Escapist writer Daniel Pereira agreed with its significance to Symphony of the Nights popularity, calling it a \\"truly remarkable feature\\" and \\"just as beautiful\\" as the regular castle. RPGFan writer Josh Curry identified it as one of the reasons he respected Symphony of the Night as much as he did. Eurogamer writer Jeffrey Matulef called it \\"brilliant design,\\" noting that while it sounds \\"lazy and repetitious,\\" it was anything but, and helped designers add more content easily. Game Informer writer Tim Turi described it as a \\"powerful feeling\\" to discover the Inverted Castle and how the castle was designed to be played upside down, expressing hope that Igarashi would explore this idea in the future. Kotaku writer Peter Tieryas discussed how the Inverted Castle ties into the inversion of Dracula's name and Alucard's need to oppose his father and destroy his past, citing the fight against fake versions of Trevor, Sypha, and Grant. Author Paul Martin discussed how the Inverted Castle, as well as players' and Alucard's strength and ease of movement, represents both of their ownership over the castle, and the risk of Alucard becoming more like his father. Screen Rant writer Leon Miller found the Inverted Castle unsatisfying, criticizing it for being too similar to the normal castle. USgamer writer Jeremy Parish compared it to the Dark World in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, a \\"twisted version\\" of the main world of that game. Parish felt that the game was not designed with the Inverted Castle in mind, criticizing it for requiring constant transformations by Alucard to reach certain heights. He also felt that the difficulty of the area was achieved through being annoying. Despite this, he appreciated references to Castlevania II: Simon's Quest and Castlevania III; he cited the fight with Trevor, Sypha, and Grant as an example of the designers trying to \\"develop a curve of complexity\\" despite the difficulty of doing so when the protagonist has grown so strong. He also enjoyed the references made to non-Castlevania works, such as The Wizard of Oz. Fellow USgamer Mike Williams agreed with Parish's criticisms; he felt that it was interesting to see the castle upside down, but had poor flow and felt like backtracking. He felt it was the worst aspect of an \\"otherwise excellent game.\\" USgamer senior editor Kat Bailey agreed with Parish's criticisms, though noted that she appreciated the \\"meta aspect\\" of the Inverted Castle, namely that Dracula's Castle is meant to be \\"weird and chaotic,\\" calling it a \\"great twist\\" and appreciating it for being more open in its exploration. Another USgamer writer, Nadia Oxford, found the Inverted Castle enjoyable, showing appreciation for how the \\"deepest cataombs\\" of the castle wind up in the sky. However, Oxford was critical of \\"lacking\\" soundtrack in the Inverted Castle. Legacy Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, a game created by Igarashi, also features an Inverted Castle. The designers of the 2014 video game Strider reference the Inverted Castle multiple times in the game.

She participated in the Naval Battle of Campeche in 1843. She was one of the first paddle warships to see action in a naval battle. She was then purchased by the Spanish Navy, renamed Castilla and was their first steam warship to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Background of the Mexican Navy The Mexican Navy has its origins in the creation of the Ministry of War in 1821. From that year until 1939 it existed jointly with the Mexican Army in the organic ministry. Since its declaration of independence from Spain in September 1810, through the mid decades of the 19th century, Mexico found itself in a constant state of war, mostly against Spain which had not recognized its independence. Therefore, its priority was to purchase its first fleet from the U.S. in order to displace the last remaining Spanish forces from its coasts. Construction of the Montezuma The Montezuma, probably named after Montezuma the last ruler of the Aztec Empire, was built in the Blackwall Yard of London in 1842 as a wooden paddle frigate of around 1,000 tons displacement. Her complement was 6 officers and 75 ratings. It was intended she would mount two 68-pounder guns that fired explosive shells, two 32-pounder guns and four 32 pounder carronades and one 9 pounder gun. Due to diplomatic action in May 1842 by William Kennedy, Republic of Texas consul general in London, and Ashbel Smith, minister to England, she was delivered unarmed as a merchant ship with her guns in her hold. Her first Captain was Commander Richard Francis Cleaveland, of the Royal Navy. HMS Sidon 68 pounder pivot gun 1855 LOC 05685u Career A trial voyage from Blackwall to the Lower Hope and back was made on 28 July 1842. After crossing the Atlantic Ocean on 18 December 1842 she made port at St. Thomas and loaded coal. She then proceeded to Vera Cruz to have her guns fitted and her crew brought up to strength. For her first operation on 20 January 1843 she left Vera Cruz with about 1,500 troops for the Yucatan. After her return she was again despatched to the Yucatan on 21 February 1843 to aid in the siege of the rebels at Campeche. On 1 March 1843. she again arrived at Campeche from Vera Cruz with reinforcements. For her last action before the Naval Battle of Campeche on 14 March 1843 she boarded the schooner ‚ÄòTwo Sons‚Äô, had a glass of wine and left. At Toculxa, near Mexico, a fever was raging and on 29 April 1843 it was reported that Captain Richard Francis Cleaveland and several of the crew, had died, and nearly all the remainder were on the sick list. Naval Battle of Campeche 30 April 1843 and 16 May 1843 The Mexican fleet now possessed the steam frigates Guadalupe and Montezuma. The Texas Navy commander Moore hoped to encounter the Guadalupe separate from her escort Montezuma.* Austin and Wharton made for the Yucat√°n coast and encountered the Mexican squadron on 30 April 1843 between Lerma and Campeche. Montezuma and Guadalupe, along with four smaller vessels, comprised the Mexican fleet. The Texans were augmented by two Yucatecan ships and five small gunboats, but were clearly the smaller fleet. The Mexican shooting at first fell short and then went over the Texas ships. During the two-hour running battle the Austin was struck once in the fighting and lost some of her mizzen rigging and the Guadalupe had 7 dead and the Montezuma 13 dead. After a few hours, the Mexican sailing ships departed and only the two steamers remained. The result was that the Mexican blockade of the port of Campeche was lifted and the Texan ships put into the port for repairs. This first attack was a draw and the fleets separated. The next event on 16 May 1843 was orchestrated by Commodore Moore and his \\"Texians\\" who lured the Mexican Forces into a narrow roadstead, and hounded the Mexican ships away from the harbour firing most of Austin's ammunition as Wharton was not able to engage. The battle toll came out as; \\"Austin\\" 3 dead, \\"Wharton\\" 2 dead, \\"Montezuma\\" 40 dead including her captain and \\"Guadalupe\\" 47 dead. The Mexican Fleet was effectively incapacitated. This battle would represent the only time that steam-driven warships would be defeated by sail powered ships. There were numerous falsehoods circulated about Moore's battle with Guadalupe. These seem to be largely the confections of the press, egged on by politicians, and are not to be taken seriously. They include claims to have sunk her. After Campeche On 4 June 1843, it was reported that the Texans caused serious damage to the vessel at the Naval Battle of Campeche. She was overhauled in the U.S. in 1844. On 26 February 1844 she once again sailed from Vera Cruz for Campeche. Next was another Atlantic Ocean crossing and on 15 August 1844 she arrived in Morocco. Next she on 17 August 1844 she sailed from Morocco for Tunis. Finally in August 1846 with Guadalupe she was sold to the Spanish Navy to become their first steam warships and delivered at Havana, Cuba. She was renamed Castilla at this time. She was used under Spanish service as dispatch vessel. In 1847 April she was the first Spanish steam warship to cross the Atlantic. In 1849, the Castilla and Le√≥n were used with two other Spanish steam ships to intervene in Italy along with French forces during the suppressing of the Roman Republic (1849). The steam ships transported 9,000 troops to Italy and provided logistical support for them for months. The resulting recognition from the Pope, Sardinia, Prussia and Austria strengthened the Spanish government versus its rival Carlist faction.

It is currently located at 8 Imam Bonjol Street () in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta, near significant city landmarks like the Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum and Taman Suropati. History The Philippine Embassy in Jakarta was initially opened as a consulate on November 24, 1949, a month before the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and the then- United States of Indonesia on December 27, 1949. Two months earlier, the Philippine government had dispatched Vicente Pastrana, who was previously posted as the first secretary to the Philippine Embassy in Washington D.C., to serve as the mission's consul, with Marciano Joven serving as vice-consul. The consulate was upgraded to a legation on February 17, 1950, when President Elpidio Quirino appointed Manuel V. Gallego, who had served as his Secretary of Education, as the first minister to Indonesia. Despite the Indonesian government having already accredited an ambassador to the Philippines, the Philippine government initially continued to only accredit ministers to Indonesia, ostensibly due to financial difficulties. It was not until April 20, 1951 when Quirino appointed former Senator Domingo Imperial as the first ambassador to Indonesia, and the legation upgraded to a full embassy ‚Äî the first Philippine embassy to be established in a Southeast Asian nation. The Embassy and its related facilities have been a target for terrorist attacks, the most serious of which was the bombing on the ambassadorial residence on August 1, 2000 which injured Ambassador Leonides Caday ‚Äî the first time a Philippine diplomatic mission had been bombed. Security was tightened as a result of the bombing, believed to have been masterminded by leading Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) operative Fathur Rahman al-Ghozi. Two years later, the Embassy had been threatened with another possible bombing by followers of another JI member, Agus Dwikarna, who is believed to have masterminded the 2000 Rizal Day bombings along with al-Ghozi, and was convicted that year on explosives charges. Thousands of protesters then, on his orders, stormed the Embassy to demand his release. Security was also tightened again in 2003 owing to continuing possible threats. Building Although the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta has been located in the same address since it first opened in 1949, the original chancery was demolished in 2010 to make way for the construction of a new, upgraded chancery building on the same site. Construction of the new chancery began with a groundbreaking on March 20, 2014, and the new building was inaugurated on September 12, 2015. The current chancery, a two-story structure designed by architect Azhari Rasuman, combines the design of the traditional Filipino bahay na bato and nipa hut, while also maintaining the fa√ßade in New Indies Style, as mandated for buildings being built in the area. Construction of the new chancery was contracted to Indonesian firm PT Dekotama Ciptakreasi. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Jakarta is currently headed by Ambassador Lee Hiong T. Wee, who was appointed to the position by President Rodrigo Duterte on January 19, 2018. Prior to becoming Ambassador, Wee, a teacher and businessman from Zamboanga City, was the founder of the W Group of Companies, one of the Philippines' largest exporters of dried seaweed. His appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on February 21, 2018, and Wee presented his credentials to Indonesian President Joko Widodo on August 13, 2018. Many of the Embassy's activities center around building ties between the two countries, with a particular emphasis in recent years between the southern Philippines and eastern Indonesia. In 2016, it hosted an event alongside the Department of Trade and Industry showcasing Philippine companies in a bid to increase their profile in Indonesia, while also hosting a familiarization tour for Indonesian companies looking to invest in the Philippines three years later, and lobbying for increased transport links. The Embassy has also played a key role in promoting cultural and educational ties between the two countries, particularly with Muslim students in the Philippines studying in Indonesia. In 2015, the Embassy was criticized for its role in mishandling the case of Mary Jane Veloso, the only Filipino on death row in Indonesia, with members of the House of Representatives' committee on overseas workers affairs demanding the recall of its consul general.

Biography  Jesse Draxler grew up in a rural town in Wisconsin. His family had an automobile repair service and as a child he used to draw cars, trucks and engines for hours with friends. In first grade, Draxler discovered that he was color blind, being red-green color deficient. He studied at the College of Visual Arts in St. Paul, Minnesota. His thesis was on the commodification of subculture through the lens of punk rock, whose primary medium was collage. Draxler began making exhibitions in 2012. On June 1, 2018, Draxler released the book Misophonia through Sacred Bones. The 100-page art book included a foreword written by musician Greg Puciato. On June 15, Draxler and Puciato co- founded the record label and art collective Federal Prisoner. On September 27, 2018, Draxler premiered a short film at Figge Art Museum in Davenport, Iowa with live score by Emma Ruth Rundle and Evan Patterson. On September 4, 2020, Draxler will release Reigning Cement, an audio-visual project consisting of a 100-page book of photographs and collages paired with a music album formed by audio assets given to thirty-four musicians, who could arrange them at their disposal but only adding vocals, mirroring the sonic equivalent of a collage. Both the visual and audio material was taken from the noisy industrial area outside of Draxler's studio, which is located on the outskirts of Los Angeles. On April 3, Draxler released its first single \\"Time reign cemenT\\", featuring Full of Hell vocalist Dylan Walker, alongside a music video premiered on Revolver. On June 12, it was released the second single and video for \\"Them\\", featuring electronic band Vowws, through Juxtapoz.  Artistry  Jesse Draxler is a mixed media and multidisciplinary artist, and his pieces combine painting, photography, collage, typography and digital painting. Among their characteristics are distorting the human form, working in grayscale, and abstract landscapes. Writer Kyle Fitzpatrick described his portrayals as \\"a person mid-question ... Everything is abstracted just slightly, just enough to unnerve and entrance ... [It] feels as if his subjects are slowly focusing and refocusing, trying to become clearer\\", while artist Mike Carney said that it \\"is an authentic look into the transitional stasis of a technologically saturated existence, and the lapse of connection, far from bridged within its void.\\" Jesse Draxler's varied influences include heavy metal and electronic music, Zen literature, automotive machinery, background noise, and films. He says that much of his work \\"involves directly translating what I hear into what I see.\\" He tends to write and journal extensively before working, believing that \\"the inception starts with thinking about it or processing an idea in my mind.\\" Before relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in January 2015, Draxler cut out all color and started to work solely in black and white. As a colorblind person, he described his transition as \\"natural\\" and felt that it opened up his artistic vision rather than limiting it. Draxler's work has inspired music by Daniel Davies and Zola Jesus.

Fernandes de Elvas and his family were Marranos; that is to say Sephardic Jews who conformed outwardly as Crist√£o-Novo due to the demands of the Portuguese Crown but privately continued to adhere to Judaism. He was contracted by the Spanish Empire with an official asiento to provide their colonies in the Spanish Americas with African slaves from 27 September 1615 to 1 April 1623. During this time, he was the Contratodore (monopolist trader) for the Atlantic slave trade in Portuguese West Africa: Angola, Cape Verde and Guinea. He was succeeded in his position as monopolist for providing slaves to the Spanish by a fellow Marrano, Manuel Rodrigues Lamego. Biography Ant√≥nio Fernandes de Elvas was born in the Kingdom of Portugal to a Sephardic Jewish converso family, who had outwardly conformed to the Catholic Church to avoid being expelled from the country, but continued to practice Judaism in private. Fernandes de Elvas and his family was engaged in the spice trade, particularly black pepper from Portuguese India. Following the Portuguese Succession War, the Iberian Union (1580‚Äì1640) was formed whereby the Habsburg Spanish Empire took control of Portugal. The Portuguese had established essential trade routes in West Africa as part of the Portuguese Empire since the 15th century. Their merchants, including Sephardic Jews, started the Atlantic slave trade, whereby African slaves purchased from West African traders were brought to work sugar cane and other plantations in Portuguese America. This period, known as the \\"first Atlantic system,\\" lasted from 1502 until 1580. After the Union, the Spanish wanted to expand slavery in their American domains and so awarded an asiento, an official monopoly licence, to experienced traders who had knowledge of West Africa; the two main groups competing for the asiento were the Portuguese Sephardic conversos and the Genoese. Marrano slave-trading families other than Fernandes de Elvas that formed part of this international network were: Rodrigues, Jim√©nez, Noronha, Mendes, Pallos Dias, Caballero, Jorge and Caldeira. It is this position that was awarded to Ant√≥nio Fernandes de Elvas from 1615 until 1623. The two main places in the Spanish Americas that slaves from Africa were brought under Fernandes de Elvas were Cartagena de Indias (in modern Colombia) and Veracruz (in modern Mexico) from here they were distributed out towards what is today Venezuela, the Antilles and Lima (through Portobello and Panama) then by land to Upper Peru and Potos√≠. This transportation itself is estimated to have caused more deaths than the Atlantic crossing itself. For its era, Fernandes de Elvas' time as asiento represented the most intense uptick of the slave trade and largest mass movement of African slaves to the Americas since the trade had began, most of it from Luanda, Portuguese Angola and the Portuguese Congo. Between 1619 and 1624, crossing over into the period that Fernandes de Elvas' successor and fellow Marrano, Manuel Rodrigues de Lamego took over as asiento, 11,328 Africans slaves were purchased and brought to Cartagena. This was only interrupted by the Dutch Capture of Bahia and a temporary blockade of Luanda, which began a sway towards the Dutch West India Company. In the decade or so after Fernandes de Elvas' death, the Spanish Inquisition, which had been in Lima since 1570, Mexico since 1571 and Cartagena since 1610 began a more severe crackdown on the Portuguese converso merchants as a class, disrupting the trade network that Fernandes de Elvas had represented. Personal life Ant√≥nio Fernandes de Elvas was married to Elena Rodrigues Sol√≠s, she, like her husband was of Marrano background. This made Fernandes de Elvas the son-in-law of Jorge Rodrigues de Sol√≠s and the brother-in-law of Jer√≥nimo Rodrigues de Sol√≠s; indeed Jer√≥nimo worked under his brother-in-law in the slave trade in Cape Verde and Angola. Their son Jorge Fernandes de Elvas was married to the daughter of Duarte Gomes Sol√≠s, an economics writer. He also worked in the slave trade under his father as his agent at Cartagena de Indias, but squandered a lot of his family's wealth at parties in Madrid. Even after the death of her husband, Elena continued to work in the slave trade. However, she failed to gain the asiento, working under her brother Francisco Gomes Sol√≠s in Cartagena de Indias.

History Russian nationalist Alexander \\"Slavros\\" Mukhitdinov founded the online message board Iron March in 2011. Mukhitdinov remained a murky figure at the time of the leaks. Iron March became a platform for militant neo-Nazi groups such as the Nordic Resistance Movement, Azov Battalion and Golden Dawn. Some of the board's members were later linked to several acts of terrorism and murder, such as the murder of an anti-fascist in Helsinki in September 2016 and the murder of a left-wing rapper in 2013. A group consisting of Serbian Combat 18, \\"MC Srbi\\" and Atomwaffen also used the forum to traffic firearms. The forum's users organized a number of violent neo-Nazi groups, including the Atomwaffen Division, Antipodean Resistance and National Action. The userbase embraced the accelerationist ideology of James Mason, a neo-nazi and associate of the serial killer Charles Manson. Members of Iron March republished and popularized Mason's book \\"Siege\\" and its brand of explicitly terroristic neo- nazism. According to SPLC: > [Iron March] became home base for those who were personally invested in neo- > Nazism, fascism and organized white extremism on a global scale ... through > total immersion in Mason's teleology, now, they are challenging the > established far-right and far-left with their eagerness to perpetrate > violence. In 2016, posters urging students to visit the Iron March website were posted on university campuses, including those of Boston University, Old Dominion University, and the University of Chicago. These posters included racist and antisemitic slogans, including \\"#Hitler Disapproves\\", \\"No Degeneracy, No Tolerance, Hail Victory\\", and \\"Black Lives Don't Matter\\". The website closed in November 2017; the reasons for its closure remain unclear in 2020. According to an investigation by BBC Russia, it is suspected Mukhitdinov was pressured by the Russian government for raising funds for the neo-nazi Azov Battalion, which is considered a terrorist group in the Russian Federation. A spokesperson for Azov refused to comment on the case. In 2018, Iron March- affiliated Discord servers alongside several other hate-group servers were removed by the messaging service. In April 2018, a networking site called Fascist Forge was launched; according to a note by its founder, it was meant as a replacement for Iron March. The site continued Iron March's virulent propaganda and grew rapidly until February 2019, when the site was taken offline by its registrar. Notable users In February 2015, three people were arrested for planning to commit a mass shooting at a shopping mall in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on February 14 that year. One of the suspects, 23-year- old Lindsay Souvannarath of Illinois, was found to have been an active member of Iron March and to have made many online posts in favor of fascist or neo- Nazi ideologies. Devon Arthurs, an Iron March user and member of the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), killed his two roommates and fellow members of AWD in May 2017. Police found neo-nazi literature, radioactive materials, a photograph of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, and explosives in his home. Arthurs' remaining roommate and fellow Iron March user Brandon Russell was arrested in Tampa, Florida, for stockpiling of illegal weapons and bomb- making materials. Russell had been among Iron March's most prolific users, having written around 1,500 posts on the site. As a result of the Iron March leak in 2019, it was discovered the Latvian national-conservative politician and activist Raivis Zeltƒ´ts had posted on Iron March under the handle \\"Latvian_Integralist\\". Zeltƒ´ts said in a Facebook post he wrote using this handle but that the writing expressed no-longer-held views. Zeltƒ´ts remained in contact with Iron March administrator Benjamin Raymond as late as 2015. Zack Davies, 26, of Mold, North Wales, attacked a Sikh man with a machete and claw hammer while shouting \\"White Power\\". Davies left his victim with life- threatening injuries; in the judge's view, the victim would have died if Davies had not been stopped by passers-by. Davies was found guilty of attempted murder and was given a life sentence by a British court in 2015. Davies had an Iron March account, was a member of the community and a supporter of the British terrorist group National Action.  Leak  In November 2019, an unknown individual uploaded a database of Iron March users to the Internet Archive; multiple neo-nazi users, including an ICE detention center captain and several active members of the US armed forces, were identified using information from the leak. A variety of individuals and organizations used information from the leak: * Journalistic outlets and anti- fascist groups used the information to reveal the identities of users of the site. * The open-source journalism outlet Bellingcat and online magazine Small Wars Journal performed data analysis on the entire corpus to understand the online radicalization processes of the far-right. * Brett Stevens, editor of the far-right site \\"Amerika.org\\", used contact information from the leak to contact former Iron March users and direct them to his website. * In September 2020, researchers at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism used the forum dump as training data for the sophisticated, flexible natural language generating artificial intelligence model GPT-3. They found that GPT-3 --or more likely a copy of it if proper safety and sanitizing protocols are observed by OpenAI--could easily be used for misinformation and radicalization purposes.

Nona Grey is a young girl who trains at a convent for future assassins. Red Sister is the first novel in the Book of the Ancestor trilogy. The novel was nominated for the 2018 David Gemmell Awards for Fantasy. Plot The planet Abeth was originally settled by four tribes with various abilities. The hunska have superhuman speed; the gerant have superhuman strength, the marjal can work elemental magic; the quantal can work larger magics. Children born on Abeth may have access to one (or rarely, multiple) bloodline powers. Abeth‚Äôs dying red giant sun cannot generate sufficient heat to prevent a global ice age. Abeth‚Äôs man-made moon refracts sunlight onto a narrow strip of land circling the globe. This Corridor, only fifty miles wide, is the only unfrozen land on the planet. It comprises several kingdoms fighting for control of the planet‚Äôs resources. Nona Grey is a peasant girl living in a remote village in the Corridor. She is purchased by a slave trader who recognizes that she has hunska blood. She is brought to the capital of the Empire, where she attacks a noble named Raymel Tacsis. She is saved from execution by Abbess Glass of the Sweet Mercy Convent. Nona trains in the arts of combat and subterfuge at Sweet Mercy. Along the way, she meets fellow novice Arabella (Ara). Various nobles believe that Ara is the Argatha, a savior destined to save Abeth. Abbess Glass convinces the nobility that Nona is the Shield, destined to protect the Argatha. With her training, Nona recognizes that she also has quantal and marjal talents. Nona also meets a mysterious student named Zole and her bodyguard Yisht. Nona realizes that Yisht is attempting to steal a valuable artifact from Sweet Mercy: the shipheart, which was left by the original settlers of Abeth. With four shiphearts, one can control the moon which is protecting Abeth from a permanent ice age. Nona and the other students defeat Yisht and save the shipheart. In a frame story, an adult Nona and Ara are attacked by members of the Empire‚Äôs nobility. They are betrayed by Clera, a former student at Sweet Mercy. Nona attempts to convince Clera to join them against the Empire‚Äôs army. Style Writing for Den of Geek, Bridget LaMonica praises Lawrence's subversion of standard fantasy novel tropes. Nona is not presented as a \\"Chosen One\\". The story is told in a close third person narrative with an unreliable narrator. Background The Book of the Ancestor is Lawrence's first series featuring a female protagonist. It is unconnected from his previous works. Lawrence believes that reading the Malory Towers series by Enid Blyton with his daughter inspired him to focus on an all-female school setting. He also credits various fantasy novels such as The Name of the Wind, A Wizard of Earthsea, and Ender's Game as inspirations for the novel. Reception Writing for Tor.com, Laura M. Hughes declared that Red Sister was an improvement from Lawrence's previous works. She praised the book's multiple timelines, writing style, and all-female cast. Publishers Weekly praised the novel's \\"evocative prose\\" and \\"three-dimensional characterizations\\". Writing for Library Journal, Kristi Chadwick wrote that Red Sister contained a \\"fantastic world in which religion and politics are dark and sharp as swords\\". She compared the novel positively to the works of author George R.R. Martin. In her review for the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, Melanie Ryan categorizes the novel as grimdark and praises the \\"exquisitely crafted\\" world, plot, and characters. The novel was nominated for the 2018 David Gemmell Awards for Fantasy.

Mt. Fitzhenry is in the Bailey Range which is a subrange of the Olympic Mountains. In clear weather, the mountain can be seen from the visitor center at Hurricane Ridge. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Fairchild, to the south. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Elwha River. Mount Fitzhenry is situated at the head of Fitzhenry Creek, and both are named for Edward Allen Fitzhenry (1868‚Äì1937), Clallam County surveyor from 1892-1900. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Fitzhenry as Washington Surveyor General in 1913, and he later served as Deputy State Land Commissioner.https://www.olsonengr.com/download/globios/fitzhenryedwardabio2.pdf Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Fitzhenry is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for viewing and climbing are July through September. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

The OQ-45 is currently in its second version (OQ-45.2), which was released in October 2013 by OQ Measures, the company founded by Burlingame and Lambert. Clinical use The instrument was designed as a brief scale to measure the subjective experience of a person, as well as the way they function in the world. Authors intended it to be a low cost instrument with a quick administration time that is sensitive to change across time. The inventory is not intended to be used for diagnostic purposes. Format The OQ-45 contains 45 items. Individuals are asked to describe their experiences in the last week, using a multiple choice format. This response format is consistent across questions: Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Frequently, and Almost Always. Domains of Measurement The OQ-45 measures progress across three different domains of experience: # Symptom Distress (SD): Measures an individual's degree of subjective discomfort # Interpersonal Relations (IR): Measures impairment in interpersonal functioning # Social Role (SR): Measures impairment in functioning at work and in other social roles Scoring Points are assigned for each response using the following scoring rubric: Never (0), Rarely (1), Sometimes (2), Frequently (3), and Almost Always (4). Individual subscales are totaled using addition, after reverse-coding procedures are performed. Higher scores indicate more severe distress and functional impairment. The Symptom Distress subscale contains 25 items, and scores range from 0 to 100. The Interpersonal Relations subscale contains 11 items, and scores range from 0 to 44. The Social Role subscale contains 9 items, and scores range from 0 to 36. A total score (TOT) is calculated by summing the subscales, and scores range from 0 to 180.

I. angustus is a member of the Ixodidae (hard-bodied) family of ticks. It is most abundant in cool, moist biomes such as riparian, boreal or montane zones. I. angustus is a host generalist and has been discovered feeding on more than 90 different host species, including humans and domestic dogs.Stephenson, Nicole, Johnny Wong, and Janet Foley. \\"Host, habitat and climate preferences of Ixodes angustus (Acari: Ixodidae) and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in California, USA.\\" Experimental and Applied Acarology 70.2 (2016): 239-252.

Damrow. \\"Vector competence of Ixodes angustus (Acari: Ixodidae) for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto.\\" Experimental & applied acarology 24.1 (2000): 77-84. but is not considered a principle vector due to the relative rarity with which it feeds on humans. Description Adult females are approximately 2 mm unfed and can grow up to 7 mm when engorged with a blood meal. They possess a diamond shaped non-ornate dorsal plate (otherwise known as a shield) with rounded edges. Palps are long, with a half- diamond shape (straight outer edge and a rounded inner edge). Adult males grow to around 2 mm, and cannot become engorged with blood as their inflexible back plate extends to cover the entire dorsal side of the tick. Palps are much smaller, thicker, and more ovular than females. Life-cycle I. angustus has a multi-stage life-cycle consisting of egg, larva, nymph and adult stage. They can complete this life-cycle in 7 months under mild temperatures, a shorter period than most other Ixodes.Hadwen, Seymour. \\"The life history of Ixodes angustus (Banks).\\" Journal of the Entomological Society of British Columbia 1 (1911): 37-38. I. angustus larvae hatch after approximately 73 days and acquire blood meals from a vertebrate, most often a small mammal like a squirrel or mouse. These meals take place over an ~3 day feeding period, the protein from which enables the larvae to moult into a nymph after an average of 60 days. Nymphs again feed for approximately 3 days on vertebrates before becoming adults after an average of 30 days. Adult females will feed for ~7 days on a vertebrate host before laying egg clusters over a 16-day period. Adult males are only rarely found on hosts and are thus assumed to wait for potential mates in or around the nest of their prior host. Distribution I. angustus has a wide distribution in North America and has been recorded in all Canadian provinces except Saskatchewan (although it is suspected to occur there), the majority of continental US states, and the Mexican state of Coahuila. There have been several erroneous records of I. angustus in South and Central America, but thus far there are no Bona fide neotropical records of I.angustus.Guglielmone, Alberto A., et al. \\"The hard ticks of the world.\\" New York: Springuer (2014). Within this extensive range, I. angustus is most prevalent in cool, damp habitats such as boreal, montane and riparian zones. Potential as a disease vector Despite a wide range and demonstrated potential to carry Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, I. angustus is considered a bridge vector of lesser importance due to its nidicolous behaviour. Important Ixodes bridge vectors such as Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus exhibit a questing behaviour where they actively hunt for new hosts, enabling them to frequently acquire human or domestic animal hosts. In contrast, I. angustus rarely leaves the nest of its host, thus almost exclusively feeding on small or medium sized nesting mammals like mice and squirrels. This behaviour also limits the accessibility of I. angustus to scientific study, as it is often missed by sampling techniques which rely upon ticks actively seeking a host such as Tick dragging or CO2 trapping.

The original core of the unit was a company of infantry known as the Richardson Light Guard. The company initially served provost duty at Fortress Monroe, was eventually trained in light artillery drill, and reorganized on March 17, 1862 as the 7th Massachusetts Battery. The battery served in a geographically diverse variety of military departments and campaigns. In 1862 and 1863, they served in the Department of Virginia and North Carolina primarily in operations in the vicinity of Suffolk, Virginia and saw combat in several engagements there including the Battle of Deserted House. Later in 1863, the 7th Massachusetts Battery served on the Virginia Peninsula during a demonstration against Richmond, in New York City in the wake of the draft riots, and later in the defenses of Washington. In January 1864, the battery was transferred to the Department of the Gulf and took part in operations in Louisiana. Later in 1864 the battery moved to Arkansas as part of the Army of West Mississippi. In 1865, the battery took part in the Mobile Campaign and saw action during the Battle of Fort Blakely. After the Confederate surrender, the battery was deployed to Houston, Texas where they performed various details over the summer of 1865. In October, the unit began its journey back to Massachusetts and was mustered out in Boston on November 10, 1865. Organization and early service The Richardson Light Guard was recruited in Lowell, Massachusetts in April immediately after the Battle of Fort Sumter and the start of the war. It was mustered in for a three-year term of service on May 21, 1861 and departed Boston for Fortress Monroe, Virginia the following day. The company was originally to be attached to the 3rd Massachusetts Volunteer Militia Regiment but instead was assigned to provost duty at Fortress Monroe and remained an unattached company. It remained on this duty until December 25 when they were assigned to light artillery drill. On March 17, 1862, it was officially reorganized by the War Department as the 7th Massachusetts Battery. During the summer of 1862, the battery was stationed at Norfolk and later Yorktown, Virginia. It was transferred to Suffolk, Virginia on September 29. Southeastern Virginia Soon after reaching Suffolk, the 7th Massachusetts Battery was posted outside the town near the crossing of the Nansemond River until January 29, 1863. On that day, the battery became part of an expedition to the Blackwater River (which represented the boundary between the Union occupied counties of southeast Virginia and Confederate territory of the interior). Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the Battle of Deserted House in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk. The 7th Massachusetts Battery was heavily engaged during this battle, suffering 13 casualties including two killed in action and two mortally wounded. In March 1862, the battery took part in another expedition towards Franklin, Virginia, marching 46 miles in 17 hours and engaging the enemy. When Union forces at Suffolk were besieged by Confederates under the command of Major General James Longstreet, the 7th Massachusetts Battery played an active role in defending the fortifications. After Confederate forces withdrew, the battery participated in a reconnaissance-in-force again towards the Blackwater River led by Maj. Gen. Robert Foster. This movement was opposed by Confederates during the Battle of Carrsville, also known as the Battle of Holland House, on May 14 and 15, 1863 in which the 7th Massachusetts Battery was engaged. New York and Washington On June 27, 1863, the battery was transferred back to the Virginia Peninsula where it took part in a demonstration against Richmond commanded by Maj. Gen. John A. Dix. The operation was intended to divert Confederate forces from the Gettysburg Campaign, possibly even resulting in the capture of a lightly defended Richmond but Dix did not press an offensive. On August 18, the battery shipped to New York where it joined other units of the Union army in keeping order in the city in the wake of the New York City draft riots. The battery camped in Madison Square until September 11 when it departed for Washington, D.C. It occupied Camp Barry in the defenses of Washington until January 1864. While at Camp Barry, 24 members of the battery reenlisted for a second three-year term. Together with new recruits and transfers, the unit numbered enough men to continue service as a full field battery. In connection with this reorganization for a second term, the roster of officers was almost completed reorganized and Newman Storer, who had originally joined the unit as a quartermaster sergeant, became captain and commanding officer. Louisiana and Arkansas On January 24, 1864, the 7th Massachusetts Battery was assigned to the Department of the Gulf and ordered to ship to New Orleans. The battery reached the city on February 5 and became part of the Second Division of the XIX Corps. For most of the spring the battery was posted in Alexandria, Louisiana, taking part in occasional patrol activities in that vicinity during the Red River Campaign. The battery moved with its division in force on May 11, taking part in the Battle of Mansura and assuming a new post in Morganza, Louisiana. For the most part the battery remained there until July 13. During the latter part of July 1864, the battery traveled by steamship on an expedition to St. Charles, Arkansas. After returning to Morganza in August, the battery made a second expedition to St. Charles, reaching that point on September 11. On October 23, two of the three sections of the battery were sent to Duvall's Bluff, Arkansas. The battery remained posted in these locations until the end of the year. Alabama and Texas On January 10, 1865, the 7th Massachusetts Battery boarded a steamship and began a journey to Alabama to participate in the operations against Mobile. On reaching Dauphin Island, Alabama they were assigned to the First Division of the XIII Corps. From March 27 to April 8, the battery took part in the Battle of Spanish Fort, firing on one of the defenses outside Mobile and taking casualties. When the fort was captured, the battery was immediately sent to participate in the Battle of Fort Blakely. When the Confederates evacuated Mobile, the battery entered the city with other Union troops and set up camp there, remaining until after the end of the war. On June 30, the battery was ordered to Texas, reaching Galveston on July 3 and proceeding to Houston. The battery remained there only a short time until they were ordered to return to Massachusetts. The unit stopped at New Orleans and was delayed there for weeks, finally leaving Louisiana in October. They arrived at Gallop's Island in Boston harbor on November 3 and were mustered out on November 10, 1865. The battery lost 3 men killed and mortally wounded and 37 by disease.

The statue was dedicated in 1911 and today stands in front of the Harrison County Courthouse.  History  The construction of a Confederate monument in Harrison County, Mississippi was lead by the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), who were active in the erection of Confederate monuments and memorials during the period between Reconstruction era and the start of World War I. The monument erected in Gulfport, the county seat of Harrison County, is similar to many erected during this time. Plans for the monument were finalized in September 1911, with the local UDC chapter raising $1,500 and the Harrison County Board of supervisors providing an additional $1,000 of funding towards the monument's construction. Total cost for the monument's construction reached $3,500, with additional funding coming from nearby UDC chapters. While some had proposed at the monument be erected in front of the town's Federal building, a sewer line at this location prevented that, and the monument was instead to be erected in front of the Harrison County Courthouse. While the UDC initially planned for a grand unveiling of the monument of October 12, 1911, shipping delays caused the official dedication of the monument to occur on November 23, Thanksgiving Day. Several years later, the original courthouse was demolished, with a new one built at a different location. The monument was moved to the grounds of the new courthouse following this. In recent years, as part of ongoing removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, there have been similar calls made for the Gulfport monument.  Design  The monument, standing , features a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier standing at parade rest atop a granite shaft and base. An unfurled Confederate battle flag is inscribed on the front of the shaft. On the base are multiple inscriptions, including \\"In Memory of Our Confederate Dead\\", \\"Lest We Forget\\", and the years \\"1861‚Äì1865\\".

With William Henry Bragg he discovered that the alpha particles emitted from particular radioactive substances always had the same energy, providing a new way of identifying and classifying them. Biography Richard Daniel Kleeman was born in Rowland Flat, South Australia, on 20 January 1875, the oldest of the nine children of a farmer, Christoph Daniel Kleemann, and his wife Johanna Elenore Munchenberg. He left school to work on the family farm when he was 13 years old. He 1893, he became an apprentice cooper at Yalumba. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked as a cooper at the Ch√¢teau Tanunda Winery until 1901. Kleeman studied physics privately, and began sending papers to William Henry Bragg, the professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Adelaide. Bragg was sufficiently impressed to arrange for Kleeman to be admitted to the university. Kleeman was awarded his BSc degree with first class honours in physics in 1905. He then worked at the university as lecturer and demonstrator, and as an assistant to Bragg in his studies of radioactivity, then a new area of research. He published five papers with Bragg on radioactivity. They discovered that alpha particles emitted from particular radioactive substances always had the same energy. This provided a new way of identifying and classifying radioactive substances, and ultimately yielded important clues about the structure of atoms. Bragg mailed copies of their results to Frederick Soddy, who arranged for their publication in Philosophical Magazine. In 1908, the university awarded Kleeman his DSc degree. The following year he received a Mackinnon Research studentship from the Royal Society that allowed him to travel to the UK as a researcher at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. He subsequently received a Clark Maxwell scholarship. He was able to renew his collaboration with Bragg, who was now the professor of physics at the University of Leeds, writing papers on radioactivity and gases. While at the Cavendish Laboratory, Kleeman unsuccessfully applied for various academic appointments, and was particularly disappointed at being passed over for the inaugural professorship of mathematics and physics at the University of Western Australia. When he returned to Adelaide for a holiday in 1911, he courted Bertha Pauline Martin, and they were married at the parish church in Woburn Square in London on 11 July 1912. They had two children, one of whom died in childhood. Kleeman's German background made securing an academic position in Australia or the UK more problematic after the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, and in November he became an assistant professor at Union College in Schenectady, New York. He became an associate professor there in 1920. He was also a consulting physicist at General Electric from 1919 to 1927. He worked on a book, A Kinetic Theory of Gases and Liquids, which was published in 1920. In 1927, he left Union College to become an independent researcher, and studied the behaviour of substances at the absolute zero temperature. Kleeman died from pneumonia at the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital on 10 October 1932, and was buried in Mount Hope cemetery in New York.

Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Elwha River. History Mt. Olympus Mount Fairchild is situated at the head of Fairchild Creek, which originates from the Fairchild Glacier, and each are named for pilot William R.

Geological Survey and U.S. National Park Service, as well as thousands of other glaciers in Western North America.

This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1975 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The William R. Fairchild International Airport in nearby Port Angeles is also named after him. The first ascent of this peak was made in 1963 by Denny Pruitt, Dan Baker, Jack Christiansen, and Roy Etten.Olympic Mountain Rescue, Olympic Mountains, A climbing Guide, Fourth Edition, The Mountaineers Books, 2006, pg. 190. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Fairchild is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. This climate supports the Fairchild and Carrie Glaciers on its slopes. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for viewing and climbing are July through September. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

Stage Head was named for a fishing \\"stage\\" dating back to the original settlement by the Dorchester Adventurers Company circa 1624. The area was first fortified in 1635 and garrisoned intermittently from then until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Fort Gloucester at FortWiki.comRoberts, p. 400 History After the first fort was built on the site in 1635, the next upgrade was a rudimentary fortified breastwork in 1703 for Queen Anne's War. New breastworks and a platform for eight 12-pounder cannon were built in 1743 for King George's War. The fort was refurbished for the French and Indian War circa 1754. Another breastwork was built for the American Revolutionary War in October 1775. In the War of 1812 the fort was repaired and a barracks added. The fort was further renovated circa 1862 for the American Civil War under the supervision of Major Charles E. Blunt, and called Fort Conant after early settler Roger Conant.Manuel, pp. 32, 38, 43 He arrived at Stage Head circa 1626 and is credited as the Cape Ann colony's first governor. He resided in a \\"great house\\" near Stage Head, which was moved to Salem by his successor John Endecott circa 1628. An 1864 plan of the fort shows embrasures for four guns and a magazine. An armament list for the fort dated January 31, 1865 shows three 32-pounder smoothbore guns mounted. Also, the Eastern Point Fort was built in 1863 to provide a fort much nearer the harbor entrance. In the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, a military camp named Camp Hobson was at or near Stage Fort. Present The fort was reconstructed for tourism in 1930, with a further reconstruction and the addition of period and reproduction cannon in 1973. It is open to the public in Stage Fort Park, which also includes Gloucester's welcome center for visitors. Historical names Over nearly four centuries of existence, the fort on Stage Head has been known by many names. In addition to Stage Fort and Fort Conant, references list Fort Gloucester (Fort at Gloucester was used by the US Army for Fort Defiance),Fort at Gloucester at FortWiki.com Fort Point, Fort Eastern Point, and other variants of these names. Fort Banks, Fort Cross, and Fort Allen were alternate names during the Fort Conant period of the Civil War.

She was arrested, imprisoned and tortured in prison in Egypt for three months after flying a rainbow flag at a Mashrou' Leila concert in 2017 in Cairo. Hegazi lived with PTSD resulting from the prison torture she had experienced in Egypt. She was granted asylum in Canada, living there until her death.  Early life and education Hegazi was born 1989 to an Egyptian conservative middle-class family; she is the eldest of four siblings. She helped her mother to care for her siblings after her father, a highschool science teacher, died. Pictures of a young Hegazi in conservative Islamic garb including a hijab surfaced after her death. Hegazi wore the hijab until she came out as lesbian in 2016. In 2010, Hegazi graduated from Thebas Academy with a bachelor's degree in Information Systems, and the American University in Cairo Continuing Education Center in 2016. Through distance learning, Hegazi completed certificates in \\"Fighting for Equality: 1950‚Äì2018\\", \\"Feminism and Social Justice\\", \\"Research Methods\\", \\"Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace\\", and \\"Understanding Violence\\" at Columbia University, University of California Santa Cruz, SOAS University of London, the University of Pittsburgh, and Emory University.https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XtvcmhAJW/ Political views Hegazi during protests in Canada Hegazi identified as a communist and supported the Bread and Freedom Party while living in Egypt, and became involved with the Spring Socialist Network once in Canada. Hegazi reported being fired from her job for opposing the Sisi regime in Egypt. Nine years after the Egyptian revolution of 2011, Hegazi wrote that \\"the old regime will try anything, even sacrificing important icons of their regime, in order to stay in power or regain power\\", describing President el-Sisi as \\"the most oppressive and violent dictator in our modern history\\" and writing that \\"revolutionaries believe the battle is one of class\\". Hegazi wrote that in consequence of the revolution being left incomplete \\"most of us are now in the grave, in prison or in exile.\\" Persecution in Egypt=Arrest and asylum On 22 September 2017, Sarah Hegazi attended a concert for the Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila whose lead singer, Hamed Sinno, is openly gay. Hegazi was among a group of others who were arrested for waving a rainbow flag in support of LGBT rights. She was charged with joining an organization in contravention of the law for the purpose inciting to acts of immorality or debauchery. Her arrest coincided with Egypt's zero-tolerance crackdown response to end public support for LGBT rights in the country. She was jailed for three months at Sayeda Zeinab police station where male agents incited inmates to beat, and to verbally and sexually assault her. In an article published by Mada Masr on September 24, 2018, Hegazi recounted her arrest. She wrote that she was arrested at home in front of her family, and that during the process the officer questioned her about her religion, why she removed her hijab, and whether she was a virgin or not. According to her account, the officer blindfolded her and took her by car to a location she did not know. She sat in a chair gagged with a cloth with her hands cuffed. She was subject to electric shock and she lost consciousness. She was also threatened that her mother would be harmed if she told anyone. Hegazi was released on 2 January 2018 and was fined E¬£1,000 ($56); after her release she struggled with depression, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder. Fearing further prosecution, Hegazi sought asylum in Canada in 2018. Hegazi lost her mother to cancer one month after leaving Egypt.  Legal and political context In Egypt, where homosexuality is not outlawed explicitly in jurisprudence, detention and charges are made on the basis of the 1961 \\"Law on Combating Prostitution\\" that sanctions debauchery and sex work. In October 2017, in the aftermath of the Mashrou' Leila's 2017 Cairo concert, a number of Egyptian members of the parliament submitted a law that sanctions homosexual acts with up to three years of prison. If convicted again, the convicts would face the possibility of being sentenced to imprisonment for five years. The law update was used to crackdown on Egyptian LGBT individuals even though the updated law made no allusion to homosexuality. The update authorized the police to infiltrate chat rooms and dating apps, to pretend to be gay men and women and ensnare members of the LGBT community. According to the Egyptian government, the law was updated to address modern developments and to stop the internet and social media users from encouraging vice and the practice of prostitution. The LGBTQ+ community is posited as a national security threat by the Egyptian government, religious authorities, and political parties; this view is promoted by state- controlled media outlets. Sarah Hegazi happily on her bicycle in downtown Cairo. Death and legacy Hegazi died on 14 June 2020 in Toronto, Canada. On 15 June 2020 Hegazi's lawyer Khaled Al-Masry confirmed her death as suicide. A short letter written by Hegazi, in Arabic, circulated on social media following her death. The letter read: \\"To my siblings ‚Äì I tried to survive and I failed, forgive me. To my friends ‚Äì the experience was harsh and I am too weak to resist it, forgive me. To the world ‚Äì you were cruel to a great extent, but I forgive.\\" Her death was reported across a range of international news outlets, with tributes to her activism a recurring theme. Hamed Sinno, the frontman of the Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila shared a tribute on his Facebook profile to Hegazi which read \\"\\", or \\"Freedom for your soul\\". Sinno later composed and performed a song based on the words written by Hegazi shortly before her death. Visual art memorializing Hegazi has circulated widely since her death.https://popularchorus.com/artists-pay-tribute-departed- lgbtq-activist-sarah-hegazi/ Other Arab and middle eastern artisits and public figures shared messages of sympathy and solidarity with Hegazi and the LGBT community among which Egyptian actor Amr Waked, Lebanese singer and stage actress Carole Samaha, Iranian painter and LGBT activist Alireza Shojaian, and Jordanian lawyer and journalist Ola Al-Fares. The Canadian socialist magazine Spring published an obituary to Hegazi with Valerie Lannon writing: \\"I remember her saying 'I never felt so alive as during the revolution.' In her honour, and to fulfil our own sense of life, it is our duty to continue fighting for the revolution here, Egypt and around the world.\\" During the 2020 Pride Month, the Arab LGBT community held vigils in the United States, Canada, London, and Beirut to commemorate Hegazi's life and struggle against homophobia; these came together with memorial vigils and events across the world. In Malta, the Allied Rainbow Communities and Moviment Graffitti commemorated Hegazi's death through a demonstration at the Egyptian Embassy and criticized the Maltese Government's designation of Egypt as a safe country to which refugees could be returned. Prominent Egyptian LGBT activist Shrouk El-Attar started a fundraiser for the benefit of Sarah's family and LGBT organizations. Hegazi was laid to rest in a rainbow coloured casket following a public funeral at St. John‚Äôs Dixie Cemetery on 22 June 2020. Commemorative events continued after Hegazi's funeral. The organizers of Global Pride, an online LGBT Pride event scheduled to take place on 27 June 2020, announced that fellow Egyptian militant Ahmed Alaa will pay tribute to Hegazi. Like Hegazi, Alaa was jailed after Mashrou' Leila's concet in 2017 for raising the gay pride flag. The 2020 version of the Napoli Pride event was dedicated to the memory Sarah Hegazi; the organizers announced that they intended the event to be a warning against compulsion, violence and close-mindedness. The Association for Women's Rights in Development (AWID) named Sarah Hegazy in their tribute to \\"450 feminist activists who have changed our world\\".  Reactions  Paris vigil in memory of Hegazi, 20 June 2020. There is a long history of LGBT people being erased and oppressed both specifically in Egypt and in the broader context of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This occurs through censorship, hate-speech, and government coordinated persecution. Sarah Hegazi's death has been met with homophobic responses in the MENA region whether through government actions, media coverage, or public discourse, An article on Raseef22 which discussed the LGBT+ community in Jordan and the Sarah Hegazi mural in Amman was quickly deleted after the Jordanian journalist received a flood of threats online. = Jordan = Amman Sarah Hegazi mural before and after blackout paint Street murals and graffiti art commemorating Hegazi in the Jordanian capital Amman were speedily painted over after a social media uproar.

It flowed above ground level until the mid-20th century, with a waterfall and a pond over its course. Rattlesnake Creek has since been mostly covered over, but a small portion of it is still visible in Seton Falls Park.  Course  According to old maps, the source of the creek was near Nereid and Hill Avenues in the Bronx's Edenwald neighborhood, where it flows southwest, then turns southeast near East 233rd Street. It then flows above ground at Seton Falls Park, entering a man-made waterfall. After exiting the park, it flows back underground. South of Boston Road, the creek flowed into a man-made pond called Holler's Pond, located at the site of the Boston Secor Houses in the Baychester neighborhood. Rattlesnake Creek then passes through Co-op City, draining into the Hutchinson River. Before draining into the Hutchinson River, it split into two small distributaries, one of which was named Mill Creek. The majority of Co-op City was built atop the mouth of Rattlesnake Creek. Some streets such as Alcott Place, Bellamy Loop, and Dreiser Loop directly follow the creek's path. A small nature preserve called the Givans Creek Woods is located at the northern portion of Co-op City, near the intersection of Baychester Avenue and Co-op City Boulevard. Despite its name, which is derived from Scottish immigrant Robert Givan, it is located above Rattlesnake Creek. The actual Givans Creek is located slightly to the south.  Etymology  There was once an abundant population of rattlesnakes in the northeast Bronx, after which the creek is named. The rattlesnake population was identified as a problem in the late 18th century, when Eastchester town officials agreed to meet once a week to discuss the eradication of the snakes. According to a Bronx historian, Eastchester's ten founding families dedicated one day each spring \\"for the destroying of rattlesnake\\", using hogs to hunt down the rattlesnakes because the hogs' fat was resistant to the snakes' fangs. By the early 20th century, the snake population had been eliminated. However, some sources put their eradication at an earlier date, saying that the last snake was a specimen killed in 1775.  History  Rattlesnake Brook, 1914 Prior to the American Revolutionary War, the area around Rattlesnake Creek was owned by Thomas Pell. In 1739, Thomas Shute and Joseph Stanton built a mill to dam the creek south of Boston Road, creating Holler's Pond. Further upstream, the creek was dammed by William Seton, son of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, who owned the land around what is now Seton Falls Park in the mid-19th century. This created two more ponds and a waterfall. Seton's mill was destroyed in a 1900 storm, but the waterfall remained. The cascade was described as a descent with two separate falls. Also located along the brook may have been the estate of Anne Hutchinson, which according to a 1929 map was located in Baychester between Rattlesnake Creek and a now-filled stream called Black Dog Brook. By 1926, Rattlesnake Creek was polluted and several cases of typhoid could be traced to the creek. After Seton Falls Park was acquired by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1930, the agency rerouted the creek's path within the park into a stone channel and infilled the two ponds on the Seton estate. Downstream, Holler's Pond was used to harvest ice, and there were several ice houses on the shore of the pond, which were all demolished by 1935. The pond was also popular among ice-skaters until it was infilled in 1951. There was a wood-framed beer garden on the shore of the pond, at 4018 Boston Road near the intersection with Dyre Avenue, which was demolished in 1960. The mouth of the creek was covered in 1960 by Freedomland U.S.A., a theme park dedicated to the history of the United States. Before Freedomland's construction, that land had been a municipal landfill built atop the marshland on the banks of the Hutchinson River. The construction of Freedomland resulted in drastic landscaping changes around the mouth of the creek. Freedomland was shuttered in 1964 and its site was used for the development of Co-op City. Rattlesnake Creek remains mostly extant, albeit in underground pipes. The only remaining above-ground section of the creek upstream is in Seton Falls Park. Within the park, an exit culvert from the creek was destroyed in 1973, creating a swamp that killed nearby trees, though the culvert and a sewer pipe under it were restored in the mid-1980s. A vestige of the old Holler's Pond mill's existence is Reeds Mill Lane, a discontinuous road between Boston Road and the New England Thruway, which cuts an irregular route through the Baychester street grid.

He was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on October 18, 1872, one of at least three children of Thomas Bullock, his father, a former slave who fought for the Union Army, according to US Census records. Bullock was a bartender at the Pendennis Club, the Kenton Club, and most notably the St. Louis Country Club, and is the first known African-American author to publish a cocktail manual, The Ideal Bartender. His book is notable as one of the last cocktail manuals published before Prohibition, providing a rare view onto pre-Prohibition cocktail recipes and drinking culture in America. Bullock was known to be a bartender and friend to George Herbert Walker, who wrote an introduction to his cocktail manual. In 1913, he was involved in a libel case when ex- President Theodore Roosevelt sued for alleged libel regarding his drinking habits, and asserted he had only had a few sips of a mint julep cocktail made by Bullock. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch disputed Roosevelt's claim, asserting that no one could fail to finish one of Bullock's cocktails. Bullock died in 1964. Cocktail historian David Wondrich believes that Bullock may have been one of the first bartenders to create a variant of the gimlet.

As mentioned, the equestrian career of Bassaeus Rufus began with him being twice primus pilus; this was followed with commission as military tribune of a cohors vigilis, then of an urban cohort, and lastly a praetorian cohort. From here he advanced to civil appointments, beginning with procurator of the imperial properties in the regions of Asturias and Galicia, then became governing procurator of the imperial province of Noricum before the end of the reign of emperor Antoninus Pius. This was followed by the procuratorship of Gallia Belgica and both Germaniae; the duties of this official included supervising the distribution of funds for the armies on the Rhine. Rufus must have distinguished himself in this appointment, for he advanced to procurator a rationibus, or overseer of the imperial secretariat in Rome. Rufus was later promoted to praefectus vigilum at some point before 10 March 168, according to an inscription with that date. Between that date and 10 July of that year, he was promoted to prefect of Egypt.Guido Bastianini, \\"Lista dei prefetti d'Egitto dal 30a al 299p\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 17 (1975), p. 297 However Marcus Aurelius found he was needed in a more important position, and at some point before the death of Lucius Verus in early 169, Bassaeus Rufus was promoted to Praetorian Prefect.O. W. Reinmuth, \\"A Working List of the Prefects of Egypt 30 B.C. TO 299 A.D.\\", Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists, 4 (1967), p. 99 Shortly afterwards he was given a colleague as praetorian prefect, Marcus Macrinius Vindex. Both were selected to help with the threat posed by the Marcomanni on the Danube frontier; the previous praetorian prefect, Titus Furius Victorinus, had been killed the year before in battle with these Germanic invaders. Nevertheless, their responsibilities included more than military matters. An inscription recovered from Saepinum (modern Sepino) records the response of Rufus and Vindex to a petition from the imperial freedman Cosmus concerning the management of the imperial flocks. Rufus is recorded as present in another case, this one heard by the emperor Marcus Aurelius, which involved his former tutor Herodes Atticus: Herodes had accused three rivals from Athens of conspiracy, and these three men appealed to Marcus at his headquarters at Sirmium. Herodes, who had shortly before the meeting lost two young slave girls when they were killed by lightning, failed to present his case properly, instead attacking him for \\"sacrificing me to the whim of a woman and a three-year-old child!\\" Rufus, who watched all this, believed only one conclusion was possible: Herodes wanted to die.Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, p. 181 Under the two prefects Rufus and Vindex, victories followed for the Romans. Although Vindex met with death in 172,Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, p. 171 Rufus distinguished himself: the lost Roman inscription states he received dona militaria appropriate to his rank. Rufus is known to have accompanied Marcus Aurelius to the front in July 175, after which the emperor awarded him a further distinction: consularia ornamenta. This is the equivalent of the consulship for non- Senators, and was commonly granted to praetorian prefects who had a successful tenure.Fergus Millar, The Emperor in the Roman World (Cornell: University Press, 1992), p. 308 Rufus received this during the triumph Marcus Aurelius celebrated on his return to Rome 23 December 176.Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, p. 197 Bassaeus Rufus retired from public life not long after this.Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, p. 207  References  Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Ancient Roman equites Category:Roman governors of Noricum Category:Roman governors of Egypt Category:Praetorian prefects ","title":"Marcus Bassaeus Rufus"},{"id":"64277249","text":"Vojtƒõch Vesel√Ω (19 April 1885 ‚Äì 7 December 1971) was an Czech figure skater.

Life and career  Mitchell was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, in 1912 and as a young child, adopted by a Calgary couple. She worked as a chambermaid at the Palliser Hotel, and took evening classes at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art (now the Alberta College of Art), and in 1942 attended the Banff School of Fine Arts on a scholarship. She was mainly self-taught but in 1959, she studied at a summer workshop with artist Gordon Smith. Before taking up painting full time at the age of 50, she worked at Calgary's federal income tax office, from 1940 to 1962. She first exhibited her work in 1947, then in 1948 showed her work in the Calgary Group exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery, considered to be one of the first modernist painting exhibitions of Alberta artists. Her first one-person show was held in Toronto in 1949. Numerous one-person exhibitions followed, mostly in Alberta, at the Allied Arts Centre in Calgary, Alberta (1963), and in Toronto, and many other galleries across Canada. Mitchell painted \\"highly realistic landscapes and townscapes of Western Canada\\", as well as \\"whimsical, sometimes dreamlike images in vibrant colors of cats, dogs, birds or fanciful floating people.\\" In the Calgary Herald, Nancy Tousley wrote that \\"[l]ike Mitchell herself, [her] work has a buoyant spirit.\\" She was influenced by Paul Klee and Marc Chagall whose work she saw on a trip in 1950 to New York. In Canadian art, she was influenced by David Milne and by Jock Macdonald who inspired her to explore the unconscious mind from 1946 to 1957. In 1979, Mitchell was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. She earned an honorary doctor of law degree from the University of Calgary in 1988.

The camp buildings, made out of wood and canvas, were intended by the architect to provide living and working spaces for himself and his draftsmen while they worked on a project (San Marcos In The Desert) for promoter, hotelier and entrepreneur,Meryl Secrest. Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography. HarperPerennial, HarperCollins, New York City, 1993, 355. Dr. Alexander John Chandler. Chandler allowed Wright to use part of his land on which to construct the camp. Wright and the draftsmen stayed at the camp until late spring, and returned back to Wright's home, Taliesin, on May 31.Randolph C. Henning, \\"George Kastner and Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" Journal of the Organic Architecture and Design Archives, volume 7, no. 3, 2019, 11. Wright, presuming work would continue into the next year, intended to return to the camp. However, a fire in the camp that summer (followed by the stock market crash in October) prevented the cabins ever being used again. The site has not held buildings since the summer of 1929. The camp was first acknowledged as a precursor to Wright's Taliesin West by architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock in his book, In the Nature of Materials, 1887-1941: The Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright, Duell, Sloan and Pearce, New York 1942. (97) History In 1928, Wright worked as a consultant to Albert Chase McArthur, the architect of record for the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix. During that time, Wright met Dr. Alexander John Chandler (a veterinarian turned businessman), who had conceived of a resort in the desert for well-paying clients, to be named \\"San Marcos In The Desert\\". In the article, \\"George Kastner and Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" writer Randolph C. Henning wrote that after Wright met Chandler, he \\"spent two days with Chandler at the end of March 1928 to discuss Chandler's idea to develop a million dollar hotel.\\" And \\"returned on April 5 to see the project's site on the southerly slope of South Mountain in the Salt River Range, approximately ten miles west of [the town of] Chandler.\\"Randolph C. Henning, \\"George Kastner and Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" Journal of the Organic Architecture and Design Archives, volume 7, no. 3, 2019, 6. Wright continued throughout 1928 to talk to Chandler about the idea for the San Marcos In The Desert project. At the end of November 1928, Wright assembled a group of draftsmen to carry out the drawings for the complex. The group left Wisconsin January 15 to work in Arizona.Randolph C. Henning, \\"George Kastner and Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" Journal of the Organic Architecture and Design Archives, volume 7, no. 3, 2019, 8. When the group arrived in Arizona to begin preparing drawings, it seemed to make more sense that instead of spending hundreds of dollars on accommodations and food for the employees with Wright and his family, they would create a desert camp on Chandler's land. The camp included a \\"living room, guesthouse, dining room, draftsmen's offices, kitchen, court, garage and even an electrical plant, using battened lower walls and wood-framed roofs covered with canvas.\\"Meryl Secrest. Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography. HarperPerennial, HarperCollins, New York City, 1993, 356. In addition to Wright's wife, Olgivanna, their daughter Iovanna, and Olgivanna's daughter, Svetlana, the draftsmen that came to Arizona with Wright were: George Kastner, Heinrich Klumb, Cy Jahnke, Vladimir Karfik and Donald Walker. Once there, they were joined by Francis Sullivan, Wright's oldest son, Lloyd Wright, and local draftsman known as \\"Cueball\\" Kelly. Wright wrote about his inspiration for Ocotillo in An Autobiography: > We all arrived in Chandler to find that suitable quarters in which to live > and work there would cost several thousand dollars for the rest of the > winter, spring and summer. And we couldn't live there in summer. I had > always wanted to camp in that region. Why not camp now? Why not spend the > \\"rent\\" on a camp, comfortable and spacious enough to use not only in which > to plan the building but from which it might be officered during > construction.

Courtesy of Brian A. Spencer and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, Scottsdale, Arizona The site (according to Henning's article) was selected on January 21, and Wright laid out the plans very quickly. On January 30, 1929 then-draftsman, George Kastner, wrote to his friend, Elsie Farber: \\"... I know ever since his first intention of coming down here, that he contemplated on the camp and that he even made some trial sketches that very time.\\"Randolph C. Henning, \\"George Kastner and Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" Journal of the Organic Architecture and Design Archives, volume 7, no. 3, 2019, 11. Wright was inspired by the desert landscape (specifically the mountains). In his autobiography, the architect wrote > Now the architect and his helpers working away to build an architect's > \\"compound,\\" as we call it, in this unmitigated quotidian wilderness > unchangeably changing. We need fifteen cabins in all. Since they will be > temporary, call them ephemera.

Edited by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, > introduction by Kenneth Frampton. Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., > New York City, 1992, 331. While Ocotillo lasted less than 6 months, its importance lies in how it allowed Wright to design a structure for himself in a completely different part of the country in which he'd ever lived. Wright used his design of Ocotillo as a \\"kind of plein air sketch of the desert, using its forms, shapes, and colors as models for adapting human life to the special conditions of desert living.\\"Neil Levine. The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1996, 204. The canvas roofs emphasized the bright sunlight, and the camp used the 30-60 degree angles, based on an abstraction of the surrounding mountain range. This temporary camp was a precursor to Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona, begun 9 years later. In particular, Wright was interested in using the desert mountain ranges as inspiration in both designs, and including canvas roofs that could be opened throughout the day to adjust to light and heat in the desert. The words \\"Ocatilla\\" and \\"Ocotillo\\" Frank Lloyd Wright used the name \\"Ocatilla\\" for this compound. This was an incorrect spelling of the name for a desert plant known as Ocotillo. Wright sometimes used the word, but the word \\"Ocotillo\\" was used by George Kastner, who was one of the draftsman on the trip to Arizona. Kastner (1898-1938) was from Germany and took many of the photographs associated with the site. Kastner's complete collection is owned by architect and Wright-scholar Brian A. Spencer. Spencer's work led him to believe that \\"Ocotillo\\" is more correct.Randolph C.

The United States Central Intelligence Agency estimated that the coup, led by Colonel Mohamed Osman Irro, involved around 24 officers, 2,000 soldiers, and 65 tanks. Following the failed coup, 17 alleged ringleaders, including Osman, were summarily executed by firing squad. Background The coup attempt was staged by a group of disgruntled Army officers, led by Colonel Mohamed Osman Irro, in the aftermath of the disastrous Ogaden War against Ethiopia (then ruled by the Mengistu-led Derg). The war was initiated by Siad Barre, who had himself come into power a decade earlier in the 1969 Somali coup d'√©tat. A United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) memorandum written the following month speculated that the coup was in response to Barre ordering the arrest and execution of officers that participated in the Ogaden War. The officers believed that Barre had intentionally used troops from other clans as \\"cannon fodder\\" while officers from his own Marehan clan were given safer orders. The report concluded that the officers involved in the coup \\"were motivated at least as much by long-standing ethnic animosities toward Barre as by disenchantment with his regime in the aftermath of the Ogaden debacle\\". Coup right The coup was launched on 9 April 1978. The bulk of the fighting concluded within the day. Gunfire broke out at the village of Afgoy, south of the capital Mogadishu, and small-arms fire and explosions were heard on the outskirts of the capital. The coup was originally planned to start in Hargeisa, but Barre likely knew of the attempt in advance and was able to disrupt the coup before it launched, as well as position forces loyal to himself in the capital. The CIA estimated that the coup involved around 24 officers, 2,000 soldiers, and 65 tanks. Aftermath Following the failed coup, 17 alleged ringleaders, including Osman, were summarily executed by firing squad. All but one of the executed were members of the Majeerteen clan, which resides mostly in northeastern Somalia. Barre used the coup as justification to purge members of the clans involved in the coup from government and military positions. One of the plotters, Lieutenant Colonel Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, escaped to EthiopiaNew People Media Centre (Nairobi, Kenya), New people, Issues 94‚Äì105, (New People Media Centre: Comboni Missionaries, 2005). and founded an anti-Siad Barre organization initially called the Somali Salvation Front (SSF; later the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, SSDF),Nina J. Fitzgerald, Somalia: issues, history, and bibliography, (Nova Publishers: 2002), p.25. initiating the Somali Rebellion and eventually the Somali Civil War. Allegation of Eastern Bloc involvement Barre blamed the coup attempt on the Eastern Bloc, namely Soviet Union and Cuba, countries that supported Ethiopia in the Ogaden War, calling them \\"new imperialists\\". The CIA determined that the Soviet Union was not behind the coup attempt, but were seeking to remove Barre. Immediately following the coup, Somalia began receiving foreign aid from the People's Republic of China.

Pseudometrics and values on topological groups  :Definition: An additive topological group is an additive group endowed with a topology, called a group topology, under which addition and negation become continuous operators. :Definition: A topology on a real or complex vector space is called a vector topology or a TVS topology if it makes the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication continuous (i.e. if it makes into a topological vector space). Every topological vector space (TVS) is an additive commutative topological group but not all group topologies on are vector topologies. This is because despite it making addition and negation continuous, a group topology on a vector space may fail to make scalar multiplication continuous. For instance, the discrete topology on any non- trivial vector space makes addition and negation continuous but do not make scalar multiplication continuous.

The topology that induces on is the discrete topology, which makes into a commutative topological group under addition but does not form a vector topology on because is disconnected but every vector topology is connected. What fails is that scalar multiplication isn't continuous on . This example shows that a translation-invariant (pseudo)metric is not enough to guarantee a vector topology, which leads us to define paranorms and -seminorms.  Additive sequences  All of the above conditions are consequently a necessary for a topology to form a vector topology. Additive sequences of sets have the particularly nice property that they define non-negative continuous real- valued subadditive functions. These functions can then be used to prove many of the basic properties of topological vector spaces and also show that a Hausdorff TVS with a countable basis of neighborhoods is metrizable. We also assume that always denotes a finite sequence of non-negative integers and we will use the notation: : and . Observe that for any integers and , :. From this it follows that if consists of distinct positive integers then . We show by induction on that if consists of non-negative integers such that for some integer then . This is clearly true for and so assume that , which implies that all are positive. If all are distinct then we're done, otherwise pick distinct indices such that and construct from by replacing with and deleting the element of (all other elements of are transferred to unchanged). Observe that and (since ) so by appealing to the inductive hypothesis we conclude that , as desired. It is clear that and that so to prove that is subadditive, it suffices to prove that when are such that , which implies that . This is an exercise. If all are symmetric then if and only if from which it follows that and . If all are balanced then the inequality for all unit scalars is proved similarly. Since is a nonnegative subadditive function satisfying , is uniformly continuous on if and only if is continuous at . If all are neighborhoods of the origin then for any real , pick an integer such that so that implies . If all form basis of balanced neighborhoods of the origin then one may show that for any , there exists some such that implies . ‚àé  Paranorms  If is a vector space over the real or complex numbers then a paranorm on is a G-seminorm (defined above) on that satisfies any of the following additional conditions, each of which begins with \\"for all sequences in and all convergent sequences of scalars \\": 1. Continuity of multiplication: if is a scalar and are such that and , then . 2. Both of the conditions: * if and if is such that then ; * if then for every scalar . 3.

A paranorm is called total if in addition it satisfies: * Total/Positive definite: implies .  Properties of paranorms  * If is a paranorm on a vector space then the map defined by is a translation-invariant pseudometric on that defines a vector topology on .

Note that the function is subadditive. * Let be a complex vector space and let denote considered as a vctor space over . Any paranorm on is also a paranorm on . *  F-seminorms  If is a vector space over the real or complex numbers then an -seminorm on (the stands for Fr√©chet) is a real-valued map with the following properties: 1.

Balanced: for all and all scalars satisfying ; * This condition guarantees that each set of the form } or } for some is balanced. 4. for every , as * The sequence can be replaced by any positive sequence converging to 0. An -seminorm is called an -norm if in addition it satisfies: 5. Total/Positive definite: implies . An -seminorm is called monotone if it satisfies: 6. Monotone: for all non-zero and all real and such that .  F-seminormed spaces  :Definition: An -seminormed space (resp. -normed space) is a pair consisting of a vector space and an -seminorm (resp. -norm) on . :Definition: If and are -seminormed spaces then a map is called an isometric embedding if for all . Every isometric embedding of one -seminormed space into another is a topological embedding, but the converse is not true in general.  Examples of F-seminorms  * Every positive scalar multiple of an -seminorm (resp. -norm, seminorm) is again an -seminorm (resp. -norm, seminorm). * The sum of finitely many -seminorms (resp. -norms) is an -seminorm (resp. -norm). * If and are -seminorms on then so is their pointwise supremum }.

Fr√©chet combination  Suppose that is a family of non-negative subadditive functions on a vector space . Definition: The Fr√©chet combination of is defined to be the real-valued map :p(x) := \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{p_{i}(x)}{2^{i} \\\\left[ 1 + p_{i}(x) \\\\right]}.  As an F-seminorm  Assume that is an increasing sequence of seminorms on and let be the Fr√©chet combination of . Then is an -seminorm on that induces the same locally convex topology as the family of seminorms. Since is increasing, a basis of open neighborhoods of the origin consists of all sets of the form } as ranges over all positive integers and ranges over all positive real numbers. The translation invariant pseudometric on induced by this -seminorm is :d( x, y ) = \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{i=1} \\\\frac{1}{2^i} \\\\frac{p_{i}( x - y )}{1 + p_{i}( x - y )} (this metric was discovered by Fr√©chet in his 1906 thesis for the spaces of real and complex sequences with pointwise operations).  As a paranorm  If each is a paranorm then so is and moreover, induces the same topology on as the family of paranorms. This is also true of the following paranorms on : * }. * }.  Generalization  The Fr√©chet combination can be generalized by use of a bounded remetrization function. :Definition: A bounded remetrization function is a continuous non-negative non-decreasing map that is subadditive (i.e. for all ), has a bounded range, and satisfies if and only if . Examples of bounded remetrization functions include , , }, and .

Suppose that is a family of non-negative -seminorm on a vector space , } is a bounded remetrization function, and is a sequence of positive real numbers whose sum is finite. Then :p(x) := \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} r_{i} R( p_{i}( x ) ) defines a bounded -seminorm that is uniformly equivalent to the . It has the property that for any net in , if and only if for all . is an -norm if and only if the separate points on .  Characterizations = Of (pseudo)metrics induced by (semi)norms  A pseudometric (resp. metric) is induced by a seminorm (resp. norm) on a vector space if and only if is translation invariant and absolutely homogeneous, which means that for all scalars and all , in which case the function defined by is a seminorm (resp. norm) and the pseudometric (resp. metric) induced by is equal to .  Of pseudometrizable TVS  If is a topological vector space (TVS) (where note in particular that is assumed to be a vector topology) then the following are equivalent: 1. is pseudometrizable (i.e. the vector topology is induced by a pseudometric on ). 2. has a countable neighborhood base at the origin. 3. The topology on is induced by a translation-invariant pseudometric on . 4. The topology on is induced by an -seminorm. 5. The topology on is induced by a paranorm.  Of metrizable TVS  If is a TVS then the following are equivalent: 1. is metrizable. 2. is Hausdorff and pseudometrizable. 3. is Hausdorff and has a countable neighborhood base at the origin. 4. The topology on is induced by a translation-invariant metric on . 5. The topology on is induced by an -norm. 6. The topology on is induced by a monotone -norm. 7. The topology on is induced by a total paranorm.  Of locally convex pseudometrizable TVS  If is TVS then the following are equivalent: 1. is locally convex and pseudometrizable. 2. has a countable neighborhood base at the origin consisting of convex sets. 3. The topology of is induced by a countable family of (continuous) seminorms. 4. The topology of is induced by a countable increasing sequence of (continuous) seminorms (increasing means that for all , ). 5. The topology of is induced by an -seminorm of the form: :p(x) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} 2^{-n} \\\\operatorname{arctan} p_n(x) where are (continuous) seminorms on .  Quotients  Let be a vector subspace of a topological vector space . * If is a pseudometrizable TVS then so is . * If is a complete pseudometrizable TVS and is a closed vector subspace of then is complete. * If is metrizable TVS and is a closed vector subspace of then is metrizable. * If is an -seminorm on , then the map defined by :} is an -seminorm on that induces the usual quotient topology on . * If in addition is an -norm on and if is a closed vector subspace of then is an -norm on .  Examples and sufficient conditions  * Every seminormed space is pseudometrizable with a canonical pseudometric given by for all .. * If is pseudometric TVS with a translation invariant pseudometric , then defines a paranorm. * However, if is a translation invariant pseudometric on the vector space (without the addition condition that is pseudometric TVS), then need not be either an F-seminorm nor a paranorm. * If a TVS has a bounded neighborhood of 0 then it is pseudometrizable; the converse is in general false. * If a Hausdorff TVS has a bounded neighborhood of the origin then it is metrizable. * Suppose is either a DF-space or an LM-space. If is a sequential space then it is either metrizable or else a Montel DF-space. If is Hausdorff locally convex TVS then with the strong topology, , is metrizable if and only if there exists a countable set of bounded subsets of such that every bounded subset of is contained in some element of .  Normability  If is a Hausdorff locally convex TVS then the following are equivalent: 1. is normable. 2. has a bounded neighborhood of the origin. 3. the strong dual X^{\\\\prime}_{b} of is normable. 4. the strong dual X^{\\\\prime}_{b} of is metrizable. Moreover, * If is a locally convex metrizable topological vector space that possess a countable fundamental system of bounded sets, then is normable. * If a TVS has a convex bounded neighborhood of the origin then it is seminormable; if in addition is Hausdorff then it is normable.  Metrically bounded sets and bounded sets  Suppose that is a pseudometric space and . We say that is metrically bounded or -bounded if there exists a real number such that for all ; the smallest such is then called the diameter or -diameter of . If is bounded in a pseudometrizable TVS then it is metrically bounded; the converse is in general false but it is true for locally convex metrizable TVSs.  Properties of pseudometrizable TVS  * Every metrizable locally convex TVS is a quasibarrelled space, bornological space, and a Mackey space. * Every complete pseudometrizable TVS is a barrelled space and a Baire space (and hence non-meager). * There exist metrizable Baire spaces that are not complete. * If is a metrizable locally convex space, then the strong dual of is bornological if and only if it is infrabarreled, if and only if it is barreled. * If is a complete pseudo-metrizable TVS and is a closed vector subspace of , then is complete. * The strong dual of a locally convex metrizable TVS is a webbed space. * If and are complete metrizable TVSs and if is coarser than then . This is no longer true if either one of these metrizable TVSs is not complete. * A metrizable locally convex space is normable if and only if its strong dual space is a Frechet-Urysohn locally convex space. * Any product of complete metrizable TVSs is a Baire space. * A product of metrizable TVSs is metrizable if and only if it all but at most countably many of these TVSs have dimension . * A product of pseudometrizable TVSs is pseduometrizable if and only if it all but at most countably many of these TVSs have the trivial topology. * Every complete pseudometrizable TVS is a barrelled space and a Baire space (and thus non-meager). * The dimension of a complete metrizable TVS is either finite or uncountable.  Completeness  Recall that every topological vector space (and more generally, a topological group) has a canonical uniform structure, induced by its topology, which allows the notions of completeness and uniform continuity to be applied to it. If is a metrizable TVS and is a metric that defines 's topology, then its possible that is complete as a TVS (i.e. relative to its uniformity) but the metric is not a complete metric (such metrics exist even for ). Thus, if is a TVS whose topology is induced by a pseudometric , then the notion of completeness of (as a TVS) and the notion of completeness of the pseudometric space are not always equivalent. The next theorem gives a condition for when they are equivalent: * A Baire separable topological group is metrizable if and only if it is cosmic.Gabriyelyan, S.S. \\"On topological spaces and topological groups with certain local countable networks (2014) * If is a closed vector subspace of a complete pseudometrizable TVS , then the quotient space is complete. * Suppose is a complete vector subspace of a metrizable TVS . If the quotient space is complete then so is . * Note that if is not complete then is a closed, but not complete, vector subspace of .  Subsets and subsequences  * Let be a separable locally convex metrizable topological vector space and let be its completion. If is a bounded subset of then there exists a bounded subset of such that . * Every totally bounded subset of a locally convex metrizable TVS is contained in the closed Absolutely convex set}convex balanced hull of some sequence in that converges to . * In a pseudometrizable TVS, every bornivore is a neighborhood of the origin. * If is a translation invariant metric on a vector space , then for all and every positive integer . * If is a null sequence (i.e. it converges to the origin) in a metrizable TVS then there exists a sequence of positive real numbers diverging to such that . * A subset of a complete metric space is closed if and only if it is complete. * Note that if a space is not complete, then is a closed subset of that is not complete. * If is a metrizable locally convex TVS then for every bounded subset of , there exists a bounded disk in such that , and both and the auxiliary normed space induce the same subspace topology on .  Linear maps  * If is a pseudometrizable TVS and maps bounded subsets of to bounded subsets of , then is continuous. * Discontinuous linear functionals exist on any infinite-dimensional pseudometrizable TVS. * Thus, a pseudometrizable TVS is finite-dimensional if and only if its continuous dual space is equal to its algebraic dual space. If is a linear map between TVSs and is metrizable then the following are equivalent: 1. is continuous; 2. is a (locally) bounded map (i.e. maps (von Neumann) bounded subsets of to bounded subsets of ); 3. is sequentially continuous; 4. the image under of every null sequence in is a bounded set; * Recall that a null sequence is a sequence that converges to the origin. 5. maps null sequences to null sequences; ;Open and almost open maps :Theorem: If is a complete pseudometrizable TVS, is a Hausdorff TVS, and is a closed and almost open linear surjection, then is an open map. :Theorem: If is a surjective linear operator from a locally convex space onto a barrelled space then is almost open. (note that every complete pseudometrizable space is barrelled) :Theorem: If is a surjective linear operator from a TVS onto a Baire space then is almost open. :Theorem: Suppose is a continuous linear operator from a complete pseudometrizable TVS into a Hausdorff TVS . If the image of is non-meager in then is a surjective open map and is a complete metrizable space.  Hahn-Banach extension property  Let be a TVS. Say that a vector subspace of has the extension property if any continuous linear functional on can be extended to a continuous linear functional on . Say that has the Hahn-Banach extension property (HBEP) if every vector subspace of has the extension property. The Hahn-Banach theorem guarantees that every Hausdorff locally convex space has the HBEP. For complete metrizable TVSs there is a converse: If a vector space has uncountable dimension and if we endow it with the finest vector topology then this is a TVS with the HBEP that is neither locally convex or metrizable.

Vaudeville Career  Upon leaving the carnival, Harrington took work as a comedian and Black vaudeville performer, moonlighting as a barber when stage work was unavailable. Throughout the late 1920s, Harrington worked as a vaudeville performer, often teaming up with well-known Black female performers. In the 1930s, Harrington began to perform solo. During that time, he acted in movies, started a singing career, and helped found the Negro Actors' Guild of America.

Fitzhugh is an American clinical pathologist and Associate Professor of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School as well as an Associate Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. She is the Interim Chair of the Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers and the Interim Chair at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School as well. Fitzhugh is also the Chair and Medical Director of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Clara Maass Medical Center. Fitzhugh specializes in bone and soft tissue pathology and cytopathology and has made the Pathology Power List by The Pathologist Magazine in 2016, 2018, and 2019. She is involved in educating pathology residents and she actively uses social media as a platform for education and for improving diversity in pathology and she also studies how effective social media is at enhancing accurate communication of science and medicine.  Early life and education  Fitzhugh attended Rutgers State University of New Jersey in New Brunswick for her undergraduate degree. She majored in Biological Sciences and was a Division 1 varsity fencing athlete. She was the captain of the fencing team for her last two years of college, and was a four-time varsity letter winner during her time at Rutgers. Her experience as an athlete inspired her to pursue medical school, initially with an interest in orthopedic surgery. In 2000, Fitzhugh received her Bachelors of Arts from Rutgers, and pursued her medical training at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - New Jersey Medical School in Newark. Towards the end of her medical degree, she completed an elective in forensic pathology and this inspired her to pursue a medical career in pathology instead of orthopaedic surgery. She completed her medical training in 2004, and pursued her medical internship in Anatomic and Clinical Pathology at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York. In 2005, she transferred back to her medical alma mater, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - New Jersey Medical School, to complete her residency training in pathology. She became the Chief Resident in her third and fourth years. After finishing her residency in 2008, Fitzhugh moved to New York City to complete a Fellowship in Cytopathology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine for one year.  Career and research  In 2009, Fitzhugh was appointed Assistant Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). In 2013, UMDNJ merged with Rutgers University and Fitzhugh‚Äôs title became Assistant Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. In 2014, Fitzhugh was promoted to Associate Professor in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. As an associate professor, Fitzhugh has been involved in both medical school and residency education. She became the director of the pathology residency education and teaches Musculoskeletal and Integumentary Systems Courses as well as the Pathology course for Rutgers medical students. As the former chair of the Committee on Curriculum, Academic Programs and Policies, Fitzhugh helped guide the structure of medical education at Rutgers. In 2018, Fitzhugh was appointed to Associate Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In 2020, she was promoted to Interim Chair for both the Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School and for the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Rutgers- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. She also directs and chairs the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine department at the Clara Maass Medical Center and is the president of the New Jersey Society of Clinical Pathology. As a physician specializing in orthopedic pathology and cytopathology, Fitzhugh signs out surgical pathology specimens, bone and soft tissue specimens, and cytopathology specimens.  Using social media to enhance pathology education and communication  Fitzhugh actively uses social media as a platform to educate future physicians, advocate for diversity and equity in medicine, and share stories about her experiences as a patient. She co-authored a paper in 2020 exploring how cytopathologists share specimens and interesting cases through Twitter using the #FNAFriday hashtag. They explored the composition of tweets in this study and found that tweets include a variety of images and data and they also found that Papanicolau is the most common stain used among the tweets they analyzed. Fitzhugh and her colleagues also explored the use of Twitter at conferences to see if it was increasing the spread of misinformation.

It is located at 9990 Richmond Avenue in the Westchase neighborhood of west Houston. History The current Philippine Consulate General in Houston was opened on September 24, 2018, 25 years after the first consulate was closed in September 1993, ostensibly due to budget issues, as well as the low number of Filipinos in the area at the time. Closing the first consulate was ordered during the administration of President Corazon Aquino, with holdover consuls heading the post until it was finally closed by her successor, Fidel V. Ramos. During the existence of the first consulate, Consul General Rodolfo Severino Jr. and other officers called on President Ferdinand Marcos to resign in the run-up to the People Power Revolution that would lead to his ouster. After that consulate was closed, relations were conducted through an honorary consulate, led most recently by Ethel R. Mercado. However, the city's rapidly-growing Filipino community continued to pressure for its reopening, and in January 2018, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano announced that the Consulate would reopen, alongside the future opening of three other missions. Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez, writing in The Philippine Star, particularly credited Senator Loren Legarda with pushing to allocate more funds for the opening of new Philippine diplomatic missions, including in Houston. The Consulate reopened out of a temporary space until finally moving to its permanent location, one floor below in the same building, on March 21, 2019. Staff and activities The Philippine Consulate General in Houston is headed by Consul General Jerril G. Santos. Prior to becoming Consul General, he served as Assistant Secretary and Chief of Protocol at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila, and before that was posted at the Philippine Embassy in Hanoi as the Ambassador to Vietnam. In addition to Santos, there are eleven other staffers deployed to the Consulate. Currently, the Consulate's jurisdiction covers Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Oklahoma in addition to Texas, and also exercises jurisdiction over the honorary consulates in Dallas and New Orleans, with former honorary consul Ethel R. Mercado being appointed to head the Dallas consulate. Prior to its reopening the various states were under the jurisdiction of other missions: Texas and New Mexico were under the jurisdiction of the Philippine Consulate General in Los Angeles, which in partnership with local organizations conducted monthly outreach visits in Houston, while Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma were under the Philippine Consulate General in Chicago. Since its reopening, the Consulate has conducted outreach missions in major cities within its jurisdiction, including in Little Rock, Albuquerque, Jackson, and Oklahoma City, as well as within Texas.

The argument, as summarised by Friedrich and Mallory goes that the Indo-European term *b ∞ƒÅg(√≥) most probably refers to the beech tree. Hence the presence of descendants of the term *b ∞ƒÅg(√≥) in Italic, Germanic, Albanian, Greek and (Indo-)Iranian, and potentially Celtic, Slavic, and Baltic, indicates that this word belonged to the most widely-spoken Indo- European language. And thirdly that since the beech tree distribution was limited historically to the regions west of the Eurasian Steppe, this is where this language was spoken. Current distribution map of Fagus sylvatica (European Beech) and Fagus orientalis (Oriental Beech) However much like the salmon problem, this is now an outdated argument, based on many factors including that the historical distribution of the beech trees was historically different to that of today, with certain species potentially extending to the Don River or to the Caucasus, due to the beech being climatically sensitive, and that with the exception of the Kurdish buz, these words for beech are only found in Western Indo-European languages.

The school was built in 1869 to replace Lemont's first school, which opened in 1836 when the area was still largely rural. Locally quarried limestone was used to construct the school; at the time, limestone production was one of the city's main industries. Architect John Barnes of Joliet designed the Victorian building. As the city's population grew considerably during the construction of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in the 1890s, an annex was placed on the school in 1896 to accommodate additional students. The school operated until building safety issues forced its closure in 1974; at the time, it was the oldest continuously operating school in the state. The building has since been converted to condominiums. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 7, 1975.

It covers a rural unincorporated area between Airway Heights and Spokane and has a single school, named Great Northern Elementary, that serves grades kindergarten to six. The district was named for the Great Northern Railway, which donated the land on which the district's single school sits. The first school at the site was built in 1894 and replaced by a larger three-room building, which opened in 1914. History The first one-room schoolhouse in the Highland area was built in 1894 on land donated by the Great Northern Railway. The district was named for the railroad, the area's largest taxpayer. The Great Northern School District graduated its first high school class in 1913, shortly after other rural districts were consolidated into it. The original building was replaced by a new brick building with three classrooms to accommodate more students. The Great Northern School District later dropped its high school classes in favor of sending students to larger facilities in other districts. It was ordered to contribute $31,818 towards the construction of a new building at North Central High School in Spokane in 1978, requiring a special vote on lifting levy limits. The levy measure was passed by 90 percent of voters, allowing for school operations to remain funded and contributing their expected share of construction costs. The district also survived several statewide attempts at consolidating rural school districts proposed by the Washington State Legislature in the 1990s. Governance The district is governed by a five- member board of directors elected to four-year terms in staggered years. It has 14 employees overseen by part-time superintendent Glenn Frizzell, who was hired in 1994. Its budget in 2017‚Äì18 was $803,357. Demographics The Great Northern School District covers an area of around the unincorporated area of Highland, located northeast of Airway Heights and northwest of Spokane. The school district is bordered to the south by the Cheney School District and to the east by Spokane Public Schools, the second-largest school district in Washington. The district's lone school has three classrooms that serve grades kindergarten to six. Older students are typically sent to nearby middle schools in Airway Heights, Cheney, and Spokane. As of the 2018‚Äì19 school year, the district has an enrollment of 41 students, including those from outside of the district boundaries. The 2010 United States Census counted a population of 695 residents within the school district boundaries, of which 22.6 percent were under the age of 18. The racial makeup of residents in 2010 was 94% White, 0.1% Black, 0.9% American Indian/Alaska Native, 1.0% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 0.4% other races, and 3.3% reporting two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 3.3% of the reported population. Data from the American Community Survey estimates that 47.1% of parents in the school district boundaries had a bachelor's degree or higher, while 34.1% had some college or an associate's degree.

Construction  Nomino√© was constructed in 1886 at the Ateliers & Chantiers Dubigeon shipyard in Nantes, France. She was assessed at and had 2 masts.  Sinking  On 28 November 1889, Nomino√© was on a voyage from London, United Kingdom to Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom with a cargo of asphalt. When she was suddenly caught in a violent storm on the North Sea. During the storm, her sails failed one by one which made the ship uncontrollable and drove her of course. To make matters worse, she even lost her anchor before the ship was finally blown upon the coast near the casino of the Belgian city of Blankenberge. Out of fear the ship might break apart by the crashing waves, captain Leperion decided to use torches as a signal of distress towards the lifeguards stationed along the coast. The distress signal was spotted at 1400 hours by a lighthouse lookout, who quickly alerted the lifeguards on duty that day. By 1430 hours, amongst a growing crowd of civilians on the Seawall, a rescue attempt for the five stricken crewmembers on Nomino√© was made with a lifeboat occupied by 13 lifeguards wearing lifebelts. Because the Nomino√© was stranded so close to shore, certain safety precautions were ignored such as securing the lifeboat with a rope to the shore as a lifeline. The lifeboat, despite having a difficult time plowing through the cold waves, managed to approach Nomino√© close enough to try and take on the first crewmember from the ships deck. All five crewmen of Nomino√© had by this point stationed themselves in one of the corners of the ship to shelter themselves from the cold waves which were washing across the deck. Before one the crewmembers could board the lifeboat, it was caught sideways in the rough sea and capsized, remaining afloat upside down. All 13 men were thrown in the waves, but luckily because they were wearing lifebelts, seven of them were able to cling on to the upturned boat and two others managed to swim back to land. Some onlookers who had witnessed the accident from the seawall, tried to swim towards the lifeguards who were stuck on the upturned lifeboat and the others who were still caught in the waves. Most of them however quickly turned back due to the cold and dangerous waves. Ultimately 12 of the 13 lifeguards got back to shore either out of their own strength or thanks to the aid of the brave onlookers. The final lifeguard was still missing after having probably lost his lifebelt when he fell into the sea. Two more had already drowned before they were brought back to shore with another lifeguard died five hours after his rescue. Due to the accident, the rescue of the crew of Nomino√© had to be postponed. By the evening the upturned lifeboat had been blown back onto the shore and was used in a second rescue attempt. At the break of dawn, the new rescue attempt was launched with some of the surviving lifeguards from the previous accident. This time the cold and fatigued crew of Nomino√© managed to be saved.  Aftermath  Four lifeguards died in the disaster with a fifth victim dying five weeks later from sustained injuries. All five victims were seen as heroes and therefore buried next to each other on 2 December 1889 at 10 am on the honour park section of the cemetery of Blankenberge named De Plicht (The Duty) with one grave vacant as the person is still missing. The disaster is still commemorated in Blankenberge to this day, even having a restaurant named after the ship located on the seawall near the place where she ran aground in 1889. The Belgian painter Jules Gadeyne even made a painting showing the wrecked ship along with the difficult rescue attempts.  Wreck  The wreck was declared a total loss and scrapped on site. Pieces of the ship were sold as firewood to the local residents.

The current tower was built in 1929 and staffed through about 1990. A volunteer organization began recruiting individuals to staff the tower in 2019. The ridge and tower were named for homesteaders Constantine and Nellie Chew, who patented on the ridge in the late 19th Century. The lookout is accessible from Carmel Valley Road, and then south on Forest Route 18S02/Tassajara Road . Most of the Tassajara Road is unpaved. Some portions of the road are only suitable for high-clearance or four-wheel drive vehicles, and depending on current weather conditions, may become impassible.  Construction and current use  In 1919, a family resided in a government-owned cabin at the summit, which also served as a fire lookout.Reaves, Irma Oksen Lookouts of the Los Padres Forest (1988) The tall steel frame tower supporting the cab was built in 1929. The tower is at an elevation of . Arthur Story and his wife were among the first residents of the lookout. The lookout was destroyed by the Marble Cone Fire in 1977 and rebuilt in 1978. In 1984 the cab was replaced with a standard R-6 design which featured a cat walk and a flat roof. The tower cab is accessible by a steep staircase of extremely narrow steps. There is no running water, electrical service, air conditioning, or heating inside the cab. Additionally, there is no cell phone service, landline telephone, or internet connectivity on Chews Ridge. Communications are conducted with a battery-powered U.S. Forest Service radio. Color slide of Chews Ridge Lookout circa 1934 Beginning in the 1940s, the tower was seasonally staffed by C. C. Yates and his wife of Arroyo Grande, California. They continued to work seasonally through the 1950s. The tower has not been staffed by the U.S. Forest Service since about 1990. The Forest Service subsequently used the structure to house radio repeater equipment and to mount antennas. In 2019, the California-South Chapter of the Forest Fire Lookout Association reached an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service to begin staffing the tower with volunteers. They cleaned up the cabin, rehabilitated the pit toilet, reinstalled and refurbished the Osborne Fire Finder, and refurbished the tower inside and out. The Forest Fire Lookout Association is training volunteers to serve as forest fire lookouts. They began staffing the tower in August 2019. Their goal is to staff the tower seven days per week from May through November. The lookout atop Chews Peak was one of six active fire lookouts in the Monterey Ranger District of the Los Padres National Forest. The others were located on Cone Peak, Ventana Double Cone, Junipero Serra Peak, Pinyon Peak, and Three Peaks.  History = Original inhabitants  Prior to the arrival of Western immigrants, the Chews Ridge area was inhabited by the Esselen people. They left unique handprints on cave walls which are found to the south of Chews Ridge. There is evidence of Esselen occupation, including bedrock mortars found in grasslands near concentrations of Valley Oak.  Ranching era One of the first non-native Americans to climb the ridge was William Brewer, who climbed the lower slopes of the ridge in May 1861. Chews Ridge was named for Constantine Marcus and Eleanor \\"Nellie\\" (James) Chew, who were married near Monastery Beach in Carmel, California on September 29, 1881. He was 45 and she was 17. They homesteaded two parcels of 155 acres and 160 acres on the ridge to the west of the peak in 1880 and 1892, about four miles south of Jamesburg. Constantine Chew was born in Ohio and descended from the Chew family of England. His wife was the daughter of John and Cynthia (Cox) James. Jamesburg was named after her father. Eleanor Chew was the Jamesburg Postmaster from 1894 to 1919. She was paid $159.20 in 1902 (equivalent to $ in ). She also wrote a column titled \\"Jamesburg Gleanings\\" filled with local news for the Salinas Californian and Salinas Daily Index newspapers for 25 years. On September 25, 1906, Eleanor Chew reported in her column that \\"an automobile party of seven, accompanied by a camp wagon, arrived here last night and will go to Miller Canyon today. This is the first auto to attempt the grade above here. H. Dana, of Mountain View, owner of the machine, is in charge.\\" Daily auto stage service to and from Salinas began in 1914. Nellie Chew also became the librarian for the Jamesburg branch of the Monterey County Library established on March 14, 1914, located in the post office. The Chews sold the ranch in April 1919 to William Gordon and Pauline (Henningsen) Lambert of Jamesburg. Constantine Chew died on March 29, 1920 at age 85 in National City, California at the home of his son John. Eleanor died at age 88 on January 36, 1952 in Pacific Grove, California.State of California. California Death Index, 1940-1997. Sacramento, CA, USA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics  World War II  During World War II, the lookout was staffed by observers for the civilian Aircraft Warning Service. Additional housing was constructed for the observers who were on duty around the clock.  China Camp  China Camp is a public drive-in campground near the summit of Chews Ridge. The camp site is the eastern trail head of the Pine Ridge Trail. There is a modern pit toilet. No water is available. There are 10 campsites that can be reserved in advance. Campsites 1‚Äî5 open year-round and campsites 6‚Äî10 are only open in the summer season. Fees are $20 per night and allow one vehicle per site. Additional vehicles cost more. There is no overnight trailhead parking without a campground reservation. Portions of the road from Tassajara Road to Chews Ridge are suitable for high-clearance vehicles or four-wheel drive vehicles. During the winter or in inclement weather, the road may be impassable. The road continues over the mountain down a very narrow and steep dirt road suitable only for four-wheel drive vehicles to Tassajara Hot Springs. It is the only high peak in the Santa Lucia Range with a road crossing its summit. China Camp was named after the Chinese workers who were hired and lived at the camp while they completed building the road to the Tassajara Hot Springs Resort in 1888. On steep portions, the wagon driver would drag a log behind the wagon to prevent it from descending too quickly.  Fire history  In 1903, a fire started by an untended campfire near Chews Ridge burned a path wide to the coast over three months. E. A. Sterling reported that \\"the largest fire in recent years started last year, 1903, in July, and burned for three months. It started from an unextinguished campfire in Township 18 south, range 4 west [in the Chews Ridge area], and burned a strip of about a township wide through to the coast, becoming wider towards its western end.\\" On July 21 of that year Eleanor \\"Nellie\\" Chew reported that \\"a fire has been raging on the Carmel for some time past and the air is filled with smoke. The weather has been cool, otherwise it would have been very unpleasant.\\" Two months later, on September 22, 1903, she reported that \\"the mountain fire which has given the people of this vicinity so much trouble for the past month has again broken out and nine or ten men have been fighting it for several days. The coast fire has also come over the divide and crossed the Carmel river and threatens Andrew Church's place with destruction.\\" In 1906, a fire that began in Palo Colorado Canyon from the embers of a campfire burned over 35 days and was finally extinguished by the first rainfall of the season. In 2017, the Soberanes fire burned east to Chews Ridge, requiring fire fighters to burn backfires to stop further spread.  Geography and geology  A developed hardwood forest and mixed community of Valley Oak (Quercus lobata) and Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri) thrives on the slopes of Chews Ridge. The ridge unusually supports extensive areas of savanna with large valley oaks, with many patches of open grassland than other peaks in the Santa Lucia Range. The predominant rock types include pre-cretaceous schist, very small ultrabasic outcrops, and Miocene sandstone.  Murders  On June 6, 2014, Joseph Nissensohn was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for killing Tanya Jones, 14, and Tammy Jarschke, 13, of Seaside, California on Chews Ridge in 1981.  Weather  Chews Ridge, at an elevation of , is the third highest peak in the Santa Lucia Range. Junipero Serra Peak at is the highest. During severe winter storms, the peak can receive of snow. In 1907, Eleanor Chew reported that of snow had accumulated on the ridge.  Astronomy use  Astronomy graduate students at Warner and Swasey Observatory, Case Western Reserve University were interested in building their own astronomical observatory. They learned about a unused mirror at Princeton and obtained it on a long-term loan. They eventually began looking for mountain ranges \\"along the west coast of a continent\\" where the air was smooth from the ocean, \\"resulted in small sharp star images\\". Two student members traveled to the Monterey area to investigate the Santa Lucia Range. In 1972, members of the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy applied to the Forest Service for a use permit, and it was granted in 1974. Over the next couple of years, the Case students moved to Monterey County, and took part-time jobs in the area, in order to make a down-payment on in Cachagua Valley, near the Carmel foothills. In 1975, the Army Corps of Engineers finished the last half mile to the observatory as part of a training exercise. Astronomer Bart Bok and his astronomer wife Priscilla donated \\"their entire collection of journals and books\\". The Oliver Observing Station () was built south-southeast of the lookout. When the facility opened in 1982, it was the first private observatory to open in the United States in the 20th century.

He is best known for winning the Macau Grand Prix in 1964, the only Hong Kong driver to win the event. Poon's name is synonymous with the Macau Grand Prix as he holds the record for competing in the most consecutive Macau Grand Prix. Beginning with his first race in 1961, Poon competed for the last time in 1982, the year before the race switched to Formula 3. Racing career Poon went over to Macau to watch the Macau Grand Prix in 1958 and he said, \\"'I want to do that' and the next year I was in it.\\" Poon took third place in 1962 at Macau in a Jaguar E-type owned by barrister Charles Ching. In 1963, Poon acquired his first real racing car - a Lotus 23. The $36,000 purchase price came courtesy of a Government loan. The first time Poon drove the Lotus 23 in a race he won the 1963 Singapore Grand Prix and later the Malaysian Grand Prix in Johor Bahru., the first person to win both races in the same year. He also won the Production Car race at Macau in a Lotus Ford Cortina. After six years of trying, Poon finally won at Macau in 1964, establishing a new lap record in doing so. He won with three laps to spare and took home a cheque for $10,000. In 1965, Poon won the Singapore and Malaysian Grand Prix again. But Poon was denied leave by the Royal Hong Kong Police to take part in the Tengku Abdul Rahman races in Kuala Lumpur and subsequently resigned from the force, in order \\"to devote more time to motor racing\\". In the Macau Grand Prix that year, Poon was forced to drop out of the race with engine trouble while leading. In 1966, Albert Poon placed first overall in the Singapore Grand Prix in the point standings for the saloon and touring cars and the Grand Prix. Placed second in the actual Grand Prix. In the same year, Alfa Romeo set up a company in Hong Kong to re-export its cars to the South East Asia market, with Albert Poon as its head. For 1967, Poon won the Production Car race in his Alfa Romeo at the Macau and Johor Grand Prix. He set a lap record in the Macau Grand Prix but failed to finish the race. Poon also came second in the Singapore Grand Prix. In 1968, Albert Poon won the Selangor Grand Prix in Malaysia. In 1969 Poon won the Asian Karting Grand Prix in Manila and the Singapore Grand Prix. For the Macau Grand Prix, Poon bought a Brabham BT30 for $80,000 and came second in the Macau Grand Prix. He recounted, 'I bought a Formula 2 car for Macau and thought I was going to win for sure. It was a former Piers Courage-winning car in Britain. At the 11th hour, the organisers said they were going to allow Australian Kevin Bartlett to race with a V8-powered Alfa Romeo. 'What could I say? I was an Alfa Romeo dealer at the time, so I said, 'Of course', knowing full well that he was going to beat me, which he did.' In 1970 Poon finished second, both in the Philippines Grand Prix and in the Macau Grand Prix where, after crashing his main car against the seawall earlier in the race, used an older back-up car. In the same year, Albert Poon took his Alfa Romeo GTA to victory of the Royal Perak 200 at the Tosek industrial site in Ipoh, beating Japanese ace drivers Tohiro Kenji and Masahiro Hasemi in the process. In 1973, Albert Poon won the 50-lap Production Race in Malaysia. Placed second in the Malaysian Grand Prix. Diana Poon, ex-wife of Albert Poon, raced alongside her husband in the 1976 Macau Grand Prix, becoming the first-ever couple to compete in the GP.

Albert Poon also entered the 1997 Australian Super Touring Championship but did not start any race. In the 2002 Merdeka Millennium Endurance Race held at the Sepang International Circuit, Albert Poon partneted Neville McKay and Jose Catita in a Mallock in the Group A which is opened to any production sports car of any capacity and any saloon cars above 1900cc. For the Macau Grand Prix's 60th anniversary in 2013, Albert Poon competed in the Lotus Greater China Race where all drivers drive in standard 1.6 litre Lotus Elises. Poon acknowledged the differences between the old days and modern day racing especially in terms of safety ‚Äúand landscape.‚Äù As he mentioned, ‚Äúthe circuit remains exactly the same but the [surrounding] landscape has changed drastically.‚Äù Rallying Poon drove in the 555 Rally from Hong Kong to Beijing in Oct 1994 in a Nissan Pulsar. Personal life Poon studied at Diocesan Boys' School. He is a former policeman and car dealer and is father of three children.

The operation took place in the Qandil Mountains, the Sinjar District, and Makhmur, against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) targets, as part of the ongoing Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish and Kurdish‚ÄìIranian conflicts. Claw-Eagle, the air campaign, began on 15 June 2020. Claw-Tiger, the ground campaign, was launched on 17 June.  Background  As part of the 2013‚Äì2015 peace talks, the Kurdistan Workers' Party agreed to move most of its fighters to the mountains in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Turkish Armed Forces also established bases in Iraq which sparked regional and international condemnation. The conflict reignited once more in June 2015, accompanied by ongoing Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War and harassment of Kurdish parties in Turkey.  Operation Claw-Eagle  Turkish Forces bombed Sinjar and destroyed multiple Yezedi villages, according to locals Turkey was specifically targeting civilian villages, and there are fears of ethnic cleansing and genocide by the Turkish State towards Yezidi's.https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Turkey-bombs-Sinjar-villages-in- Iraq-where-genocide-survivors-live-606992 The Turkish government claimed that fighter jets destroyed caves in the Qandil Mountains used by the guerrillas. The airstrikes also struck near Makhmour refugee camp, which hosts thousands of Turkish Kurd refugees who fled the conflict in the 1990s, as well as Yezidi villages in Sinjar. The Turkish Ministry of National Defense released a video of the airstrikes, claiming 81 targets were destroyed. On 25 June, a drone strike killed one or two PKK fighters outside a shop in Kuna Masi north of Sulaymaniyah, and injured six nearby civilians in the marketplace (two men, two women, and two children). Four of the wounded are in serious condition in Qalachwan Hospital.  Operation Claw-Tiger  On 17 June, Turkish Land Forces launched a ground operation in the Haftanin region of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Iranian cooperation  On 16 June, the Iranian military shelled the Choman area of the Qandil Mountains, an attack that is believed to have been coordinated with the simultaneous Turkish airstrikes. The collaboration is said to materialize known alliances between Turkey and Iran.  Reactions  * The Arab League condemned the operation based on violation of Iraq's sovereign space. Turkey criticized the declaration, on the claim of PKK itself affecting Iraq's sovereignty. * The parliament of the Kurdistan region criticized the attacks while Iraq demanded that Turkey stops violating the Iraqi airspace and terrorizing the population in the area. * Protests condemning the airstrikes were held in Duhok province but also in several countries in Europe. In London a Kurdish protester forced a car transporting Boris Johnson to stop in order to raise awareness to the situation of the Kurds in Iraqi Kuridistan. * In June 2020, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom accused Turkey that it threatened Yazidis families who attempted to return to their homes in the Sinjar. Turkey rejected the claims. * In August 2020, Iraq canceled a ministerial meeting and summoned the Turkish ambassador as Iraq blamed Turkey for a drone strike that killed two high-ranking Iraqi military officers.

Aug. 5, 1919, Peaks Mill, KY) was a master distiller at Buffalo Trace Distillery, and master distiller emeritus after his retirement in 1985. Lee died July 16, 2013 at 93. Lee is known for launching Blanton's in 1984, the first modern bourbon brand marketed as a single barrel bourbon. Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers‚Äô Association, credited the premium market that Mr. Lee pioneered as a major factor in the bourbon industry‚Äôs turnaround in the last decade; sales reached 30 million gallons in 2012 for the first time since 1973, he said. He entered the University of Kentucky but withdrew to volunteer for the Army in World War II. He served as a radar bombardier in B-29 bombers based in Guam. Mr. Lee returned to the university after the war to get his degree and began working at the distillery as a maintenance engineer when, under a different owner, it was called the George T. Stagg Distillery. He was promoted to plant superintendent in 1966 and to plant manager in 1969 and given the title master distiller in the early 1980s. After his retirement, Buffalo Trace honored Mr. Lee with a single- barrel brand of his own, the Elmer T. Lee Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, bottled from barrels he continued selecting himself into his 90s. The label won gold medals this year [2013] at both the Los Angeles International Wine and Spirits Competition and the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. The journal Whiskey Advocate described its flavor as ‚Äúelegant and complex.‚Äù Lee was inducted in the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame in 2001 and received lifetime achievement awards from both Whisky Advocate (2002) and Whisky Magazine (2012).

It is near Bab Guissa in Fes el-Bali.  History  The oldest pavilion of the building was begun in 1879 as the residence of Si Mohammed ben Arbi el Jamai, who, along with his brother, was one of the Grand Viziers of the Alaouite sultan Moulay Hassan (ruled 1873‚Äì1894). The same family also built and owned the Dar Jamai in Meknes (now a museum), built around the same time. Upon the ascension of Sultan Abdelaziz and his Grand Vizier Ba Ahmed (whose family were rivals to the Jamai family) in 1894, the Jamai family lost favour with the court, some of its members were arrested, and its property was seized by the state. In 1927 the palace was expanded by architect Edmond Gourdain (1885‚Äì1968), and in 1929 it was purchased by the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique who transformed it into a hotel for their North African tours. When the company ran into troubles, the hotel was purchased by the Compagnie des chemins de fer du Maroc (ONCF). In the early 1970s, a major new wing, five stories tall, was added. In 1998 the property was bought by the Accor group which renovated it and reopened it as part of the Sofitel chain. The hotel closed again in 2014 and is being renovated again.  Description  The original palace was built in a Moorish-Moroccan style and was surrounded by gardens, on a hill overlooking much of the city near Bab Guissa, the northern gate of Fes el- Bali. Like other palaces and mansions in this style, it included carved stucco and zellij (mosaic tilework) decoration. Subsequent expansions of the hotel have modified the palace grounds and added a modern five-story wing, but have continued to pay tribute to the original Moorish style. In addition to the old pavilion from Jamai's time and the new wing of the hotel, the grounds also include extensive gardens in an Andalusian or Moroccan style (based on the riad model), which partly surround the palace. The gardens include traditional fountains decorated with zellij tilework, including a particularly ornate wall fountain.

Buchanan was awarded the MBE in 2012 for services to Social Science. She is a fellow of the Academy of Social Science.  Early life and education  Buchanan was born in England and raised in Scotland. She received a Diploma in Social Studies in 1968 with Distinction and Post-Graduate Diploma in Applied Social Studies from University of Bath and Certificate of Qualification in Social Work. In 1990, she received a Ph.D. in Social Work and Psychology from University of Southampton.  Career  In 1974, Buchanan joined Burderop Hospitals as a Research Assistant to Jack Oliver. She left Burderop Hospitals in 1980 to become a child psychiatric social worker. In 1989 she was appointed as a Lecturer at University of Southampton. In 1994, she joined University of Oxford as Lecturer. She was promoted to Professor in 2006. At Oxford she set up the Centre for Research into Parenting and Children at Oxford in 1996 with partners from across the university, with a particular focus on children who were at risk of social exclusion. She served as its Director from 1996 to 2008. She was appointed to the Council of ESRC in 2006 and chaired the Research Ethics Committee and Evaluation Board from 2007 to 2013 and then served on the Council of the National Academy of Social Sciences from 2011 to 2017, serving on their Audit Committee and Publication Committees.{{cite weburl=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21582041.2013.767469title=Impact and knowledge mobilisation: what I have learnt as Chair of the Economic and Social Research Council Evaluation Committee}natio} Buchanan was a Trustee of Family Welfare Association from 1999 to 2007, The Baring Foundation from 2002 to 2014; Grandparents Plus from 2012 to 2018 and Oxfordshire Community Foundation from 2004 to 2014.  Research  In 1973, Buchanan worked with Jack Oliver on his studies of severely abusing families ‚Äì with one family they traced back 7 generations. With his help, she wrote her first book Intergenerational Child Maltreatment: Facts, Fancies and Interventions. They also undertook a study on children in subnormality hospital who had been rendered disabled as a result of child abuse. As, severely abused children ended up in public care, as a social worker Buchanan was interested in what happened to those children brought up by the public parent. She wrote several papers on this topic. Later at Oxford, Buchanan broadened her research to include all children. For these studies, she used the National Child Development Study (NCDS). Her research on what happened when these children grew up showed that children brought up in care had major mental health and other problems when adult. Two issues emerged from her NCDS work: first, the impact of divorce on children‚Äôs outcomes and second, the important role of fathers. This led to studies funded by Nuffield Foundation on divorce and ESRC on fathers. The work on divorce was also influential highlighting court cases where parents were fighting over the custody of children. By this point, the focus of Buchanan's research was moving onto how to promote child well-being and supportive family relationships. She conducted research on the issues that went wrong in family relationships. Her Centre at Oxford ran seminars every year on ‚ÄòPromoting the well-being of children‚Äô; two edited volumes emerged from this work. She continued her work on fathering but also began focusing on the impact of grandparents in a child's life. Subsequently, she edited a volume on the role of grandfathers. In 2013, she co-edited the book Fertility Rates and Population Decline: No Time for Children? with Anna Rotkirch. She then edited the 2016 book, Grandfathers: Global Perspectives with Rotkirch. The book was nominated for a British Academy Peter Townsend award. In 2018, she and Rotkirch edited the book The Role of Grandparents in the 21st Century: Global Perspectives on Changing Roles and Consequences.

Preceded by four singles including \\"My Game\\" and \\"Only a Dream\\", the visual EP was produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. The record marks Day's first release under joint record deal with Concord Records and Easy Eye Sound. The music videos for the EP were directed by Neil Krug, Phillip Lopez, Samuel Richard and Gianennio Salucci. Krug also shot cover artwork for each song on the EP. Background and development After releasing her debut major label album, Kicker (2015), under Hollywood Records, Day eventually split ways with the label in 2017. She then released the double-single \\"Man on the Moon / Hunnie Pie\\" (2018) under B3SCI, with the intention for the song to be the lead single off her unreleased third studio album. While on tour, Day debuted several songs including songs such as \\"Gypsy Girl\\". Day eventually parted ways with B3SCI and signed a new deal with Easy Eye Sound and Concord Records to begin recording new material. In an interview, Day stated that after leaving her labels she had \\"moved into a new apartment with [her] sister in Beachwood... [and] allowed [herself] to not feel pressured to write when [she] was hurting on the inside,\\" adding how \\"there was a lot of betrayal that I was feeling. I was presenting these songs that I was in love with and they were being rejected. It was just kind of this wakeup call that I had to act now.\\" Recording During the summer of 2019, Day wrote several songs over a four-day period that would end up becoming her EP, Where Does the Devil Hide. Produced by The Black Key's Dan Auerbach, the EP will feature five songs. On working with Day, Auerbach said \\"Working with Zella at Easy Eye came as a creative partnership in so many ways. She‚Äôs such a free thinker. These songs showcase her in a way that is honest and self- realized.\\"https://www.concordrecords.com/release/where-does-the-devil-hide/ The song \\"People Are Strangers\\" was debuted live by Day as part of her opening set for Lana Del Rey in Santa Barbara. Visuals American photographer Neil Krug had assisted Day with her visuals for the songs on the EP, while also directing two videos for the EP with \\"People Are Strangers\\" and \\"Purple Haze\\". Phillip Lopez directed the follow-up video for \\"My Game\\" and co- directed \\"Only A Dream\\" with Gianennio Salucci. \\"Benny My Dear\\" has been the only song to not have a video so far, though a lyric video was released. Promotion and release Prior to the release of the first single off the EP, Day debuted her cover of \\"You Sexy Thing\\" and premiered an accompanying video for it in September, 2019. After announcing the EP, Day released \\"People Are Strangers\\" as the first single in April. This was followed by the release of \\"My Game\\" in May and \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"Only a Dream\\" in July. Day has only been able to promote the album with one performance due to the restrictions put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Day performed the \\"People Are Strangers\\" and \\"My Game\\" independently, without a crowd, as a part of a 360¬∞ livestream series in partnership with MelodyVR. In an interview promoting the EP with Sch√∂n! magazine, Day announced that she had a full-length album coming as a follow-up to the EP.https://schonmagazine.com/interview-zella-day/ Singles Dan Auerbach (pictured) produced and co-wrote the EP with Day. \\"People Are Strangers\\", the EP's first single, was released on April 23, 2020. In a press release for the song, Day stated \\"I began writing \\"People are Strangers\\" on the bathroom floor after a night of learning an ugly truth about my lover. I brought the idea to Nashville where Dan Auerbach and I finished the song by taking a dark subject matter and approaching it with simplicity. There is sweetness to the lyrics and melodies of \\"People are Strangers\\" that is meant to inspire empathy towards the ones that have hurt us.\\" Northern Transitions called the song a \\"vulnerable ballad, sun-soaked and possessing the aura of classic California\\" while Anna Milo Devine of Noise Trend praised the song as \\"a sonic nod to the sounds and ideas of \\"quintessential California\\", but refreshed with modern honesty.\\" The song is dream pop, influenced by surf rock and soft rock. The second single, \\"My Game\\", is a pop funk and nu-disco track. Written by Day, Auerbach, and Bobby Wood, the song is an upbeat anthem that serves as an homage to classic 70s film scores and Donna Summer. American Songwriter called the song \\"sexy psychedelic and cinematic romp that would have made for the perfect 007 theme song\\". Day (pictured in 2017) co-wrote every song on the EP. The third song off the EP, \\"Purple Haze\\", was announced and released on July 9 alongside an accompanying Neil Krug- directed music video. A writer from Skope magazine called the video \\"echnicolor visions of Zella that warp and melt together like vivid hallucinations, the piece truly makes you feel as though you can taste outer space\\" and adding that the song itself is \\"sultry psychedelia and marks yet another imaginative sonic direction\\" like other songs on the EP released so far. Day commented on the song's conception and meaning, saying how \\"‚ÄòPurple Haze‚Äô is summer love for simple pleasures,\\" says Zella. \\"When I lived in downtown LA I would hum this melody while strolling to the market in the mood for something sweet. All of those perfect Saturdays with nothing to do but eat oranges and daydream.\\" The fourth song released, \\"Only a Dream\\", is an indie pop ballad about desiring a relationship even if it is toxic and all- consuming. The video was directed by Samuel Richard and Gianennio Salucci and released online on July 31, 2020. The video follows Day and her male co-star in a vintage-themed, passionate love story. The clip was filmed in San Luis Obispo, partially at the Madonna Inn. When interviewed by Flaunt magazine, Day said the song was inspired by the garden of love and the visuals for the video were inspired by her mother's backyard in Day's childhood home in Arizona. The song's bridge references the title of the EP. The final single, \\"Benny My Dear\\", was released on the EP's release date of August 28, 2020. The song's digital release was followed by a lyric video being premiered on Day's Vevo on the same day. Upon the release, Day released a statement stating how \\"selfless love acts without expectation of receiving anything other than the satisfaction of giving. Benny has been crying out for affection for far too long, he struggles to believe that he deserves it. Benny reminds us that vulnerability is the only way out and the only way in.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo57HbRbqQ8 Critical reception RJ Frometa of Vents magazine praised the EP and its visuals, writing \\"From the radiant songs to the jaw-dropping imagery captured in her music videos and artwork for the project, every element of Where Does The Devil Hide shares a unified vision that melds vivid sounds, aesthetics and ideas inspired by the essence of quintessential California.\\"https://ventsmagazine.com/2020/08/28/zella-day-releases-brand-new- ep-where-does-the-devil-hide/ Taila Lee of The Daily Californian left a positive review of the record, commenting how \\"A variety of genres are represented in Day‚Äôs vibrant discography, but this organic EP signifies her general shift from down-to-earth pop to head-in-the-clouds indie.\\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/08/28/coming-face-to-face-with-the- darkness-zella-day-talks-new-ep-california-inspiration/ Gary Graff of The Oakland Press included the EP in its weekly list of new musical releases.https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/new-music-katy-perry- metallica-kem-record-store-day-and- more/article_89a84cc4-e7d9-11ea-9c80-17b5e417ead6.html Taylor Thompson of Lady Gunn positively compared the EP to the music of Stevie Nicks and The Doors while calling the video for \\"Only A Dream\\" \\"beautifully intimate and personal\\".https://www.ladygunn.com/music/interviews-music/zella-day-a-vintage- sound-ahead-of-the-times/  Track listing  All tracks were produced by Dan Auerbach.

Flowering mainly occurs from October to January and the fruit is a capsule about with the remains of the sepals attached, but which fall from the plant when mature. Taxonomy and naming This tea-tree was formally described in 1920 by Cyril Tenison White and William D. Francis who gave it the name Agonis elliptica and published the description in the Botany Bulletin of the Department of Agriculture, Queensland from specimens collected by Francis near Beerwah. In 1932, Edwin Cheel transferred the species to the genus 'Leptospermum, but since there was already a species L. ellipticum (now known as Pericalymma ellipticum), Cheel changed the name to L. whitei, honouring C.T.White.

As a result, he was sometimes referred to as the \\"Austrian Raffet\\", after the French lithographer, Auguste Raffet.Ulrich Thieme (Ed.), Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden K√ºnstler von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart. Leipzig, 1937, Vol.XXXI, pg. 497 f. He had his first exhibition in 1846 and would continue to have showings on a regular basis for the rest of his life. The events of 1848 gave an impetus to his interest in military painting, which would become his specialty, although he is also known for hunting scenes. His clients included hunting associations and horse lovers, as well as the Common Army and the usual wealthy individuals. In 1869, he became a member of the \\"Genossenschaft der bildenden Kunstler\\" (Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus). In 1879, he became mentally deranged and was committed to an asylum. He died two years later, leaving a large collection of arms and military antiques. In 1889 a street, the \\"Stra√ügschwandtnerstra√üe\\", was dedicated to him in the Penzing district of Vienna.

Mount Ferry is the eighth-highest peak in the Bailey Range, which is a subrange of the Olympic Mountains. In clear weather, the mountain can be seen from the visitor center at Hurricane Ridge. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Pulitzer, to the southwest. Stephen Peak is set to the northwest, and Mount Olympus is to the southwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Elwha and Hoh Rivers. Etymology This peak was named by the 1889-90 Seattle Press Expedition after Elisha P. Ferry (1825‚Äì1895), the first Governor of Washington. It was at Ferry's urging that the Seattle Press newspaper sponsored the expedition to make the first crossing of the Olympic Mountains. The mountain's name was originally affixed to the 6,283-ft peak (Mt. Pulitzer) to the southwest before it was moved to its present position. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Ferry is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing. Geology Mt. Ferry north aspect The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

Biography Rabbi Shimon was born in Lukov, to his father Rabbi Israel Leib (Elbaum) Likover from J√≥zef√≥w, the son of Rabbi Yaakov Kopel Likover, of Lukov, and his mother Esther Etel WeissblumMy Heritage. As a child, his father moved to J√≥zef√≥w, leaving Rabbi Shimon with his grandfather Rabbi Yakov Kopel Likover. Rabbi Ya'akov Koppel made a living from his inn and a whirlpool managed by employees. He himself sat day and night in Talmudic Study and his name became known in the area as a true scholar and as a generous person. He was opposed to the Hasidic Movement. It is recounted that the Ba'al Shem Tov, the founder of Chasidus, tried to attract Rabbi Ya'akov Kopel to Hasidism but he was unsuccessful. Rabbi Yaakov Koppel was offered various rabbinic positions and he rejected all of them, including the rabbinate proposed to him by the community in Amsterdam. He died on the february 22nd, 1769. His son Rabbi Israel Leib followed him and strongly opposed Hasidism. In his youth, Rabbi Shimon son of Rabbi Israel Leib, was pursued by his rabbi and cousin the prominent Chozeh MiLublin (his mother was Rabbi Israel Leib's sister) and Rabbi Shimon became Hasidic. As a result, his father was so upset that he told him not to say Kaddish for him with the addition of 'Veyatsmach' as per the custom of Hasidim (Nusach Sefard). He firmly held that it would be better not to say Kaddish at all than to recite that version. After his marriage, Rabbi Shimon lived with his wife's family in JaroslawOhel Shimon by Meir Wonder. Teachers The first of his rebbes was Rabbi Elimelech of Lyzensk. When Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz, the \\"choze,\\" began to head the community , Rabbi Shimon joined him, even though Rabbi Elimelech was still alive. He always had viewed the \\"Choze/Seer of Lublin\\" as the highest authority and saw himself as his devoted follower. At the same time, he also received the authority of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Rimanov, who lived in close proximity to Jaros≈Çaw, as instructed by the \\"Choze.\\" After the death of the Choze and of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Rimanov, in 1825, he traveled extensively to Rabbi Naftali Zvi of Ropshitz, who was one year younger than him, until his death. Then he continued to travel to Rav Naftali's son, Rabbi Menashe, even though he was forty years younger than him. He also traveled to Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Meshares, who was the son of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Rimanov and succeeded him after his passing, and to Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov, who began to lead the community after the passing of the Choze. In his old age he would often travel to Rabbi Sholom Rokeach of Belz. It is said that when he once arrived at Rabbi Shalom at the age of ninety, the latter told him that at such an age he should stay at home, but he replied to him \\"at home you rot\\" (\\"◊ë◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊û◊™◊¢◊§◊©◊ô◊ù\\"). He had a place of honor in Belz, and many of his Divrei Torah and stories were preserved by Belz's followers. He was close to many of the Admorim of his generation and although he lived until ninety-one and was becoming blind, he continued to travel to the admorim, young and old. Also among his many rebbis were: Rabbi Moshe Leib of Sasov, Rabbi Moshe of Peshawarsk, Rabbi Meir of Permishlan, Rabbi Chaim of Kosov, Rabbi Chaim of Sanz, Rabbi Shalom of Kaminka, Rabbi Issachar Dov Av Beit Din Scohl (the father-in-law of Rabbi Sholom Rokeach of Belz). Rabbinate After the passing of Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk, his disciples appointed Rabbi Shimon to a Rebbe without asking him, for fear of being refused. Good relations existed between him and the rabbis of the city: Rabbi Yehuda Heller-Wallerstein, Rabbi Naphtali Hertz Sharif, and Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz, author of \\"Beer Yitzhak\\". The \\"Dayan Hagadol\\" in the city was Rabbi Aryeh Leibush Horwitz, brother of Rabbi Eliezer, author of \\"Noam Megadim\\". He was involved in public affairs in the city, and personally handled the existence of the institutions, such as Mikveh and Kosher slaughter. When they were building the Great Synagogue and held a comprehensive fundraiser, Rabbi Shimon took an active part, despite having his own synagogue (klois). He also served as the chairman of the committee of seven members of dignitaries, which was set up on 19th January, 1834 to raise funds, so that the poor children could also be exempt from the Austrian army. His secretary (the Gabay) of Rabbi Shimon was Menachem Mendel (Mendish) Taustein. Disciples Among his famous students was Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Frankel of Willipoli, who was first a student, and became a rebbe,. Until the Holocaust there were generations of rabbis and Rebbe's from his students. Also known to travel to Rabbi Shimon were: Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac of Zidichov, and Rabbi Yitschok Aizik Yehudah Yechiel Safrin of Kumarna. Joseph Babad of Ternopol, author of \\"Minchat Chinuch\\", traveled there twice. Death Rabbi Shimon passed away on the first day of Sukkot, 1849, buried in Cemetery in the Falkin suburb about eight kilometers from Jaros≈Çaw. An Ohel/structure was built on his tomb. Buried there as well were his son Rabbi Bunem Mendel and his wife, and his son-in-law Rabbi Kehat Hilferrin and his wife. The city's Jews used to visit the place mainly during the days of mercy and forgiveness. The Ohel was destroyed by rioters during the Holocaust and for a long time its place was unknown in the ruined cemetery. On the 19th of february, 2010, the Ohel was re-inaugurated by Agudath Ohalei Tsadikim◊ô◊®◊ï◊°◊ú◊ë: ◊†◊ó◊†◊ö ◊ê◊ï◊î◊ú ◊î◊®◊î\\"◊ß ◊û◊ô◊®◊ï◊°◊ú◊ë, in Agudath Ohalei Tsadikim's website.

Life  Born in Leipzig, between 1921 and 1929 Collum attended a primary school in Leipzig. Afterwards he studied the organ from 1930 to 1934 with Karl Straube and G√ºnther Ramin, the piano with Carl Adolf Martienssen, with Choir conducting with Kurt Thomas and musical composition with Johann Nepomuk David at the . Fritz Reuter was also one of his teachers there.Walter Clemens, Werner Busch: In memory of Fritz Reuter. In Heinz Wegener (editor's note): Gedenkschrift Fritz Reuter (Scientific journal of the Humboldt University of Berlin. Social and linguistic science series 15 (1966) 3). pp. I-VI, here: p. V. Already from 1927 he was deputy organist at the St. Matth√§ikirche Leipzig. From 1932 to 1935 he worked as assistant to Professor G√ºnther Ramin at the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig. His main creative phase was the period as Dresden organist, which began with his appointment in 1935 and ended with his death in April 1982 at the age of 67. Michael-Christfried Winkler was elected as his successor. In 1946 he founded the Collum Choir and the Collum Concerts. On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach, a total of 24 Collum concerts took place between September 1949 and August 1950. Soloists, the Collum Choir and members of the S√§chsische Staatskapelle performed under Collum's direction. Performance venues were the Dresdner Martin Luther Church in the Neustadt and the Reformed Church, because the Kreuzkirche, which burned down in 1945, could not yet be used again. During his time as a cross organist Collum also took on various teaching assignments. From 1942 to 1945 and again between 1954 and 1956, he was a teacher at the and subsequently, until 1958, he was a lecturer for organ at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden.

He frequently gave concerts on the Silbermann organ of the church there and also made a recording in the series \\"Bach's Organ Works on Silbermann Organs\\". The concert tradition founded by him is successfully continued under the direction of the present cross organist Holger Gehring. That is why this organ is one of the most famous organs in Saxony.  Honours  In 1973 Collum received the Art Prize of the German Democratic Republic. In Dresden, the Herbert-Collum-Stra√üe was later named after him.

Collision Course was recognised by commentators upon its release for displaying a more jazz-orientated sound than the band's previous releases. Shortly after the album's release, vocalist and rhythm guitarist LeRoy Preston, pianist Floyd Domino and fiddler Bill Mabry all left Asleep at the Wheel, with Johnny Nicholas joining on guitar, piano and vocals. Domino was reportedly the first to leave, following a \\"falling out\\" with frontman Ray Benson. The pianist, whose then-wife was also the manager of the group, claimed that \\"We had a big blowout when I left. When you battle with Ray, there are no time-outs. But there are also no hard feelings.\\" Reception=Commercial Collision Course did not reach the US Billboard 200, but registered at number 10 on the Bubbling Under chart. On the Top Country Albums chart it peaked at number 46, 13 places lower than 1977's The Wheel. In other publications, the album reached number 171 on the Cash Box albums chart, number 29 on the publication's country albums chart, number 174 on the Record World albums chart, and number 14 on the magazine's country albums chart. Collision Course was the band's first album to chart outside of the US, reaching number 19 on the Canadian RPM country albums chart. Critical Critical reviews of Collision Course were generally positive. In an uncredited review, Cash Box magazine noted that \\"Despite the group's name, its latest album is a wide awake effort which should help liven up everything from radio playlists to parties,\\" praising the range of musical styles on the album and describing it as \\"100% fun\\". Similarly, Record World claimed that \\"The Wheel continues to progress musically with blues, jazz, country and much more with a style all their own,\\" highlighting in particular the recordings of Randy Newman's \\"Louisiana\\", J.R. Chatwell's \\"Pipe Dreams\\" and Naomi Neville's \\"Ruler of My Heart\\". Robert Christgau awarded Collision Course a B‚Äì rating, his lowest for the band to date, which he credited to the lack of original material on the album. He described the majority of tracks as \\"nice, rarely more\\". Accolades Collision Course spawned Asleep at the Wheel's first Grammy Award, winning Best Country Instrumental Performance for its recording of Count Basie's \\"One O'Clock Jump\\".

She received her MA in Educational Administration from the University of Toronto and a BA Diploma in Teaching from the University of Waikato. She earned her PhD in Educational Administration from the University of Toronto.  Career  Johansson-Fua is Director of the Institute of Education at the University of the South Pacific. In 2018 she initiated a Network for Educational Research which brought together education ministries from a variety of Pacific countries for the first time to further collaborative research and understanding. Research interests As a Tongan academic, Johansson-Fua sees her Tongan rather than a general indigenous identity as central to her practise. One strand of her research explores ideas of indigenous leadership and how they might be applied within education. This includes how the Tongan concept of faka‚Äôapa‚Äôapa guides ideas of leadership in that country. This concept is based on four key principles: generosity, love, helpfulness, and humility. Another strand of her research in education centres on talanoa, a traditional oral communication method amongst Pacific Islanders.Prescott, S. M., & Johansson Fua, S. (July 2016). Enhancing Educational Success Through Talanoa : A Framework for the Pacific. A. Kautoke (Ed.), Vaka Pasifiki Education Conference (pp.1-27). As an educational researcher, Johansson-Fua has published on how schools and school relationships need to function within local cultural contexts. One application of this model was the Rethinking Pacific Education Initiative by Pacific Peoples for Pacific Peoples (RPEIPP), an academic and educational research project which Johansson-Fua convened. She has been vocal in addressing the absence of input from Pacific Islanders in international and comparative educational research. Johansson-Fua also oversees the Kuk≈´ Kaunaka Collection, an archive commissioned by King Tupou VI which contains doctoral and masters dissertations written by Tongan scholars at universities around the world. The United Nations Population Fund commissioned Johansson-Fua to produce a report on domestic violence in Tonga. In 2012, Johansson-Fua was a member of the team that assessed the potential for heritage tourism in Tonga.

It requires the wearing of a face covering when travelling on public transport such as trains, buses and aircraft in England. The regulations were later extended to include taxis and private hire vehicles.  Initial regulations = Legal basis  The regulations were introduced by way of a Statutory Instrument made by the Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, using emergency powers available to him under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. The regulations themselves state the legal basis for using such powers, namely \\"the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) in England\\"; he also certified that the restrictions \\"are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.\\" The regulations were made on 14 June, and were laid before parliament and simultaneously came into force the next day. The Secretary of State used section 45R of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 to enact the regulations without prior parliamentary consideration, subject to retrospective approval by resolution of each House of Parliament within twenty-eight days.  Geographical scope  The regulations cover England only (the rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland differ). They also extend to any aircraft while in English airspace that took off from or is to land in England, as well as any vessel in UK territorial waters adjacent to England, apart from vessels just passing through.  Requirement to wear a face covering when on public transport  Subject to a number of exceptions, nobody is allowed ‚Äì unless they have a \\"reasonable excuse\\" ‚Äì to use public transport without wearing a face covering. For this purpose, \\"public transport\\" does not include school transport, a taxi or private hire vehicle, nor a cruise ship. Any type of face covering is considered acceptable, provided that it covers the wearer's nose and mouth; the regulations do not require or mention a mask. The covering has to be worn both while boarding and while actually on board any public transport vehicle. Several groups of people are exempt from the requirement to wear a face covering, including children under the age of 11, public transport staff, police officers, and emergency responders while on duty, as well as travellers who have their own private cabin or berth. Face coverings are not required where travellers are transported and remain in a separate vehicle, for example a car ferry.  Reasonable excuse  The regulations provide a list of excuses for not wearing a covering which are considered to be \\"reasonable\\", while not excluding other possibilities. These are where the traveller is unable to wear a covering due to a disability, or where it would cause severe distress; to facilitate lip reading; where the covering is removed to avoid the risk of harm; where a traveller who is travelling to escape a risk of harm has no covering with them; where reasonably necessary to eat, drink or take medication; or where instructed to do so by an official.  Offences and enforcement  It is a criminal offence to contravene the regulations, and offenders may be prosecuted. Both police officers and public transport staff have the power to deny boarding to anyone not wearing a covering; and a traveller already on a vehicle can be directed to wear a covering or to disembark. Police and Transport for London officials (but not public transport staff) also have the power to remove from a vehicle anyone not complying with a direction, using force if necessary, and to issue a fixed penalty notice of ¬£100 (reduced to ¬£50 if paid within 14 days).  Review and expiry  The Secretary of State must review the regulations by no later than 15 December 2020. Unless revoked earlier, they automatically expire on 15 June 2021.  Changes to the regulations = New penalties, 28 August 2020  From 28 August 2020 new penalties were introduced by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Wearing of Face Coverings in a Relevant Place and on Public Transport) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/906). Repeat offenders face a sliding scale of penalties up to a maximum of ¬£3200 for the sixth and subsequent fixed penalty notice. Taxis and private hire vehicles, 23 September 2020 From 23 September, The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Wearing of Face Coverings in a Relevant Place and on Public Transport) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1021) redefined taxis and private hire vehicles as 'public transport', making it mandatory to wear a face covering when in such a vehicle.

She authored short stories and novels for children and adults. The Raven's Heart: A Story of a Quest, a Castle and Mary Queen of Scots (2011) won the Benjamin Franklin House annual literary prize and Golden Crown Literary Society awards for 2013. Blackadder was the second person and first woman to have been awarded two Australian Antarctic Arts Fellowships, in 2011 and 2018, about which she wrote a number of essays.  Personal life  Blackadder grew up on Sydney's north shore. She completed a Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the University of Technology in Sydney and a Master of Applied Science in Social Ecology and a Doctor of Creative Arts from Western Sydney University. When she was 12, her two-year-old sister Lucy drowned, a tragic incident about which Blackadder said, \\"I feel like it formed the rest of my life.\\" She lived in Byron Bay in NSW with her partner Andi for many years, where she died on 10 June 2020 from pancreatic cancer.  Career  Blackadder's first novel, After the Party (2005), appeared on the Australian Book Review's 2010 list of favourite Australian novels of the 21st century. Her second, novel, The Raven's Heart: A Story of a Quest, a Castle and Mary Queen of Scots (2011), is a work of historical fiction written partly because she decided to investigate the origins of the Blackadder surname, having been repeatedly asked if she was related to Rowan Atkinson (who created and starred in the BBC comedy series Blackadder). The Raven's Heart won the Benjamin Franklin House annual literary prize and Golden Crown Literary Society awards for 2013, and an Independent Publisher Book Awards Historical Fiction bronze medal. In 2011, Blackadder received an Australian Antarctic Arts Fellowship to visit Davis Station (on Ingrid Christensen Land in Antarctica) for six weeks. Using her research there, she explored the issue of using historical figures in fiction to obtain her Doctorate in Creative Arts, awarded in 2014, from Western Sydney University. From this came her historical novel, Chasing the Light (2013), about Ingrid Christensen, the first woman to see Antarctica, and the women who accompanied her. The trip also resulted in a children's book called Stay: The Last Dog in Antarctica (2013), featuring Stay, a fibreglass guide dog that kept Blackadder company during one her field trips. Having previously shelved a manuscript about her childhood experiences when her two-year-old sister drowned in her family's backyard swimming pool, she eventually wrote the novel Sixty Seconds (2017) to explore the grief and guilt felt by a family in similar circumstances, as well as the issue of personal responsibility and the possible criminal repercussions of such accidents. The book was published in the United States in 2019 under the title In the Blink of an Eye. In 2018, Blackadder again was a successful recipient of an Australian Antarctic Arts Fellowship, this time won jointly with screenwriter Jane Allen. The two writers visited Mawson Station from November 2018 to February 2019, during which time they prepared a draft of an Antarctic adventure novel for young readers and the structure for the first season of a television series about life on an Antarctic research station. These two works were still in development at the time of Blackadder's death. As a freelance journalist, Blackadder published many articles, including \\"The first woman and the last dog in Antarctica\\", which won the 2012 Guy Morrison Prize for Literary Journalism from the Australasian Association of Writing Programs. She also wrote extensively about agriculture and sustainability; deliberative democracy; and landcare and the environment.

He was a keen amateur sportsman, who played football for the Royal Engineers. helping them to victory in the 1875 FA Cup Final. Family and education Richard Ruck was born at Pennal, Merionethshire, Wales on 27 May 1851, the fourth child and second son of Laurence Ruck (c.1820‚Äì1896), a gentleman farmer, originally from Newington in Kent. Richard acquired his second Christian name from his mother, Mary Anne Mathews (1822‚Äì1905), whose family could claim descent from Owain Glynd≈µr, the last Welsh native Prince of Wales. Richard's siblings included: *Mary Elizabeth Ruck (1842‚Äì1920): married Robert Travers Atkin, a newspaper editor; their son, James, became an eminent judge and was ennobled as James Atkin, Baron Atkin. *Arthur Ashley Ruck (1847‚Äì1939): served with The King's (Liverpool Regiment), retiring in 1886 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was later the Chief Constable of Caenarvonshire. His daughter Amy Roberta (1878‚Äì1978) was a writer of romance novels. *Amy Richenda Ruck (1850‚Äì1876): married Francis Darwin, the botanist son of the naturalist Charles Darwin. She died shortly after the birth of her son, Bernard, the golf writer. *Oliver Edwal Ruck (1856‚Äì1934): also served with the Royal Engineers and played in the 1878 FA Cup Final. Ruck was educated privately, before joining the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Football and sporting career The Royal Engineers team of 1875. Ruck is on the left of the middle (seated) row. At the Royal Military Academy, Ruck gained a reputation as an athlete, playing both cricket and rugby football and being a keen gymnast. On joining the Royal Engineers in 1871, he switched to association football. At this time, the Royal Engineers were among the top football teams in England, having reached the final of the first FA Cup tournament in 1872 and again two years later, finishing on both occasions as runners-up. Ruck played on the right of the half-backs and was described as a \\"good half-back, being a sure kick... using his weight well\\". The Engineers reached the FA Cup Final for the third time in four years in 1875 but only after a hard semi-final against Oxford University, with a 1‚Äì1 draw followed by a 1‚Äì0 victory in the replay. In the final, played on 13 March 1875 at Kennington Oval, the Engineers met the Old Etonians. The match was played in a strong gale and the Engineers spent most of the match against the gale, with the rules requiring ends to be changed after each goal. Alexander Bonsor scored for the Old Boys after 30 minutes followed by an equaliser from Capt Renny-Tailyour within five minutes. Shortly after the equaliser, Ruck collided with Cuthbert Ottaway who was forced to leave the field with a serious ankle injury; in his absence, the Old Boys were regarded as fortunate to have held on for a 1‚Äì1 draw. The replay was three days later; although the Engineers were able to field the same eleven as in the first match, the Etonians had to make four changes, losing the match 2‚Äì0, with both the Engineers' goals scored by Capt Renny-Tailyour. At the third attempt, the Royal Engineers won their first, and only, FA Cup Final. Ruck also represented the Royal Engineers at billiards, cricket and golf. During his military posting to Malta from 1899 to 1902, he laid out a golf course and designed the clubhouse, before winning the inaugural tournament, despite this being open to officers from both the Army and the Royal Navy. In 1891, he was the founder and first secretary of the Welsh Golfing Union, becoming president in 1933, and was a member of golf clubs at Aberdovey and Woking. In December 1928, he was the author of a \\"valuable\\" article published in the Royal Engineers Journal entitled \\"R.E. Football in the Early 'Seventies\\". In the article, Ruck describes the Engineers' use of passing rather than running with the ball: > Individually, we were sometimes up against better players than ourselves, > but collectively we felt equal to any club. We were a veritable band of > brothers. Military career Ruck graduated from RMA Woolwich and joined the Royal Engineers as a lieutenant on 2 August 1871. After completing his initial training at the Royal School of Military Engineering in Chatham in November 1873, he was posted to Aldershot until September 1874, when he returned to Chatham to join the Submarine Mining Service, in which he was to serve for over 20 years. Over the next six years, Ruck was posted to various ports around the British Isles, including Pembroke and Cork, taking command of the 28th Company, Royal Engineers, until 1 March 1881, when he was appointed assistant instructor at the School of Military Engineering, in charge of the Submarine Mining School at Gillingham. He was promoted to captain on 2 August 1883. Between May and December 1885, Ruck worked in the War Office, before being appointed Assistant Inspector of Submarine Mining Defences in January 1886, with the temporary rank of major in the Army. He was promoted to the permanent rank of major on 17 December 1889, and to Inspector of Submarine Defences at Headquarters on 1 July 1891, replacing Colonel R. Y. Armstrong. On 31 December 1896, Ruck was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and left the War Office to become Commander, Royal Engineers (C.R.E.) at Shoeburyness, until July 1898, when he was placed on temporary half-pay on account of ill-health. On 1 January 1899, his health was restored and he briefly returned to the War Office, until 26 April 1899, when he took up his first and only overseas posting as C.R.E., West Sub- district, Malta. Having been promoted to brevet colonel on 17 June 1901, Ruck remained in Malta until 1 June 1902, when he returned to England to take up the post of Deputy Inspector-General of Fortifications, at Headquarters, under General Sir Richard Harrison. On 1 April 1904, he was promoted to Director of Fortifications and Works (the equivalent of the Chief Royal Engineer), with the substantive rank of Colonel in the Army, obtaining the temporary rank of brigadier general on 17 July 1905. After four years as Director of Fortifications and Works, on 1 April 1908 Ruck was appointed Major-General in charge of Administration, before retiring at his own request on 1 October 1912, having been appointed a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (C.B.) in the Coronation Honours of 23 June 1911. In his final role, he took charge of the military arrangements in London during the railway strike in August 1911. First World War service On the outbreak of the First World war, Ruck volunteered to re-join the Army, and on 22 October 1914 he was appointed Chief Engineer of the Central Force, with responsibility for organising Territorial units in London and eastern England, covering the coast from The Wash to Portsmouth, and for preparing the defences of London. In April 1915, the command of the Central Force was combined with that of the Eastern Command, and in November 1915, Ruck was appointed Major-General in Charge of Administration to the Eastern Command. On 6 June 1916, he was replaced by Major General Sir Frederick Robb, and retired for the second time. following which he was mentioned in dispatches. On 1 January 1917, he was appointed a companion of The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (C.M.G.). Aeronautics Ruck developed a keen interest in aeronautics and in 1905, he forecast that \\"in the early future the question of military supremacy would be decided by fighting in the air\\". In 1911, Ruck became a member of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and was the society's chairman from 1912 to 1919, after which he became a vice-president. In 1916, he was appointed vice-chairman of the Air Inventions Committee under the Air Ministry, and was also a member of the first Civil Aerial Transport Committee. For his services on the Air Inventions Committee, Ruck was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (K.B.E.) on 1 April 1920. Inventor Throughout his career, Ruck submitted numerous applications for patents to cover his inventions, including: * June 1885: A \\"counterbalancing float for marine torpedoes\\". *May 1890: Hook or shackle. * October 1906: Variable speed driving mechanism. *August 1927: Gear-changing apparatus. *March 1930: Gear-changing apparatus. Marriage and children On 8 October 1878, Ruck (aged 27) married 45-year old Mary Constance Pedley n√©e Gully, the widow of Thomas H. Pedley (1806‚Äì1871), at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, Marylebone. She was the daughter of the late John Gully (1783‚Äì1863), a prize-fighter and politician. By her marriage to Thomas Pedley, Mary had ten children, including William (1858‚Äì1920), who played first-class cricket for Sussex and was later an engineer in California, and Eve (1854‚Äì1951} who married Richard's younger brother, Oliver, in 1884. By 1903, Richard Ruck was in a relationship with a 21-year old Frenchwoman, Elizabeth Marie (Lisette) Ducros, with whom he had three children: Alice Bertha (1903‚Äì1991), Richard Edward (1905‚Äì1976) and Dorise Annette (1908‚Äì1997). In January 1905, Lisette Ducros was the subject of an attempted blackmail by Frederick Paxton, who threatened to expose her relationship with \\"a Mr.... in the War Office\\", with whom she had a child, and accused her of \\"keeping a disorderly house\\" at her lodgings in Clarendon Street, Pimlico. At his trial at the Central Criminal Court on 8 February, Paxton was found guilty of demanding money with menaces, and sentenced to 18 months hard labour. Ruck's wife, Mary, died on 13 October 1914, but earlier that year, Lisette had married student-teacher Frank Hoare (1894‚Äì1980), who would later become a film and TV producer. Richard Ruck adopted the three children shortly after the death of his wife. Alice married Revd. Geoffrey Warwick in a \\"society wedding\\" at St. Paul's Church, Regent's Park, London on 23 February 1927. Dorise married Edward Kench at All Saints' Church, Leamington Spa on 11 June 1930. Death and funeral Following the death of his friend, John Townshend, 6th Marquess Townshend in 1921, Ruck was a trustee of the Raynham estates in Norfolk, during the minority of the 7th Marquess, who inherited the title aged just 5. During the last few years of his life, Ruck lived with his daughter, Alice and her husband, Revd. Geoffrey Warwick at Woodford, Essex (where Geoffrey Warwick was Vicar of St Peter-in-the-Forest), although his home was at Charles Street in St James's, Westminster. Richard Ruck died, aged 83, on 17 March 1935 at a nursing home in St John's Wood, London. His funeral was at Golders Green Crematorium on 21 March 1935. Among the tributes paid to him, one officer said: > He had a very strong character and a quiet efficiency which was very > comforting to his subordinates.

His guilt was conclusively proven in four murders with the help of DNA profiling in 2012, 16 years after his death, as a result of which his total victim count remains unknown. According to the Denver Police Department, based on circumstancial and a number of testimonies, Groves could've been responsible for more than 20 murders.  Early years  Vincent Groves was born on April 19, 1954 in the family of a postman and a teacher, the eldest of three sons. The family lived in the western Denver suburb of Wheat Ridge, which was mainly inhabited by members of the upper middle class. Vincent's parents were law-abiding, average citizens who took good care of their children. Groves attended Wheat Ridge High School, which he graduated in 1972, the only black student from his class. One of his classmates was Dave Logan, who would later become a prominent professional football player and coach. With a tall and athletic physique, Vincent spent his highschool years as a member of the school's basketball team, achieving outstanding results on the court. In 1972, his team reached the final in the annual interscholastic basketball championship in the state, with Groves being recognized as the team's star player, thanks to which he was popular and had many friends and acquaintances. After school, he entered Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he played for the local basketball team. However, he quickly lost interest in studying and sports, and in 1974, due to his chronic absences, he dropped out of college and returned to Denver. He moved in with his grandmother and found a job as an electrician at the Gates Rubber Company. In his free time, Groves was fond of drinking alcohol and visiting the red- light districts, as a result of which, in the late 1970s, he spent a lot of time surrounded by pimps and prostitutes, and subsequently began leading a criminal lifestyle.  Criminal career  In late 1977, Groves met 17-year-old Jeanette Baca, whom he persuaded to engage in prostitution and became her pimp. On June 11, 1978, Baca's naked body was found in the woodland in Jefferson County. During the investigation, police interrogated Groves, but since there was no evidence of his guilt, he wasn't charged. A few months later, he met 21-year-old Norma Jean Halford, from San Jose, California, who became his cohabitant. On August 24, 1979, a soldier from the army discovered Halford's empty car parked on a mountain road outside of Georgetown. Halford, or her body, have not been located to this day. At the end of 1979, Groves became addicted to drugs. During this period, he met Janett Hill, whom he married in March 1981. Due to his addiction, Vincent began to exhibit volatile behavior, quitting his job at the Gates Rubber Company and finding employment as a janitor with irregular working hours, from which his relationship with Janett became strained. On August 14, 1981, Groves killed 17-year-old Tammy Sue Woodrum while out camping. On the advice from his wife, after committing the murder, Groves surrendered himself at the police station and gave a full confession. He insisted that the girl had died from an overdose, but the autopsy later established that Woodrum had been raped and strangled, and that there were no traces of drugs in her blood. Vincent was charged with second- degree murder, and in the summer of 1982, he was found guilty and received a 12-year sentence. During his imprisonment, he divorced his wife, finished college and went through several programs for rehabilitation of sex offenders. On February 13, 1987, he was paroled and released from prison. Groves returned to Denver to live with his parents. With the support of his father, Vincent bought a blue AMC Concord and found a job as a janitor, working both at one of the local churches and at a department store. In his spare time, he visited one of the main streets on Colfax Avenue, where prostitution and drug trafficking were beginning to flourish due to social and economic upheavals, with the highest crime rates at the time being recorded. In March 1987, he met 20-year-old prostitute Sheila Washington on Colfax Avenue. Having paid for her services, Groves drove her to a motel, where, after sharing drugs together, he beat and attempted to strangle her. Motel residents overheard noises coming from the room, after which Groves fled the scene. Washington survived the ordeal and managed to describe her assailant and his car, but couldn't give a name, thanks to which Groves avoided detection. In August 1988, Washington identified his car and reported it to the police. At the same time, Groves became a suspect in the murders of more than 20 Denver girls, all of whom had been strangled. The investigators found that Groves was familiar with the victims and was a known drug dealer among the pimps and prostitutes on Colfax Avenue, even being the last person seen with the victims in some cases. Based on circumstancial evidence and testimonies, Vincent Groves was arrested on September 1, 1988 and interrogated. During said interrogation, he categorically denied any involvement and insisted on his innocence. A blood sample was taken from him, and his parents, ex-wife and a number of acquaintances interrogated. His car and apartments were searched, but no incriminating evidence was found against him, as a result of which he was ultimately charged only with assaulting Sheila Washington. In a lawsuit that opened in early 1989, Groves claimed that he was acting in self-defense, after Washington stole $1,600 and tried to attack him, which was supported by the fact that she had been convicted of cocaine possession at the time. Since he was able to prove that she was a drug addict prone to committing such offenses, in February of that year, Groves was acquitted. However, he did not go free, because by that time, according to results from a DNA profiling test, Groves was linked to the murders of 19-year-old Juanita Lovato, whose naked body was found in April 1988 in a rural area east of Denver, and 25-year-old Diane Mancera, whose body was found in neighboring Adams County, near the I-25 west of Denver.  Trial  Vincent Groves was convicted of Lovato's killing in 1990, receiving life imprisonment. A month later, he was extradited to Adams County, where he charged with murdering Diane Mancera. At the end of 1990, he was additionally convicted of her death and received 20 years imprisonment. At the trial, prosecutors provided evidence of his involvement in eight other murders in the Denver area, using testimonies and other evidence that placed Vincent as the last person seen with the victims before they were found dead or disappeared. However, no new charges were brought against him.  Death  In the early 1990s, Vincent Groves began to have health problems. He was diagnosed with Hepatitis C and liver failure, the complications from he died on October 31, 1996, in a prison hospital near Denver. Shortly before his death, Groves was asked to confess to other murders, but he refused.  Aftermath  In 2012, on the basis of DNA analysis, Groves' guilt was established in the murder of 25-year-old Emma Jenefort, whose body was discovered in Denver in March 1978; 23-year-old Joyce Ramey, who was killed in July 1979; 20-year-old Peggy Cuff, whose body was discovered in November 1979 in Denver, and 35-year-old Pamela Montgomery, who was strangled in August 1988. In 1989, during the trial, Groves was named as a suspect in Montgomery's killing, as during the investigation, a witness was found who identified Vincent as the driver of the car in which the girl got in on the day of her disappearance, after which she was found dead.

It was first published in 2009 and was awarded Best Novel of The Year in 2011 by the Universal Society for Peace and Research (Aurangabad). The book was an immediate success in the Urdu speaking world. Plot and Motif The novel is a heart-touching and melancholic love story between a 15-year-old boy-Abdul Aziz and a married woman-Sakina. The story is set in a remote village of Kokan i.e., on the western coastline of India, a village not yet connected with the modern world and immersed in the magic of its own culture and dialect. The book mesmerizes readers by all seasons of the western coastal region, one can strongly smell the torrential rainfall, rice paddies, Alphonso mango orchards, rivulets in deep forests, snakes with golden skin, Garcinia indica, (Kokum trees) and its soar taste, superstitions, Jinn and birds forecasting luck along with the stories of people who have never seen other places or countries. An Illicit Love Story is considered one of the most passionate and imaginative love stories written by any Urdu writer in the last two decades in Urdu fiction. The novel begins with the wedding rituals where the protagonists Abdul Aziz and Sakina accidentally indulge in a sexual encounter that thrived into a lifelong romantic relationship. Sakina begets a son (Yusuf) out of this illicit relationship who was destined to become a religious scholar and preacher who later advocates the puritan religious ways. However, Abdul Aziz grows into a mature person having faith in the composite culture and liberal values. He challenged dogmatic thinking and fundamentalism but as a consequence of countering with the religious dictum, the disciples of Yusuf killed Aziz. The story creates doubts in the hearts of readers that Yusuf might have killed Abdul Aziz because he realized that his mother had an extra-marital affair with Aziz and that wounded Yusuf more than the free-thinking of Aziz. Reception The novel is considered one of the most imaginative love stories written by any Urdu writer in the last two decades in Urdu fiction. The former President of the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, Gopi Chand Narang has said during a seminar titled Urdu Novel on the threshold of 21st Century that in this novel the author has woven two love stories artistically, the intersexuality is rich with several layers. Eminent critic Waris Alvi has said that in this novel Rahman has smartly used humor. On the other hand, fiction writer Sajid Rashid said that undoubtedly it is a major love story, beautifully written, it also poses serious questions about the time we are living in. The book has been discussed in various literary magazines in both India and Pakistan.

It describes the internal relationship between the intensity and phase distribution of a wave. The TIE was first proposed in 1983 by Michael Reed Teague. Teague suggested to use the law of conservation of energy to write a differential equation for the transport of energy by an optical field. This equation, he stated, could be used as an approach to phase recovery. Teague approximated the amplitude of the wave propagating nominally in the z-direction by a parabolic equation and then expressed it in terms of irradiance and phase: :\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}I(x,y,z)= - abla_{x,y} \\\\cdot [I(x,y,z) abla_{x,y}\\\\Phi], where \\\\lambda is the wavelength, I(x,y,z) is the irradiance at point (x,y,z), and \\\\Phi is the phase of the wave. If the intensity distribution of the wave and its spatial derivative can be measured experimentally, the equation becomes a linear equation that can be solved to obtain the phase distribution \\\\Phi. For a phase sample with a constant intensity, the TIE simplifies to :\\\\frac{d}{dz}I(z) = -\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2\\\\pi} I(z) abla_{x,y}^2 \\\\Phi. It allows measuring the phase distribution of the sample by acquiring a defocused image, i.e. I(x,y,z + \\\\Delta z). The TIE utilizes only object field intensity measurements at multiple axially displaced planes, without any manipulation of the object and reference beams. TIE-based approaches are applied in biomedical and technical applications, such as quantitative monitoring of cell growth in culture, investigation of cellular dynamics and characterization of optical elements. The TIE method is also applied for phase retrieval in transmission electron microscopy.

The series stars Rebeka Nirmali as the titular role alongside Kamal Addararachchi, Sriyantha Mendis, and Edward Gunawardhana. Plot In 1990, Deemantha is a young dance teacher. One day, Deemantha is diagnosed with lung cancer while practicing a dance. Deemantha's mother, Maya, and adopted uncle, Dharmapriya are shocked after hearing this. He thinks that his father died from the same type of cancer. However, Dharmapriya then informs him that his father's death was not due to cancer and decides to tell him the story of his father's life. The story flashes back to 1958 when Gunendra and Dharmapriya were best friends. Gunendra is a rich businessman who is also able to play music. One day, he is diagnosed with lung cancer while he is playing the saxophone. His doctor informs that Gunendra's life expectancy is a mere three months. Meanwhile, Dharmapriya learns about an Ayurvedic doctor who offers to cure cancer of an advertisement. The advertisement tells him the man is named Appuhami and can be found in Thalakiriyagama village. He travels to the doctor who then cures him and advises him to stay away from alcohol. But, after returning, Gunendra forgets the Ayurvedic doctor's advice and continues to drink alcohol, to the dismay of his wife, Maya, and friend Dharmapriya. As a result of this, Gunendra is diagnosed with lung cancer again after 2 years. Gunendra returns to Thalakiriyagama and learns that the doctor had died before 6 months. He is shocked and tries to return but the doctor's daughter Mangali manages to cure him. Gunendra realizes that he has fallen in love with Mangali and marries her. After some time, Gunendra returns to his home and lives with Maya who is pregnant with Gunendra's child. One day, Appuhami visits Dharmapriya's office and informs that Mangali is also pregnant with Gunendra's child. Dharmapriya gets angry and informs Gunendra. He is shocked and visits Mangali's home. Mangali advises him to keep his marriage with Maya. After so much pressure, Gunendra goes to the beach and commits suicide. Then, Dharmapriya takes Maya's responsibility. After that, both Maya and Mangali give birth to boys. Maya names her child Deemantha. The day after hearing the story, a shocked Deemantha visits Thalakiriyagama with his mother and uncle. Mangali is now old and lives with her son. She sees Dharmapriya, Maya, and Deemantha and is amazed. Finally, she tells her son that his relatives have come.

Described by the author as \\"a sardonic take on agitprop fiction exploring themes of political corruption, justice, destiny and timeless love, with a bit of metaphysics thrown in for good measure\\", it is based on The Executioner's Daughter, an unproduced screenplay Trenchard-Smith began developing in 2003. PlotDevelopment and publication=Development In 2003, while staying on campus at UCLA - where his wife Margaret was completing a doctorate in Byzantine history - Trenchard-Smith devised the premise of Alice Through the Multiverse on the basis of a dream he experienced, in which a medieval young woman fleeing from an execution found herself in a 21st century psychiatric hospital. He continued to develop the story and characters between his daily swimming sessions at a campus pool, \\"scribbl[ing] bullet points on [his] hand as soon as [he] reached the locker room\\". After initially polishing these ideas through two novel chapters, he rewrote the project as a screenplay, titled The Executioner's Daughter. The Executioner's Daughter was optioned twice for \\"good money\\", but could not enter production because Trenchard-Smith and the financiers were unable to find an established actress who could play the leading role of Alice and her 21st century counterpart, Jane, and thus gain the financial backing of a major studio. Reportedly, Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley were among those considered and contacted via their agents, but Trenchard-Smith believes that neither actress read the script, noting \\"To be fair, it may have seemed too wacky a premise for a new young star\\". To attract further attention to the project, as Trenchard-Smith's reputation had not yet been bolstered by the documentary Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation! (2008), Christian Alvart signed on as director, and a further eleven drafts of the script were written to please a variety of distributors, but eventually the option expired, and the rights to the work reverted to the author by 2008. Trenchard-Smith decided to rewrite The Executioner's Daughter as a novel, and sent drafts to various publishers, none of whom expressed interest. In 2015, he decided to self-publish the novel, and rewrote it again to build on the characterization and the story's political themes. To avoid confusion with a novel of the same name by Jane Hardstaff, he changed the book's title to The Headsman's Daughter. Despite attracting positive reviews from readers, the author felt that the book's cover art and title did not garner the attention of the young adult audience he was hoping to attract the story with, and that the ending was not satisfactory. Deciding to republish the story under the title Alice Through the Multiverse, he added an additional three chapters to the book, including a new ending which he devised with Margaret's help. Acknowledging that Alice Through the Multiverse does not fit into a singular genre, Trenchard-Smith has said of the project's development: > I have called it a genre mash-up/movie homage in novel form, as if Game of > Thrones met The Bourne Identity on Freaky Friday. I realize fiction in > today's market is very niche-reader specific, particularly in self- > publishing, and I am swimming against the tide by combining genres. But I > could not keep Alice locked up in my head. She had to come out, so I hope > people love her as I do. I would love to see it become a movie or TV > franchise. Alice has more adventures in her. Publication The first edition of Alice Through the Multiverse, as The Headsman's Daughter, was published on June 16, 2016. To accompany its release, a trailer was created by BFX Imageworks, which had provided visual effects on four of Trenchard-Smith's previous films, featuring music by Penka Kouneva. The second edition was published on January 29, 2018. Reception Writer Richard Christian Matheson, with whom Trenchard-Smith had worked with on the television series Chemistry, expressed his view that Alice Through the Multiverse \\"cliff-hangs madly with wild twists, wicked wit and red-blooded passion. The action is knock-out filmic and Trenchard-Smith has dazzling talent to burn\\".

They hook their little cart to the back of it, step in and drive along until they reach the Place Royale () with the statue of Godfrey of Bouillon in its center and the Palais de Justice () in the background. From there they walk on to visit the Grand Place and watch the Manneken Pis being dressed. The children continue their expedition on a tram which passes by the Brussels Stock Exchange, De Brouck√®re Square and the Gare du Nord (). A new tram ride take the children to the outskirts of Brussels where they see a milkmaid delivering milk with her dogcart. They wait until the dogcart is left unattended, remove the milk cans, climb aboard and happily set off for a ride. Analysis right The surviving version of this film that is publicly available is in the English language which seems to indicate that the film has been distributed outside of France and Belgium, maybe as an early precursor of touristic advertisement. The film includes 28 shots composing 10 scenes introduced by intertitles. Continuity editing links the various shots and scenes albeit with some imperfections, both in the edition of the shots (characters or camera movements not consistent from one shot to the next), and of the scenes (order of the scenes not corresponding to geographic reality). This does not prevent the film from giving a convincing impression of an entertaining trip through the city enlivened by the antics of the children.Gabrielle Claes, Livio Belloi, Toto et sa soeur en bombe √† Bruxelles in Les Cahiers du Muet, Cin√©math√®que Royale de Belgique, Mus√©e du cin√©ma, 1995, pp. 4-5.

Background In 2014 a tender package was issued by the CEB for a major upgrade of an existing diesel power station at St. Louis, on the outskirts of capital city Port Louis. Burmeister & Wain Scandinavian Contractor (BWSC) of Denmark was awarded the contract by the Mauritian power-generating entity Central Electricity Board (CEB). In 2018 a whistleblower alerted the financier African Development Bank (ADB) that the award to BWSC occurred after bribes had been received by several CEB employees through an intermediary of BWSC who owns a Mauritian construction company. ADB investigated the claims and thus excluded BWSC from all future work for 21 months. Revelations In early June 2020 Leader of Opposition Arvin Boolell raised this issue in the Parliament. Shortly after the entire Management Team of CEB was stood down on 14 June 2020 by the Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth who appointed a new Board of Management. As more details surrounding the St Louis Gate scandal became public the Opposition highlighted the need for a detailed enquiry and also requested the dismissal or resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister involved. Observers also questioned the basis for the significant capital expenditures, given the remote risk of a power black-out on the island. In July 2020 the contracting firm PAD & Company Limited (PAD & Co. Ltd.) was placed under voluntary administration and firm BDO was appointed as administrator after facing liquidity problems following revelations of fake bank guarantees for civil works contract of the order of Rs 210 Millions, as well as earlier revelations of the firm's involvement in the BWSC-CEB-ADB St Louis gate scandal.Shamshir Mukoon former director of CEB and Alain Hao Thyn Voon, former director of contracting firm PAD CO have also been interrogated by ICAC investigators.

Bertrand Lagesse has been the consulting engineer for Burmeister & Wain Scandinavian Contractor (BWSC) which is the principal contractor of the CEB in this scandal. He is suspected of having acquired a property worth 212,948 Euros (Rs 10 Millions) as well as for holding Rs 8.17 Millions in a bank account using proceeds of corruption.

Allenger) is an American author, and former military officer, known for his novels Polyxena and Ahuitzotl. Early life and education Herbert Aldinger was born in Turin, Poland, of a German father and Austrian mother. The family immigrated to the U.S. in 1951. He spent his early childhood in Glendive, Montana. He left his school halfway through his 8th grade and moved to Livington. He then attended Park County High School but had to move to Spokane, Washington and enrolled at North Central High School where he graduated in 1962. He received his higher education from Eastern Washington State College, graduating with BA in Political Science in 1966. Both in 1962 and 1966, he had a draft board looming over him, so he decided to voluntarily join the college's ROTC program. Alternative link, transcribed to HTML Career=Military Aldinger entered the US ARMY in 1966 and was assigned to the Transportation Corps Officer Training School at Fort Eustis, Virginia for three months where he got his first tour of duty assignment to Okinawa from 1966 to 1968. From there he spent a year in Vietnam (from October 1968 to October 1969), first as Operations Officer for the 57th Transportation Battalion in Quang Tri, and then as commander of Task Force 57-2 in Duc Pho (LZ Bronco), a forward logistical activity in direct support of the 11th Infantry Brigade. He extended his military service and requested an inter-theatre transfer to Germany, mainly to make contact with relatives he had there, which eventually did, but by way of Fort Bliss, Texas. He was then assigned as the Battalion Motor Officer for the 2nd Battalion, 60th Air Defense Artillery, a newly activated unit that was implemented to provide defense against low-flying enemy aircraft for primary military installations. The new weapons were the Chaparral missile/Vulcan gun systems. After nine months at Fort Bliss, the battalion was moved to Germany where, by a stroke of good fortune, the unit was headquartered at Ramstein Air Base in the Rhineland. It was considered good fortune because the Air Force had the best facilities in Germany and Allenger s best friends were also Air Force Officers. Allenger received a Master‚Äôs Degree in International Relations in 1972 from the University of Arkansas which offered an overseas extension course in that field by attending night school while at Ramstein.The intercept: The Author H. Allenger was once posted at Ramstein Air Base, The Intercept, April 17, 2015, retrieved February 4, 2017 From June 1970 to October 1973, Aldinger was posted in Germany and visited many places in Europe in his times off duty, which gave him the traveling bug that lead to his present day career. He joined the Ramstein Ski Club and skied in some of the most notable places in Europe. His military service ended after seven years in 1973 when the US ARMY reduced its Reserve Officer corps after the Vietnam War neared its close. Aldinger received a Bronze Star for this service in Vietnam and then an Army Commendation Medal for his service in Germany.The intercept: The Author H. Allenger was once posted at Ramstein Air Base, The Intercept, April 17, 2015, retrieved February 4, 2017 Civilian life After floundering for over a year, he got a job as Transportation Coordinator for the Seattle School District in February, 1975, and remained at that job for the next 31 years. He headed the Transportation Office‚Äôs budget and fuel accounts and became sort of a jack-of-all-trades within the department, but primarily he managed the Secondary School Transportation program (Middle/High Schools) guiding it through the District‚Äôs desegregation years. The office transitioned from a manual operation to a highly computerized system in the time Aldinger was there, keeping him mentally stimulated and energized so that the job rarely was boring. He retired from the District in 2006.The intercept: The Author H. Allenger was once posted at Ramstein Air Base, The Intercept, April 17, 2015, retrieved February 4, 2017 Author H. Allenger had a life-long interest in Native- American civilizations and began satisfying this curiosity in the years that he worked for the School District by taking trips to Mexico and Central America with his frequent traveling partner, Judy Zier. He had a wide range of interests that included history, Greek and Norse mythology, and traveling. In 1990, he went on a trip titled ‚ÄòThe Capitals of Anatolia‚Äô where, among other places, he saw the ruins of Hissarlik, or Troy, in Turkey with no inkling at the time that he would eventually write a novel about it. Instead he began to write his Aztec novel ‚ÄòAhuitzotl‚Äô, after one of his frequent trips to Mexico. He had it written out on a typewriter when the District began its desegregation busing program in 1980. Managing this program became very labor intensive and demanded a lot of overtime work so the novel languished in the closet for over twenty years. It was after he retired in 2006 that, not knowing what to do with himself, he proceeded on the novel ‚ÄôPolyxena‚Äô. The inspiration for the book came from watching Wolfgang Peterson‚Äôs movie ‚ÄòTroy‚Äô. He was actually in Mycenae, Greece, in 2004, on a trip with Archaeological Tours when ‚ÄòTroy‚Äô made its debut in Europe. He was attracted to the name Polyxena that made him want to write a story about her. Writing ‚ÄòPolyxena‚Äô greatly helped Allenger ease into retirement. He remained gung-ho on it throughout, waking up in the mornings eagerly wanting to get to it, and never suffered any writer‚Äôs block while doing it, completing it in six months. Then he ran into difficulties trying to find a publisher for it, and after three years, he decided to go the self-publishing route. After that, he scanned the type-written pages of his Aztec novel into a computer and proceeded to finalize it, so in a curious twist of fate, his first novel wound up being his second published novel. Oddly enough, he began it for the same reason he wrote ‚ÄòPolyxena‚Äô; he was attracted to the name Pelaxilla (one of the principle characters of ‚ÄòAhuitzotl‚Äô). In addition to the novels, ‚ÄòPolyxena‚Äô and ‚ÄòAhuitzotl‚Äô, he wanted to try his luck at a non-fiction work and completed ‚ÄòThe Pleasures of Green Lake‚Äô, a photographic journal of his daily walks around Seattle‚Äôs Green Lake covering an eighteen month period. Allenger presently has two other works in progress: ‚ÄòAssortments‚Äô, a collection of short stories on strange dreams he has had, and ‚ÄòThe Mayas: A Private Passion‚Äô, a personalized view of his visits to several Mayan archaeological sites..

S53P4 is osteoconductive and also osteoproductive in the promotion, migration, replication and differentiation of osteogenic cells and their matrix production. In other words, it facilitates bone formation and regeneration (osteostimulation). S53P4 has been proven to also naturally inhibit the bacterial growth of up to 50 clinically relevant bacteria strains.  History  The S53P4 bioactive glass has its roots in the bioglass 45S5 developed by Larry Hench in the late 1960s in New York. A couple of decades later, in the 1980s, the compound S53P4 bioactive glass was developed in Turku, Finland. S53P4 was found to be osteostimulative (non-osteoinductive), but it also had one new additional property: the composition of 53% silica and smaller weights of sodium, calcium and phosphorus gave rise to surface reactions in vitro that appeared to inhibit bacterial growth ‚Äì a material that could not be infected by bacteria was discovered.  Applications  Areas of use include a wide range of indications that require the filling of bone cavities, voids and gaps as well as the reconstruction or regeneration of bone defects. Several long-term studies have shown that mastoid cavities in both Cholesteatoma, old radical cavities and Chronic otitis media can be successfully obliterated with S53P4 bioactive glass. Clinical experience has been gained from several extensive studies where patients with bone infections have been treated. S53P4 has shown promising results in chronic osteomyelitis surgery, septic non-union surgery, segmental defect reconstructions and other infectious complications, such as sternum infections, diabetic foot osteomyelitis and spine infections. S53P4 has gained clinical experience within spine surgery in spine fusions and spinal deformity surgery. S53P4 has also been used successfully in the filling of benign bone tumor cavities in both adults and children, sustaining the bone cavity volume long term. Clinical experience has been gained from aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC), simple bone cysts (UBC), enchondroma and nonossifying fibroma (NOF).  Mechanism of action  When S53P4 bioactive glass is implanted into a bone cavity, the glass is activated through a reaction with body fluids. During this activation period, the bioactive glass goes through a series of chemical reactions, creating the ideal conditions for bone to rebuild through osteoconduction. * Na, Si, Ca, and P ions are released. * A silica gel layer forms on the bioactive glass surface. * CaP crystallizes, forming a layer of hydroxyapatite on the surface of the bioactive glass. Once the hydroxyapatite layer is formed, the bioactive glass interacts with biological entities, i.e. blood proteins, growth factors and collagen. Following this interactive, osteoconductive and osteostimulative process, new bone grows onto and between the bioactive glass structures. * Bioactive glass bonds to bone ‚Äì facilitating new bone formation. * Osteostimulation begins by stimulating osteogenic cells to increase the remodeling rate of bone. * Radio- dense quality of bioactive glass allows for post-operative evaluation. In the final transformative phase, the process of bone regeneration and remodeling continues. Over time, the glass is fully remodeled into bone, restoring the patient‚Äôs natural anatomy. * Bone consolidation occurs. * S53P4 bioactive glass continues to remodel into bone over a period of years.  Inhibition of bacterial growth  The bacterial growth inhibiting properties of S53P4 derive from two simultaneous chemical and physical processes, occurring once the bioactive glass reacts with body fluids. Sodium (Na) is released from the surface of the bioactive glass and induces an increase in pH (alkaline environment), which is not favorable for the bacteria, thus inhibiting their growth. The released Na, Ca, Si and P ions give rise to an increase in osmotic pressure due to an elevation in salt concentration, i.e. an environment where bacteria cannot grow.

She proposed the condition Pathological demand avoidance in 1980.  Life  Newson was born in Highgate to Mary and Richard Palmer. She was the first of their four children. Her parents were committed socialists and they took in a Jewish girl who had been sent for safety from Germany. Later they gave a home to her parents as well. She married John Newson and in 1955 they had their first child who had very disruptive sleep patterns. Parenting manuals and academic articles, to which they had easy access, were of little use in explaining their child's behaviour so they set out to investigate this themselves. Using their own funds they arranged interviews with 700 families. Health workers helped but Elizabeth conducted 200 interviews herself and her husband spent many hours creating punch cards in the computer centre at Nottingham University to enable the data to be processed. The interviews were conducted without judgement and they recorded what the parents wanted to say. The Child Development Research Unit opened in 1958 at Nottingham University with Newson and her husband as joint directors. In 1965 their studies led to \\"Patterns of Infant Care in an Urban Community\\" being published by Penguin. In 1967 they founded the Child Development Research Unit at the University of Nottingham. Their work placed particular emphasis on toys and learning through play, as well as on the needs of children with conditions such as autism. In 1968 she and a group of parents formed \\"Autism East Midlands\\" to support assistance for families around Nottingham. In 1980 she proposed the term Pathological demand avoidance to describe people who do not want to co-operate with instructions even when this would be in their own interest. She had identified a group of children who had this characteristic and they would \\"avoid everyday demands and expectations to an extreme extent\\". The work of Elizabeth and John Newson emphasised that social class and cultural influences created a range of beliefs about childrearing. Their work did not fit into established academic categories: psychologists considered it too sociological and sociologists too psychological. In 1993 the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health made her an honorary fellow and the following year the In 1994 the Early Years Diagnostic Centre was renamed the Elizabeth Newson Centre. Five years later she was given an OBE for her work with children on the autism spectrum in the 1999 New Year Honours. Death and legacy Newson died in 2014.
