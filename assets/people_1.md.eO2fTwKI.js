It lasted about 90 minutes, with the most intense portion spanning 30–40 minutes. As of 16 April, more than 140 deaths have been reported. At least 91 people died in the Indian state of Bihar, 44 in West Bengal, and 4 in Assam. In Bangladesh, five deaths and two hundred injuries were reported. Most of the deaths were women and children crushed when their huts were destroyed. Over 91,000 dwellings were destroyed in India and several thousand in Bangladesh; approximately 300,000 dwellings were at least partially damaged. Both mud and pucca housing was damaged by the storm. Nearly 500,000 people were left homeless or otherwise affected by the storm. The storm According to local officials the storm was an extreme nor'wester commonly formed over the Bay of Bengal during the hot months of the year. Meteorologist S.I. Laskar said the storm was due to an unstable atmosphere caused by excessive heat and humidity. \\"It is quite normal in the pre-monsoon season,\\" he added. The severity of the storm was likely due to wind pulling the moisture from the Bay of Bengal northward to north Bihar, where it converged with another cloud formation to form a 20 km tall cloud mass. The cool air in the clouds was met by hot air rising from the ground, which caused the storm to start rotating. Although thunderstorms had been predicted, the severity of the storm was unexpected. Although not a tropical cyclone, the storm brought back memories of Cyclone Aila, which killed 155 people in the same area in May 2009. One eyewitness described the storm: \\"It was all dark. I thought it was the end of the world and we were going to die.\\" Locals received no warning of the impending storm, and were mostly sleeping when the storm hit, increasing the casualties. Out-dated equipment with limited capabilities was blamed for the lack of warnings. The storm spawned a large tornado, which lasted about 20 minutes. It was the first tornado recorded in Bihar history. Tornadoes are a very rare occurrence in India – the last one was in 1998. Radar equipment which could have provided early warning had arrived in the area, but had not yet been installed because the building to house it was still under construction. The storm occurred during a heat wave with temperatures greater than 40 °C (104 °F) reported. West Bengal regional weather office director Gokul Chandra Debnath said that the heatwave \\"could have been a catalyst ... that triggered the tornado\\". The amount of damage caused directly by the tornado is unknown. Damage The storm struck in northeastern parts of West Bengal and Bihar states, with winds estimated from 120–160 kilometres/hour (75–100 miles/hour), then moved into Bangladesh. The strong winds uprooted trees, displaced roof tops, and snapped telephone and electricity lines. The worst damage was reported in the towns of Hemtabad, Islampur, Kaliaganj, Karandighi, and Raiganj. Purina had the most reported casualties. Power was lost throughout the area, and communication was difficult due to severed phone lines and damaged rail lines. Nepal, which relies on India for part of its power generation, was also affected by the outages. In Araria district, a jail was partially destroyed causing the transfer of 600+ inmates to another facility. In Rangpur, a police officer was killed and five other injured when a wall of the Rangpur Police Line building collapsed. The police barracks in Raiganj, which houses 300 officers, were partially destroyed. Several other police buildings had their roofs blown away. The initial strong winds were followed by heavy rains, causing further damage to weakened structures. Widespread damage to crops and livestock was also reported in both West Bengal and Bihar, as well as in Bangladesh. More than 8,000 hectares of maize was destroyed in West Bengal. More than 4,000 hectares of maize and boro was destroyed in Bangladesh. In Assam, paddy crops, bananas, and other vegetation were damaged. Assam crops were already in poor shape due to earlier hail storms before 13 April storm, and were further damaged by another strong storm on 15 April. Aftermath and rescue efforts Rescue efforts have been inhibited as many roads, including National Highway 34, are blocked by downed trees and telephone poles. Medical personnel and supplies were quickly rushed to the affected areas, and aid packages were announced. Aid workers began to distribute rice, dried fruits, water, and temporary tarpaulin shelters on 15 April. However, many remote regions remained inaccessible as of 16 April. Aid workers said that hundreds of thousands of victims had not received any relief by 16 April. Another rainstorm on 15 April added to frustrations. On 16 April, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced an ex gratia payment Rs 100,000 to the next of kin to persons killed in the storm. The money will come from the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund. In the Lok Sabha, members have taken turns blaming each other's political parties for the delays. On 19 April, The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) asked for central assistance of Rs 10 billion for Bihar and Rs 5 billion for West Bengal. Prashanta Mazumdar additionally asked for government workers to assess the damage and distribute relief. Indian National Congress (INC) member Deepa Dasmunshi countered by saying the state administration had failed miserably. All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) leader Sudip Bandopadhyay agreed and added that the CPM was \\"more involved in state terrorism\\" against political opponents than distribution of aid. The CPM responded that West Bengal had done its best to provide relief. Dasmunshi strongly disagreed, claiming \\"not even one tarpaulin or piece of cloth has reached the victims. The state government has failed.\\" The CPM and other left parties accused Dasmunshi and Bandopadhyay of \\"playing politics at the cost of human lives\\". Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav demanded that the House have a more thorough discussion on the matter. In Bihar In Bihar, storm victims are being given rice, cash, and asbestos sheets to rebuild their houses. Families of the deceased are also receiving money to pay for last rites plus an ex gratia payment of Rs 150,000 from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. Phone service was restored to most of the region after 30 hours without service, However, areas near the Nepal-India border remained without power on 17 April. On 20 April, the Bihar Electricity Board said that it would be at least a month to repair all damaged electrical transmission towers. Rolling blackouts were conducted in Nepal to combat the decreased electricity availability. On 16 April, the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee called for the firing of Minister for Disaster Management Devesh Chandra Thakur, who was reportedly on vacation and had not visited the affected areas. On 22 April, the INC announced that it would distribute food and other relief to storm victims in the Purnia, Kishanganj, Katihar, Araria, and Supaul districts. In West Bengal In West Bengal, Civil Defense Minister Srikumar Mukherjee is personally overseeing rescue efforts. As of 15 April, all major roads and rail lines were cleared and power had been restored to 50% of the population. However, some of the hardest hit towns had not yet received any government aid by 16 April, causing widespread anger. Mukherjee admit state government was struggling to distribute food rations, blaming insufficient manpower for the delay. He has since asked district officials to purchase supplies locally. According to international aid agency ActionAid, only 7,000 tarpaulins had been distributed by 17 April; Mukherjee claimed 57,000 had been distributed. The state has announced cash relief of Rs 10,000 for the homeless and a Rs 200,000 payment for relatives of the deceased. A total of Rs 500,000 has been released to rebuild housing, and a metric ton of rice and 30,000 tarpaulin sheets have been released for direct aid. Storm victims angry about the slow rate of aid distribution quickly turned to demonstrations and violence. In Karandighi, hundreds of protesters squatted on the highway, closing it down for three hours on 15 April. Protests were also held in Raniganj. On 16 April, \\"Thousands of villagers staged angry protests in front of government offices [in Karandighi and Hemtabad] demanding more relief materials and assaulted officials when they came to open the offices,\\" according to West Bengal relief minister Mortaza Hossain. Riot police had to be dispatched to both Karandighi and Hematabad. In Hemtabad, angry villagers attacked the block development building and shut down the Raiganj-Balurghat state highway for 30 minutes. Raids on several rural offices were reported in the North Dinajpur district on 16 April. Accusations of corruption were made in Karandighi and Raiganj, with some storm victims claiming they received only part of their promised relief payments. In Karandighi, anger lead to looting and later violence. Shortly after 2pm IST on 15 April, a delivery of 500 tarpaulin sheets arrived. Villagers seeing that the supply would not be enough for everyone in need decided to take matters into their own hands. Some protesters jumped a wall, broke into the godown, and looted the tarpaulins. Police were called in, but were blocked from entering the facility by protesters. One looter remarked \\"What else could I have done? The government is not helping us so we have to help ourselves.\\" Just after noon on 16 April, an angry mob attacked Panchayat Pradhan Badal Singh and began to beat him. One of the perpetrators said he couldn't control his anger when he saw that Singh \\"was distributing the [tarpaulin] sheets only to his party supporters.\\" Throughout the North Dinajpur district, panchayat leaders have fled their homes after being attacked by angry villagers. On 19 April, protesters blocked National Highway 34 at Panisala in the Raiganj subdivision. Others surrounding the panchayat office demanding more relief. The police fired shots into the air to scare the crowd off the highway after it was shut down for about an hour. According to one report, the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) was responsible for organising the road block. Later that evening, at 5:30pm IST, 1,500 people who had been dispersed earlier attacked the police at Sitgram. Three sub- inspectors were badly beaten and two police vehicles pushed into a ditch before the crowd was dispersed with tear gas and shots fired into the air. District magistrate Ramanuj Chakrabarty claimed that \\"the distribution of relief has picked up\\" and that the attack \\"was politically motivated.\\" In Assam In Assam, food and building supplies have been distributed to storm victims. \\"We have taken all possible measures to provide relief and other financial assistance to people hit by the storm,\\" remarked Relief and Rehabilitation minister Bhumidhar Barman. An ex gratia payment of Rs 5,000 was announced for the next of kin of storm victims, plus Rs 300,000 to be released at a later date. In Bangladesh In Bangladesh, power was restored to most areas by 16 April, although parts of Rangpur remained without power. In Dinajpur, locals frustrated about the lack of power attacked the Dinajpur Power Development office on 15 April. Police had to be called in to take control of the situation.

The plant became a federally listed threatened of the United States in 1997.California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Profile This species is an annual herb growing 20 to 70 centimeters tall. It has a thin coating of woolly hairs. The leaves are up to 6 centimeters long and are generally divided into a few leaflets which are subdivided into lobed segments. The inflorescence is a solitary flower head lined with about eight phyllaries which are fused at the base, making the involucre a rounded cup with pointed lobes. There are about 8 golden ray florets. At the center of the head are yellow disc florets. The main threat to its remaining populations is destruction of its habitat for residential development. Other threats include grazing and agriculture and maintenance of flood control structures, transmission lines, and roads. The heavy presence of competitive exotic plants in the habitat, including charlock (Sinapis arvensis), stork's bill (Erodium cicutarium), and non-native bromes, is detrimental.

Apostol originally competed on Survivor: Tocantins in 2009, finishing in 8th place. He returned as a villain on Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains in 2010 and came in 15th place. In 2013, he returned again and was eventually crowned the winner of Survivor: Blood vs. Water. Apostol competed for a fourth time on the show's 40th season Survivor: Winners at War, finishing in 11th place. Apostol is a former professional cyclist and also appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 2 with his then-girlfriend, now-wife, Rachel Foulger. He is a frequent contributor on Rob Has a Podcast, created by fellow Survivor contestant Rob Cesternino. They co- host the weekly podcast, News AF, alongside Apostol's longtime friend, Danny Bryson. Early life Apostol was born in Provo, Utah, on June 17, 1979. He was raised in Lindon, Utah, and currently lives in Mesa, Arizona. He is a bike shop owner and has cycled professionally in Switzerland, Belgium, and Austria, most notably riding for the Austrian professional continental team, between 2005 and 2007. Apostol attended Brigham Young University where he earned a swimming scholarship, but did not graduate. He spent two years in the Philippines as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Survivor=Tocantins On the 18th season of Survivor, Apostol was placed on the Timbira tribe, initially sticking with the majority alliance and forming a particularly close bond with Benjamin \\"Coach\\" Wade, who dubbed Apostol his \\"assistant coach\\". Early on, Apostol wanted to blindside fellow contestant Erinn Lobdell; however, he eventually sided with the majority and voted out the ill Jerry Sims. At the merge, Apostol won the first individual immunity by outlasting former tribemate Debbie Beebe. He went on to win immunity again with nine contestants left as well. Wade and Apostol aligned with Stephen Fishbach, James \\"J.T.\\" Thomas, Jr., and Beebe, blindsiding Brendan Synnott with the cooperation of Lobdell and Tamara \\"Taj\\" Johnson- George. Sierra Reed became the target, but Thomas, Lobdell, and Fishbach joined the other group, deciding that Apostol was a bigger threat than Reed; Apostol was voted out and became the second juror. He eventually voted for Thomas to win the game. Jeff Probst stated that Apostol was one of his favorites of the season because he was maniacal and unpredictable. Heroes vs. Villains Apostol accepted an offer to participate again, in the show's 20th season, where he was assigned to the Villains tribe. His tribe dominated the initial immunity challenges. He formed an alliance with Jerri Manthey and fellow Tocantins participant Benjamin \\"Coach\\" Wade. Apostol appeared to be safe after joining the alliance of \\"Boston Rob\\" Mariano, Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Courtney Yates, along with Wade and Manthey. This group held a majority over the bloc of Russell Hantz, Parvati Shallow, and Danielle DiLorenzo. When both the Heroes and Villains tribes had to vote someone out consecutively, Mariano directed his alliance to split their votes due to Hantz's possession of a hidden immunity idol. The plan was to have him, Mariano and Diaz-Twine vote to eliminate Hantz and Yates, Manthey and Wade vote to eliminate Shallow. If Hantz gave Shallow the idol or if Hantz did not play the idol at all, on the revote, Hantz would be eliminated. If Hantz played the idol for himself, on the revote, Shallow would be eliminated 4-3-0. Hantz manipulated Apostol into disobeying Mariano's plan, and instead of forcing a tie, Apostol switched his vote to Shallow. After Hantz gave Shallow the hidden immunity idol and she played it, Apostol was eliminated by a vote of 3–2, with Hantz's idol negating four votes against Shallow. If Apostol voted along Mariano's plan, he and Hantz would have tied 3–3, and Hantz would have been eliminated on the revote. Thus Apostol was the sixth survivor and the second Villain to be voted out of the season. His switching votes has been called \\"one of the dumbest moves in Survivor history.\\" His vote switch caused huge ramifications on the game as Hantz and Shallow both would make it to the Final Tribal Council despite both losing to the more heroic, Diaz-Twine. Blood vs. Water Apostol returned for Survivors 27th season, Blood vs. Water. This time, he and his longtime girlfriend, Rachel Foulger, were both cast as contestants.'Survivor: Blood vs. Water': New cast and (lots of) twists revealed! Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved February 23, 2020 He was assigned to the Galang tribe, while she went to Tadhana. Foulger was the fourth person eliminated from the game after being the second contestant to be voted out in a Tribal Council. Later on, a tribe switch put Apostol on a tribe with fellow former Galang members Gervase Peterson and Aras Baskauskas, as well as former Tadhana members Hayden Moss, Ciera Eastin, and Caleb Bankston. Using the clues to the hidden immunity idol's location, given to him verbally by Moss and Bankston, Apostol found the first idol by himself and kept it a secret. He also formed an alliance with Peterson, Moss, Eastin, and Bankston. At the merge, this alliance joined with Monica Culpepper and Eastin's mother, Laura Morett, to take out Baskauskas and his brother, Vytas, as well as Tina Wesson. From here, Apostol began looking further past this alliance of seven, orchestrating Morett's return to Redemption Island and voting out Bankston, who was conspiring to blindside him. In this Tribal Council, Apostol used his idol, even though no votes were cast against him and Bankston still received the majority of votes. With the sudden revelation that he had had the idol all along, Apostol began facing rebellion within his alliance from Moss and Eastin, who continuously appealed to Culpepper to switch her vote and go with them to vote against Apostol and Peterson. However, Apostol maintained control of Peterson and Culpepper, and even found the idol a second time, utilizing the clue that Eastin was given. Apostol later won the final two immunity challenges, thus guaranteeing himself a spot in the final three. He then decided to vote out former Survivor winner Wesson, who had just returned from Redemption Island, recognizing she was his only remaining threat for jury votes. Thus he went to the finals alongside the less-liked Peterson and Culpepper, who were both widely viewed by the jury as riding Apostol's coattails, letting him make all the decisions, and doing little to play their own games, with Culpepper especially being criticized for failing to make a big blindside move against Apostol and Peterson despite numerous opportunities to do so. Culpepper was also razzed for her lack of social bonds with any of the other players outside of her alliance, and she broke down crying during Final Tribal Council. Though Apostol was responsible for most of the jury members' eliminations, his method of playing the game was praised, and he was voted the $1 million winner, receiving seven of the eight jury votes (with Culpepper receiving the dissenting vote, from Vytas Baskauskas). Winners at War Apostol once again came back for the show's 40th season, Winners at War.Meet the cast of Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved April 19, 2020Jeff Probst shares intel on Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved April 19, 2020 He was a member of the Dakal tribe. He was targeted by Yul Kwon early in the game for having close ties with other players outside the game, such as Rob Mariano and Kim Spradlin-Wolfe. After Dakal lost the fifth immunity challenge, Apostol became the fifth person voted off and went to the Edge of Extinction. He rejoined the game at the merge after winning the return challenge against the other Edge of Extinction contestants. However, Apostol was voted off again on day 25 and returned to the Edge of Extinction. He was defeated in the second return challenge by Natalie Anderson, for whom he later voted to win the season, though she would lose to Tyson's former Dakal tribemate Tony Vlachos, who would win the season and become the second-ever two-time winner in Survivor history. Personal life Apostol proposed to his girlfriend of six and a half years, Rachel Foulger, during the finale of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 2. The episode aired on March 13, 2015. On March 15, 2015, Apostol and Foulger confirmed that in the time since filming Marriage Boot Camp, they had gotten married. Apostol's Survivor: Tocantins co-star, Stephen Fishbach, performed the private ceremony on February 8, 2015 in Utah. Foulger and Apostol have two daughters, born in 2015 and 2018.

Background Kantorovich in 1948 proposed calculating the smallest eigenvalue \\\\lambda_1 of a symmetric matrix A by steepest descent using a direction r = Ax-\\\\lambda (x) x of a scaled gradient of a Rayleigh quotient \\\\lambda(x) = (x, Ax)/(x, x) in a scalar product (x, y) = x'y, with the step size computed by minimizing the Rayleigh quotient in the linear span of the vectors x and w, i.e. in a locally optimal manner. Samokish proposed applying a preconditioner T to the residual vector r to generate the preconditioned direction w = T r and derived asymptotic, as x approaches the eigenvector, convergence rate bounds. D'yakonov suggested spectrally equivalent preconditioning and derived non-asymptotic convergence rate bounds. Block locally optimal multi-step steepest descent for eigenvalue problems was described in. Local minimization of the Rayleigh quotient on the subspace spanned by the current approximation, the current residual and the previous approximation, as well as its block version, appeared in. The preconditioned version was analyzed in and. Main features * LOBPCG is matrix-free, i.e. does not require storing the coefficient matrix explicitly, but can accesses the matrix by evaluating matrix-vector products. * The costs per iteration and the memory use in LOBPCG are competitive with those of the Lanczos method, computing a single extreme eigenpair. * Linear convergence is theoretically guaranteed and practically observed, since local optimality implies that LOBPCG converges at least as fast as the gradient descent method. In numerical tests, LOBPCG typically shows no super-linear convergence. * LOBPCG blocking allows utilizing highly efficient matrix-matrix operations, e.g., BLAS 3. * LOBPCG can directly take advantage of preconditioning, in contrast to the Lanczos method. LOBPCG allows variable and non-symmetric as well as fixed and positive definite preconditioning. * LOBPCG allows warm starts and computes an approximation to the eigenvector on every iteration. It has no numerical stability issues similar to those of the Lanczos method. * LOBPCG is reasonably easy to implement, so many implementations have appeared. * LOBPCG general technology can also be viewed as a particular case of generalized block Davidson diagonalization methods with thick restart, or accelerated block gradient descent with plane-search. * Very large block sizes in LOBPCG become expensive to deal with due to orthogonalizations and the use of the Rayleigh-Ritz method on every iteration. Algorithm=Single-vector version The method performs an iterative maximization (or minimization) of the generalized Rayleigh quotient :\\\\rho(x) := \\\\rho(A,B; x) :=\\\\frac{x^T A x}{x^T B x}, which results in finding largest (or smallest) eigenpairs of A x= \\\\lambda B x. The direction of the steepest ascent, which is the gradient, of the generalized Rayleigh quotient is positively proportional to the vector :r := Ax - \\\\rho(x) Bx, called the eigenvector residual. If a preconditioner T is available, it is applied to the residual and gives the vector :w := Tr, called the preconditioned residual. Without preconditioning, we set T := I and so w := r. An iterative method :x^{i+1} := x^i + \\\\alpha^i T(Ax^i - \\\\rho(x^i) Bx^i), or, in short, :x^{i+1} := x^i + \\\\alpha^i w^i,\\\\, :w^i := Tr^i,\\\\, :r^i := Ax^i - \\\\rho(x^i) Bx^i, is known as preconditioned steepest ascent (or descent), where the scalar \\\\alpha^i is called the step size. The optimal step size can be determined by maximizing the Rayleigh quotient, i.e., :x^{i+1} := \\\\arg\\\\max_{y\\\\in span{x^i,w^i}} \\\\rho(y) (or \\\\arg\\\\min in case of minimizing), in which case the method is called locally optimal. To further accelerate the convergence of the locally optimal preconditioned steepest ascent (or descent), one can add one extra vector to the two-term recurrence relation to make it three-term: :x^{i+1} := \\\\arg\\\\max_{y\\\\in span{x^i,w^i,x^{i-1}}} \\\\rho(y) (use \\\\arg\\\\min in case of minimizing). The maximization/minimization of the Rayleigh quotient in a 3-dimensional subspace can be performed numerically by the Rayleigh–Ritz method. As the iterations converge, the vectors x^i and x^{i-1} become nearly linearly dependent, making the Rayleigh–Ritz method numerically unstable in the presence of round-off errors. It is possible to substitute the vector x^{i-1} with an explicitly computed difference p^i=x^{i-1}-x^i making the Rayleigh–Ritz method more stable; see. This is a single-vector version of the LOBPCG method—one of possible generalization of the preconditioned conjugate gradient linear solvers to the case of symmetric eigenvalue problems. Even in the trivial case T=I and B=I the resulting approximation with i>3 will be different from that obtained by the Lanczos algorithm, although both approximations will belong to the same Krylov subspace. Block version Iterating several approximate eigenvectors together in a block in a similar locally optimal fashion, gives the full block version of the LOBPCG. It allows robust computation of eigenvectors corresponding to nearly-multiple eigenvalues. Convergence theory and practice LOBPCG by construction is guaranteed to minimize the Rayleigh quotient not slower than the block steepest gradient descent, which has a comprehensive convergence theory. Every eigenvector is a stationary point of the Rayleigh quotient, where the gradient vanishes. Thus, the gradient descent may slow down in a vicinity of any eigenvector, however, it is guaranteed to either converge to the eigenvector with a linear convergence rate or, if this eigenvector is a saddle point, the iterative Rayleigh quotient is more likely to drop down below the corresponding eigenvalue and start converging linearly to the next eigenvalue below. The worst value of the linear linear convergence rate has been determined and depends on the relative gap between the eigenvalue and the rest of the matrix spectrum and the quality of the preconditioner, if present. For a general matrix, there is evidently no way to predict the eigenvectors and thus generate the initial approximations that always work well. The iterative solution by LOBPCG may be sensitive to the initial eigenvectors approximations, e.g., taking longer to converge slowing down as passing intermediate eigenpairs. Moreover, in theory, one cannot guarantee convergence necessarily to the smallest eigenpair, although the probability of the miss is zero. A good quality random Gaussian function with the zero mean is commonly the default in LOBPCG to generate the initial approximations. To fix the initial approximations, one can select a fixed seed for the random number generator. In contrast to the Lanczos method, LOBPCG rarely exhibits asymptotic superlinear convergence in practice. Partial Principal component analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) LOBPCG can be trivially adopted for computing several largest singular values and the corresponding singular vectors (partial SVD), e.g., for iterative computation of PCA, for a data matrix with zero mean, without explicitly computing the covariance matrix , i.e. in matrix-free fashion. The main calculation is evaluation of a function of the product of the covariance matrix and the block-vector that iteratively approximates the desired singular vectors. PCA needs the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, while LOBPCG is typically implemented to calculate the smallest ones. A simple work- around is to negate the function, substituting for and thus reversing the order of the eigenvalues, since LOBPCG does not care if the matrix of the eigenvalue problem is positive definite or not.LOBPCG at Mathworks LOBPCG for PCA and SVD is implemented in SciPy since revision 1.4.0 LOBPCG in SciPy General software implementations LOBPCG's inventor, Andrew Knyazev, published a reference implementation called Block Locally Optimal Preconditioned Eigenvalue Xolvers (BLOPEX)GitHub BLOPEX with interfaces to PETSc, hypre, and Parallel Hierarchical Adaptive MultiLevel method (PHAML)PHAML BLOPEX interface to LOBPCG.

Background and education The Ruffinyi family had moved to Dobsina (today Dobšiná, Slovakia) from Italy because Eugene's father accepted a position as a mining engineer in this city. The original name of his family was Ruffini. Jenő attended primary school in Dobsina, and high school in Késmárk (today Kežmarok, Slovakia). He then took up mining studies in Selmecbánya (today Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia), where he earned his degree in 1869. On his return to Dobsina, he became a mining overseer and metallurgical inspector. Exploration of the Ice Cave While touring Ducsa Hill near Dobsina with his friend, Lt. Gustav Lang, in 1869, Ruffinyi threw a stone into an opening in the rock that was known as Cold Hole () in local lore. From the multiple and delayed echos, the men got the impression that a substantial cave must extend beyond the entrance and decided to return for an exploration. On June 15, 1870, Ruffinyi was the first to enter the cave, sliding down on a hemp rope. Honors The elementary school in Dobšiná, Jenő Ruffinyi Elementary School (), is named after Ruffinyi.

He succeeded David Howarth, who stood down after one term as an MP. In the 2015 General Election he lost the seat to Daniel Zeichner of the Labour Party by 599 votes, and he subsequently failed to retake it in the 2017 General Election.  Early life and education  Huppert is the son of Australian-born geophysicist Herbert Huppert and psychologist Felicia Huppert. He was born in the United States, and moved to Cambridge when he was three months old. He had a Jewish upbringing, he and his parents attended Beth Shalom Reform Synagogue in Cambridge; however he has stated that he is an atheist. After attending The Perse School in the city, Huppert went on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, completing a Master of Science degree in 2000 followed by a PhD in Biological Chemistry in 2005 supervised by Shankar Balasubramanian on G-quadruplexes.  Career  After his PhD, Huppert was elected a Junior Research Fellow of Trinity College in 2004, and became a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge in 2009 (the College at which the previous Liberal Democrat MP for the city, David Howarth, was a member). He worked as a research scientist studying the structures of DNA as well as tutoring students. On returning to academic life in 2015, Huppert lectured on science and technology policy at the Cavendish Laboratory, and in 2016 was appointed as the founding director of a new centre, the Intellectual Forum, based at Jesus College.  Councillor  During his eight years serving as a County Councillor on Cambridgeshire County Council for Cambridge's East Chesterton area, Huppert helped open Brown's Field Community Centre, chaired the Cambridge Traffic Management Committee and served on the Regional Assembly. His interests in internationalism, the UN and human rights led him to a position on the National Council of Liberty, formerly the National Council for Civil Liberties, from 2009 to 2011.  Political career  Huppert unsuccessfully contested Huntingdon at the 2005 general election, before winning the Cambridge seat in the 2010 general election. Huppert has stated that he wanted to get involved in politics because he believes in \\"a free, fair and open society, where nobody should be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity.\\" In an interview with the BBC's Today programme shortly after his election as an MP, Huppert stated, regarding negotiations with the Conservative party on possible deals to form a coalition, that whilst he found it \\"very hard to see how a deal could leave out electoral reform [...] if we got all the rest of our manifesto I'd probably live with that\\". As an MP, Huppert proposed a bill to prevent the demolition or change of use of pubs or independent shops without planning permission under the Ten Minute Rule in 2012 but the proposals failed to make any further progress. In 2013–14 he was an active supporter of and signatory to the Fair Deal For Your Local campaign, which would be the coalition government's only defeat on a legislative vote. Huppert was involved in a number of All-party parliamentary groups, being joint chair of the Cycling Group, and a vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, the Refugees group, and the Local Government group. He also sat on the Home Affairs Select Committee. Huppert expressed disappointment at the lack of scientific understanding amongst MPs. Although he was described by Cambridge Liberal Democrats and The Independent newspaper as \\"the only scientist\\" in the House of Commons, in November 2012, Huppert acknowledged other scientists in the House of Commons saying: \\"Although it has been said that I am the only scientist in the House, that is sadly not true. I am one of two Members with a science PhD and I went on to do research, but there are other scientists in the House and it always a great pleasure to have them here.\\" In June 2013 he told the BBC that he complained of bullying in the Commons after being greeted by collective groans and shouts of \\"Oh no\\" when he rose to his feet in the house. When the Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader stepped down to take a ministerial post, Huppert was talked about as a possible contender for the post. As co-chair of the all party parliamentary cycling group, Huppert helped to produce the landmark report on the future of cycling in Britain, ‘Get Britain Cycling’, in 2013. Also in 2013, Huppert secured a debate on Education Funding in Cambridgeshire, which resulted in Cambridgeshire schools receiving an extra £23.2 million in government funding, £2.7 million more than originally expected. In 2014, he presented a bill to parliament to improve conditions for those in the private rented sector. Huppert also co-sponsored the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Bill, which enshrined in law a commitment by the UK to spend 0.7% of its gross national income (GNI) on aid every year.  Cycling  Huppert is a cycling safety campaigner and organised and spoke at a parliamentary debate on the subject, as well as passing a motion at the 2013 Liberal Democrat Conference on the subject. His support of the principle of \\"Proportionate liability\\" has led to debate in his Cambridge Constituency and nationally. Huppert was named one of the most influential people in UK cycling by magazine Bikebiz and was awarded road safety organisation Brake's Road Safety award in March 2013 for his campaign on 20 mph speed limits.  Local campaigns  Huppert criticised the decision of the competition commission to force Cineworld to sell the Cambridge Arts Picturehouse. He took up the issue in Parliament, claiming the competition commissions should be looking into other monopolies in Cambridge: \\"To be frank, I start to wonder what the value of the Competition Commission is. In Cambridge we have two big problems with monopoly – Stagecoach’s control of the buses, and Tesco’s control of the supermarkets.\\" and gained the support of the then leader of the house, Andrew Lansley, who represented the neighbouring constituency of South Cambridgeshire. In November 2014 he launched a campaign to persuade the County Council to invest more in Cambridge's pavements, highlighting the effect even minor damage has on disabled people. Huppert also campaigned for additional funding for Cambridge schools, which received less per student than anywhere else in the country.  Awards and honours  Huppert was nominated the most impressive new Liberal Democrat MP elected in the 2010 election by a party website. Huppert's performance has also been highlighted in a number of publications and he was named as the top backbencher in the Telegraph's list of \\"Most influential Lib Dems\\". Huppert was awarded the \\"Internet Hero of the year award\\" by the Internet Service Providers Association for his involvement in the campaign against the Draft Communications Data Bill, also known as the \\"Snooper's Charter\\". Huppert was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.

In July 1800, Kent, under Lieutenant Robert Baron Cooban, participated in the raid on Dunkirk that resulted in the cutting out of the French frigate Désirée. During the action on 8 July, Kent, together with the gun-brig and the hired armed cutter Ann, engaged some French gunboats and prevented them from intervening.

Corbo, and Jared Edwards. The film has been described by Robert Hope as \\"Angela Carter rewriting La Belle et la Bête as an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\" Plot Through a series of dreamlike images, a girl (Sarah Livingston Evans) and her three friends find themselves stranded in a dark and surrealistic forest by someone — or something (Edward Gusts) — who has obsessively loved, watched, and waited for the girl ever since childhood. Cast *Sarah Livingston Evans as The Girl *Jared Edwards as Her Boyfriend *Anna-Marie Wayne as His Sister *Nancy P. Corbo as Her Girlfriend *Edward Gusts as Spike Production The film was produced by String And A Can Productions, with Erik Rodgers and Devin DiGonno serving as the principal producers on the project.IMDb Filming Filming for Spike took place just off the Angeles Crest Highway, high in the mountains of the Angeles National Forest, entirely at night in the spring of 2007 (in locations that burned down two years later in the Station Fire). Treacherous terrain and temperatures dropping below 15 °F, well below freezing, made filming difficult, and delays were caused by rain, snow, and even hail. Robert Beaucage directed the film from a screenplay he was inspired to write by the stories of \\"Cupid and Psyche, Hades and Persephone... Beauty and the Beast, as well as horror classics such as Frankenstein and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\\". He chose to shoot on 16 mm film rather than a digital format, despite the production's tight schedule and low budget, in order to give the film a different \\"feel\\" from the typical contemporary indie movie, the overwhelming majority of which are shot digitally. Design Seeking a more natural look (rather than CGI) for the film's special effects, Beaucage chose veteran concept artist and sculptor Jordu Schell to create the unique design of Spike's title character, which Schell worked into his schedule even while concurrently shaping the design of the Na'vi with James Cameron for Avatar. Reception=Release Announced in Variety as \\"a horror fairy tale from U.S. director Robert Beaucage, whom [festival director Hannah] McGill had never heard of before he wowed her with an unsolicited DVD\\", Spike had its world premiere at the 62nd Edinburgh International Film Festival on 20 June 2008, the festival's first year in its new June slot after having, in previous years, taken place in autumn. The film subsequently played the North American film festival circuit at such festivals as the Berkshire International Film Festival and Shriekfest. Spike was released in North America on DVD in the summer of 2010 by Maverick Entertainment. Critical analysis When first released, Spike was referred to by The List as a film that \\"overturns genre conventions to explore the darker side of fairytale mythology\\", and the All Movie Guide called it a \\"dark fairy tale that's not for the faint of heart\\". Calum Waddell, a film critic for magazines such as Dreamwatch and Fangoria, called Spike \\"assured and stylish... a promising debut\\" and praised its \\"mix of David Lynch, The Brothers Grimm, and Shakespeare\\", while adding a reservation that the film \\"does not seem to know what it wants to be\\". Others were more positive, such as the North Adams Transcript which wrote about the film's \\"artful\\" exploration of \\"both the tenderness and madness of monsters, as well as the many faces of love—most importantly, the destructive ones\\" and Moviestar magazine which, in its coverage of the EIFF, referred to Spike as \\"an original take on the genre\\" and said that it \\"delivered both thrills and chills\\". Awards Spike was chosen as part of the Edinburgh International Film Festival's Best of the Fest in 2008 and won Best Fantasy Feature Film at Los Angeles's Shriekfest in 2009.

Food safety incidents in China have received increased international media scrutiny following the reform and opening of the country, and its joining the World Trade Organization. Urban areas have become more aware of food safety as their incomes rise. Food safety agencies in China have overlapping duties. The 2008 Chinese milk scandal and COVID-19 pandemic received the most attention among food safety incidents. Food safety incidents in 2003=Poisonous Jinhua ham In 2003, several small producers of Jinhua hams (from Jinhua, Zhejiang) operated out of season and produced hams during warmer months, treating their hams with pesticides to prevent spoilage and insect infestation. The hams were soaked in the pesticide dichlorvos, which is a volatile organophosphate insecticide used for fumigation. Food safety incidents in 2004=Counterfeit baby formula In April 2004, at least 13 babies in Fuyang, Anhui, and 50-60 more in rural areas of Anhui died of malnourishment from ingesting fake powdered milk. In addition, 100-200 other babies in the province suffered malnutrition but survived. Local officials in Fuyang arrested 47 people who were responsible for making and selling the fake formula and investigators discovered 45 types of substandard formula for sale in Fuyang markets. Over 141 factories were responsible for the production of the formula and Chinese officials seized 2,540 bags of fake formula by mid-April. The State Food and Drug Administration ordered an investigation in May, 2004. Within three days of ingesting the formula, the babies suffered from what Chinese doctors described as \\"big head disease,\\" since the babies' heads swelled while their bodies became thinner from malnourishment. The fake formulas were tested to have only 1-6% protein when the national requirement was 10% protein. The government promised to compensate families and help cover medical bills.

These sauces were manufactured in China using a chemical amino acid extraction process similar to artificially hydrolyzed soy sauces and then quietly exported to other countries. An investigative report that aired on Chinese television exposed the unsanitary and potentially contaminated sources of the hair: In response, the Chinese government banned production of soy sauces made from hair. Other carcinogens remain; see 3-MCPD. Food safety incidents in 2005=Sudan I red dye In 1996, China banned food manufacturers from using Sudan I red dye to color their products. China followed a number of other developed nations in banning the dye due to its links to cancer and other negative health effects. However, officials in the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, the State Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the State Food and Drug Administration discovered in 2005 that Sudan I was being used in food in many major Chinese cities. In Beijing, the Heinz Company added the red dye to chili sauce; in Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Fujian, the red dye was discovered in vegetables and noodles. Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) used the red dye in its 1,200 restaurants, and medicine in Shanghai also contained Sudan I. Before the year 2005, companies in China had been using Sudan I illegally, and government officials gave two reasons why the 1996 ban had not been adequately enforced. The first reason was that there were too many agencies overseeing food production, creating loopholes and inefficiency. The second reason was that the government agencies were not equipped or trained with the food testing equipment that could have detected the dye earlier. Officials announced that they would begin to reform the food safety system on national and local levels.Yan, Hu. \\"Red Dye a 'Food for Thought' for Chinese.\\" People's Daily. March 31, 2005.

Greenpeace explained that nearly 80% of vegetables in these grocery stores originated from mainland China.

Alleged carcinogen used in frying oil In March 2007, the Guangzhou Information Times accused Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) of adding oil filtering powder, magnesium trisilicate, to its frying oil. It reported that KFC restaurants in several cities in Shaanxi added this chemical so that the frying oil could be used repeatedly for up to ten days. KFC pointed out that the additive is considered safe by United States and international standards, but health officials in Xianyang, Yulin, and Xi'an, inspected their local KFCs and confiscated the frying powder. Officials in Guangzhou also began in investigation into the frying oils, and the cities requested that the Ministry of Health step in.\\"KFC food safety scares the public again.\\" China Daily. March 9, 2007. China Daily\\"KFC Responds To Health Department Warning In China.\\" China Franchiser. March 13, 2007. The Chinese government's actions in this case stand in stark contrast to the many confirmed cases of food contamination that were actually denied and covered up by Chinese government corruption. KFC stated that the oil filtering powder does not cause health problems and meets local and international standards, but local Chinese authorities claimed that reusing the powder decreased its nutritional value and that it was connected to cancer. Magnesium trisilicate is commonly used in medicines such as antacids, and is widely considered to be safe for human consumption with no known connections to cancer. Contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein used for export In May 2007, The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) confirmed that two domestic companies had exported melamine-contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the United States. In August 2007, AQSIQ introduced recall systems for unsafe food products and toys and on December 3, 2007, China ordered 69 categories of products to be bar-coded at factories amid efforts to improve product safety, in response to several recent incidents, including: \\"scares rang[ing] from ducks and hens that were fed cancer-causing Sudan Red dye to make their egg yolks red, to pet food made of melamine-tainted wheat protein that killed scores of dogs and cats in the United States.\\" See also 2007 pet food crisis. Sewage used in tofu manufacturing Close to a hundred manufacturers of stinky tofu in Guangdong were found to use a combination of sewage, slop, and iron(II) sulfate to accelerate production and improve appearance of their fermented product. The waste water produced by the tofu industries also has effects on the environment. Cardboard bun hoax=Food safety incidents in 2008=Tainted Chinese dumplings In January 2008, several Japanese people in the Hyōgo and Chiba prefectures fell ill after consuming Chinese-produced jiaozi (dumplings) tainted with the insecticide methamidophos. The dumplings had been produced by the Tianyang Food Plant in Hebei and sold by JT Foods and the Japanese Consumers' Co-operative Union. Kyodo News reported that about 500 people complained of symptoms such as nausea and stomach pain. On February 5, 2008, Hyōgo and Chiba prefectural police departments announced that they were treating these cases as attempted murder, establishing a joint investigation team. When Japanese police and other prefectural authorities inspected the recalled dumplings, they found pesticides other than methamidophos, including dichlorvos and parathion. The Japanese National Police Agency found these toxins in packages that were completely sealed, concluding that it would have been nearly impossible to insert such toxins into the packages from the outside. They provided the test results to the Ministry of Public Security of China (MPS). Investigations jointly held by both the Chinese and Japanese governments cleared the Chinese company of responsibility after finding no traces of any poison in the raw material used nor in the factory. Officials are now treating this incident as a deliberate poisoning, and an investigation is underway. On February 28, 2008, the MPS criminal investigation bureau announced that there was little chance that methamidophos had been put into the dumplings in China, and declared that the Japanese police had rejected the requirement by the MPS to check the scene, relative material evidences, and test reports, thus information on the evidence was not fully provided to the MPS. On the same day, Hiroto Yoshimura, the Commissioner-General of Japan's National Police Agency, argued against the Chinese authorities that the Japanese had already offered test results and photographic evidence and claimed that some part of China's assertion \\"cannot be overlooked\\". They asked Chinese authorities to offer evidence. On August 5, 2008, Japanese media revealed that some Chinese people who had eaten the recalled Chinese dumplings made by Tianyang Food had also become sick after the incident in Japan, in mid-June 2008; the cause was again found to have been methamidophos contamination. The Chinese government alerted the Japanese government to this fact just before the 34th G8 summit in July 2008. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that this incident has increased the suspicion of foods produced in China. Contaminated powdered ginger In July 2008, it was announced that the Whole Foods supermarket chain in the United States had been selling powdered ginger produced in China, which was labeled as organic food, but when tested was found to contain the banned pesticide Aldicarb.I-Team: Organic Food Contamination wjla.comI-Team Investigates: Pesticide-laced Organic Foods Follow Up wjla.comWhole Foods ginger recall The ginger had been mistakenly certified organic by Quality Assurance International, who relied on two Chinese certifiers because, under Chinese law, foreigners may not inspect Chinese farms. Contaminated baby formula In September 2008, a fresh outbreak of kidney disease occurred, due to baby formula contaminated by melamine. Melamine was deliberately added to fool quality testing intended to measure protein content, which was implemented after the 2004 incident where babies died of malnutrition due to baby formula being watered down too much. Six babies died and 54,000 were made sick by the melamine-tainted formula with 51,900 requiring hospitalization. The supplier of the milk, Sanlu Group, is a name brand and is a major player in the industry in China. The company is said to have known of the problem for months, but claims the contaminant came from milk suppliers.Raymond Li, Censorship hammer comes down over scandal, Page A5, South China Morning Post (16 September 2008)Kristine Kwok, Officials knew of tainted milk for a month, Page A4, South China Morning Post (17 September 2008) Contaminated egg products In October 2008 news emerged certain egg products produced by Hanwei Group were also contaminated with melamine.

Fake lamb meat Businesses in Qingdao, Shandong, have been caught marinating duck meat in goat or sheep urine to give the duck the smell and taste of lamb. The duck is then sold as lamb to customers. Formaldehyde-laced blood pudding Inspectors in Wuhan, Hubei, discovered that most of the pork blood pudding in Chinese markets contained little actual blood, but rather, was manufactured with formaldehyde, corn starch, industrial grade salt, artificial food colourings, and a variety of other additives.

Food safety incidents in 2012=Contaminated strawberries In October 2012, frozen Chinese strawberries contaminated with norovirus infected over 11,000 children in Germany. Food safety incidents in 2013=Pork meat scandal By March 2013, over 15,000 dead pigs had been found drifting down Huangpu River, caused by a crack-down on illicit pig-trade in Zhejiang. As reported by Shanghaiist, local pork dealers would buy up dead meat unfit for sale, process it in illegal workshops, and then re-introduce the products into the legal market. Lamb meat scandal In May 2013, the Ministry of Public Security released a press statement warning Shanghai consumers of lamb meat that inadvertently may have been, or contained, rat, fox or mink meat. According to some sources,Reuters, as mentioned in Shanghaiist article respective fake lamb meat also reached Yum-owned \\"Little Sheep\\" hot pot chain restaurants, though Yum itself declined these rumours. Recycled expired food In June 2013, Wenzhou police shut down 10 underground mills in Zhejiang's Cangnan County, and additionally seized large amounts of chemical additives and coloring agents, which were used to clean expired chicken drumsticks and wings, ducks’ heads, and duck meat prior to re-selling them to the public. Fake beef In September 2013, according to JRJ and Shanghaiist six workshops near Xi'an, Shaanxi, have been shut down that produced fake beef by mixing pork with chemicals, such as paraffin wax and industrial salts. Cat meat scandal In October 2013, cat meat, slaughtered at a \\"black\\" slaughterhouse in Huai'an City near Shanghai, was sold to butchers and local markets under the guise of “rabbit”. Some of the cats were kept alive and shipped to the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi where they were sold for around 10 yuan (£1) per animal. Food safety incidents in 2014= Gutter oil scandal  Gutter oil is a term used in China to describe illicit cooking oil that has already been used and is then processed by cleaning and filtering to be resold as a cheaper alternative to normal cooking oil. The sources of this oil are restaurant fryers, sewers and leftover or used oil that is sold by restaurants. A newer version of gutter oil uses discarded animal parts, animal fat, internal organs, and expired or otherwise low quality meat which is then cooked in large vats in order to extract the oil. Expired meat sold to global brands Shanghai Husi Food Co. Ltd. supplied products containing expired meat to McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, and Burger King. The products were sold in numerous countries including Japan. Pizza Hut's and KFC's parent Yum! Brands, Inc. apologized to Chinese customers after the scandal was exposed. Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd based in China was a subsidiary of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC. The company was forced in July 2014 to shut down after local television station Dragon TV ran footage of the company's factory workers picking meat such as hamburger patties from off the factory floor and throwing them directly into meat mixers, and handling poultry and beef on the assembly line with their bare hands. The footage also showed sewage and trash spread all over the floor of the plant. In addition, the expired meat, which workers described as \\"stinky,\\" was concealed mostly by mixing it with non-expired meat.  Sodium Formaldehyde Sulfoxylate (CH3NaO3S)  A video about the top 10 most common toxic substances in Chinese food and snacks looked into the use of the carcinogen, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate (CH3NaO3S), to bleach food. According to the video, this practice has been widely adopted by the largely unregulated Chinese food industry. In the video, all 12 samples taken from mianjing snack stalls in Beijing were found to contain CH3NaO3S. Mushrooms, tofu, mianjing (a Chinese starch product), mixian (mainly rice made noodles), vermicelli, and flour were among the food that contained contaminated substances. Bean and starch products were also found contaminated with CH3NaO3S.  Fake hot pot soup  A video made by a Chinese dietitian has become popular on Internet showing a commonly adopted way to turn boiled water into \\"high quality pork soup\\" for hot pot. By adding ethyl maltol, capsicum oleoresin, and Disodium 5’-ribonucleotide into boiled water, fake pork hot pot soup becomes ready to serve in 20 seconds. As investigators dug deeper, it was revealed to the public that many cooks of hot pot restaurants took training programs in China that approved the fraud to reduce cost. Investigators also found antimalarial drugs in the soup to cover the side effects of rotten meat. In the same video, the dietitian also showed a common method to make “beef balls” from bean powder by adding sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7·10H2O) and sodium tripolyphosphate (Na5P3O10).

He is the founder and director of think tank organisation \\"International Centre For Relations & Diplomacy. Career In 2007, Habeeb started to intensify his media work as the siege became tougher in Gaza. He launched a blog, Gaza Today, the Untold Story, late in 2007. Between 2007 and 2008 he published tens of articles, photo stories, and features, and blogged on a daily basis. The same year, he started to take photos in Gaza that only focused on humanitarian conditions. His photos were shown on Sky News and published internationally. In April 2008, Habeeb conducted a speaking tour across Italy, lecturing at 25 meetings in universities, colleges and city councils, to speak about the conditions in Gaza. During the 2008–09 Gaza War he was a source of news in Gaza. He reported for a number of media outlets, including The Real News and was a contributing reporter for BBC, Sky News, Channel 4, ABC, CBC, CNN, and tens of other media outlets on an hourly basis.Israeli troops attack Gaza City. The Real News. Working under terrible conditions during the war, he worked as a field reporter with Netwerk TVGaza: het conflict door de ogen van een Palestijn [Dutch TV] of the Netherlands, as well as Vandakh, where he did various reports about the war. During the 23 days of the War on Gaza, Habeeb sent daily dispatches via his blog about the war for all media outlets. His reporting put him in focus, which, he reports, led to numerous threats on his life. PBS studied Habeeb’s work, and drew a comparison between the Israeli and Palestinian media. In March 2009, Habeeb founded The Palestine Telegraph online newspaper. In April 2010, Habeeb's website featured an interview with the ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in which Duke stated Israel was a terrorism threat against America. A backer of the website, Jenny Tonge resigned as a patron over the website's posting of the video. In early May 2010, an issue of the Leeds Student newspaper which is based at the Leeds University was removed from sale by the Students' Union after complaints for featuring an interview with Habeeb. He was asked whether the \\"mainstream media organizations have a hidden agenda?\\" to which he replied: \\"They are certainly pro-Israeli. I think you have to ask yourself who controls the media\\". Habeeb holds a master's degree in Business Management, and he is a regular guest as a political analyst on Middle East issues on Press TV, BBC and others. In 2009 and 2010, he carried out more than 100 workshops, meetings and conferences across the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland, France and Australia, where he conducted lectures on the media in Palestine and the recent political conditions in Gaza and the West Bank. He has also worked with many European and British Members of Parliament in regard to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and has spoken repeatedly at the British Parliament. Initially a Labour Party candidate in the 2018 British local elections in Northwood, London on 3 May, he was suspended from party membership on 3 April prior to an investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.

Unit cell  Plumbogummite crystallizes in space group Rm. The reported lattice parameters (the lengths of the sides of the unit cell) vary in detail according to the source, but all agree that normal plumbogummite has \\"a\\" close to 7 Å and \\"c\\" close to 17 Å, with Z=3.

Structure  The basic structural units of plumbogummite are PO4 tetrahedra, with phosphorus atoms (P) at the center and oxygen atoms (O) at the corners, together with AlO6 octahedra, aluminium atoms (Al) at the center and oxygen atoms at the corners. The tetrahedra and octahedra combine by sharing corners, to form composite layers. Lead atoms (Pb) occupy sites between the layers.  Environment  Plumbogummite is found in the oxidized zones of lead-bearing deposits. It commonly occurs as botryoidal, kidney shaped, stalactitic or globular crusts or masses, frequently with a concentric structure; rare crystals have a hexagonal outline. Pyromorphite and baryte are common associated minerals, and plumbogummite may be pseudomorphic after them. Other associated minerals include mimetite, duftite, cerussite, anglesite and wulfenite.  Occurrence  The type locality is Huelgoat, Finistère, Brittany, France, and the type material is stored in the Natural History Museum, Paris, France.

They are offences under the common law, developed entirely by the law courts, and therefore have no specific basis in statute. Australia Under the criminal law of Australia the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) abolished all common law offences at the federal level.History of Australian Criminal Law, Parliament of Australia Library The Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia have also abolished common law offences, but they still apply in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Although some common law offences still exist in New South Wales, many common law offences – for example nightwalking, riot, rout, affray, keeping of bawdy houses, champerty and maintenance, eavesdropping and being a common scold – have been abolished in that State. Canada In Canada the consolidation of criminal law in the Criminal Code, enacted in 1953, involved the abolition of all common law offences except contempt of court (preserved by section 9 of the Code) and contempt of Parliament (preserved by section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867). England and Wales In England and Wales, the Law Commission's programme of codification of the criminal law included the aim of abolishing all the remaining common law offences and replacing them, where appropriate, with offences precisely defined by statute. Common law offences were seen as unacceptably vague and open to development by the courts in ways that might offend the principle of certainty. However, neither the Law Commission nor the UK Parliament have completed the necessary revisions of the law, so common law offences still exist. In England and Wales common law offences are punishable by unlimited fines and unlimited imprisonment. Extant common law offences are listed at , and those that have been abolished or redefined as statutory offences are listed at .

The Crimes Act, 1961 (which replaced the 1908 enactment) affirmed the abolition of criminal proceedings at common law, with the exception of contempt of court and of offences tried by courts martial. United States The notion that common law offenses could be enforced in federal courts was found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Hudson and Goodwin, 11 U.S. 32 (1812). A woman, Anne Royall, was nonetheless found guilty of being a common scold in Washington, D.C. in 1829; a newspaper paid her fine. Some have argued that common law offences are inconsistent with the prohibition of ex post facto laws.Anthony J. Fejfar (2009), \\"Common Law Crimes Are Unconstitutional as Ex Post Facto Laws\\" At the state level, the situation varies. Some states, such as New Jersey, have abolished common law crimes (see State v. Palendrano), while others have chosen to continue to recognize them. In some states, the elements of many crimes are defined mostly or entirely by common law, i.e., by prior judicial decisions. For instance, Michigan's penal code does not define the crime of murder: while the penalties for murder are laid out in statute, the actual elements of murder, and their meaning, is entirely set out in case law.

Gonzalez (born June 4, 1978) is an attorney and politician from El Paso, Texas. She was a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015, where she represented the 76th district in El Paso County. She lost her race for re-election in 2014, defeated by Cesar Blanco in the Democratic primary. Early life and career Gonzalez graduated from Jefferson High School in El Paso, before going to Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio and law school at St. Mary's University. On graduating from law school, she worked at El Paso law firms before joining the El Paso County Attorney's office in 2007 as an Assistant County Attorney. Political career=2010 campaign for state representative Gonzalez defeated seven-term incumbent Norma Chávez in the 2010 Democratic primary runoff to capture a seat in the Texas House, capitalizing on a series of high- profile controversies surrounding Chávez. Despite running against a long-time incumbent, Gonzalez's campaign received the support of numerous local political players, including the El Paso Times, state senator Eliot Shapleigh and other members of the county's legislative delegation. The race was highly negative and personal, with each candidate launching attacks against the other. In the Democratic primary election held on March 2, Gonzalez polled 48% of the vote to Chávez's 46%, with a minor candidate taking the remainder. Because no candidate won an absolute majority, a runoff election was held on April 13, 2010 with Gonzalez defeating Chávez by 53% to 47% – a margin of 361 votes. No Republican filed for the seat and Gonzalez won the general election unopposed. Gonzalez took the oath of office in January 2011. 2014 re- election campaign Re-elected in 2012, Gonzalez lost her bid for re-election in 2014, coming third in the Democratic primary on March 4, 2014. She finished third with 27% of the vote, behind Cesar Blanco who took 44% of the vote and Norma Chavez, who took 29% of the vote. Blanco won the primary runoff and the general election, succeeding Gonzalez on the expiration of her term in January 2015.https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_170_state.htm?x=0&y;=6224&id;=299 Primary results Personal During the 2010 campaign, Chávez drew attention on several occasions to Gonzalez's sexual orientation, saying that her opponent was a lesbian. Gonzalez did not deny the charge but criticized Chávez's tactics and accused her of trying to run from her record. Driving while intoxicated arrest and charge Close to 2 A.M. on March 14, 2013 Rep. Gonzalez was arrested and charged with DWI after her vehicle struck a car at the intersection of Congress Ave. and Barton Springs Rd. in Austin, Texas. Gonzalez's car was allegedly traveling at 50 mph, 20 miles over the speed limit, when it struck a vehicle and forced it into a collision with a bicyclist. Police state that Gonzalez's blood alcohol content was .164, over twice the legal limit. Gonzalez told police that she had only two drinks and cried while telling them that she had worked so hard to get where she is today. The following week she offered an emotional apology to her fellow House members telling them, \\"I made a mistake and I am deeply, deeply sorry for it\\" adding, \\"I am sorry for the shame I have brought upon this House and my district.\\" She said that ongoing legal issues prevented her from saying much about the incident, but that she was glad no one was seriously injured.

The Tamborito is the national song and dance of Panama. The dance is a romantic, couple's dance, often involving a small percussion ensemble, and in all versions; a female chorus. The Tamborito is performed in formal costumes in front of large, interactive crowds that form a large circle around the performers. The members of such crowds often participate in the percussion of the song as well as the actual dance itself.http://www.angelfire.com/tx/CZAngelsSpace/Tamborito.html Hirons, Virginia. El Tamborito. 3/29/10 The Tamborito is most commonly performed during Panamanian festivals, and in particular, the Panama Carnival. History The Tamborito is a derivative of mestizo dance and folkloric music, with the melody tracing its roots as far back as the seventeenth century. This genre of folkloric music is a hybrid-mix of the Spanish, Amerindian and African cultures. The rhythm of the Tamborito is of African influence, lyrics tend to be repetitive and, as in West African vocal music, also incorporate popular commentary.http://www.folkdance.com/federation/dances/tamborito.pdf) Graham, Omega, et al. Tamborito. California: Folk Dance Federation of California Research Committee, Panama's most famous Tamborito was written in 1918 by Juan Pastor Peredes, put to music by Carmen Lagnon, entitled El tambor de la alegria.https://books.google.com/books?id=cNEcEyZs254C&pg;=PA98&dq;=Tamborito&hl;=en&ei;=MDbES5m6DY2otgOh0ITfDg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CDIQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q;=Tamborito&f;=false Soley, Culture and Customs of Panama. Westport: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009. Musical composition The Tamborito is musically performed to the beat of drums, the stomping of feet, the clapping of hands, and the chanting of harmonic poems, called coplas. Vocally, the Tamborito is led by a female singer, the cantalante, who sings of the lust, frustration, and sexual tension and attraction felt between the men and women at carnival. The onlooking spectators and awaiting group of performers, known as the estribillio, respond to the cantalante's song by clapping twice to a measure and by the singing of the copla. Coplas are Spanish poems, which are sung lyrically, and comprise four line stanzas.http://xpress.sfsu.edu/bayvoices/2008/05/las-bellezas- panamenas-to-brin.html Greenhouse, Paulette. Las Bellezas Panameñas troupe to bring Tamborito dance to Carnaval. San Francisco: San Francisco State University, 2008. The percussion involved in the Tamborito consists of three drums in the center of the circle created by the estribillio. There are three drums, native to Panama, used in the performance of the Tamborito: the “Caja”, the “Repujador” and the “Repicador”. All of these drums are from the hollowing of local, Panamanian, trees, with the heads constructed from tanned cowhide.http://eltamborito.com/cultura.html \\"El Tamborito\\": Panama's Folklore. 2004. The drums represent the three primary aspects of the Tamborito. The Caja is the smallest of the drums used in the Tamborito. The Caja is a short, wide drum used to create staccato tones, much like those created by the estribillio. The Repujador is the masculine aspect of the Tamborito, as this drum creates the base. The Repujador is a long, slender drum. The Repicador is the final, feminine, aspect of the Tamborito. The Repicador is similar in shape to the Repujador, however the Repicador creates high-pitched notes that are scaled to fit the rhythm. Tamborito dance The dance of the Tamborito is one between a man and a woman couple. The dance is of a sexual nature, often referred to as a courting dance, and begins with the clapping of the crowd and playing of the playing of the percussion band. As the female and male dancers take their places within the circle the Repicador drummer will give a signal to the dancers in the form of three knocks. In response, the female dancer will give the percussion band three curtseys, known as quiebres, the last of which results in a twirling of the dancers body. The male dancer will kneel three times, known as the golpes magistrales, thus beginning the Tamborito dance. The dance is a series of shuffling steps, with the woman maneuvering her skirt in a provocative fashion and the man positioning his arms in a protecting fashion. At the conclusion of the dance, the Repicador drummer again gives three knocks, the male and female dancers curtsey once more and the crowd gives their approval of the dance in the form of a \\"Vivas\\" chant. Tamborito attire The attire worn by the performers during the Tamborito is quite elegant and flashy. The women wear an embroidered gown known as La Pollera, and the men wear a costume called El Montuno. The Pollera is a gown only worn on festival occasions and consists of two ruffles, embroidered with colors and intricate designs, two pom-poms are fastened to the front and rear of the woman's chest with lace gracefully draped from handmade thread lace insertion at the neckline. The stitching and thread used to detail the Pollera must be the same color as the velvet, heel-less shoes. The women's outfit is completed with gold hairpins and a flashy headpiece, which is supposed to resemble a crown. The headpiece is commonly made of shell.http://www.thebalboainn.com/about-panama/panama-cultural/la-pollera- panamas-national-dress/ La Pollera, Panama’s national dress. Panama: The Balboa Inn, 2009 The Montuno worn by the male performers is much less intricate than the Pollera worn by the female performers. The Montuno generally consists of long sleeved, white collared shirt, which fits loosely on the performer. The trousers worn by the male are made of black, navy or white cotton and come to knee length. The outfit is completed with a shallow straw hat and canvas or leather shoes.http://www.theworldly.org/ArticlesPages/Articles2003/April03Articles/Fashion- Panamanian.html Caroline, OUYANG.

In popular culture Besides being the national song and dance of Panama, the Tamborito is important to Panamanian culture because folkloric music plays a continuous role in Panama's contemporary music. The Tamborito genre of music competes for radio and record sales with the other popular music of Panama, and has created such Panamanian celebrities as Sammy and Sandra Sandoval.

It is the most populous area of Quetta with five lakh population. The majority of the population are Hazara people. This place is the birthplace of many Hazara political, social, military, writers, sports personalities of Quetta city.  History of Hazaras establishment in Balochistan  The first contact between the British and the Hazaras was just before the First Afghan War, when some Hazaras served in \\"Broadfoot's Sappers\\" (British Scouts) from 1839–1840. This sappers company participated in the First Anglo-Afghan War also . Hazaras also worked in the agriculture farms in Sindh and construction of Sukkur barrage . In his seminal book War and Migration, Alessandro Monsutti classifies the Hazara migration to Balochistan in the following phases: 1878–91 Following the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the first Hazaras came to Quetta to seek employment in British-run companies under the Raj. They are thought to have worked on the building of roads and the Bolan Pass railway as well as enlisting in the British Army of India. At that time, there could have been no more than a few hundred Hazaras in Balochistan. 1891–1901 The subjugation of Hazarajat by Abdur Rahman, between 1891 and 1893, triggered a mass exodus of Hazaras to Turkestan, Khorasan and Balochistan. 1901–33 The situation in Afghanistan returned to normal under Habibullah (1901–1919), the son of Abdur Rahman. He offered amnesty to the Hazaras but this proved to be of little help in improving the lot of the Hazara community in Afghanistan. In 1904, the 106th Hazara Pioneers, a separate regiment for the Hazaras formed by the British, offered greater careers prospects, social recognition and economic success. 1933–71 The regiment of Hazara Pioneers was disbanded in 1933. Deprived of this social and professional outlet, Hazaras went to settle in Quetta between the 1930s and 1960s, although the process of migration never completely dried up. 1971–78 Following the 1971 drought, Hazaras then settled in Quetta or went to Iran in search of work. Between 1973 and 1978, tensions over the Pashtunistan issue between Pakistan and the Afghan regime, were an additional factor in the Hazara migration since President Daoud Khan of Afghanistan saw the Hazara as Pakistan's allies. After 1978 Following the Communist coup in April 1978 and the Soviet Union intervention in December 1979, the migratory movement assumed hitherto unprecedented dimensions. Educational institutes Hazaras have been very active in the field of education in Pakistan. Many, private educational institutes are found in the area . A partial list of educational institutes is provided below.

Slightly less than half of Kazakhstan's Poles live in the Karaganda region, with another 2,500 in Astana, 1,200 in Almaty, and the rest scattered throughout rural regions. Migration history=Arrival The first Pole to travel to the territory which today makes up Kazakhstan was probably Benedict of Poland, sent as part of the delegation of Pope Innocent IV to the Khagan Güyük of the Mongol Empire. Migration of Poles to Kazakhstan, largely of an involuntary character, began soon after the Kazakh Khanate came under the control of the Russians. Captured participants of the 1830-1831 November Uprising and the 1863-1865 January Uprising, as well as members of clandestine organisations, were sent into exile throughout the Russian Empire. By the time of the Russian Empire Census of 1897, there were already 11,579 Poles in Central Asia, 90 per cent male. Poles both inside and outside of the Soviet Union would later get caught up in Stalinist population transfers in the late 1930s. At least 250,000 Poles from the Polish National Districts of the Soviet Union were deported to the Kazakh SSR in 1930s; among those, as many as 100,000 did not survive the first winter in the country. After the Soviet invasion of Poland, another 150,000 Poles were deported from eastern Polish territories to Kazakhstan; 80% of these were women and children, as the adult men of their community were typically absent due to army service. After the end of the war, people who had been Polish citizens before September 1, 1939 were allowed to repatriate to Poland; however, no provision was made for earlier deportees to leave Kazakhstan. The 1970 Soviet census found 61,400 Poles (0.5% of the population) in the Kazakh SSR, while the 1979 census found 61,100 (0.4%) and the 1989 census 59,400 (0.4%). However, Polish scholars believe these numbers to be underestimates, due to the reluctance of Poles to register their true ethnicity in their official documentation and the relative ease of changing one's declared nationality to another, such as Ukrainian or Russian; they have given numbers ranging from 100,000 to 400,000. Post- Soviet emigration When communist rule in Poland ended, there was great political enthusiasm on the part of the new Polish government for facilitating the repatriation of members of the Polish diaspora. However, up until 1996, there was no formal system for controlling the migration of ethnic Poles from the Soviet Union to Poland. Roughly 1,500 Poles from Kazakhstan came to Poland during this period, often on tourist visas. They were typically granted residency permits, but only a few managed to obtain Polish citizenship. However, legal reforms in 1996 and again in 1998 regularised the immigration procedures, allowing any ethnic Pole from abroad to settle in the country upon receiving an invitation from a company or association. Prospective emigrants were required to apply at the Polish consulate in Kazakhstan with documentary proof of their Polish ancestry. In a 1996-1998 academic survey, Poles who had emigrated from Kazakhstan cited a number of reasons for their departure, including the decreased social status of non-Kazakh-speakers in the newly independent country, the local economic crisis which saw many salaries go unpaid, and the desire to avoid service in the Kazakhstani army. Some also claimed to survey takers that their female relatives were in danger of bride kidnapping. Due to their experience with agriculture on kolkhoz during communism, many of the Poles in Kazakhstan were able to obtain invitations from rural communes in Poland, which hoped to revive farms that would otherwise be sold to German expatriates. However, in practise many were specialised with only one type of skill, and lacked familiarity with other aspects of farm operation that they would need in their new lives in Poland. In other cases, Polish students came to Kazakhstan with grants from the Polish Ministry of Education (100 each year), and later invited their family members to join them. There were also reports of people from Poland travelling to Kazakhstan and selling invitations at a high price. The number of repatriates might be as large as 20,000, and is partially reflected by a decrease in the Kazakhstan census' recorded number of Poles in the country. Religion The first Polish Catholic church for exiles on the steppe was opened at Orenburg in 1844; another was opened in Omsk in 1862. (Both cities are today part of Russia). By 1917, the church at Petropavlovsk had grown to 3,000 members. During the years of exile and assimilation to Soviet-Russian society, for many Poles the Catholic religion was the only link to their ancestral culture. Inter-ethnic relations Poles tend to be settled in multi-ethnic regions of Kazakhstan, where settlers and exiles of many other nationalities predominated and members of the titular Kazakh nationality were few. Interethnic marriages between Poles and members of other European ethnic groups were quite common; however, those with members of traditionally Muslim ethnic groups were much rarer. An anthropological study conducted in 1993 found that Poles generally viewed the Kazakhs as lazy but friendly, and generally stated that inter- ethnic relations were good.

The tallest point in the hills is West Butte at . Quite prominent in the local area, they are clearly visible from US Highway 2 to the south, I-15, and can sometimes be seen as far north as the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) near Medicine Hat in Alberta. Other named peaks in the small group are Gold Butte (6,512 feet), East Butte (with two peaks, the taller of which at 6,958 ft), and Mount Lebanon (5807 ft). The Sweet Grass Hills are an example of the island ranges that dot the central third portion of the state of Montana. These island ranges, completely surrounded by the 'sea' of plains and not geographically (or often geologically) part of the Rocky Mountains to the west, are \\"biological hotspots\\", containing more species than the prairie below. Formation and natural features The Sweetgrass Hills as seen from Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park in Canada. The hills were formed in the early Paleogene period, and geologically are known as stocks - intrusive igneous rock forced up from below and solidified. Because of uplift and erosion, the overlying rock formations have disappeared. The upper slopes of the hills have not been glaciated and would have stood above the ice sheet that covered the area during the last ice age. pp.84-85. Since the Sweet Grass Hills are at a higher elevation than the surrounding prairie, temperatures are cooler and precipitation is higher. Forested areas, consisting mainly of Douglas fir, are therefore able to grow on the hills' slopes. Cultural significance The Sweet Grass Hills are a sacred site of the Blackfoot aboriginal people who live on both sides of the 49th parallel north which forms the Canada–United States border. The Hills were the site of a battle between Native people and wolfers in 1872. The Sweetgrass Hills Treaty of 1887 was signed between the Blackfeet and the United States, ceding 17,500,000 acres of land to the US Government, and dividing the remaining 6,000,000 into three separate reservations – The Blackfeet, Fort Belknap and Fort Peck. This is often referred to as the Sweetgrass Hills Treaty/Agreement and was ratified by congress in 1888.http://opi.mt.gov/pdf/IndianEd/IEFA/FortPeckTimeline.pdf In 1993, the Hills were listed as one of America's Most Endangered Places.

These are projective analogs of spherical polyhedra – tessellations of the sphere – and toroidal polyhedra – tessellations of the toroids. Projective polyhedra are also referred to as elliptic tessellations or elliptic tilings, referring to the projective plane as (projective) elliptic geometry, by analogy with spherical tiling, a synonym for \\"spherical polyhedron\\". However, the term elliptic geometry applies to both spherical and projective geometries, so the term carries some ambiguity for polyhedra. As cellular decompositions of the projective plane, they have Euler characteristic 1, while spherical polyhedra have Euler characteristic 2. The qualifier \\"globally\\" is to contrast with locally projective polyhedra, which are defined in the theory of abstract polyhedra. Non-overlapping projective polyhedra (density 1) correspond to spherical polyhedra (equivalently, convex polyhedra) with central symmetry. This is elaborated and extended below in relation with spherical polyhedra and relation with traditional polyhedra.  Examples  hemi-cube is a regular projective polyhedron with 3 square faces, 6 edges, and 4 vertices. The best-known examples of projective polyhedra are the regular projective polyhedra, the quotients of the centrally symmetric Platonic solids, as well as two infinite classes of even dihedra and hosohedra:Coxeter, Introduction to geometry, 1969, Second edition, sec 21.3 Regular maps, p. 386-388 * Hemi-cube, {4,3}/2 * Hemi-octahedron, {3,4}/2 * Hemi-dodecahedron, {5,3}/2 * Hemi-icosahedron, {3,5}/2 * Hemi-dihedron, {2p,2}/2, p>=1 * Hemi-hosohedron, {2,2p}/2, p>=1 These can be obtained by taking the quotient of the associated spherical polyhedron by the antipodal map (identifying opposite points on the sphere). On the other hand, the tetrahedron does not have central symmetry, so there is no \\"hemi-tetrahedron\\". See relation with spherical polyhedra below on how the tetrahedron is treated.  Hemipolyhedra  The tetrahemihexahedron is a projective polyhedron, and the only uniform projective polyhedron that immerses in Euclidean 3-space. Note that the prefix \\"hemi-\\" is also used to refer to hemipolyhedra, which are uniform polyhedra having some faces that pass through the center of symmetry. As these do not define spherical polyhedra (because they pass through the center, which does not map to a defined point on the sphere), they do not define projective polyhedra by the quotient map from 3-space (minus the origin) to the projective plane. Of these uniform hemipolyhedra, only the tetrahemihexahedron is topologically a projective polyhedron, as can be verified by its Euler characteristic and visually obvious connection to the Roman surface. It is 2-covered by the cuboctahedron, and can be realized as the quotient of the spherical cuboctahedron by the antipodal map. It is the only uniform (traditional) polyhedron that is projective – that is, the only uniform projective polyhedron that immerses in Euclidean three-space as a uniform traditional polyhedron.  Relation with spherical polyhedra  There is a 2-to-1 covering map S^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbf{RP}^2 of the sphere to the projective plane, and under this map, projective polyhedra correspond to spherical polyhedra with central symmetry – the 2-fold cover of a projective polyhedron is a centrally symmetric spherical polyhedron. Further, because a covering map is a local homeomorphism (in this case a local isometry), both the spherical and the corresponding projective polyhedra have the same abstract vertex figure. For example, the 2-fold cover of the (projective) hemi-cube is the (spherical) cube. The hemi-cube has 4 vertices, 3 faces, and 6 edges, each of which is covered by 2 copies in the sphere, and accordingly the cube has 8 vertices, 6 faces, and 12 edges, while both these polyhedra have a 4.4.4 vertex figure (3 squares meeting at a vertex). Further, the symmetry group (of isometries) of a projective polyhedron and covering spherical polyhedron are related: the symmetries of the projective polyhedron are naturally identified with the rotation symmetries of the spherical polyhedron, while the full symmetry group of the spherical polyhedron is the product of its rotation group (the symmetry group of the projective polyhedron) and the cyclic group of order 2, {±I}. See symmetry group below for elaboration and other dimensions. Spherical polyhedra without central symmetry do not define a projective polyhedron, as the images of vertices, edges, and faces will overlap. In the language of tilings, the image in the projective plane is a degree 2 tiling, meaning that it covers the projective plane twice – rather than 2 faces in the sphere corresponding to 1 face in the projective plane, covering it twice, each face in the sphere corresponds to a single face in the projective plane, accordingly covering it twice. The correspondence between projective polyhedra and centrally symmetric spherical polyhedra can be extended to a Galois connection including all spherical polyhedra (not necessarily centrally symmetric) if the classes are extended to include degree 2 tilings of the projective plane, whose covers are not polyhedra but rather the polyhedral compound of a non-centrally symmetric polyhedron, together with its central inverse (a compound of 2 polyhedra). This geometrizes the Galois connection at the level of finite subgroups of O(3) and PO(3), under which the adjunction is \\"union with central inverse\\". For example, the tetrahedron is not centrally symmetric, and has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces, and vertex figure 3.3.3 (3 triangles meeting at each vertex). Its image in the projective plane has 4 vertices, 6 edges (which intersect), and 4 faces (which overlap), covering the projective plane twice. The cover of this is the stellated octahedron – equivalently, the compound of two tetrahedra – which has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces, and vertex figure 3.3.3.  Generalizations  In the context of abstract polytopes, one instead refers to \\"locally projective polytopes\\" – see Abstract polytope: Local topology. For example, the 11-cell is a \\"locally projective polytope\\", but is not a globally projective polyhedron, nor indeed tessellates any manifold, as it not locally Euclidean, but rather locally projective, as the name indicates. Projective polytopes can be defined in higher dimension as tessellations of projective space in one less dimension. Defining k-dimensional projective polytopes in n-dimensional projective space is somewhat trickier, because the usual definition of polytopes in Euclidean space requires taking convex combinations of points, which is not a projective concept, and is infrequently addressed in the literature, but has been defined, such as in .  Symmetry group  The symmetry group of a projective polytope is a finite (hence discrete)Since PO is compact, finite and discrete sets are identical – infinite sets have an accumulation point. subgroup of the projective orthogonal group, PO, and conversely every finite subgroup of PO is the symmetry group of a projective polytope by taking the polytope given by images of a fundamental domain for the group. The relevant dimensions are as follows: n-dimensional real projective space is the projectivization of (n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space, \\\\mathbf{RP}^n = \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{R}^{n+1}), so the projective orthogonal group of an n-dimensional projective space is denoted :PO(n+1) = P(O(n+1)) = O(n+1)/{±I}. If n=2k is even (so n+1 = 2k+1 is odd), then O(2k+1) = SO(2k+1)×{±I} decomposes as a product, and thus PO(2k+1) = PSO(2k+1) \\\\cong SO(2k+1)The isomorphism/equality distinction in this equation is because the context is the 2-to-1 quotient map O \\\\to PO – PSO(2k+1) and PO(2k+1) are equal subsets of the target (namely, the whole space), hence the equality, while the induced map SO \\\\to PSO is an isomorphism but the two groups are subsets of different spaces, hence the isomorphism rather than an equality. See for an example of this distinction being made. so the group of projective isometries can be identified with the group of rotational isometries. Thus in particular the symmetry group of a projective polyhedron is the rotational symmetry group of the covering spherical polyhedron; the full symmetry group of the spherical polyhedron is then just the direct product with reflection through the origin, which is the kernel on passage to projective space. The projective plane is non-orientable, and thus there is no distinct notion of \\"orientation- preserving isometries of a projective polyhedron\\", which is reflected in the equality PSO(3) = PO(3). If n=2k + 1 is odd, then O(n+1) = O(2k+2) does not decompose as a product, and thus the symmetry group of the projective polytope is not simply the rotational symmetries of the spherical polytope, but rather a 2-to-1 quotient of the full symmetry group of the corresponding spherical polytope (the spherical group is a central extension of the projective group). Further, in odd projective dimension (even vector dimension) PSO(2k) eq PO(2k) and is instead a proper (index 2) subgroup, so there is a distinct notion of orientation-preserving isometries. For example, in n = 1 (polygons), the symmetries of a 2r-gon is the dihedral group Dih2r (of order 4r), with rotational group the cyclic group C2r, these being subgroups of O(2) and SO(2), respectively. The projectivization of a 2r-gon (in the circle) is an r-gon (in the projective line), and accordingly the quotient groups, subgroups of PO(2) and PSO(2) are Dihr and Cr. Note that the same commutative square of subgroups occurs for the square of Spin group and Pin group – Spin(2), Pin+(2), SO(2), O(2) – here going up to a 2-fold cover, rather than down to a 2-fold quotient. Lastly, by the lattice theorem there is a Galois connection between subgroups of O(n) and subgroups of PO(n), in particular of finite subgroups. Under this connection, symmetry groups of centrally symmetric polytopes correspond to symmetry groups of the corresponding projective polytope, while symmetry groups of spherical polytopes without central symmetry correspond to symmetry groups of degree 2 projective polytopes (tilings that cover projective space twice), whose cover (corresponding to the adjunction of the connection) is a compound of two polytopes – the original polytope and its central inverse. These symmetry groups should be compared and contrasted with binary polyhedral groups – just as Pin±(n) → O(n) is a 2-to-1 cover, and hence there is a Galois connection between binary polyhedral groups and polyhedral groups, O(n) → PO(n) is a 2-to-1-cover, and hence has an analogous Galois connection between subgroups. However, while discrete subgroups of O(n) and PO(n) correspond to symmetry groups of spherical and projective polytopes, corresponding geometrically to the covering map S^n \\\\to \\\\mathbf{RP}^n, there is no covering space of S^n (for n \\\\geq 2) as the sphere is simply connected, and thus there is no corresponding \\"binary polytope\\" for which subgroups of Pin are symmetry groups.

All five persons on board were killed, as well as one on the ground. Aircraft involved The aircraft involved was built in 1979 and after service with a number of operators was leased to Aerounión – Aerotransporte de Carga Unión in April 2002 and registered as XA- TUE. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had flown for 55,200 hours and made 27,600 landings. Accident At about 23:18 local time on 13 April (04:18 UTC on 14 April), AeroUnion Flight 302 executed a missed approach after a landing attempt and crashed The Airbus A300B4-203F was on a scheduled international freight service from Mexico City International Airport via General Mariano Escobedo International Airport, Monterrey, to Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles. The crew had been cleared to land the aircraft on runway 11 at Mariano Escobedo Airport, but it crashed onto the Avenida Miguel Alemán motorway, almost 2 km short of the runway threshold. It struck a car, killing the driver. The airplane broke up and burst into flames. All five occupants of the aircraft were killed. There was a storm that caused windshear and heavy rain, with a ceiling varying between 500 and 800 feet. The METAR in force at the time of the accident stated visibility of 7 miles with light rain. Cloud cover was \\"broken\\" at 2,500 ft, overcast at 5,000. with intra-cloud lightning observed. Investigation The Direction General of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC) of the Ministry of Communications and Transportation of Mexico (SCT) opened an investigation into the accident. Assistance was provided by Airbus, the aircraft's manufacturer; and by France's aircraft accident investigation body, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA). The investigation noted that on final approach the speed decreased to 110 knots (more than 20 knots below typical final approach speed) followed by the crew pulling the control column which resulted in further speed decay and increased angle of attack. The stick shaker, stall warning and Alpha Floor protection activated and caused the engines to accelerate to maximum thrust. In response to the pitch up moment produced by the accelerating engines the control column was pushed forward however the trim was at 10.25 degrees nose up and was not adjusted. The aircraft pitched up reaching an angle of attack of 41 degrees, the speed decayed to 70 knots, the stick shaker and stall warning activated again, the control column was at its forward stop, and the aircraft began to descend. During the last 10 seconds of flight the control column was reversed to its backward stop while the aircraft was losing height until impact.

They are most well known for the Dutch modernist inspired Mac.Robertson Girls High School, designed by Norman Seabrook in 1933.  Architectural Practice  As a young architect Norman Seabrook famously won the competition for the Mac.Robertson Girls' High school in 1933 soon after returning from travels through Europe, with a striking Dutch Modernist inspired design later hailed as a seminal element of what architect and critic Robin Boyd called the '1934 Revolution'. Seabrook took on the slightly older and more experienced Alan Fildes to execute the project, which became a formal partnership in 1936. By applying and adapting European modernist design principles to a broad range of civic, industrial, commercial and residential buildings, Seabrook and Fildes played a primary role in the dissemination of modernist architecture in Victoria in their relatively short-lived period of greatest creative output between 1934 and 1940. Other notable projects included fire stations in Brunswick and Windsor, both also broadly inspired by Dutch Modernism, with rectangular volumes of brick and minimal decorative touches. Other landmarks included Barnett's in Bourke Street, Melbourne, where the strip windows were separated by panels of blue-painted metal spandrels in imitation of curtain walling, and the Royal Exchange in Pitt Street, Sydney, with its large areas of glass, and rectilinear detailing (though the most distinctive feature of two floors of glass block walls have been replaced). Through a connection of Alan Fildes the firm was engaged on numerous projects that transformed the commercial streets of the Victorian country town of Hamilton, Victoria in the 1930s, with three pubs refurbishments and five new retail buildings, some in their signature rectilinear style, while others are more exuberant Art Deco, with prominent signage, curved corners and glass brick towers. One of their most outstanding projects was a new town hall for the small town of Warracknabeal in a boldy modernist composition of massive cream brick volumes, with integral clock tower and elegant signage. An 8-storey office block for the Bank of New South Wales for 100 Collins Street, Melbourne was designed but never constructed. Designed in association with the larger firm of Godfrey & Spowers, it was a design with a rectilinear chequerboard effect, but also a vertical emphasis typical of Art Deco, on a traditionally solid base. Though known as committed modernists, they were also capable of designing in other modes, and their villa 'Combe Martin' for industrialist Charles Ruwolt in Mornington is a fine example of the Old English revival style. The practice operated as Seabrook, Fildes and Hunt briefly from 1955 until Fildes' death in 1956, then as Seabrook, Hunt and Dale until Norman Seabrook's retirement in 1976, but after WW2 the firm had lost their position as leading avant-garde designers. Personal life Norman Hugh Seabrook was born in the Melbourne suburb of Northcote in 1906. He received his education at Brighton College, Wesley, and Hassets Commercial College Prahran, and gained his Architectural articles working for A.R. Barnes in 1924–26. He continued his studies at the University of Melbourne Architecture Atelier from 1927 to 1931, before working for 18 months in Britain and travelling in Europe, possibly gaining first-hand experiences of the Dutch Functionalists and working on projects influenced by them in Britain.http://www.architecture.com.au/i-cms_file?page=4048/MacRobV2.pdf On his return to Melbourne in 1933 he won the competition to design the new Mac.Robertson Girls' High school, which he completed with the assistance of Alan Fildes, with whom he entered into partnership in 1936. The partnership ended in 1956 with the death of Fildes. Seabrook taught briefly at the University of Melbourne in the 1950s, and continued practicing as Seabrook Hunt and Dale until his retirement in 1976. He died two years later in 1978. Alan Fildes was born in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond in 1909. He studied modelling, architecture, construction and carpentry at Brighton Technical College. He received his certificate of architectural registration while working for Oakley and Parkes in 1933. By 1936 he had entered into practice with Norman Seabrook, Seabrook as the main designer, Fildes managing the projects and running the office.Goad, Philip. 'Seabrook, Norman Hugh (1906 - 1978)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16, Melbourne University Press, 2002, p. 202 Alan Fildes died in 1956 at the age of 47. Amongst the office staff of Seabrook & Fildes was Russian-born architect Anatol Kagan (1913-2009), who worked there in the late 1930s and later became a prominent practitioner in his own right. Notable projects=MacRobertson Girls' High school, 1934 MacRobertson Girls' High school was constructed in 1933–34 to Norman Seabrook's competition-winning design. It remains one of the first and best examples of Modernist architecture in Melbourne and was said by Robin Boyd to have signalled ‘the 1934 revolution’ of Victorian architecture. Influenced by Dutch Architect Willem Marinus Dudok’s Hilversum City Hall, the school was arranged in a functionalist manner, breaking the program down into series of intersecting cream-brick volumes according to De Stijl principles, interrupted by large strips of red-framed windows and blue-glazed window sills. The building was a radical departure from school buildings of the time, even including a rooftop classroom, and was the first Willem Marinus Dudok inspired building designed by Seabrook, the principles of which would be repeated and adapted through much of the practices later work. Stokes and Sons, 1936 The factory for the silverware and medallion manufactures Stokes and Sons was constructed in Albert Street, Brunswick in 1936. It was a significant building for architects Seabrook and Fildes, as it saw them expand their Modernist design principles to successfully execute an industrial building type. Constructed in their signature cream-brick it broke down the traditional large factory into a series of volumes, each scaled according to its function, the largest for the manufacturing part of the complex and a lower volume for the office spaces. It also featured the bright colors used at MacRob, with window frames in bright vermillion, the soffits of the long ledges above in bright blue, with a bright yellow front door and lettering of the signage. The building is demolished. Brunswick Fire Station, 1937 Brunswick Fire Station was designed for the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in 1937, and remains in operation today. It is significant for its radical shift from the Georgian revival style common to fire stations of the time, replacing historical reference with a stripped-back modern functionalism. The red brick cubic composition of the Station was set apart from the domestic components, which were contained in two small blocks behind the main building, forming their own residential precinct and reflecting recent advances in European urban design. Windsor Fire Station, 1940 Windsor Fire Station was a departure from the intersecting forms of the practices earlier works, reducing the massing to a simple cream brick box form with a central symmetrical panel of strip windows and projecting balconies, cut short by a blade wall on one side. The design of Kew Fire Station in 1941 by Harry Winbush may have been influenced by the Seabrook & Fildes stations, since it has the two-tone brickwork of Brunswick, and the central panel form of Windsor. The building was demolished in 1994 to make way for a new fire station. Warracknabeal Town Hall, 1940 The largest civic building designed by Seabrook and Fildes was a town hall for the rural Victorian town of Warracknabeal. The building is significant for its application of European modernist design principles to the town-hall building type, which until then had been dominated by classical references The building is constructed from the practice's signature cream- brick and features an asymmetric composition of two large volumes with a large corner clock tower signalling the main entry. The front of the building is broken up by three vertical strips of deeply recessed windows, creating an interplay between solid and void and combined with the deep shadow over the entry suggest an adaptation of modernist design principles to an Australian climate. When built, it originally included an operational cinema to provide a social focus for the town and a means of paying for the building's construction.

The concept of a gammoid was introduced and shown to be a matroid by , based on considerations related to Menger's theorem characterizing the obstacles to the existence of systems of disjoint paths.. Gammoids were given their name by . and studied in more detail by .. Definition Let G be a directed graph, S be a set of starting vertices, and T be a set of destination vertices (not necessarily disjoint from S). The gammoid \\\\Gamma derived from this data has T as its set of elements. A subset I of T is independent in \\\\Gamma if there exists a set of vertex-disjoint paths whose starting points all belong to S and whose ending points are exactly I.. A strict gammoid is a gammoid in which the set T of destination vertices consists of every vertex in G. Thus, a gammoid is a restriction of a strict gammoid, to a subset of its elements. Example Consider the uniform matroid U{}^r_n on a set of n elements, in which every set of r or fewer elements is independent. One way to represent this matroid as a gammoid would be to form a complete bipartite graph K_{r,n} with a set S of r vertices on one side of the bipartition, with a set T of n vertices on the other side of the bipartition, and with every edge directed from S to T. In this graph, a subset of T is the set of endpoints of a set of disjoint paths if and only if it has r or fewer vertices, for otherwise there aren't enough vertices in S to start the paths. The special structure of this graph shows that the uniform matroid is a transversal matroid as well as being a gammoid.. Alternatively, the same uniform matroid U{}^r_n may be represented as a gammoid on a smaller graph, with only n vertices, by choosing a subset S of r vertices and connecting each of the chosen vertices to every other vertex in the graph. Again, a subset of the vertices of the graph can be endpoints of disjoint paths if and only if it has r or fewer vertices, because otherwise there are not enough vertices that can be starts of paths. In this graph, every vertex corresponds to an element of the matroid, showing that the uniform matroid is a strict gammoid., p. 100. Menger's theorem and gammoid rank The rank of a set X\\\\subset T in a gammoid defined from a graph G and vertex subsets S and T is, by definition, the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths from S to X. By Menger's theorem, it also equals the minimum cardinality of a set Y that intersects every path from S to X. Relation to transversal matroids A transversal matroid is defined from a family of sets: its elements are the elements of the sets, and a set X of these elements is independent whenever there exists a one-to-one matching of the elements of X to disjoint sets containing them, called a system of distinct representatives. Equivalently, a transversal matroid may be represented by a special kind of gammoid, defined from a directed bipartite graph (S,T,E) that has a vertex in S for each set, a vertex in T for each element, and an edge from each set to each element contained in it. Less trivially, the strict gammoids are exactly the dual matroids of the transversal matroids. To see that every strict gammoid is dual to a transversal matroid, let \\\\gamma be a strict gammoid defined from a directed graph G and starting vertex set S, and consider the transversal matroid for the family of sets N_v for each vertex v\\\\in V(G)\\\\setminus S, where vertex u belongs to N_v if it equals v or it has an edge to v. Any basis of the strict gammoid, consisting of the endpoints of some set of S disjoint paths from S, is the complement of a basis of the transversal matroid, matching each N_v to the vertex u such that uv is a path edge (or v itself, if v does not participate in one of the paths). Conversely every basis of the transversal matroid, consisting of a representative u_v for each N_v, gives rise to a complementary basis of the strict gammoid, consisting of the endpoints of the paths formed by the set of edges u_vv.. To see, conversely, that every transversal matroid is dual to a strict gammoid, find a subfamily of the sets defining the matroid such that the subfamily has a system of distinct representatives and defines the same matroid. Form a graph that has the union of the sets as its vertices and that has an edge to the representative element of each set from the other members of the same set. Then the sets N_v formed as above for each representative element v are exactly the sets defining the original transversal matroid, so the strict gammoid formed by this graph and by the set of representative elements is dual to the given transversal matroid. Every gammoid is a contraction of a transversal matroid. The gammoids are the smallest class of matroids that includes the transversal matroids and is closed under duality and taking minors.. Representability It is not true that every gammoid is regular, i.e., representable over every field. In particular, the uniform matroid U{}^2_4 is not a binary matroid, and more generally the n-point line U{}^2_n can only be represented over fields with n-1 or more elements. However, every gammoid may be represented over almost every finite field. More specifically, a gammoid with element set S may be represented over every field that has at least 2^{S} elements...

Background  Release management is a relatively new but rapidly growing discipline within software engineering. As software systems, software development processes, and resources become more distributed, they invariably become more specialized and complex. Furthermore, software products (especially web applications) are typically in an ongoing cycle of development, testing, and release, often running on evolving platforms with growing complexity. Such systems require dedicated resources to oversee the integration and flow of development, testing, deployment, and support. Relationship with Continuous Delivery, DevOps, and Agile software development  Organizations that have adopted agile software development are seeing much higher quantities of releases. With the increasing popularity of agile development a new approach to software releases known as Continuous delivery is starting to influence how software transitions from development to a release. One goal of Continuous Delivery and DevOps is to release more reliable applications faster and more frequently. The movement of the application from a “build” through different environments to production as a “release” is part of the Continuous Delivery pipeline. Release managers are beginning to utilize tools such as application release automation and continuous integration tools to help advance the process of Continuous Delivery and incorporate a culture of DevOps by automating a task so that it can be done more quickly, reliably, and is repeatable. More software releases have led to increased reliance on release management and automation tools to execute these complex application release processes.  Relationship with Enterprise Release Management  While Release Management focuses on the transitions from development to testing and release for a single project or a collection of related projects, Enterprise Release Management (ERM) is focused on the coordination of individual releases within a larger organization. An organization with multiple application development groups may require a highly orchestrated series of releases over multiple months or years to implement a large-scale system. ERM involves the coordinated effort of multiple release managers to synchronize releases in the context of an IT portfolio.  Relationship with ITIL/ITSM  In organizations that manage IT operations using the IT Service Management paradigm, specifically the ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library,) framework, release management will be guided by ITIL concepts and principles. There are several formal ITIL Processes that are related to release management, primarily the Release and Deployment Management process, which \\"aims to plan, schedule and control the movement of releases to test and live environments.\\", and the Change Management process In ITIL organizations, releases tend to be less frequent than in an agile development environment. Release processes are managed by IT operations teams using IT Service Management ticketing systems, with less focus on automation of release processes.

In other words, the governance of these institutions is based on the equal representation of employees (normally the trade unions) and employers in their governing bodies. The social protection funds managed by the paritarian institutions are set up through collective agreements at the company, the industry-wide (such as construction sector, metal sector, etc.) or the inter-sectoral level, and they can provide several social benefits such as pension (in particular occupational pension funds), health care, unemployment, disability, paid holidays, and other such benefits. Within the paritarian model there are two phases: in the negotiation phase, when a collective agreement between the trade unions and the employers’ representatives set up the social fund; and in the management phase, the signatory parties decide to manage their negotiated social funds themselves by establishing a Paritarian Institution in which they are equally represented. Paritarian Institutions of Social Protection are widespread in Europe, especially in Western Europe and Scandinavia. The combined funds currently managed by the Paritarian Institutions of Social Protection total to a rough estimate of 1.3 trillion euro in assets and cover about 80 million European citizens. In 1996, a European Organization the European Association of Paritarian Institutions of Social Protection (AEIP) European Association of Paritarian Institutions of social protection (AEIP) was created in order to represent the Paritarian Institutions to the European Union. AEIP underlines the specific peculiarities of the Paritarian Institutions compared to other similar actors like private insurance companies or mutual organizations. Even though of European origins, paritarian institutions also exist in other parts of the world like in North America,National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans (NCCMP)Multi-Employer Benefit Plan Council of Canada (MEBCO) South America, India, and Japan. Etymology Paritarian (from the French \\"paritaire\\"; \\"paritair\\" in Dutch, \\"paritätische\\" in German, \\"Paritetico\\" in Italian) means jointly managed on an equal basis (parity basis).

It was announced on April 13, 2010. It is the third Nokia Symbian^1 smartphone featuring a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Its software and hardware specifications resemble the N97 mini in most ways. One of the differences is that the sliding in this phone is flat, unlike the upward angled in the N97 mini, hence allowing a four row QWERTY keypad, bringing a slightly enhanced typing experience to the table. The phone has a 5-megapixel camera, though unlike the N97 mini, it does not have Carl Zeiss optics. It also has a secondary camera in front for video calls. The Nokia C6-01 is the successor to the C6-00 featuring a major step-up with the new Symbian^3 operating system, Ovi Maps 3.0 and such but losing the QWERTY keyboard. All application and games for similar handsets like the N97, the N97 Mini, the 5800 Xpressmusic, and the 5230 will be compatible with this handset. Reviews Cnet UK wrote that 'The C6 suffers from the worst excesses of the N97's software, without the saving grace of its solid hardware, resulting in a phone that's disappointing at any price.' Cnet Asia wrote that though the user interface is slow and outdated. However, they like the improved connectivity features, free real-time navigation with Ovi Maps and the generally well-built chassis. T3 magazine said that 'This is a decent phone, but unlikely to convert anyone to Symbian, making it a handset for Nokia fans, with the priority of texting and emailing'. while techradar.com gave it three out of five stars and stated that while the phone had useful widgets and a nice screen that those features were countered by general usability frustrations. Stuff.TV also gave the phone three out of five stars and said that the C6 was an 'efficient enough phone' but felt outdated.

The genesis of the Council however, dates back to the erstwhile National Research Council (NRC), which was established by government in August 1958 to organize and coordinate scientific research in Ghana. In 1963, the NRC merged with the former Ghana Academy of Sciences, a statutory learned society. Following a review in 1966, the Academy was reconstituted into, essentially, its original component bodies, namely a national research organization redesignated the CSIR and a learned Society, designated the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. The distinctive features of the 1996 Act are the emphasis accorded private sector concerns, and the introduction of market principles into the Council's operations through the commercialization of research. In this connection, the Council is expected to generate part of its income through the sale of its products and services, and to institute a system of contract research. Mandate The CSIR is mandated to perform the following functions among others: *To pursue the implementation of government policies on scientific research and development; *To advise the sector Minister on scientific and technological advances likely to be of importance to national development; *To encourage coordinated employment of scientific research for the management, utilization and conservation of the natural resources of Ghana in the interest of development; *To encourage in the national interest scientific and industrial research of importance for development of agriculture, health, medicine, environment, technology and other service sectors and to this end to encourage close linkages with the productive sectors of the economy; *To coordinate all aspects of scientific research in the country and to ensure that the Council, the research institutes of the Council and other organizations engaged in research in Ghana, coordinate and cooperate in their research efforts; *To exercise control over the research institutes and projects of the Council and to have power after consultation with the Minister to create, reconstitute, merge or dissolve any institute, centre, unit or project of the Council; *To review, monitor and periodically evaluate the work of the institutes administered by the Council in order to ensure that research being carried out by the institute directly benefits identified sectors of the economy and is within the national priorities; * To institute a system of contract research to ensure that research being carried out in the Council is relevant and cost effective; * To encourage and promote the commercialization of research results; * To undertake or collaborate in the collation, publication and dissemination of the results of research and other useful technical information; * To organize and control services and facilities available to the Council and generally to manage the properties of the Council; *To coordinate human resource development in institutes of the Council and to encourage the training of scientific personnel and research workers through the provision of grants and fellowships; * To cooperate and liaise with international and local bodies and organizations, in particular, the Universities and the private sector on matters of research; and *To perform such other functions as may be determined by the Minister.

Neoterius is probably to be identified with the prefect who wanted to give the basilica Portiana of Milan to the Arians but who was opposed by the Nicene bishop Ambrose. In 390 he was Praetorian prefect of Gaul, as well as consul with the Emperor Valentinian II as colleague; this appointment can be seen as protecting Theodosius' interests in Gaul.Robert Malcolm Errington, Roman imperial policy from Julian to Theodosius, UNC Press, 2006, , p. 136. He knew Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, with whom he exchanged letters (he is the addressee of the letters 38-46 by Symmachus); according to these letters, Neoterius was alive in 393 and maybe in 398.

At that time, there were no similar organisations anywhere in the world . The Council itself consisted of some 60 members drawn from a wide range of bodies with an interest in education . This Council appointed a director and arranged for some basic funding to come from government local authorities, but the EIS provided free accommodation and secretarial assistance. For more than 20 years, most of the work was carried out by groups of teachers on a voluntary basis. Throughout these years and on into the 1980s Council staff and associates made distinguished contributions to educational research, often setting world standards.

They found worthy successors in later years — Maxwell, Fraser, Clark, Nisbet, Hope, Dockrell, Patricia Broadfoot, Spencer, John Raven, Ian Deary. In later years the Council's research programme came more and more under government control with the Council itself finally being disbanded and the few remaining staff moved to an all-but non-existent renamed Scottish Center for Educational research within the Faculty of Education of Glasgow University.

The aim of the operation was to break the two-month-long siege laid by armed cadres of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) around two companies of 5/8th Gorkha Rifles Infantry Battalion Group at Kailahun by effecting a fighting breakout and redeploying them with the main battalion at Daru. Background The Indian 5/8th Gorkha Rifles, 14th Mechanised Infantry and elements of the 23rd Mechanised Infantry, together designated as INDBATT-1, had been sent to Sierra Leone to aid the Government in the disarmament of the RUF rebels. Two rifle companies had been kept as a Quick Reaction Force. Elements of the 9th Para (SF), were also included. By mid- April 2000, two of the companies of INDBATT-1 were deployed in Kailahun, while the rest were deployed in Daru. On May 1, some elements of the RUF attacked and overran the KENBATT forces at Makeni. Due to a communication gap, the INDBATT-1 weren't informed, and some of their commanders at Kailahun, were captured the next day at a meeting with the RUF. Within ten days of this, some of the hostages were released due to intense pressure by INDBATT-1 and civilians; however some including the 2IC who had gone to negotiate remained in 'honourable custody', being allowed to return to the base everyday. The situation worsened and the RUF disarmed 500 Kenyan Peacekeepers, and began advancing towards Freetown. As panic broke out, British troops evacuated the civilian staff at Freetown. The INDBATT-1 QRF was launched to Magburaka, where more Kenyans had been besieged. They made a 180 kilometer advance, pushing back several ambushes, and rescuing the Kenyans. However the situation at Kailahun kept deteriorating, and the two companies of 5/8th Gorkha Rifles remained in their base surrounded by hundreds of RUF rebels of the 1st Brigade. For seventy-five days the RUF rebels negotiations were on to release the 2IC and his party which was achieved through Charles Taylor and Liberia. In the meanwhile additional forces ex India were built up to launch operations to seize control over nearly 100 km of jungle track to break the siege at Kailahun. Order of battle=RUF Forces The RUF rebels had six brigades, one of which were deployed in the sector. This brigade consisted of four main battalions, and one Strike Battalion. They were armed with AK-47s, RPGs, APCs, and SAMs. Each battalion was deployed in a particular area: *1st Battalion - Mobai *2nd Battalion - Kuiva *3rd Battalion - Neama *4th Battalion - Koindu *5th Battalion - Segbwema UNAMSIL Forces Indian: *INDBATT-1 - 5/8th Gorkha Rifles Battalion and elements of 14th Mechanised Infantry *QRC - A Quick Reaction Force formed by elements of INDBATT-1, alongside 23 Mechanised Infantry and 9 Para (SF) *INDMECH QRC - A Mechanised Infantry QRF *INDENG Coy-2 - A Company of 116 Engineer Regiment *INDSF Coy - A Team of 2nd Para (SF) *Indian Aviation Unit - 8 Mil Mi-8s, 3 Mil Mi-35s, 2 HAL Chetaks *INDBATT-2 - 18th Grenadiers Battalion *Independent Composite Battery - Mortars 120 mm from 310th Light Regiment, Light Field Gun (105 mm) from 255th Field Regiment Alongside these the Indians had set up a Sector HQ, Surgical HQ, and a Forward Surgical Team. Other: *GHANBATT - 2 Infantry Companies of the Ghana Army *NIBATT - 2 Companies of the Nigerian Army *RAF Aviation Unit: 2 Chinook Helicopters, 1 C-130 *Elements of D Squadron of the British SAS; These units guided the Aviation units during their tasks Plan of Operations The battle was planned to involve five phases: *Phase I: Mobilisation of UNAMSIL forces. *Phase II: Pre-emptive strikes by the helicopters, and breakout by the besieged forces at Kailahun. The UNAMSIL forces were to secure the area for a clear extraction. *Phase III: Link up of the besieged Kailahun column and Special Forces units at Giehun. 5/8 Gorkha Rifles (Daru column) to secure Pendembu. *Phase IV: Link up of Daru column and Kailahun column at Pendembu. Extraction to begin by air. *Phase V: All forces to fall back to Daru. Battle=Buildup Phase I of the operation was the buildup of forces. Between 13th and 15th, the UNAMSIL forces were assembled at Daru and Kenewa. The IAF and RAF Aviation units were critical in the buildup, especially at Daru, since the area was cut off from the rest of the UN controlled areas. By midnight, 14 July, the buildup was complete. The role of 2 Para (SF) The mission was conducted in a classical VUCA environment, in the absence of geographical information, using tourist maps and borrowing equipment from friendly nations. 2 Para (SF) collected valuable intelligence by conducting reconnaissance and inserting its commandos for 7 days at a stretch into the camp in disguise, prior to the launch of the operation, to map the area, carry out liaison and collect intelligence which enabled the planning and execution of what would become one of the most daring commando operations conducted by the Indian Army on foreign soil. The units at Kailahun were informed of the plan, and constantly kept in touch with the HQ through satellite phones. The operational plans were conveyed in Malayalam to overcome RUF monitoring of communications. Since the operation required insertion by helicopters, the two companies at Kailahun were required to fall back 500 metres from the town itself, and secure two helipads. On 15 Jul 0600h, before first light, 80 commandos from 2 Para (SF) were inserted into the enemy territory by two British Chinook helicopters. The air assault was carried out under adverse conditions, with heavy rain and poor visibility, and without air and artillery support which had to be withdrawn at the last minute due to the inclement weather. The flight time of 25 minutes was extended to 50 minutes and the team commander of 2 Para (SF) stuck to his commitment despite the danger of getting daylighted and having to fight without external support. 40 Commandos were inserted close to village Jimila (2514), and 34 Commandos were inserted at the Bandajuma track junction (2512), and the balance six commandos were inserted inside the hostage camp to enable the extrication of Military Observers and others. Last minute changes in plan and cancellation of MI-8 helicopters, meant that the young lieutenant of the Special Forces had to personally inform the change in plan and lead the break out column till the centre of the town. The use of SAS-supplied phosphorus grenades by 2 Para (SF) quickly laid waste the camp and denied any UN stores and supplies that would be left behind while the INDBATT companies conducted the breakout from falling into RUF hands. In the meanwhile, the 40 commandos encountering heavy resistance, from the RUF who were mobilised once the surprise was lost, cleared the road axis and successfully secured the town centre of Kailahun. At the same time, the second team, dropped at Bandajuma, split into two groups, while the first secured the track junction, the second went ahead to clear the axis till Kenewa. With the Chinooks safely taking off with the 11 Mil observers along with their equipment, the 6 commandos, led the break out of IND BATT with their BRDMs in close support behind them and affected a link with the 40 commandos at the town centre amidst fire from all directions. The move of the INDBATT breakout column was secured by the Special Force Commandos both at the Van and the Rear. This ensured that the tired hostages were kept safe from any possible assault from the now active enemy. The INDBATT column thus secured at both ends was now under hot pursuit from the RUF rebels and caught up with the rear of the foot column approximately 5 km south of Kailahun. 2 Para (SF), under the leadership of its second in command, started laying booby-traps along the road in the rear to start slowing down the rebel advance. The ensuing firefight resulted in major losses to the RUF after which they abandoned the chase. The weather cleared at 9:30 am, and the UN helicopters were now available for providing a much-required air support to the advancing column. The RUF Forces reorganised and taking advantage of dense jungle and knowledge of jungle tracks were constantly sniping at the rearguard, making the advance difficult and slow. The Indian MI-35 attack helicopter on the scene provided fire support to the advancing columns, making their advance much swifter. At 09:45 hours, the attack helicopters were tasked to provide covering fire to the Mi-8 helicopters and one company of 18th Grenadiers, part the INDBATT-2, were airlifted and dropped off north-east of Giehun, where they awaited the arrival of the Kailahun column. At approximately 10:20, nearly four hours ahead of schedule, 2 para (SF) affected a linkage with the 18th Grenadiers at Giehun (1807), which had landed there at around 10:00. The force commander landed at Geihun to congratulate the SF team commander for an excellent operation. After the airlift, the column reorganised and advanced towards Pendembu. They were faced with two major roadblocks along the road, the first was an 8-foot-deep ditch, and the second, a 4-foot-deep one, each covered by troops with small arms and RPGs. Continuous sniping and slushy roads hampered the progress, but the column secured the area, and using bridging stores carried in the column and dropped by the MI-8s, the units crossed the bridges, and continued on their way. Daru Column At 06:20, after the extraction of personnel at Kailahun, the INDBATT-2, INDMECH QRC (Mech-2 Company), and the rest of the 5/8th Gorkha Rifles (Mot-2 Company) at Daru, commenced their operations. The 18th Grenadiers, alongside Infantry Fighting Vehicles from the Mech-2, and aided by artillery bombardment, secured a firm base along the road. Immediately after securing the base, the Daru Column advanced along the road, with Mech-2 Company's IFVs leading the advance. At 08:30, the column came under heavy fire from the north of the road, 500 metres short of Tikono. The IFVs neutralised the enemy and continued. The unit faced heavy resistance at both Bewobu, and Kuiva, but broke through with ease. Though the plan originally called for a physical capture and search of Kuiva, the speed of the advance of the Kailahun column, indicated a possibility of a link-up and evacuation on the same day. So the Daru Column continued to advance quickly to Pendembu. Though the rebels had dug-in positions in the town, they fled in the face of small arms fire by the column, and supporting fire from nearby mortars. The column continued to move towards Area-3 bridges, suppressing enemy fire with their IFVs, while 9th Para, part of the battalion's QRC, was airlifted from Daru in 3 MI-8s, and secured the bridges in Area 3. Maintaining momentum, the column met up with the QRC forces near the bridges at 1230 hours, and continued onwards to Pendembu. Securing Pendembu The Daru column and the QRC reached Pendembu, and prepared to assault the town. It was the HQ of the RUF 1st Brigade, and heavily defended. At 1300 hours, an attack helicopter made five passes over the town strafing the defenders, and performed pinpoint engaging of the defenders in their entrenched positions. Meanwhile, the mortars relocated to a location north of the Area 3 bridges. Mot-2 Company was to attack and secure the nearly 300 houses of the town, as well as an air head to the south-west. Mech-2 moved in from the north, and neutralised all the targets, and occupied the northern side of the town. Mot-2 moved up and silenced the enemy positions in the south-west corner, using the IFVs, and then cleared the houses systematically with its riflemen. 4th Platoon of Mot-2, killed several rebels in the south-west pocket, and several more were killed in the armoury, cleared by 6th Platoon. A suitable airhead was established along the Daru-Pendembu road. All units linked up in the south- west corner, and reorganised into defensive positions for the evening. At about 1630 hours, the Daru Column personally led by the Commanding Officer of 5/8 Gurkha Rifles advanced through the jungle to link up with Kailahun column. A link up was established at 1730 hours, and the entire force was gathered back at Pendembu by 1900 hours. The units took up defensive positions around and inside Pendembu. Any attempts by the RUF to counter-attack were thwarted with accurate fire from the troops. The routes used by the RUF for reinforcements were constantly kept under surveillance by the scout helicopter. On two occasions regrouping militia were observed approaching Pendembu by the scout helicopter which directed the Mi-35 to carry out dissuading attacks on them using rockets and guns. Approach paths to the town were shelled by mortars and a 105 mm Light Field Gun throughout the night. Helilift Operations The next day, 16 July, at 700 hours, Mot-2 secured an airhead and also prepared a helipad as well as readjusted the defences to prepare for the forthcoming helilift extraction. At 815 hours, Mil Mi-8 helicopters began arriving to extract the units. In 12 sorties, Mech-1 Company, Mot-1 Company, SF Company, D Company of the 18th Grenadiers, and 2 Platoons of QRC Company were extracted. At 930 hours, 50-60 enemies were spotted to the north of the town and effectively neutralised by the attack helicopters directed by Adjutant-GLO of 5/8GR and MFC grouped with Mech 2 ICVs which also brought down heavy fire. The last MI-8s took off at 1030 hours. The Gurkha battalion pioneers demolished the selected RUF Bunkers, and the RUF ammunition store. Move to Daru After the last helicopter took off the remaining troops, consisting of Daru Column of 5/8th Gorkha Rifles, D-Company of the 18th Grenadiers, remaining QRC Companies, and the vehicles of the Kailahun Companies, began to make their way back to Daru, with Mot-2 in the lead. Mech-2 was to hold on to the northern edge of town, and then bring up the rear of the column, after a tactical disengagement. The column was constantly supported by one MI-35 helicopter at all times. After neutralising enemies at the bridges, the column reached Kuiva without incident. At Kuiva, the Mi-35 helicopter and the IFVs blind fired on any suspected enemy positions repeatedly to ensure the safety of the column. Despite the firm base being secured by 18th Grenadiers, the columns were ambushed near Kuiva. At 1400 hours, scout helicopters reported that the road between Kuiva and Bewabu had been dug up. The 18th Grenadiers secured the roadblock position, but the column had to be halted as they had stretched over too long a distance. At this time, one of the vehicles was attacked by an RPG. The Mi-35 operating overhead was immediately called upon to engage the ambushing militia. The riflemen and IFVs cleared any remainder ambushing forces. Under the cover of helicopter the column continued to advance towards Daru. At 1430 hours, near Bewabu, the leading IFVs came across a ditch, covered by heavy small arms fire from higher ground on both sides. The Commanding Officer realised that his troops were in the kill zone. He immediately sent 4 Rifle Platoon to engage the enemy targets. The firefight continued for fifteen minutes, and the MI-35 strafed enemies on both sides of the road. 6 Platoon and INDENG units bridged the gap, and the column immediately set off. While the 5/8th Gorkha Rifles engaged the enemy at Bewabu, the 18th Grenadiers about six kilometers behind, supported by 2 BMPs from Mech-2, and 2 BRDMs of Mech-1, were engaged by enemy units just short of Kuiva. The units fought the enemy for about ten minutes, and continued to advance. About 500 metres from here, a vehicle carrying ammunition was hit by an RPG. Once again the Mi-35 was called upon and it carried out a strafing run in the direction of attack. No further opposition was encountered after this. The casualty was evacuated by a Chetak. The convoy continued the rest of the way uneventfully. By 1730 hours, all the units had safely reached Daru. Aftermath The operation was a complete success. All the besieged forces were evacuated successfully, with one casualty. Operation Khukri was not a success simply in tactical terms. It was the worst defeat that the RUF has suffered in recent times, and was a tremendous boost to UNAMSIL morale. The Indian Forces were met with a rapturous welcome, as they marched triumphantly into Daru. The people of Sierra Leone helped build the Khukri War Memorial on the bank of the River Moa.  Popular culture  Red Chillies Entertainment, Dharma Productions, Azure Entertainment, and Flying Unicorn Entertainment are making a film based on Operation Khukri. Film will have Shah Rukh Khan, Ayushmann Khurrana, and Rajkummar Rao in lead roles.

Life Ahmed was born in Salford, England. She has a Pakistani father and English mother, and emigrated to Adelaide, Australia, with her family in the early 1970s. Key themes in her work, such as migration, orientation, difference, strangerness, and mixed identities, relate directly to some of these early experiences. She completed her first degree at Adelaide University and doctoral research at the Centre for Critical and Cultural Theory, Cardiff University. She now lives in the outskirts of Cambridge with her partner, Sarah Franklin, who is an academic at the University of Cambridge. Career Ahmed was based at the Institute for Women’s Studies at Lancaster University from 1994 to 2004, and is one of its former directors. She was appointed to the Department of Media and Communications at Goldsmiths College, University of London in 2004, and was the inaugural director of its Centre for Feminist Research, which was set up 'to consolidate Goldsmiths' feminist histories and to help shape feminist futures at Goldsmiths.' In spring 2009 Ahmed was the Laurie New Jersey Chair in Women’s Studies at Rutgers University and in Lent 2013 she was the Diane Middlebrook and Carl Djerassi Professor in Gender Studies at Cambridge University, where she conducted research on \\"Willful Women: Feminism and a History of Will\\". In 2015 she was the keynote speaker at the National Women's Studies Association annual conference. In 2016 Ahmed resigned from her post at Goldsmiths in protest over the alleged sexual harassment of students by staff there. She has indicated that she will continue her work as an independent scholar. She blogs at feministkilljoys, a project she continues to update. The blog is a companion to her book \\"Living a Feminist Life\\" (2017) that enables her to reach people; posts become chapters and the book becomes blogging material. The term \\"feminist killjoy\\" \\"became a communication device, a way of reaching people who recognized in her something of their own experience.\\" Theories=Intersectionality Intersectionality is essential to Ahmed's feminism. She states that \\"intersectionality is a starting point, the point from which we must proceed if we are to offer an account of how power works.\\" She agrees with hooks, stating that if we aim to end sexism etc., we must also look at the other things attached, like racism and colonial power which molded our current society. To Ahmed, intersectionality is how we \\"make a point of how we come into existence.\\" \\"How we can experience intersections,\\" though, can be \\"frustrating, exhausting, painful.\\" Intersectionality is important to Ahmed, as it defines her own feminism and sense of self: “I am not a lesbian one moment and a person of color the next and a feminist at another. I am all of these at every moment. And lesbian feminism of color brings this all into existence, with insistence, with persistence.” Diversity work Diversity work is one of Ahmed’s common topics. Included in many of her works, including Living a Feminist Life and On Being Included, it is a concept that makes tangible what it means to live a feminist life day to day in institutions. To Ahmed, diversity work is \\"[learning] about the techniques of power in the effort to transform institutional norms or in an effort to be in a world that does not accommodate our being.\\" Diversity work is not any one thing. It is the act of trying to change an institution, and also simply the act of existing in one when it was not meant for you. She draws upon her experiences as a woman of color in academia and the works of others, including Chandra Talpade Mohanty, M. Jacqui Alexander, and Heidi Mirza.  Lesbian feminism of color  To Ahmed, lesbian feminism of color is \\"the struggle to put ourselves back together because within lesbian shelters too our being was not always accommodated.\\" She draws upon the work of other lesbian feminists of color, like Cherie Moraga, Gloria Anzaldua, and Audre Lorde. These women have taken part in the effort to write\\"[themselves] into existence.\\" Ahmed sees the texts of these women and many others like them to be a \\"lifeline\\".  Killjoy feminism  To Ahmed, practicing feminism is integral to the embodiment of living a feminist life. Ahmed's Killjoy Manifesto feministkilljoy blog elucidate the tenets of living and practicing life through a feminist philosophy- while also creating space for sharing how these embodiments create tension in life experiences under systems of patriarchy and oppression.  Affect and Phenomenology  Sara Ahmed's work is deeply interested in both lived experience analysis and the analysis of affect or emotion. She often analyzes structures of emotion as social phenomena that dictate the way we lead our lives. For example, in \\"The Promise of Happiness,\\" she explores the way that happiness acts as \\"social pressure\\" to push individuals towards or away from certain experiences, objects, and behaviors. This intersects with her study of queerness in \\"Happy Objects\\" where she describes the experience of being a young queer person at a family dinner table being overlooked by ancestral photos of heterosexual nuclear families. Awards 2017, Ahmed received the Kessler Award for contributions to the field of LBGTQ studies from CLAGS, CUNY. Ahmed gave a talk, \\"Queer Use,\\" when accepting this award.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Y_P27vVAQ 2019, Ahmed was awarded an honorary doctorate from Malmö University, Sweden. She gave a lecture, \\"Feminists at Work: Diversity, Complaint, Institutions\\" as honorary doctor. Works Ahmed has been described as a prolific writer. One reviewer of her work commented, \\"Few academic writers working in the UK context today can match Sara Ahmed in her prolific output, and fewer still can maintain the consistently high level of her theoretical explorations.\\" Ahmed has written nine single-authored books.  Books  Vithetens Hegemoni (English Translation: The Hegemony of Whiteness) =Differences that Matter: Feminist Theory and Postmodernism= Published in 1998 by Cambridge University Press.Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Ahmed's main focus in this book revolves around the question \\"is or should feminism be modern or postmodern?\\" She reflects on what she feels postmodernism is doing to the world in different contexts. =Strange Encounters: Embodied Others in Post- Coloniality= Published in 2000 by Routledge. =The Cultural Politics of Emotion= Published in 2004 (with a second edition in 2014) by Edinburgh University Press. =Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others= Published in 2006 by Duke University Press. Ahmed often focuses on the subject of orientation and being orientated in space, especially in relationship to sexual orientation. In her book Queer Phenomenology: Orientation, Objects, Others Ahmed states that orientation refers to the objects and others that we turn to face as well as the space that we inhabit, and how it is that we inhabit that space. Ahmed brings together queer phenomenology as a way of conveying that orientation is situated in the lived experience. =The Promise of Happiness= Published in 2010 by Duke University Press.Durham: Duke University Press. This work was awarded the FWSA book prize in 2011 for \\"ingenuity and scholarship in the fields of feminism, gender or women’s studies\\".March 2012 FWSA Newsletter, p.7-8. In this book, Ahmed focuses on what it means to be worthy of happiness and how specific acts of deviation work with particular identities to cause unhappiness. She also focuses on how happiness is narrated and the idea of utilitarianism. =On Being Included: Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life= Published in 2012 by Duke University Press.Durham: Duke University Press In On Being Included, Ahmed \\"offers an account of the diversity world\\". She explores institutional racism and whiteness, and the difficulties diversity workers face in trying to overcome them in their institutions. =Willful Subjects= Published by Duke University Press in 2014.Durham: Duke University Press Ahmed focuses on the idea of willfulness as resistance. She adds that willfulness involves persistence in having been brought down. Ahmed's goal throughout this book was to \\"spill the container\\" as willfulness provides a container for perversion. =Living a Feminist Life= Published in 2017 by Duke University Press. Ahmed's blog, \\"feministkilljoys\\", was written at the same time as \\"Living a Feminist Life\\" (2017). As the title suggests, Ahmed explores feminist theory, and what it means on our everyday lives. One way this manifests is in diversity work, something to which she dedicated a third of the book. She also spends much of the book exploring the feminist killjoy, the feminist in action who takes up the call in their everyday life. In 2020, Duke University Press confirmed that Living a Feminist Life was their best-selling book of the previous decade. =What's the Use? On the Uses of Use= Published in 2019 by Duke University Press.Durham: Duke University Press. Ahmed gives the historical idea on the association of use with life and strength in the 19th century and how utilitarianism helped shape individuals through useful ends. She also explores how use comes with restricted spaces. Ahmed then explores the ideas for queer use.

It is comparable to other PDE4 inhibitors for its anti-inflammatory effects. It has been investigated for its applications to the treatment of conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma. It is a second generation compound that exhibits structural functionalities of the PDE4 inhibitors cilomilast and roflumilast. The structure for piclamilast was first elucidated in a 1995 European patent application. The earliest mention of the name \\"piclamilast\\" was used in a 1997 publication.  Pharmacology  Piclamilast functions through the selective inhibition of the four PDE4 isoforms (PDE4A-D). It shows no inhibition of the other PDEs. The PDE4 isoforms are especially important to inflammatory and immunomodulatory cells. They are the most common PDE in inflammatory cells such as mast cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, macrophages, and structural cells such as sensory nerves and epithelial cells. PDE4 hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to inactive adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Inhibition of PDE4 blocks hydrolysis of cAMP thereby increasing levels of cAMP within cells. cAMP suppresses the activity of immune and inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition in an induced chronic lung disease murine model was shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, attenuate pulmonary fibrin deposition and vascular alveolar leakage, and prolong survival in hyperoxia- induced neonatal lung injury. A study of PDE4 inhibition in a murine model of allergic asthma showed that piclamilast significantly improves the pulmonary function, airway inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia.  Side effects  Vomiting is the most commonly cited side effect of piclamilast. It has proven difficult to separate the emetic side effects from the therapeutic benefits of several PDE4 inhibitors, including piclamilast.

The MacMillan Press (London & Basingstoke), p. 231 (1994, ). Howell achieved fame with her symphonic poem Lamia (inspired by the Keats poem) which Sir Henry Wood premiered at The Proms on 10 September 1919. Wood directed Lamia again that same week, on 13 September 1919. He subsequently conducted Lamia again in the 1921, 1923, 1924, 1926, 1930 and 1940 Proms seasons, but in subsequent years Lamia was neglected, until its revival in the 2010 season of The Proms. It received a centenary performance at the Proms in 2019.Prom 46: City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (2019) Howell dedicated Lamia on its 1921 publication to Wood.Burton, Anthony, Programme Notes for Prom 68, 116th Season of The Henry Wood Promenade Concerts, 5 September 2010. Among other compositions by Howell, Wood conducted Koong Shee in 1921, her Piano Concerto in 1923 and 1927 with the composer herself as pianist on both occasions, and The Rock in 1928. He was scheduled to conduct the first performance of Three Divertissements in 1940, but the concert was cancelled owing to The Blitz. Her Air, Variations & Finale for oboe, violin & piano (1949) can be obtained from June Emerson Wind Music (E620). Three Divertissements, Howell's last known orchestral work, did not receive its premiere until the 1950 Elgar Festival in Malvern. Howell won the Cobbett Prize in 1921 for her Phantasy for violin and piano. She received the nickname of the \\"English Strauss\\" in her lifetime. Wood attempted to recruit Howell to his conducting class at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in 1923, but she instead became a teacher at the RAM in 1924. During World War II, she served with the Women's Land Army. She taught at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire from 1950–57. She retired from the RAM in 1970, and after her retirement, continued to teach students privately. She died in Malvern, aged 83. Howell tended the grave of Sir Edward Elgar for several years, and herself is buried near Elgar. Her music has been recorded commercially on the Dutton Digital and Harlequin labels. The Cameo Classics label recorded Lamia in 2008 with Marius Stravinsky conducting the first modern recording of Howell's orchestral music with the Karelia Symphony Orchestra.

Built between 1878 and 1881, the fort is part of the Séré de Rivières system of fortifications built in the late 19th century. It has been rehabilitated as a contemporary artists' community. The Fort en Jazz festival is held there each year.http://www.mairie-francheville69.fr/vc_page38.php page de la mairie sur le fort  Concept and design  The Fort de Bruissin is located about to the southeast of the center of Lyon. Lyon's original protective ring of forts was built in the 1830s at a distance from the city just beyond the range of the artillery of the era, thus denying a potential attacker the means to bombard Lyon. With the introduction of rifled artillery, the range increased, placing the city once again into jeopardy. In the 1870s a second ring of forts was built farther out to deal with the extended range of artillery. Work on the second ring of eighteen forts was complete by 1893. The Fort du Bruissin was number 13 in the Army's numerical designation of the forts of Lyon. The Fort de Bruissin is a six-sided polygon, with masonry walls surrounded by a defended ditch. The most striking feature of the fort is its entry court, reached through a gatehouse at the head of a bridge over the ditch. A two- level vaulted barracks faces the gatehouse across the court, covered with earth. A terrace or cavalier on top of the barracks was shielded by an earth rampart. The fort was primarily armed with a mixture of 155mm and 120mm guns. located on the cavalier within the walls of the fort. Close-in defense was provided by revolving cannons in large caponiers at the corners of the fort, reached by subterranean passages. The fort was initially manned by 294 men, serving a total of thirty artillery pieces.  History  The Fort du Bruissin is part of the second ring of the fortifications of Lyon. During World War I the fort was a training center for future officers. During World War II, the fort was occupied by the Germans, who used it as an ammunition depot and headquarters. In 1981 the fort was sold to the commune of Francheville. In 1988 the entry was renovated, followed by the barracks in 1989. In 1991 the fort became a community of contemporary artists. It has been the home of the Fort en Jazz festival since 1990.  Arts center  The fort now functions as a center for visual and performing arts. The grounds are a community park and nature preserve. Approximately 3000 square meters of space is available within the fort, with about 800 square meters of exhibition space. A venue for the performing arts is located behind the barracks, to accommodate up to 2000 spectators.

He is a survivor of Buchenwald concentration camp, where he helped save the life of Stefan Jerzy Zweig (through causing the death of a Romani boy named Willi Blum), among others.  Biography = Youth, war and the early Weimar years  Siewert was born the son of a carpenter in Schwersenz, Province of Posen, German Empire (today Swarzędz, Poznań County in Poland). He learned the trade of masonry and became a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1906. From 1908 to 1915, he worked as a bricklayer in Switzerland, where he got to know Vladimir Lenin and Heinrich Brandler. Siewert was a soldier during the First World War, serving on the eastern front, while also working for the Spartacist League. In 1918, he was a member of the Soldiers' Council of the 10th Army. After that, he became a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1919, Siewert was the district political leader in the Ore Mountains and in 1919 and 1920, he was a delegate to the party congress and then secretary to the unification congress when the KPD merged with the USPD. He was elected to the Central Committee at the KPD congresses in 1921 and 1923. In 1922, he was a delegate to the Fourth World Congress of the Communist International and he joined the leadership of the KPD publishers. He became the political leader in Chemnitz in 1923. Siewert's political position was between the \\"Brandlerists\\" and the \\"middle group/conciliators,\\" which led in 1924 to his being relieved of his party functions and being sent to Berlin, where he was only allowed to handle minor party responsibilities. Working with Hans Beck, he organized a workers' delegation to go to the Soviet Union. Later, he worked as editor of Einheit (Unity) magazine, which was oriented toward left-leaning Social Democrats. In 1926, Siewert was elected to the Saxon Landtag, where he served till 1929.  Opposition to the Stalinization of the KPD  Siewert's position as a \\"Brandlerist\\" in opposition to the growing Stalinization of the KPD caused him to be relieved of all party responsibilities in 1928, and on 14 January 1929 he was expelled from the KPD. Siewert became an active functionary of the Communist Party Opposition (KPO) and a member of the district leadership of West Saxony. He held his seat in the Saxon parliament as one of the five members of the KPO faction. From 1931 to 1936, he worked as business manager of the newspaper Arbeiterpolitik (Labor Policy), first in Leipzig and then in Berlin. From 1933 till his arrest in late 1934, he was part of the initial national leadership of the KPO with Erich Hausen and Fritz Wiest.Theodor Bergmann, Gegen den Strom. Die Geschichte der KPD (Opposition). Hamburg (2001)  Resistance to Nazism  Siewert was charged by the Nazis with high treason and sentenced at the Volksgerichtshof to three years at hard labor in a Zuchthaus. After serving his term in Luckau, rather than being released, he was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. There, he moved politically toward the KPD and became involved in the leadership of the underground resistance at the camp. He often took a stand for Jewish prisoners and for the imprisoned children and he organized a class to teach bricklaying to Polish and Jewish children,Gisela Karau, Der gute Stern des Janusz K. - Eine Jugend in Buchenwald, (1994) Verlag 1900, Berlin. an act that saved the lives of many. In late August 1944, Siewert gave a speech at an illegal memorial organized by Willi Bleicher for Ernst Thälmann, who had recently been executed by the Nazis. As a result, he was subjected to reprisals and was under growing threat of execution, when the camp was liberated in April 1945.  After 1945, political repression  After the war, Siewert rejoined the KPD and began in Halle (Saale) with the rebuilding of the KPD in the Province of Saxony. By July 1945, he was being rejected by the secretariat of the SED Central Committee because of his KPO activities and he was replaced as district party leader. Nonetheless, he was able to become the first vice president of the Province of Saxony and later, Minister of the Interior of Saxony-Anhalt. In 1950, the SED began launching campaigns against the one-time members of the KPO, initiating repressive measures against Siewert and others. Siewert was demoted as Minister and installed in a minor position within the Ministry.Bill Niven, The Buchenwald child: truth, fiction, and propaganda Camden House (2007) Retrieved April 15, 2010 Furthermore, he was forced to write a self- critical article in Neuen Deutschland (New Germany), which was published on 25 January 1950. A few weeks later, on 15 March, it was labeled \\"inadequate\\" and he was forced to write another, even more self-critical article. One issue was the Central Party Control Commission'sThe \\"Central Party Control Commission\\", similar to its Soviet counterpart, was the disciplinary organ of the SED, responsible for the unity and purity of the KPD. Working with other agencies, it had the power to sanction, reprimand, punish, expel and rehabilitate (even posthumously) individuals who were accused of \\"revisionism\\", disloyalty and other political \\"crimes\\". view that the KPO had not become an agent of financial capitalism, but rather had been one from the beginning.  Rehabilitation  After Stalin's death and the revelation of his crimes, the SED was \\"destalinized\\" and Siewert was rehabilitated. He was recognized with a number of national awards. He remained employed in the Ministry of Construction and was active in the leadership of the GDR's Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime. Siewert died on 2 November 1973 in Berlin and was laid to rest in the \\"Pergolenweg\\" of the Memorial to the Socialists at the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde. The official SED obituary called him one of the \\"closest comrades of Ernst Thälmann,\\" founder of the KPD. Three official memorial brochures omitted any mention of his leadership or activity in the KPO.

It belongs to the V. doreanus group of the subgenus Euprepiosaurus. Taxonomy Two subspecies have been described:EOL *V. d. doreanus (Meyer, 1874) *V. d. finschi (Bohme, Horn & Zeigler, 1994) The latter has since been elevated to full-species status as Varanus finschi. Once considered a member of the V. indicus species complex, it now forms its own species complex with V. finschi, V. semotus, and V. yuwonoi, having diverged from the V. indicus species complex 5.8 million years ago. The V. doreanus species complex formed at most 4.1 million years ago. V. doreanus is the most basal and widespread member of this species complex. Distribution This species can be found throughout New Guinea, New Britain, the Bismarck Archipelago, Biak, Salawati, and Waigeo. The blue-tailed monitor is also found on mainland Australia on the tip of the Cape York Peninsula. It inhabits rainforest areas, dry streambeds, and riparian zones. Description The blue-tailed monitor can reach a total length (including the tail) up to 135 cm. The body is greyish-blue in colour and covered with round ocelli. The throat is whitish and strongly marbled. The tail shows clearly a double keel. The tail is light blue (hence the common name of this species), which is interrupted by black cross bands. In adults this color partially fades away. Scales on its neck are smooth and oval. It has a yellow tongue, which is a shared characteristic of the V. doreanus species complex. Ecology Like other monitors of the V. doreanus species complex, the blue-tailed monitor feeds on a relatively high amount of vertebrate prey such as birds, especially when compared to other monitors of the subgenus Euprepriosaurus. It will also feed on invertebrates such as beetles. Like many monitor lizards, males fight over females and territory by standing on their hindlegs and grappling with each other. In Australia, they are predated on by black-headed pythons. It is sympatric with the mangrove monitor and the peach-throated monitor in many parts of its range.

History  Beaurepaire was owned by the Brocas family from Aquitaine for approximately 500 years. In the 14th century, Sir John Brocas was Edward III's Master of the Horse. In 1369, Edward permitted John's son, Bernard, to enclose the parkland and create the Beaurepaire estate. As a knight, Bernard was favoured by Edward, the Black Prince, and accompanied him during the Battle of Poitiers. Bernard later became Chief Surveyor and Sovereign Warden of the parks at Winchester College; he was acquainted with the college's founder, William of Wykeham. The house suffered considerable damage during the Civil War and was later rebuilt in 1777. The house is moated with access over small bridges: the white iron gates to the main bridge were designed by Sir John Soane.  Recent history  The estate was sold by the Brocas family in 1873. In 1942, the building was largely destroyed by fire. The Tudor wing, however, survived. The owner at the time of the fire, Sir Strati Ralli, was unable to restore or repair the house due to wartime restriction of building materials. In 1959, the house was bought by Roger Makins, 1st Baron Sherfield who lived in nearby Sherfield. Makins commissioned Tom Bird (an architect who worked at the offices of Maxwell Fry) to restore the building. The building was further renovated by Makins's son, Dwight, who added a cloister garden with battlements and crow-stepped gables. In the early 21st century, the estate was put up for sale. The estate was broken into lots, aiming to attract offers of £3.4 million for the house and immediate grounds, or offers exceeding £7 million for the full estate of .

He is primarily noted for his connection to William Shakespeare. Life He attended Oriel College, Oxford, from which he matriculated on 4 December 1612 at the age of 16. He received his B.A. on 23 October 1615, his M.A. on 10 July 1618, and a Bachelor of Divinity sometime afterwards. Thereafter, on 8 July 1621, he became vicar of Bishop's Itchington, and three years later, on 24 January 1623 married Anne Lees of nearby Lighthorne (d.1636),Alan H. Nelson and Paul H.

Altrocchi, M.D. \\"Searching for the Oxfordian ‘Smoking Gun’ in Elizabethan Letters,\\" in The Oxfordian, Volume VIII 2005 pp.110-122, note p.114 and a lifelong subscriber to the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, according to which the works of Shakespeare were actually written by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, in 2003 made what the mainstream Elizabethan scholar Alan H. Nelson of Berkeley University termed \\"one of the most important Shakespeare discoveries of recent years\\"; Altrocchi noted in a copy of the 1590 edition of William Camden's Britannia, that turned out to be Richard Hunt's, an annotation which read: *et Gulielmo Shakespear Roscio planè nostro (and to William Shakespeare, manifestly our Roscius). The periphrastic eponym Roscius here is an allusion to the great Roman actor Quintus Roscius Gallus, and was applied at the time by John Weever (1599) and Thomas Fuller (1662) to Edward Alleyn, and by William Camden to Richard Burbage. It was variously applied to actors like Richard Tarlton and William Ostler, the latter by John Davies of Hereford. There is one instance of it referring to playwrights, Ben Jonson and William Davenant. Nelson and Altrocchi conclude: :: > Having set out the facts to the best of our ability, we leave it to others > to debate whether Richard Hunt characterizes Shakespeare of Stratford-upon- > Avon (following the majority of citations) as a memorable actor, or > (following Pecke) as a man of the theater or indeed as a playwright.'Alan H. > Nelson, Paul H. Altrocchi, ‘William Shakespeare, “Our Roscius” in > Shakespeare Quarterly, Volume 60, Number 4, Winter 2009, pp. 460-469, p.469. This marginal entry clearly showed that the book's owner, Richard Hunt, associated Stratford on Avon's fame, not only to John of Stratford, the Archbishop of Canterbury and a London magistrate Hugh Clopton, as Camden had written in 1590, but also to the actor of the London stage, William Shakespeare, who in various versions of the Oxford alternative authorship theory had been dismissed as either no more than an illiterate Stratfordian grain-merchant and real-estate speculator, or a London frontman for de Vere's plays. For Altrocchi, this meant that Richard Hunt had fallen for a hoax devised to monstrously deny to de Vere his authorship of the plays.Paul H.Altrocchi ‘Sleuthing an enigmatic Latin annotation,\\" in \\"Shakespeare Matters\\", Summer 2003 pp.16-19 For Nelson, it constitutes yet one more solid proof that Shakespeare of Stratford was known by learned neighbours to be the same man as the great London actor and playwright, and he adds that \\"[i]t would take an individual of great courage to claim that an Oxford-educated vicar born in 1596 was so deceived.\\"Alan H.Nelson, ‘William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon: \\"our Roscius\\",’ 14 August 2003 Katherine Duncan-Jones had recently suggested that Hunt's mention of Shakespeare as Stratford's third notable may reflect a possibility that his theatrical fame had contributed to the town's mercantile prosperity, through literary pilgrimages.Katherine Duncan-Jones, \\"Shakespeare, the Motley Player,\\" in The Review of English Studies, Oxford University Press 2009 p.729.

The armour got its name from Kanchan Bagh,http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?ftid=0x3bcba29d6e18be0d:0x4581fdc1badae0c0&q;=Kanchan+Bagh,+Hyderabad≷=uk&ei;=tgLgS7rKJ4eD_Aaf1bmcCA&sll;=17.333092,78.506447&sspn;=0.021303,0.032015&ie;=UTF8≪=17.335471,78.501617&spn;=0,0&t;=h&z;=17&iwloc;=A Hyderabad, Telangana, where the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) is located. Although the construction details of the armour remain a secret, it has been described as being made by sandwiching composite panels between rolled homogeneous armour (RHA). The number of layers may vary based on the user requirements. This armour is able to defeat armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) and high-explosive anti-tank warhead (HEAT) rounds and is known to defeat armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS).Kanchan armor, frontierindia.net During development in the 1980s, Kanchan armour defeated a 106 mm recoilless rifle which was tried on the Arjun Tank. During trials in 2000, the armour was able to withstand hits from T-72 tank at point blank range, and defeated all available high-explosive squash head (HESH) and APFSDS rounds, which included Israeli APFSDS rounds.Arjun (tank)#Protection This armour is lightweight and compact. A new honeycomb structure design of non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour (NERA) is reportedly being tested on Arjun tanks .http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/arjun-mk-ii.htm Protection When a projectile is fired, the armour stops it via compression and decompression method. As the projectile hits the armour, it faces compression because of the RHA, and then it faces decompression because of the composite. When the projectile passes through several such sandwiched layers, it breaks up those projectiles. Composition In the 1980s the Kanchan composite had a composition of ceramic, aluminium oxide, fibreglass and some other such materials mixed. The Kanchan composite tried out had two thicknesses, i.e. a plate and a plate. However these two plates had the same weight as a RHA. Hence it is said that Kanchan armour is more volume at same weight. Anti-tank munitions have problems in penetrating such materials.http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?89961-Indian- Armed-Forces/page108 Kanchan armour composition has undergone massive changes since the 1980s. The volume of the RHA has been reduced to lesser mass because of better metallurgy. The composite has evolved too and it does not use the 1980s technology any more.

The building closest to Drammensveien, was built by the Germans in 1926, and drawn by Oscar Hoff. After the conclusion of World War II, the building was seized by the Norwegian government and made available for the Soviet Union.  The Embassy building  The complex of buildings of the Russian Embassy is located on an area of 11.5 hectares and since 1946, it is on an indefinite rent. Since 1924, started the history of the complex of buildings of the diplomatic mission of Russia in Norway, when diplomatic relations were established between the USSR and Norway. It was the time when the premises located in a house on 22A, Incognitogata Street, were allocated to the needs of the USSR Embassy. In June 1940, Norway was occupied by fascist Germany and diplomatic relations with the USSR were interrupted. After the end of the World War II in 1946, the diplomatic relations at the embassy level were restored and two buildings along Drammensween Street 74 were allocated for the premises of the USSR Embassy. Before that, the diplomatic representation of Germany was located in these buildings for 20 years. One of the buildings, a mansion with an area of 0.9 thousand m², was designed in the middle of the 19th century by the famous German architect Wilhelm von Hanno, commissioned by the State General and Marshal of the royal court Frederic Neser. In 1885, the house was bought by Norwegian W. E. Kier, one of the five sons of a wealthy timber merchant H. Kiera, and was inherited for 40 years. The interior of the building, despite a series of rearrangements, was largely preserved in its original form. Currently, the Embassy’s protocol events are held in this building.

It denies TCP/IP access to registered IP addresses by using the ipfw packet filter. It targets spam prevention, but may also be used against other attackers (e.g. brute force password crackers.) The rate limiting approach This approach leverages the superior determination exhibited by legitimate senders. In this respect, it may be considered similar to greylisting. Originally, the authors conceived an MT Proxy to rate-limit the SMTP connections of messages believed to be spam. That worked by adding a dummynet rule for frequent senders who had been sending messages that triggered an unreliable statistical analysis. A key limitation of the original scheme was the consumption of local resources (in the SMTP proxy). Stockade approach introduces the notion that an inbound TCP connection may be rejected with some random probability proportional to the level of spam already seen from the connection’s originator over some configurable period of time. That probability is subject to a decay, configured as a halving time period, so that each IP address is eventually rehabilitated. That way, stockade provides for fully automatic spam mitigation.

The quaestor sacri palatii (, usually simply ), in English: Quaestor of the Sacred Palace, was the senior legal authority in the late Roman Empire and early Byzantium, responsible for drafting laws. In the later Byzantine Empire, the office of the quaestor was altered and it became a senior judicial official for the imperial capital, Constantinople. The post survived until the 14th century, albeit only as an honorary title. Late Roman quaestor sacri palatii The office was created by Emperor Constantine I (), with the duties of drafting of laws and the answering of petitions addressed to the emperor. Although he functioned as the chief legal advisor of the emperor and hence came to exercise great influence, his actual judicial rights were very limited.. Thus from 440 he presided, jointly with the praetorian prefect of the East, over the supreme tribunal in Constantinople which heard appeals (the so-called causae sacrae, since these cases were originally heard by the emperor) from the courts of the diocesan vicarii and the senior provincial governors of spectabilis rank. According to the Notitia Dignitatum, the quaestor held the rank of vir illustris and did not have a staff (officium) of his own, but was attached a number of aides (adiutores) from the departments of the sacra scrinia.Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Orient. XII and Pars Occident. X. In the mid-6th century, by law their number was fixed at 26 adiutores: twelve from the scrinium memoriae and seven each from the scrinium epistolarum and the scrinium libellorum, although in practice these numbers were often exceeded. Perhaps the most notable quaestor was Tribonian, who contributed decisively to the codification of Roman law under Emperor Justinian I (). The office continued in Italy even after the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, as first Odoacer and then the Ostrogothic kings retained the position, which was occupied by members of the Roman senatorial aristocracy like Cassiodorus. Byzantine quaestor As part of his reforms, in 539 Emperor Justinian I created another office named quaestor or alternatively quaesitor (Greek: κυαισίτωρ) who was given police and judicial powers in Constantinople, and also tasked with the supervision of new arrivals to the imperial capital. By the turn of the 9th century, the original quaestor had lost most of his former duties to other officials, chiefly the logothetēs tou dromou and the epi tōn deēseōn. The functions of the middle Byzantine quaestor were essentially those of the quaesitor: he was one of the kritai (\\"judges\\") of Constantinople. However, as John B. Bury notes, an examination of his subordinate staff, and the fact that it could be held by a eunuch, shows that the later office was the direct continuation of the quaestor sacri palatii. His duties involved: the supervision of travellers and men from the Byzantine provinces who visited Constantinople; the supervision of beggars; jurisdiction on complaints from tenants against their landlords; the supervision of the capital's magistrates; jurisdiction over cases of forgery. Finally, he had an extensive jurisdiction over wills: wills were sealed with the quaestor's seal, opened in his presence, and their execution supervised by him. The 9th-century quaestor ranked immediately after the logothetēs tou genikou in the lists of precedence (34th in Philotheos's Klētorologion of 899). The post survived into the late Byzantine period, although by the 14th century, nothing had remained of the office save the title, which was conferred as an honorary dignity, ranking 45th in the imperial hierarchy. Subordinate officials Unlike the late Roman official, the middle Byzantine quaestor had an extensive staff: *The antigrapheis (, \\"copyists\\"), the successors of the old magistri scriniorum, the heads of the sacra scrinia under the magister officiorum. The term antigrapheus was used for these officials already in Late Antiquity, and they are explicitly associated with the quaestor in the preparation of legislation in the Ecloga (circa 740). Otherwise, their functions in the quaestor's office are unknown. John B. Bury suggests that the magister memoriae, who inter alia had the task of replying to petitions to the Byzantine emperor, evolved into the epi tōn deēseōn, while the magister libellorum and the magister epistolarum became the (two?) antigrapheis. *The skribas (σκρίβας), the direct successor of the scriba, a notary attached to the late antique official known as magister census, who was responsible for wills. When the quaestor absorbed the latter office, the skribas came under his control. It is known from legislation that the skribas represented the quaestor in supervising the provisions of wills as regards minors. *The skeptōr (σκέπτωρ), evidently a corruption of the Latin term exceptor, hence also the direct continuation of the exceptores, a class of officials of the sacra scrinia. *The libelisios (λιβελίσιος), again deriving from the libellenses of the sacra scrinia. *A number of kankellarioi (καγκελλάριοι, from Latin cancellarii) under a prōtokankellarios (πρωτοκαγκελλάριος).

The Secretary-General had reported on human rights violations in Srebrenica, Žepa, Banja Luka and Sanski Most and found evidence of executions, rape, mass expulsion, arbitrary detention, forced labour and disappearances. The Council pointed out that persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) established in Resolution 827 (1993) would not to be able to participate in elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. All violations of international humanitarian law were strongly condemned, particularly those committed by Bosnian Serbs, as there was evidence that a large number of men from Srebrenica were executed by them. The Council demanded that international organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross had access to prisoners, refugees and displaced persons. Violations of humanitarian law and human rights in Srebrenica, Žepa, Banja Luka and Sanski Most from July to October 1995 would be fully investigated by relevant agencies of the United Nations and other organisations. It was noted that the ICTY had issued indictments against Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić for crimes committed against Bosnian Muslims. The Bosnian Serb party was demanded that it give immediate and unrestricted access to the region for purposes of investigation. All parties, especially the Bosnian Serbs, had to preserve the evidence without destroying or hiding it, and it was demanded that all detention centres be closed.

She escaped during the 1943 uprising, hid in Poland, and survived the war. Engel-Wijnberg immigrated to the United States from Israel with her family in 1957, settling in Branford, Connecticut. She returned to Europe again only to testify against the war criminals of Sobibor. In 2010 she was in the Netherlands to receive the governmental honor of Knight in the Order of Oranje-Nassau. Early life Wijnberg was born into a Jewish family in Groningen, Netherlands. She was raised in Zwolle, where her parents owned and managed the Hotel Wijnberg. There she attended local schools. Five days before Wijnberg turned 18, the Germans invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. They soon began persecution of Jews. In September 1942 Wijnberg first hid in Utrecht, and later in De Bilt. Holocaust years While hiding she used the name \\"Greetje van den Berg\\". She was rounded up by Nazi forces on 18 December 1942. Two months later she was transferred to Camp Vught, then to the transit Camp Westerbork, and finally deported to Sobibor extermination camp on 9 April 1943, along with 2019 other Jewish men, women and children. She survived the selection at arrival, and was assigned to the arbeitshaftlinge unit in Lager II. There she was forced to sort the clothes of gas chamber victims so that they could be sent to German civilians disguised as charitable donations. When guards were looking the other way, she would surreptitiously slash fine items to prevent them from being of use. In the sorting barracks Wijnberg met her future husband, Chaim Engel (10 January 1916 – 4 July 2003), a Polish Jew from Brudzew, who was six years her senior. They were able to communicate in German. He helped her survive; for instance, when she contracted typhus and was weakened, he carried her to the latrines and helped her rest when the guards weren't looking. During the revolt in Sobibor on 14 October 1943, Wijnberg and Engel escaped together. She provided Chaim with a knife, with which he stabbed a Nazi guard, and the couple fled under gunfire through the main gate and into the forest. They found shelter with two Polish farmers, named Adam and Stefka, a married couple, whom they paid for hiding them. They survived for nine months in a barn's hayloft until the retreat of Nazi Germany from occupied Poland in July 1944 during Operation Bagration, the Red Army counter-offensive. By that time, Selma was pregnant. The couple married, and they journeyed through Poland via Chełm and Parczew, where their son Emiel was born, then to Lublin. They crossed the Ukraine by train to Chernivtsi and to Odessa, and soon left by boat for Marseille, France. Chaim had to be smuggled aboard the ship, because Poles were not allowed to come to Europe. Because of this, Selma was nervous, and couldn't give any breastmilk to her son Emiel. She went to the kitchen, and asked for milk. She got given 'very heavy creamy milk', which she fed to her son. Because of this, the child got ill, and died within 24 hours. His body was buried at sea near Naxos. From Marseille, the couple traveled north by train to Zwolle and returned to Selma's parents' home, Hotel Wijnberg, in the Netherlands. After the Second World War In the Netherlands Chaim and Selma married again on 18 September 1945. The police of Zwolle decided that Selma, by marrying Engel, a Pole, had lost her citizenship and become a Polish citizen. The couple could not be returned to Poland because the latter's government no longer accepted the return of Polish citizens expelled from foreign countries. Officials decided against interning the Engels in a displaced persons camp for foreigners near Valkenswaard because the holding center was full, and Wijnberg was a Dutch native. While they lived in Zwolle, Engel-Wijnberg gave birth to two more children, a son and a daughter. They set up a velvet fabric and fashion store. In a 2015 interview, she said she and Chaim hated the Netherlands for their treatment after the war, when they tried to deprive her of her nationality and intended to deport them. The family made aliyah (migrated to Israel) in 1951, where they moved several times. However, Engel did not feel comfortable there, so in 1957 they decided to emigrate to the United States. They settled in Branford, Connecticut. They returned to Europe only to testify against the war criminals of Sobibor. On 12 April 2010, Minister Ab Klink apologized to Engel-Wijnberg for her treatment after the war, on behalf of the Dutch government, during the Westerbork Camp remembrance ceremony. Despite rejecting the apology, Engel- Wijnberg accepted the government's honor of Knight in the Order of Oranje- Nassau. This occasion was the first time since she had left in 1951 that she returned to the Netherlands.Officiële excuses voor Sobibor-overlevende, nos.nl, 8 April 2010.

The temple is famed for its Pooram festival held during February / March every year.

Just aside the Thrissur - Shoranur Railway line, amidst the paddy fields and surrounded by a chain of highlands and hills, the temple compound forms a rather arena-like stage where the Pooram and its associated features such as elephant procession, fireworks, percussion orchestra etc. would be held. Despite the fact that the temple is rather small in size compared to its counterparts in Kerala and that it is located at an isolated rural part of the district, during the festival season, the temple and the village raises to media attraction and news fame.  The festival Uthralikavu pooram The Uthralikkavu festival is conducted during early summer every year. The festival flag-hoisting (kodiyettam കൊടിയേറ്റം) takes place on the second Tuesday of Kumbha (കുംഭമാസം), the month of the Malayalam Kollam era. (This is the same day that another important local festival, Machad Mamangam(മച്ചാട് മാമാങ്കം), takes place. Towards the end of following seven days, on next Tuesday, as part of the valedictory functions, the actual Pooram is conducted. Pooram is a Kerala Hindu ritual festival in which generally caparisoned elephants are led in a controlled and organized procession. At Uthralikkavu Pooram, three teams, each from neighboring village temples Enkakkad, Kumaranellur and Wadakanchery participate. Each team normally presents seven to eleven elephants, all decorated with traditional trunk masks (netippaTTam നെറ്റിപ്പട്ടം), shields (aalavaTTamആലവട്ടം) and fans(veNchaamaram വെൺചാമരം). The elephant positioned at the middle will also have a large plaque (thiTamp തിടമ്പ് or kOlam കോലം)on its top which represents the deity. There are many festivals in kerala used to celebrate like this. Some of them are Thrissur Pooram, Nenmara Vallangi Vela, Arattupuzha pooram, chinakathur pooram etc. Apart from the elephant procession, at Uthralikkavu, there also held are Kuthira Vela (a procession with wooden horse) and a variety of such other events dedicated by various communities. One of the crucial components of pooram is the set of percussion orchestra (Panchavadyam, Melam etc.). Particularly, 'naTappura' (നടപ്പുര) panchavadyam is a noteworthy session of percussion performance by the leading Panchavadyam artists of Central Kerala.https://www.webindia123.com/user_interaction/asp/article/article.asp?a_no=3189&article;=Uthralikavu+Pooram+%7C+An+Annual+Temple+Festival+Celebrated+With+Pomp+And+Gaiety%21+ ;Fireworks It is the second biggest fireworks after Nenmara Vallangi Vela. The most spectacular show during the Pooram is the magnificent and thunderous fireworks that takes place twice. One during the evening 4 pm on the pooram day and the other during the early morning hours of succeeding day (typically at 4:00 am). The fireworks is of a class of its own among such fireworks shows of Kerala temple festivals. The peculiar landscape (of being a low valley surrounded by many hills) adds extra reverberation and reinforcement to the already well-engineered explosive sounds produced. The show is enjoyed by tens of thousands of people gathered from various parts of the state. Nenmara Vallangi Vela is also celebrated like poorams and it is famous for the fireworks (Vedikkettu).https://www.manoramaonline.com/district- news/thrissur/2020/02/26/thrissur-uthralikkavu-pooram.html References Category:Festivals in Thrissur district Category:Elephant festivals in Kerala ","title":"Uthralikavu Pooram"},{"id":"26953169","text":"Zhanakala (, Jańaqala; ) is a town in north-western Kazakhstan.

In 1833, the school moved '..to a house on the Royal Fort site', and in 1862 to Great George Street on St Brandon's Hill in Bristol, in premises for which the architect was William Venn Gough. The name of the school was changed to St Brandon's Clergy Daughters' School after its location in 1904 to distinguish it from other Clergy Daughters' Schools at Brighton, Casterton and Darley Dale, and this was shortened to St Brandon's School in the 1930s. A junior department was opened in Henbury in 1933, and plans were made to move the senior school there. During World War II, the school was evacuated to the Bishop's Palace in Wells. In 1945, it bought and moved to Clevedon Hall, where it remained until 1991. It erected some additional school buildings in the grounds, including a new wing which was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester in 1958.

Members of the Rsm/Csr family are present in a diverse range of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Erwinia,Liu et al.

These ncRNAs act by sequestering translational repressor proteins, called RsmA, activating expression of downstream genes that would normally be blocked by the repressors. Sequestering of target proteins is dependent upon exposed GGA motifs in the stem loops of the ncRNAs. Typically, the activated genes are involved in secondary metabolism, biofilm formation and motility. In Pseudomonas spp., three rsm ncRNAs have been identified. These are RsmX (approximately 115 nt), RsmY (approximately 120 nt) and RsmZ (approximately 145 nt). Expression of all three ncRNAs is population density dependent, with maximal expression occurring at the end of exponential phase. Further, expression of all three ncRNAs is dependent upon the response regulator, GacA, which activates transcription of the ncRNAs by binding a conserved upstream activating sequence (UAS) in the promoter region. Typically, pseudomonads contain a single copy of each of RsmY and RsmZ, however the copy number of RsmX is more variable. For example, P. aeruginosa contains no copies of RsmX and P. syringae pathovars contain five copies.

Facts Intelligence suggested a team of known Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members (Daniel McCann, Seán Savage and Mairéad Farrell) were planning a bombing in Gibraltar. One of the members was a known explosives expert while the others had been linked as well as convicted for various explosive and terrorist related activities. During surveillance, the team crossed the border from Spain with no resistance from the authorities and subsequently parked a car in a crowded place. In past instances, the IRA had employed remote control detonators and intelligence suggested the car was rigged with explosives with the suspects holding the remote detonator. A team of SAS soldiers was sent to intercept and arrest them on conspiracy charges, in an operation code-named Operation Flavius. The team, in accordance with their training, shot and killed the suspects which at the time was justified by the teams to be in response to the suspects reaching for what they believed were the detonators. The inquest into the shootings found no breach of Article 2 of the Gibraltar constitution. At the time of the shootings the suspects had neither a detonator nor any explosives. A car was however found registered under one of the suspects names which had been laced with explosive devices of 'ticking time bomb' type and not remote detonators. It appeared that the suspects were on a reconnaissance-mission and had parked their car to save a space for the actual car containing the explosives. Judgment The ECtHR considered whether the shooting was disproportionate to the aims to be achieved by the state in apprehending the suspects and defending the citizens of Gibraltar from unlawful violence; the court found a violation of article 2: the killing of the three IRA members did not constitute a use of force which was \\"absolutely necessary\\" as proscribed by Article 2-2. The violation of Article 2 was found by a vote of 10 to 9 in the planning by the Authorities in that it was not \\"strictly proportionate\\" to the objectives to be achieved; i.e. saving lives. First, the court found a breach in the failure to arrest the suspects at the border so as to safeguard all human lives concerned. Second, the court found that the authorities did not consider the correctness of the intelligence (which turned out to be wrong) and, thirdly, the use of SAS soldiers - combat teams trained to shoot to kill - also amounted to a procedural failure in planning the mission which breached article 2. Nine of nineteen judges dissented: Ryssdal, Bernhardt, Vilhjálmsson, Gölcüklü, Palm, Pekkanen, Freeland, Baka and Jambrek. The court rejected that the U.K. had specifically planned an execution mission and not an arrest mission and dismissed unanimously the applicants' claims save for compensation for legal expenses. The Court held: * By ten votes to nine that there was a violation of Article 2 (art. 2) of the Convention; * Held unanimously that the United Kingdom is to pay to the applicants, within three months, £38,700 (thirty- eight thousand seven hundred) for costs and expenses incurred in the Strasbourg proceedings, less 37,731 (thirty-seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-one) French francs to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment; * Dismissed unanimously the applicants' claim for damages; * Dismissed unanimously the applicants' claim for costs and expenses incurred in the Gibraltar inquest; * Dismissed unanimously the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.

With an angel—a creature of fantasy unlike a religious angel—as protagonist and taking place in contemporary England, the book could be classified as contemporary fantasy, although the genre was not recognised in Wells's time. The Wonderful Visit also has strong satirical themes, gently mocking customs and institutions of Victorian England as well as idealistic rebellion itself. Plot summary The Wonderful Visit tells how an angel spends a little more than a week in southern England. He is at first mistaken for a bird because of his dazzling polychromatic plumage, for he is \\"neither the Angel of religious feeling nor the Angel of popular belief,\\" but rather \\"the Angel of Italian art.\\"H.G. Wells, The Wonderful Visit, ch. 9. As a result, he is hunted and shot in the wing by an amateur ornithologist, the Rev. K. Hilyer, the vicar of Siddermoton, and then taken in and cared for at the vicarage. The creature comes from \\"the Land of Dreams\\" (also the angel's term for our world), and while \\"charmingly affable,\\" is \\"quite ignorant of the most elementary facts of civilisation.\\"H.G. Wells, The Wonderful Visit, ch. 12. During his brief visit he grows increasingly dismayed by what he learns about the world in general and about life in Victorian England in particular. As he grows increasingly critical of local mores, he is eventually denounced as \\"a Socialist.\\"H.G. Wells, The Wonderful Visit, ch. 42. The vicar, his host, meanwhile comes under attack by fellow clerics, neighbours, and even servants for harbouring a disreputable character (no one but the vicar believes he comes from another world, and people take to calling him \\"Mr. Angel\\"). The angel's one talent is his divine violin-playing, but he is discredited at a reception that Lady Hammergallow agrees to host when it is discovered that he cannot read music and confides to a sympathetic listener that he has taken an interest in the vicar's serving girl, Delia. Instead of healing, his wings begin to atrophy. The local physician, Dr. Crump, threatens to have him put in a prison or a madhouse. After the angel destroys some barbed wire on a local baronet's property, Sir John Gotch gives the vicar one week to send him away before he begins proceedings against him. The Rev. Mr. Hilyer is regretfully planning how he will take the angel to London and try to establish him there when two catastrophes abort the plan. First, the angel, who \\"had been breathing the poisonous air of this Struggle for Existence of ours for more than a week,\\" beats Sir John Gotch with Gotch's own whip in a fury after the local landowner insolently orders him off his land.H.G. Wells, The Wonderful Visit, ch. 48. Distraught to think (mistakenly) that he has killed a man, he returns to the village to find the vicar's house in flames. Delia, the serving girl, has entered the burning building in an attempt to rescue the angel's violin: this extraordinary act comes as a revelation to the angel. \\"Then in a flash he saw it all, saw this grim little world of battle and cruelty, transfigured in a splendour that outshone the Angelic Land, suffused suddenly and insupportably glorious with the wonderful light of Love and Self-Sacrifice.\\"H.G. Wells, The Wonderful Visit, ch. 50. The angel attempts to rescue Delia, someone seems to see \\"two figures with wings\\" flash up and vanish among the flames, and a strange music that \\"began and ended like the opening and shutting of a door\\" suggests that the angel has gone back to where he came from, accompanied by Delia. An epilogue reveals that \\"there is nothing beneath\\" the two white crosses in Siddermorton cemetery that bear the names of Thomas Angel and Delia Hardy, and that the vicar, who never recovered his aplomb after the angel's departure, died within a year of the fire. Background The Wonderful Visit was inspired by John Ruskin's remark that an angel appearing on earth in Victorian England would be shot on sight.Norman and Jeanne McKenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 107; William Greensdale and Terence Rodgers, Grant Allen: Literature and Cultural Politics at the Fin de Siècle (Ashgate, 2005), p. 117. The novel's publication date of September 1895 means that it must have been read by the public as a commentary on the notorious trial of Oscar Wilde, whose persecution had begun in February 1895 and who was imprisoned on 25 May 1895. Wells dedicated the book to his friend Walter Low, who died of pneumonia in 1895. Low had helped Wells get a foothold in the world of journalism in 1891 when both were working at the University Correspondence College.Michael Sherbourne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 76–77, 101. The Wonderful Visit was published in the same year (1895) as Select Conversations with an Uncle, The Time Machine, and The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents; at this time Wells's published output was about 7,000 words a day.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 118. In 1907 George Bernard Shaw discouraged Wells from thoughts he had long harboured of turning the book into a play; at least four attempts to dramatise the work—some of them realised, some not—seem to have been made, in 1896, 1900, 1921, and 1934.David C. Johnson, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 143, 540-51n.41; Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 245. Reception Reviews were favourable, with one contemporary reviewer calling The Wonderful Visit \\"a striking fantasia wrought with tact, charm and wit.\\"David C. Johnson, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 205. Joseph Conrad, whom Wells met when he reviewed his early work favourably, admired The Wonderful Visit and wrote to him to praise his \\"imagination so unbounded and so brilliant.\\"David C. Johnson, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 162. For biographer Michael Sherbourne, The Wonderful Visit \\"presages the humour of Kurt Vonnegut.\\"Michael Sherbourne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 108.  Adaptations  The novel was adapted to film by Marcel Carné in 1973 as La Merveilleuse visite. An operatic adaptation, La visita meravigliosa, by Nino Rota, premiered in 1970; an excerpt from the work was performed at Federico Fellini's funeral in 1993.

On the face of it, it seems that people who must attend countless meetings are the ones who need online diary planners the most. However, actual trends show that those who are in the habit of recording and chronicling their activities all the time are the real takers and users of online diary planners. Such people may be executives, event managers, doctors, students, and people from various walks of life. Terminally ill patients have often taken to writing online diaries. Through the medium of such online diaries, they have kept millions of others in the know of their personal plans, thoughts, their medical treatment procedures, etc. Since all sorts of people have been using online diary planners since their advent in the 1990s, the demand for perfect online organizers and personal information managers (PIMS) has been growing steadily with time. Initially, web-based Filofax came into being to satisfy the organizing need of users. But such applications had their disadvantages. This forced users to turn to solutions like ACT!, Time and Chaos. As these too did not prove to be adequate, those in need of online diary planners started looking towards Microsoft Outlook. Online calendars: Upgraded online diary planners Online calendars, a newer and upgraded version of online diary planners, soon appeared to replace the older online diary planners. The main difference between the newer online calendars and the older handheld computers and PIMS was that while the older devices stored all the appointments and meeting schedules of a person on their computer or handheld device, the newer calendar devices stored all information on the Internet. Hence, online calendars were automatically more accessible and less cumbersome as they could be accessed anytime, anywhere if users were in front of a PC, laptop or other machine connected to the Internet. Users did not need to carry them around as they had to carry the older versions because the older versions were not available on the Internet. Hence, diarists turned to Outlook. Right through the first half of the first decade of the 21st century, Outlook was considered to be an excellent application that could be synchronized with Pocket PCs. Further, the older versions required users to make backups of their data regularly, so they had to do that extra work. If they did not make a backup and their Psion, Palm or Pocket PC or other device crashed, they would be unable to recover any data. And if they did recover some data from the backup, to where would they restore it? To another Psion palmtop? Psion soon stopped producing palmtops. First generation online calendars However, some of the very first online calendars that were developed did not perform too well as online diary planners. Though they were impressive enough initially with their multifaceted social networking abilities, they could not manage to impress their users over a long period of time. They helped users to add appointments straightaway. Users did not need to sort through dropdown menus to choose meeting dates and times. That way, the online calendars functioned like secretaries. Users just had to key their meeting schedules into the application and the online diary planner would flash the data and remind them in time. But users soon began to be put off with these first-generation online calendars. They complained that they could view only one-month's appointments on the calendar. Which means if they wanted to schedule a conference over one month away, they would be unable to do so because the application allowed viewing a calendar only 30 days at a time. Also, if users set a meeting date that was far in the future, months from the date on which the details were entered, the online calendar would not show the details until and unless that month arrived. This disadvantage of the initially launched online calendars became a bane for most users. Then, there was the privacy issue. Such open calendars that intended users to connect with as many people as they could meant that others would be able to view the users’ calendars. Moreover, these online diary planners were unable to warn their users if more than one appointment was made within the same time slot. In other words, they could not prevent double bookings. Further, many people found the idea of an online calendar weird because they felt that it is impossible to access the Internet everywhere! Most first-generation online calendars could not carve out a decent market for themselves and thus had to give way to calendars created by giants of the information technology industry such as Microsoft and Yahoo!. To add insult to injury, users also disliked the appearance and the look and feel of first-generation online calendars. Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo! Calendar However these shortcomings of the first-generation online calendars prompted most users to go back to tried and tested ways. So people began to use Microsoft Outlook and synchronize the same with portable contrivances. However, this concept did not work with everybody. The Outlook applications on PCs, Palm handheld computers, Psion palm tops or diaries on cell phones that had been around for quite some time could not, however, meet the expectations of users. Despite helping users to automate the conference management process to some extent, these contrivances lacked the ability to guard against the common problem of double-booking appointments and meetings. So the Yahoo! Calendar was visited once again. Yahoo! was popular from the last decade of the 20th century. Yahoo! always came with downloadable and compatible software that helped to keep the office computer, the Yahoo! calendar and the handheld online diary working in tandem. Yahoo enables synchronization with Lotus Organizer, Outlook, ACT, Outlook Express and Palm. But there was one hitch. The Yahoo! software had to be downloaded to the office PC if a user wanted to use it from their office. But downloading software from the Internet is discouraged and proscribed by many companies. Which meant that users could not use the Yahoo! calendar in many offices, but could use it in some. This is why the calendar began to experience a drop in popularity. This, and the Yahoo! design being not particularly eye-catching and that it did not work easily with all browsers, are the chief reasons why the Yahoo! calendar could not hold onto its number one position as the best and most user-friendly online calendar and diary planner. Google Calendar Google Calendar launched with a mix of unique and existing features. Users can synchronize their calendar with Microsoft Outlook, making use of the conventional meeting request procedure found in other calendaring systems. When accepted, the proposed date will show on the recipient's Google Calendar. A reminder for the event can be sent to the involved parties' Gmail account before the event begins. Google Calendar sends meeting alerts as SMS to users' cell phones and smartphones via the official apps. Users are also able to download public holidays and important dates from the public calendar gallery. Google Calendar permits users to drag and drop events and happenings from one calendar, such as Microsoft Outlook, to another. However, Google Calendar has several flaws. Firstly, to use it, users must have an active Google account. Secondly, the calendar may, at times, double-book users.

The site allows travelers to name the place they wish to travel to as well as to announce their other travel wishes. All such information is recorded on the site. Hotel Planner then asks most of the hotels of that particular place to give quotations for room and other charges, online. If the travel group agrees to a particular quotation, Hotel Planner designs a tailor-made website for the travelers so that the travelers can book the hotel rooms online. Priceline.com is another online diary planner that helps travelers plan for their trips smoothly. Travel groups of five to nine can book accommodation by sending their quotations or by agreeing straightaway to posted rates. However, if there are ten or more than ten travelers in the group, Priceline recommends them to ask the hotels directly for quotations.

InterContinental Hotels Group and Carlson Hotels Worldwide provide travel groups with tailor-made websites so that travelers can book rooms and pay for the same over the Internet. However, many opine that booking trips via online travel planners may not be the best way of booking trips. Larger groups are bound to get better discounts if they do not restrict themselves to the Internet, i.e., booking trips on a face-to-face basis or through travel agencies might be more lucrative for larger travel groups.

In other words, polyL = DSPACE((log n)O(1)), where n denotes the input size, and O(1) denotes a constant. Just as L ⊆ P, polyL ⊆ QP. However, the only proven relationship between polyL and P is that polyL ≠ P; it is unknown if polyL ⊊ P, if P ⊊ polyL, or if neither is contained in the other. One proof that polyL ≠ P is that P has a complete problem under logarithmic space many-one reductions but polyL does not due to the space hierarchy theorem. The space hierarchy theorem guarantees that DSPACE(logd n) ⊊ DSPACE(logd + 1 n) for all integers d > 0. If polyL had a complete problem, call it A, it would be an element of DSPACE(logk n) for some integer k > 0. Suppose problem B is an element of DSPACE(logk + 1 n) \\\\ DSPACE(logk n).

Military career When Korea was under Japanese rule, he participated in education activities and voluntarily joined the Japanese army called Sugada but he escaped the army in 1944 when he was in Suzhou, Jiangsu. His joining of Sugada army was only nominally voluntarily as it was forced by the Japanese army for Korean males to join the army. He then was trained at China Central Officer School and became a warrant officer in the Chinese Central Army. In 1945, he visited Korean Liberation Army located in Suzhou and joined the army from the February as a commissioned officer. While serving the Korean liberation army, he participated activities with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS; the predecessor of the CIA). In November 1945, he came back to Korea via the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. In politics After returning to Korea, Chang worked as a secretary of Kim Gu and participated in Lee Beom-seok's Chosun Ethnic Youth League. After the establishment of Republic of Korea, during the First Republic of South Korea, he worked for the government as a secretary. In 1950, he was in charge of citizen spirit reformation in the Ministry of Education and Culture (문교부). In 1952, he was the directing manager of national ideology research institution. He also worked in two more positions in the Ministry of Education and Culture and founded a periodical called Sasangge. He established the Dong-in Literary Award in 1956. Sasangge acrimoniously denounced the 자유당 administration and became the starting fire of the 4.19 revolution. After the 4.19 revolution took place, he took positions in the Ministry of Munkyo during the second republic. After the May 16 coup, he opposed the South Korea–Japan conference and the sending of troops to Vietnam War. During the 1967 South Korean presidential election, he made an issue out of the career of Yun Bo-seon on Park Chung-hee's pro-Japanese and Workers' Party of South Korea activities. He was then sent into prison for insulting the head of the state. After he came out of prison, he worked with Yun Bo-seon and New Democratic Party (South Korea) in the Korean National Party. From 1975, when he was preparing to fight against the Park Chung-hee administration, he died mysteriously in Pocheon, Gyeonggi-do. The South Korean government announced that Chang's death had been caused by loss of footing while climbing down a mountain. However, after Chang's death, continuous doubts were raised whether it was a homicide by Park's government. To such doubts, the Park administration declared the state of national emergency and arrested anyone who mentioned the death of Chang Chun-ha. The death of Chang Chun-ha has been re-investigated, but there have not been any clear conclusions yet.

It is the seventh largest stone circle in Britain and the largest on the mainland of Scotland.Stell, G. (1996) Exploring Scotland's Heritage: Dumfries and Galloway, Edinburgh: The Stationery Office, p. 170 It is similar in design to the stone circles of Cumbria, and is considered to be an outlier of this group. Its south-westerly arrangement aligns it with the midwinder sunset. It is a scheduled ancient monument. Description The circle is composed of eleven stones, of which five are earthfast; however, there were originally twelve. A plan taken by Francis Grose in 1789 shows twelve stones and the First Statistical Account, published two years later, records the same number. One of the stones was removed before 1837, when the New Statistical Account entry for Holywood was compiled. The 25 inch Ordnance Survey map of 1850 shows twelve stones in the circle, but this is due to an accidental spot of blue ink on the original plan which was carried on to published work. Local traditions recorded in the nineteenth century associate the stones with the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, and link the removed twelfth stone with Judas Iscariot. W. C. Lukis notes that in one tradition the stones were said to be set up by the apostles. The tallest upright stone is around 1.9 meters tall. The longest, lying in the south-western sector, is 3.2 meters long. The circle measures 89 meters at its maximum diameter. It is not a true circle in formation; rather, it is an example of Alexander Thom's Type B 'flattened circle'.ScotlandsPlaces record All but one of the stones are Silurian rock; the other being Porphyry. Four, including the Porphyry rock, are natural boulders; the rest have been quarried. The nearest occurrence of Silurian rock is two miles away, near Irongray Church. The Easthill stone circle is 3¾ miles SSW west of the Twelve Apostles. There was another stone circle a mile east near the River Nith but this was destroyed and used for building material before the New Statistical Account was compiled. Nearby are two cursuses, one of which, if extended, would run towards the circle. In 1882 it was reported that a four inch bronze figure was uncovered at the circle some years before. This has since been identified as Saint Norbert, and dated to the twelfth century. It is now housed in the Dumfries Museum.

The film premiered at South by Southwest, where it won the award for Best Narrative Feature, screened at such festivals as Maryland Film Festival, and was released theatrically in the United States on November 12, 2010. Dunham plays Aura, an aimless, jilted film school graduate who returns home on what she hopes is a temporary basis. Dunham’s own mother, the artist Laurie Simmons, plays Aura’s mother, while her real sibling, Cyrus Grace Dunham, plays Aura’s on-screen sister. The actors Jemima Kirke and Alex Karpovsky would also appear in Dunham's television series Girls. Plot Having been dumped by her boyfriend after graduation, Aura (Lena Dunham) moves back home to her mother's loft in TriBeCa for the summer. Aura's plan is to save money until her friend Frankie finishes her degree at Oberlin College and can move to the city so that they can be roommates. Aura's mother Siri is a successful photographer who takes pictures of scenes using tiny furniture. She is aided by Candice, her assistant, and Aura's teenage sister, Nadine. Siri is initially supportive of her daughter's return home while Nadine appears condescending toward her. Upon moving back into her old room, Nadine commands Aura to replace a lightbulb. While searching for one, Aura stumbles upon her mother's journals from when she was Aura's age, and she begins reading them clandestinely. Shortly after arriving home, Aura goes to a party where she meets Jed, a mildly successful filmmaker who puts his work on YouTube. She also runs into her childhood friend Charlotte (Jemima Kirke), a recovering drug addict. She and Aura return to Charlotte's apartment that night, where they smoke marijuana. Charlotte also helps Aura land an $11/hour (no tips) job taking reservations at a restaurant. The news that she has landed a job is quickly overshadowed by the fact that Nadine has won a prestigious poetry prize for high school students. Aura begins to feel anxious in comparison to her put-together younger sister and resents the close bond between Nadine and their mother. Depressed, Aura begins to spend time with Jed, who is couchsurfing as his agent tries to land him a TV development deal, and flirts with Keith (David Call), a junior chef at the restaurant. When her mother and sister leave for a week in order to tour colleges, Aura invites Jed to stay with her. Together they discover that Aura's pet hamster Gilda has died, and they store it in the freezer in a plastic bag until Aura can bury her. Jed and Aura ultimately neglect to take care of the apartment while drinking most of Siri's wine and eating frozen dinners. Siri eventually confronts Aura about these things upon her return, which Aura first lies about before throwing a tantrum in front of her mother and sister. Despite this, Aura later asks her mom to let Jed extend his visit by having him stay on an inflatable mattress in her room. She is eventually forced to kick him out after he annoys Siri with his entitled attitude. Meanwhile, Aura's flirtation with Keith hits a snag when she discovers he has a girlfriend and only seems interested in her ability to obtain prescription pills through Charlotte. After Keith stands her up when they make plans to get high together, Aura impulsively quits her restaurant job. Later that night, Nadine has a party in their loft while their mother is out for the night. Aura becomes upset, ostensibly by the number of drunk high schoolers at the party, and calls Charlotte to help deal with the situation. Upon arriving, however, Charlotte merely joins the party as well. Nadine eventually confronts Aura over her immaturity, yelling at her to grow up. The next morning, Aura's mother finds the frozen hamster in the freezer, which Aura promptly disposes of. Aura also tells a bewildered Frankie that she no longer can move in with her, offering the excuse that her mother needs her too much. Unsure of what to do with her filmmaking degree, Aura lucks out when Charlotte asks a curator friend to put one of Aura's college videos in his gallery. At the exhibit, Charlotte is annoyed when Frankie appears to discuss living arrangements with Aura. Charlotte encourages Aura to leave Frankie in order to spend time with Keith, who also showed up. Ditching Frankie, Aura goes with Keith and the two smoke marijuana in the street. Encouraged by Charlotte's earlier advice to be spontaneous, Aura makes a move on Keith who, despite still being in a relationship, responds with passion. As Keith still lives with his girlfriend and Aura cannot bring him to her mother's apartment, the two crawl into a pipe in a construction yard where they have unprotected sex. Returning home, Aura fights with her mother but eventually apologizes. She later climbs into bed with her and tells her about her evening with Keith. Aura confesses to having read her diaries, though her mother calmly replies she is not upset over it. Aura uses the opportunity to get to know her mother, and asks her about what she was like when she was Aura's age.

Dunham says she wrote a \\"tight script\\" to which the actors were faithful. Music The soundtrack included music by Teddy Blanks of The Gaskets, Domino (Domino Kirke, and Jordan Galland), Rebecca Schiffman and Sonia's Party! & The Everyone's Invited Band. The soundtrack is downloadable for free on the movie website. Home media Tiny Furniture was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in 2012 as part of the Criterion Collection. Reception=Critical response Tiny Furniture received positive reviews from critics and holds an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.9/10, based on 98 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Agonizingly funny, Tiny Furniture marks an observant study of a failure to launch and an auspicious debut for writer-director Lena Dunham.\\" On review aggregator website Metacritic, the film received a score of 72 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Joe Leydon of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing \\"Winner of the narrative feature prize at the SXSW Film Festival, Tiny Furniture should strike a responsive chord in anyone who remembers — or is experiencing — that post- college period in life when you’re impatiently eager to invent yourself, yet hesitant to get started. Written and directed by newcomer Lena Dunham, who also plays the lead role, this technically polished indie often feels like a semi-autographical effort by a filmmaker trying to work out issues in her art that she’s still confronting in life. But that, too, may help the pic connect with auds during limited theatrical exposure.\\" Accolades Lena Dunham won for Best First Screenplay at the 2010 Independent Spirit Awards.

It was a sentimental ballad (or tear- jerker) that became one of the most popular songs of 1900, reportedly selling more than two million copies in sheet music. Ruhlmann, Wiliam. Breaking Records (One Hundred Years of Hits), New York & London: Routledge Taylor & Francis Group, 2004, p.8 Jere Mahoney (Edison) and Steve Porter (Columbia) recorded two early popular versions of this song. Background According to Von Tilzer, he was approached in 1899 by Lamb with the lyrics for a song. Although Von Tilzer liked it, he asked Lamb to change some of the words to make it clear that the woman in the song was married and not a mistress. Later that evening, as he worked out a melody at a piano in a public house with some friends, he noticed that many of the girls nearby were crying, which convinced him the song could be a hit. Later, Von Tilzer would claim that this song was \\"the key that opened the door of wealth and fame\\" for him. Its success signalled the dominance of ballads in American popular music through 1914. Synopsis The song describes the sad life of a beautiful woman who has married for money instead of love. Its lyrics are as follows: The ballroom was filled with fashion's throng, It shone with a thousand lights, And there was a woman who passed along, The fairest of all the sights, A girl to her lover then softly sighed, There's riches at her command; But she married for wealth, not for love, he cried, Though she lives in a mansion grand. She's only a bird in a gilded cage, A beautiful sight to see, You may think she's happy and free from care, She's not, though she seems to be, 'Tis sad when you think of her wasted life, For youth cannot mate with age, And her beauty was sold, For an old man's gold, She's a bird in a gilded cage. I stood in a churchyard just at eve', When sunset adorned the west, And looked at the people who'd come to grieve, For loved ones now laid at rest, A tall marble monument marked the grave, Of one who'd been fashion's queen, And I thought she is happier here at rest, Than to have people say when seen, In popular culture Tony Martin sings it with Edith Fellows in the movie \\"Music in my Heart.\\" Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album On the Sentimental Side (1962). The song is performed by the heroine Nellie in Matthew O'Reilley's melodramatic operetta \\"Lost in the City (or The Triumph of Nellie),\\" which was a popular choice for high school productions in the early 1980s. Sylvester Stallone sings the song in his guest spot of The Muppet Show. Malcolm McLaren produced, together with Bootsy Collins, a cover version of \\"Bird in a Gilded Cage\\" in hiphop style as a bonus track for a release from his album Waltz Darling, The House of the Blue Danube. (1989). Kristin Chenoweth sings the song as Lavinia Peck-Foster in season 2 episode 2 of Trial & Error. In the 2007 film “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” Zooey Deschanel’s character Dorthy Evans performs the song at a burlesque show in Creede, Colorado. \\"Bird in a Gilded Cage\\" is the title of Episode 17 of Season 6 of The Vampire Diaries (2015); in Season 7, Episode 13 (\\"This Woman's Work,\\" 2016), the character Beau, played by Jaiden Kaine, sings snatches of the song while exiting an English tavern in 1903.

The function of the yjdF gene is unknown, but the protein that it is predicted to encode is classified by the Pfam Database as DUF2992.http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family/PF11208.1 The moderately complex secondary structure and nucleotide positions conserved in the yjdF RNA motif and the fact that it is likely to be present in 5' UTRs led to the hypothesis that yjdF RNAs function as riboswitches. One yjdF RNA is found instead in the presumed 5' UTR of genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). These RNAs lack a region of the otherwise conserved yjdF RNA motif and might be non-functional, or conform to a distinct structure that achieves the same function. If yjdF RNAs are riboswitches, this other RNA might bind a distinct small molecule ligand. Experiments support the conclusion that the yjdF RNA in B. subtilis is indeed in the 5' UTR of the yjdF gene, and that the yjdF genes are transcribed separately from the upstream manPA operon.

It was the successor to earlier UPI television news film operations United Press Movietone and United Press International Newsfilm. It was at the forefront of international television newsgathering and had a vast network of foreign bureaus around the world with film crews capturing images of the events and people that defined the era. United Press International Television News and Visnews were the two largest and most important television news agencies at the time. In 1985, after UPI sold its interest, it was renamed Worldwide Television News, or WTN. In 1998 WTN was bought out by the 'Associated Press', to become Associated Press Television News. History= United Press Movietone  The agreement between United Press and Fox-Movietone to shoot newsfilm for television stations was announced on July 13, 1948.Anon, Paramount and U-I join daily television feed’, Boxoffice, Canadian Edition, February 7, 1948, p.16, Accessed, 16th June 2009, http://issuu.com/boxoffice United Press Movietone, or UPMT, was pioneering in providing a dedicated newsfilm service to television stations in the United States. UPMT introduced crucial innovations and procedures that became intrinsic to the business of motion picture newsgathering for television. UPMT grew steadily and became the first television news agency to operate on a truly international level with the BBC as its first European client. In 1958, an auxiliary service, originally called UPI Audio, was created to make newsmaker and reporter audio from the film service available to UPI radio clients.  United Press International Newsfilm  On 30 September 1963 UPI and Movietone ended their partnership. Movietone briefly stayed in the theatrical newsreel field while UPI set up a new corporate entity, UPI-Newsfilm (UPIN,) with headquarters in London and New York. UPIN took on staff cameramen around the world, very often former Movietone staff, now on the UPI payroll. The client list continued to expand as new stations around the world commenced broadcasting. United Press International Television News / UPITN UPI, having broken away from Movietone, believed it essential to team up with another major partner. The pressure to find a big client/partner increased when UPIN lost its BBC contract. ITN was the obvious choice, but it took four years before UPI actually joined with ITN to form UPITN in June 1967. The company entered its most prolific decade. UPI, however, was plagued by financial difficulties that had negative consequences for UPITN. In the early eighties, UPITN was acquired by ABC (the American Broadcasting Company) which shared ownership with ITN (London's Independent Television News). Australia's Channel 9 owned 10% of the network, which was renamed Worldwide Television News (WTN). In the early nineties, ABC purchased another 30% of the company from ITN. The Disney Company acquired ABC in 1995 and in 1998, resold the company to Associated Press Television News (APTN). Legacy Newsfilm The copyright to the UPIN/UPITN archive is held by Associated Press Television News, which acquired WTN. It is managed through APTN's stock footage licensing division, AP Archive. Although the films themselves have been well preserved, the numerous pieces of text catalogue that accompanied them were scattered across various locations in the UK and US. The text catalogue is essential as it identifies what footage is held in each film can and without it, the archive has been virtually inaccessible since the day the films were first produced. Twenty- thousand film cans containing 3,500 hours of international news footage have been lying dormant for decades deep underground in the Central London bunker. AP Archive assembled a team of archival researchers to create a coherent online text database. The films themselves are being cleaned and restored by Éclair Laboratoires of Paris, and then transferred onto high definition videotape for use by professional producers.

Its origins are unknown but seem to have been coined in the 1920s or 1930s. The term is now more generally used to 'get rid of' someone or something. In the 1970s its meaning expanded to refer to murder.  Etymology and meanings  Chumley's at 86 Bedford Street in the West Village According to the Merriam- Webster Dictionary, 86 means to \\"refuse to serve (a customer)\\", to \\"get rid of\\" or \\"throw out\\" someone or something. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it primarily means \\"to eject or debar (a person) from premises; to reject or abandon\\". It is often used in food and drink services to indicate that an item is no longer available or that a customer should be ejected. There are many theories about the origin of the term but none are certain. It seems to have originated in the 1920s or 1930s. Possible origins include: * Rhyming slang for nix. * Part of the jargon used by soda jerks. Walter Winchell wrote about this in 1933, in his syndicated On Broadway column. In this, the code 13 meant that a boss was around, 81 was a glass of water and 86 meant \\"all out of it\\". Professor Harold Bentley of Columbia University studied soda jerk jargon and reported other numeric codes such as 95 for a customer leaving without paying. * Author Jef Klein theorized that the bar Chumley's at 86 Bedford Street in the West Village of Lower Manhattan was the source. His book The History and Stories of the Best Bars of New York claims that the police would call Chumley's bar during prohibition before making a raid and tell the bartender to \\"86\\" his customers, meaning that they should exit out the 86 Bedford Street door, while the police would come to the Pamela Court entrance. This story is repeated by Sherlock Holmes in the series Elementary. * Another explanation offers that 86th Street stop was the end of the line on the Chicago \\"L\\" train, and drunks and derelicts who were still on board would have to exit the train. According to Cassell's Dictionary of Slang, the meaning expanded in the U.S. during the 1970s to also mean “to kill, to murder; to execute judicially”. Other slang dictionaries confirm this definition. Notable uses= In entertainment  * The 1947 song \\"Boogie Woogie Blue Plate\\", by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five, uses hipster lingo, among which is \\"86 on the cherry pie\\". * Agent 86 in the 1960s TV show, Get Smart, gets his code number from the term. * David B. Feinberg's first novel, Eighty-sixed (1989), refers to \\"the gay community wiped out by AIDS\\". It won Feinberg the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Fiction and the American Library Association Gay/Lesbian Award for Fiction. * The song \\"86\\" (1995) by Green Day is about them being rejected from their punk rock community when they started achieving commercial success. * Dan Fante’s novel, 86'd (2009) is loosely based on his own struggles with alcoholism and substance abuse. * Neon Indian’s comedy crime film, 86'd (2018), takes place at a 24-hour restaurant.  In politics  * In 2005, the grassroots campaign 8664 was started in Louisville, Kentucky to advocate for removing Interstate 64's segment through downtown. * In 2018, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, then-White House Press Secretary under President Donald Trump, was asked to leave the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. This was reported by Brennan Gilmore with a note saying \\"86 – Sara Huckabee Sanders\\". * In 2020, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer had a small sign inscribed with \\"8645\\"—an allusion to the term and the 45th US President (Trump)—in the background during a Meet the Press interview. Representatives of the 2020 Trump presidential campaign interpreted it as encouragement for the assassination of Trump. A spokesperson for Whitmer stated in response, \\"The silly season is officially here. It's pretty clear nobody in the Trump campaign has ever worked a food service job.\\" Whitmer herself said about the Trump campaign's accusation, \\"That was ridiculous. Eighty-six means reject, and I do reject Donald Trump. I reject Donald Trump's rhetoric, I reject Donald Trump's bungled COVID response, and I reject Donald Trump's decisions to pit Americans against Americans.\\" See also * Deep Six (disambiguation) * 23 skidoo * List of restaurant terminology References Category:Slang Category:Restaurant terminology Category:Jargon Category:English language ","title":"86 (term)"},{"id":"26953757","text":"The Ojo Alamo Formation is a geologic formation in New Mexico spanning the Mesozoic/Cenozoic boundary.

It overlies the De-na-zin member of the Kirtland formation, though the two are separated by another large unconformity that spans a period of geologic time equivalent to 73-69 million years ago.Sullivan, R.M., and Lucas, S.G. 2006. \\"The Kirtlandian land-vertebrate \\"age\\" – faunal composition, temporal position and biostratigraphic correlation in the nonmarine Upper Cretaceous of western North America.\\" New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Bulletin 35:7-29.

History Established as a Fourth Air Force bombardment squadron in November 1940 as part of the USAAC's buildup of forces after the outbreak of World War II in Europe; equipped with B-18 Bolos. Deployed to Third Air Force in May 1941 engaged in antisubmarine patrols with Lockheed A-29 Hudsons over the Gulf of Mexico. Returned to California in late December flying anti-submarine warfare patrols and training replacement crews. It continued to perform this duty until September 1943, and in October the squadron was moved to Hawaii to join the Seventh Air Force. Re-equipped with Very Long Range (VLR) B-24 Liberators and deployed to the Central Pacific in November 1943 to take part in the island hopping campaign. Moved to Funafuti Airfield and Nanumea Airfield, Gilbert Islands, from where on 14 November it flew its first bombing mission. On 23 December 1943 aircraft from the 27th Bombardment Squadron became the first American heavy bombers to use Hawkins Field on Tarawa, when the squadron used it as a staging base while escorting US Navy reconnaissance aircraft to Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands during the preparation for the invasion of that atoll. The squadron took part in the island hopping campaign, making three hops itself - to Abemama Airfield in the Gilbert Islands at the start of 1944, to Kwajalein Airfield in March 1944 and to East Field, Saipan in the Mariana Islands in August 1944. During this period the squadron had attacked targets in the Marshall, Gilbert and Truk Islands, as well attacking Wake Island, Guam and Saipan. Once on Saipan the squadron attacked targets in the Bonin and Volcano Islands in support of the invasion of Iwo Jima. In March 1945 the squadron (although not all of its aircraft or crews) returned to Hawaii, from where it carried out a mix of patrol and training duties. Inactivated in Hawaii on 20 March 1946.

A students who fails all must repeat the school year. The mid-term exams take place in January, and the final exams take place in June. They are three types of courses enriched, regular, and special ed (the last only for secondary one and two). Enriched is for those who get above 75% the first half of the school year, and they learn academic in their level and the second half of the next level. Regular is for students who learn academics in their own level throughout their whole school year. Special ed is for those with learning disabilities and those who get lower than a 65% average. For students to graduate, they need 54 credits. Students can work hard and get credits in secondary three, four and five. Exams Exams are a part of academics. The mid-term and final exams each count for 30% of the grade and come from the English Montreal School Board except for secondary five exams, which comes from the Quebec government.

The next day, the fibres were tested, and the results were negative, but Marra closed the school for a week. Students were relocated to Rosemount High School until the cleanup had been completed. In July 2012, more fibres were found, and this time, test results were positive. Students and staff returned to the John F.

It was located in the northern part of the Island of Oahu. History=World War II Possibly developed as an emergency field dating to the 1930s, but it was not until the United States entered World War II that the airfield was developed. Kahuku Army Air Field was classified as an auxiliary field and had a very short life span, from 1942 until it was closed in the late 1940s. Ground troops were stationed in the area to protect the airfield and man the shoreline fortifications. The northern tip of Oahu had three airfields in close proximity during World War II. The Kahuku Point Airfield was located near the tip of Kahuku Point, and was evidently the most elaborate. The Kahuku Army Airfields were used for training of pilots from Wheeler Army Air Field for instrument flying on different types of aircraft. The airfield was ideal for training because it had a good approach, runway length, and take off clearance. This field was not over populated like Hickam or Wheeler. It is documented that the 18th Air base Group, 47th Pursuit Squadron was stationed there along with B-24s and B-17s that were based at Kahuku for short periods of time during World War II. At the end of World War II, the 27th Bombardment Squadron used the airfield for training with B-24's until March 1946. Afterwards the USAAF closed the airfields and returned the Kahuku property to its owners. Postwar history No airfields at Kahuku were depicted on the October 1954 Hawaiian Islands Sectional Chart. In the early 1960s prior to the opening of the Campbell Race Course, the Kahuku airfield runways were used for both drag racing and the first Hawaii Grand Prix sports car race. At some point between 1954-77 the former Kahuku Point airfield was apparently reused as a private civil airfield. It was depicted as having a single hard-surface runway. Current use Very little remains of the three Kahuku airfields. The Turtle Bay Resort golf courses absorbed two of the runways. This site is typical of a former airfield converted into a golf course. The long runways are ideal for golf fairways. The northwestern portion has been covered by aquaculture equipment built on the runway by a lease tenant. Very little evidence of Kahuku's World War II fortifications remain except one bunker site that is keeping its past military secrets. The entrance to the bunker is buried in sand and brush leaving only two concrete structures exposed. Scattered concrete pillboxes covered by low brush and debris can be found in the surrounding jungle. No historical markers indicating the areas past could be found. , a small privately owned heliport for daytime VFR use only was located at the Turtle Bay Resort next to the main hotel building.

History The Plaza Hotel at the plaza's western side Original design The idea for a unified treatment of the plaza was first proposed by Karl Bitter in 1898. The newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer died in 1911 having bequeathed $50,000 for the creation of a memorial fountain to be \\"like those in the Place de la Concorde, Paris, France.\\" In December 1912, the executors of Pulitzer's estate announced that New York City had approved the fountain's proposed location, in the plaza between 58th Street and 60th Street, just west of Fifth Avenue, the same plaza where the equestrian Sherman Monument stood since 1903. The executors invited five architecture firms to participate in a competition to determine the fountain's design, and to provide designs for a \\"good architectural treatment of the whole plaza.\\" The New York Times, December 22, 1912. In January 1913, the five schemes were exhibited at the New York Public Library Main Branch, including the winning scheme, designed by Carrère and Hastings. Architect Thomas Hasting's design placed the fountain in the southern half of the plaza, whereas the Sherman Monument remained in the northern half (but moved fifteen feet west to be symmetrically opposite the fountain). Construction of the new plaza began in 1915, and by November one newspaper reported: \\"The Pulitzer Fountain...is now finished and bubbling with the purest Croton water,\\" noting that work on the northern portion of the plaza was delayed by subway construction.Chicago Daily Tribune, November 7, 1915. The New York City Board of Aldermen named the space the Grand Army Plaza in 1923 after the Grand Army of the Potomac. Renovations and landmark designation In 1933, Herbert, Joseph and Ralph, sons of Joseph Pulitzer, donated $35,000 for the restoration of the Pulitzer Fountain, done under the supervision of architect Dan Everett Waid. The work, delayed by labor troubles, was completed by June 1935.The New York Times, June 14, 1935. As part of the work, the limestone basin was rebuilt in Italian marble, and the plaza's limestone balustrade and columns that surrounded the fountain were demolished.The New York Times, May 8, 1935. On May 30, 1974, the Landmarks Preservation Commission held a public hearing to consider designation of the Grand Army Plaza, including the Pulitzer Fountain and Sherman Monument, as a Scenic Landmark. The measure was approved on July 23, 1974. On March 26, 1985, the Central Park Conservancy and the architecture firm of Buttrick White & Burtis presented plans to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a full restoration of the plaza, including the Pulitzer Fountain. The plans called for the restoration of the balustrade and columns removed in the 1935 repairs. The work was completed in June 1990, including a reconstruction of the fountain, this time in granite. Plans to restore the balustrade and columns were abandoned on account of costs. The New York Times wrote: \\"For years this fountain merely dripped and dribbled, but now it cascades, and that makes all the difference, for now the Pulitzer Fountain has a sound.\\" The restoration work included a re-gilding of the Sherman Monument. The plaza was renewed again in 2013, including a re-gilding of the statue of William Tecumseh Sherman. Gallery File:New York City.

It can determine the energetic effect of point mutations as well as the interaction energy of protein complexes (including Protein-DNA). FoldX can mutate protein and DNA side chains using a probability-based rotamer library, while exploring alternative conformations of the surrounding side chains.  Applications  * Prediction of the effect of point mutations or human SNPs on protein stability or protein complexes * Protein design to improve stability or modify affinity or specificity * Homology modeling  The FoldX force field  The energy function includes terms that have been found to be important for protein stability, where the energy of unfolding (∆G) of a target protein is calculated using the equation: ∆G = ∆Gvdw \\\\+ ∆GsolvH \\\\+ ∆GsolvP \\\\+ ∆Ghbond \\\\+ ∆Gwb \\\\+ ∆Gel \\\\+ ∆Smc \\\\+ ∆Ssc Where ∆Gvdw is the sum of the Van der Waals contributions of all atoms with respect to the same interactions with the solvent. ∆GsolvH and ∆GsolvP is the difference in solvation energy for apolar and polar groups, respectively, when going from the unfolded to the folded state. ∆Ghbond is the free energy difference between the formation of an intra-molecular hydrogen-bond compared to inter-molecular hydrogen-bond formation (with solvent). ∆Gwb is the extra stabilizing free energy provided by a water molecule making more than one hydrogen-bond to the protein (water bridges) that cannot be taken into account with non-explicit solvent approximations. ∆Gel is the electrostatic contribution of charged groups, including the helix dipole. ∆Smc is the entropy cost for fixing the backbone in the folded state. This term is dependent on the intrinsic tendency of a particular amino acid to adopt certain dihedral angles. ∆Ssc is the entropic cost of fixing a side chain in a particular conformation. The energy values of ∆Gvdw, ∆GsolvH, ∆GsolvP and ∆Ghbond attributed to each atom type have been derived from a set of experimental data, and ∆Smc and ∆Ssc have been taken from theoretical estimates. The Van der Waals contributions are derived from vapor to water energy transfer, while in the protein we are going from solvent to protein. For protein-protein interactions, or protein-DNA interactions FoldX calculates ∆∆G of interaction : ∆∆Gab = ∆Gab\\\\- (∆Ga \\\\+ ∆Gb) + ∆Gkon \\\\+ ∆Ssc ∆Gkon reflects the effect of electrostatic interactions on the kon. ∆Ssc is the loss of translational and rotational entropy upon making the complex.  Key features  * RepairPDB: energy minimization of a protein structure * BuildModel: in silico mutagenesis or homology modeling with predicted energy changes * AnalyseComplex: interaction energy calculation * Stability: prediction of free energy changes between alternative structures * AlaScan: in silico alanine scan of a protein structure with predicted energy changes * SequenceDetail: per residue free energy decomposition into separate energy terms (hydrogen bonding, Van der Waals energy, electrostatics, ...)  Graphical interface  Native FoldX is run from the command line. A FoldX plugin for the YASARA molecular graphics program has been developed to access various FoldX tools inside a graphical environment. The results of e.g. in silico mutations or homology modeling with FoldX can be directly analyzed on screen.

They were previously famous for Pigeon Street. The series was produced by David Yates and Joe Wolf. The title is a reference to the nursery rhyme Rub-a-dub-dub. Rub-A-Dub-Dub was animated in a similar way, yet all the characters were anthropomorphic animals. It ran in 1984, completing 25 episodes. Episode structure The episodes usually started off with the character Mother Goose and (most often) another character stood by a polka-dot patterned bathtub, with Mother Goose saying \\"Rub-a-dub- dub...\\" announcing that there was an item in the tub, an item that will then be relevant to the episode, e.g. \\"Rub-a-dub-dub, there's a kettle in the tub...\\" The line would then usually be followed up by another. In this case, the character King Crow appears at the window and says \\"...And King Crow wants his tea!\\" The nursery rhymes themselves would be dotted in amongst the humorous dialogue between the animal characters. Characters=Principal characters *Mother Goose: Could be considered the hostess of Rub-A-Dub-Dub. She begins every episode by saying \\"Rub-a-dub-dub, there's a... in the tub.\\" She is a white goose, wearing what looks to be a yellow raincoat and hat, a blue skirt beneath the coat and blue shoes. She also wears pink tights with white spots. *Polly: An irritable parrot. She often gets annoyed with various characters, such as with Mother Goose when she asks her to make King Crow's tea. In this instance, she responds \\"I'm not gonna make it! Why does it always have to be me!? Humph!\\" She also often appears to be on the receiving end of bad luck, such as when she sets her dinner down before the television, leaves to get a drink, and then finds her dinner has been stolen, to which she responds: \\"EH! Where did it go?!\\" Polly had a red face and blue hands and legs, wore a green jumper with red sleeves and yellow shoes. *King Crow: The King who is a crow. He was awfully demanding of his servants such as Polly, on whom he intrudes into her TV-watching time, saying \\"Hello Polly, get me my pipe and bowl please!\\" He was also awfully energetic and bounced around a lot. Like all crows, King Crow was black with a yellow beak. He wore a stereotypical King's robe and crown, black and white striped stockings and black-and-white shoes. *Queen Duck: The wife of King Crow. *Al E. Gator: An alligator who was somewhat of an antagonist on the show. He was always causing trouble, such as tripping over Baa Sheep and causing him to fall in mud, or interrupting Polly's favourite TV show as \\"Tonight's Special Guest\\". He wore a red coat and a top hat. In one episode, he lost his violin bow. He does have his good points though, as he helped nurse Yankee Doodle back to health when the latter knocked himself out after doing his morning exercises. *Baa Sheep: A white sheep who wore red shoes. He once fell victim to Al E. Gator's mischief, when he tripped him over and caused him to fall into a muddy puddle. This dirtied his wool. Displeased, he sang I do not like thee, Doctor Fell to him. Al E Gator simply laughed, before asking \\"What did I do wrong?\\" before leaving. Baa was also close to Mother Goose, who cleaned him up in the eponymous tub after this incident. *Buzz Tiger: A tiger with a fear of bees. He seemed to be romantically involved with Mary the giraffe. *Brian Lion: A lion who was good friends with Buzz and Blue. *Olga Ostrich: An ostrich who wore pink shoes. She once lost one of these shoes in one episode. She was also sat at the same restaurant as Polly when she had her dinner stolen. *The Penguin Trio: Three traveling penguins, who served as soldiers and musicians for King Crow as well as inattentive waiters at the restaurant. *Jack and Jill: Two twin pigs. They both wore blue and yellow tops and red shoes. one pig male wear a yellow striped red hat and the other pig female got blonde hair with two plaits with red bows. Jack was more heavily featured than his sister, although in Jack and Jill, Mrs. Mason's Basin and Jack Sprat they were featured together. They were Elsie Pig's children and had a baby sibling. *Elsie Pig: The mother of Jack and Jill and an unnamed baby. She wore a yellow and black dress and matching hat. She appeared to be a cleaner in the castle like Mother Goose. *Blue: A blue hippopotamus who wore a yellow raincoat and rain hat, similar to Mother Goose. He was featured on Polly's favorite Western TV show. He was due to face off in a duel with Yankee Doodle, before they were interrupted by Al E. Gator. He also appeared as Santa Claus in one episode. *Yankee Doodle: A white rooster married to Mrs. Doodle. He was often seen jogging and weightlifting. He was featured on Polly's favorite Western TV show. He was due to face off in a duel with Blue the hippo, before being interrupted by Al E. Gator. *Mrs. Doodle: A brown hen who was married to Yankee Doodle. *Tom Cat: A young cat who went to London to see the Queen. The Queen Duck asked him to catch one of the mice in the castle, but ended up knocking all of the furniture over and was sent away. He was often depicted as a troublemaker who enjoyed stealing others' food. *Yellow Dog: A yellow dog who wears a blue sweater and often liked to make jokes. *Mice: Three mice that were often in some nursery rhymes, one dressed as a Chef, one as a Butcher, and one in a yellow top with red, green and blue stars. *Mary Giraffe: A giraffe who wore a blue sweatshirt with a giraffe number 11 and a pink skirt with pink shoes.

Early life, education Raleigh Degeer Amyx with the FBI in 1957 Amyx was born in 1938 in Kansas City, Kansas, and later moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he resided during the World War II years. In 1945, his father, Eugene Raleigh Amyx, accepted a transfer by his employer Johnson & Johnson, to Louisville, Kentucky. There Raleigh was raised until his graduation from Atherton High School. Career Amyx served in the U.S. Army and worked at the FBI. At one time he served in the Investigation Division, which included the kidnapping and white slave trade units. He served as a Messenger to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. In 1957 Hoover presented an inscribed and signed sepia-toned photo to Amyx. About the same time, Amyx was asked by the Director's Office to take a message to the then Majority Leader of the United States Senate, Lyndon B. Johnson, and to then Senator John F. Kennedy. While in the Senate Office with Kennedy, Amyx asked him to inscribe and sign a photograph, to which he obliged. Later Amyx became an Association Executive, overseeing and co-authoring the Gymnastics Safety Manual. Following a near- fatal bout with throat cancer, Amyx founded American Heritage Manuscripts and Collectibles. Collector Amyx claims he started collecting at age seven, when he \\"opened\\" a museum consisting of some coins, stamps, butterflies and a dead bat. Admission was 2 cents. Amyx's large private collection as an adult is specialized in Presidential, Sports, Military, and NASA collectibles, particularly those owned and used by famous Americans. Presidential collection A photograph of the painting Eisenhower did of Telegraph Cottage where he lived during WWII In the early 1980s, Amyx claims he saw Backstairs at the White House, a television mini-series adapted from the book My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House by Lillian Rogers Parks, who had been a housekeeper and seamstress at the White House for thirty years. Amyx was inspired to gather mementos from former White House employees into a collection, and placed numerous advertisements in the Washington Post. One response said, \\"You don't know who to leave all this stuff to. You'd be out on a walk with the president and he would say 'Here's a little something for you'....We took it for granted in those days. It was just work. Now it's history.\\" Amyx has stated he recognized the historical importance of both the items and the stories, and gathered signed provenance letters from each contributor to authenticate the items. Amyx has since worked with some 100 people who have held long-term household positions for First Families since the days of Herbert Hoover, and some whose parents and/or grandparents served in the White House as far back as the 19th century. Dwight Eisenhower's Rolex watch, from the Raleigh DeGeer Amyx Collection His official White House china collection ranks as the world's second-largest privately owned such collection. One piece from the collection was traded to Robert L. McNeil and is featured in the book American Presidential China. Another item in the collection is President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Rolex Datejust, which is the 150,000th officially-certified Rolex Chronometer made. This watch was featured in Jake's Rolex World Magazine. Sports collection Amyx has a collection of sports collectibles relating to baseball, football, boxing, horse racing and the Olympics. Amyx possesses three official Super Bowl rings presented to Washington Redskins players in 1982, 1987, and 1991. ;Olympic memorabilia According to the Olympian Collectors Club, his Olympic Medal and memorabilia collection ranks within the top four collections in the world.Olympian Collectors Club 2008, 2009 His collection includes over 50 Olympic medals in gold, silver, and bronze dating back to 1896.

Its last assignment was with the 30th Bombardment Group, based at Kahuku Army Airfield, Hawaii Territory. It was inactivated on March 20, 1946.  History  Established as a Fourth Air Force bombardment squadron in November 1940 as part of the USAAC's buildup of forces after the outbreak of World War II in Europe; equipped with B-18 Bolos and early YB-17 Flying Fortress prototypes. Deployed to Third Air Force after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, engaged in antisubmarine patrols over the southeast Atlantic coastline. Returned to California in late December flying anti-submarine warfare patrols and training replacement crews with Lockheed A-29 Hudsons. It continued to perform this duty until October 1943, when the squadron was moved to Hawaii to join the Seventh Air Force. Trained with early LB-30 Liberators and B-25 Mitchells in Hawaii until November, then re-equipped with Very Long Range (VLR) B-24 Liberators and deployed to the Central Pacific in November 1943 to take part in the island hopping campaign. Moved to Funafuti Airfield, Nanumea in the Gilbert Islands. Mounted bombing raids against enemy installations on those islands. It also raided airfields in the Marshall Islands to help prevent the launching of Japanese planes against the amphibious assault on Tarawa. Staging through the recently captured Tarawa and Makin Islands, the squadron attacked several atolls in the Marshalls, including Kwajalein. Between November 14, 1943, and April 1, 1944, the squadron carried out bombing missions over the Marshall Islands and participated in the actual invasion of Kwajalein in February 1944. As the war moved closer to Japan, the squadron attacked Truk. The 38th also bombed Wake Island, Guam, Saipan, and harassed other islands in the Carolines and Marianas, bypassed by American amphibious forces. In August 1944, the squadron moved to East Field, Saipan in the Mariana Islands. During the next six months, the 38th conducted intensive bombing strikes against airfields and shipping at Bonin and Volcano Islands, Iwo Jima, ChiChi Jima, and Yap. Its final bombing mission was at Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945, the same day three Marine divisions invaded the island. In March 1945, the 38th returned to Hawaii on the popular but mistaken rumor that it was to be reequipped with B-32 Dominators. Instead, many of the crews and planes were reassigned to the 11th Bombardment Group and subsequently served with it. The remaining elements waited out the war conducting training sorties and routine patrols. Inactivated on 20 March 1946.

It also builds regional legal capacity through targeted training, mentoring and network activities, co-ordinating a network of criminal justice legal experts and European human rights NGOs called JUSTICIA.  History  Fair Trials was founded by lawyer Stephen Jakobi in 1992 (under the name Fair Trials Abroad) as a response to the case of Karen Smith, a British citizen arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling. It now styles itself as the \\"global criminal justice watchdog\\".  Current work  The areas where Fair Trials works are: Pre-trial Detention Since 2011, Fair Trials has campaigned for international human rights standards on pre-trial detention to be more widely understood and applied in practice. This began with a 2011 report, which was followed by a 2014 report.http://www.fairtrials.org/wp- content/uploads/Stockholms-Sunset.pdf These reports called for the adoption of EU-wide minimum standards on pre-trial detention, including: * Ensuring that the procedure for pre-trial detention decisions complies with all aspects of the right to a fair trial; * Not using extradition until cases are trial- ready; * Considering the proportionality of detention and the use of alternatives to pre-trial detention; * Ensuring detainees are given the best opportunity to prepare for trial, through safeguarding detention conditions. Plea Bargaining ('Trial Waivers') Fair Trials has researched the use of plea bargaining, also known as 'trial waivers', campaigning for a \\"a rights-based approach\\" to trial waiver systems. They coordinated research across 90 countries, assessing the legal and human rights implications and providing recommendations in a report: 'The Disappearing Trial.' EU Defence Rights Fair Trials has been responsible for the production of detailed reports and policy briefings for EU policy-makers. It has worked for the proper implementation of EU law, through strategic litigation and training and has helped people access local expertise by producing 'Notes of Advice' on criminal proceedings and justice systems in Europe. Additionally, Fair Trials set up the Legal Experts Advisory Panel (LEAP) which is an EU-wide network of experts in criminal justice and human rights working to promote fair and effective judicial cooperation within Europe, as well as informing the EU’s work on criminal justice. Extradition Reform Fair Trials' work in this area has been focused on campaigning to reform the European Arrest Warrant, a fast-track system for surrendering people from one EU country to another. Fair Trials has highlighted a number of cases which demonstrate that the European Arrest Warrant system is jeopardising the right to a fair trial. In particular, Fair Trials alleges that: * European Arrest Warrants have been issued many years after the alleged offence was committed. * Once warrants have been issued there is no effective way of removing them, even after extradition has been refused. * They have been used to send people to another EU member state to serve a prison sentence resulting from an unfair trial. * Warrants have been used to force a person to face trial when the charges are based on evidence obtained by police brutality. * Sometimes people surrendered under an Arrest Warrant have to spend months or even years in detention before they can appear in court to establish their innocence. INTERPOL INTERPOL systems, particularly its international ‘wanted person’ alerts (\\"Red Notices\\") can be abused in order to persecute refugees, journalists and peaceful political demonstrators worldwide. In 2013, Fair Trials released a reporthttp://www.fairtrials.org/wp- content/uploads/Fair-Trials-International-Strengthening-INTERPOL- brochure.pdfhttp://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/Strengthening- respect-for-human-rights-strengthening-INTERPOL4.pdf which identified two major areas for INTERPOL reform: 1\\\\. Protection from abuse of INTERPOL’s tools by member countries, and 2\\\\. Creation of a more fair and transparent process for individuals who are challenging data that has been processed by INTERPOL. Fair Trials has met with INTERPOL on multiple occasions as part of an ongoing dialogue between the two organisations to prevent the abuse of its systems.  Casework  In its early years, Fair Trials used to provide case support, assisting around 500 individuals each year and provide assistance in approximately 50 cases at any one time. It used a network of lawyers and diplomatic, political and media contacts to advocate on behalf of clients. It did not charge clients for the service it offers. Fair Trials provided assistance on several high-profile casesng c ase of English nanny Louise Woodward who, in 1997, was arrested in America for murder, after the death of a baby in her care. Woodward was found guilty of second degree murder, although her sentence was reduced on appeal as the court found that there was no malice in Louise’s actions and that “allowing this defendant on this evidence to remain convicted of second-degree murder would be a miscarriage of justice.” In 2007, 10 years later, the key prosecution witness reversed his evidence stating: “the science we have today could, in fact, have exonerated Louise. There is certainly, in retrospect, reasonable doubt.” Other high- profile, notable cases include Ian Stillman: In August 2000, deaf charity worker Ian Stillman was arrested in India for smuggling 20 kilograms of cannabis after the drug was found in a shared taxi. He has always maintained his innocence. Fair Trials campaigned for his release and in 2002 he was finally released after spending 2 years in prison. Greek Plane Spotters: In November 2001, a group of 12 British and two Dutch plane spotters were arrested on charges of espionage after taking notes during an open day at a Greek Air Force base. They were found guilty in 2002. The Greek courts overturned the conviction on appeal. Ghana Girls: In July 2007, two 16-year- old girls, Yetunde Diya and Yasemin Vatansever, were arrested for possession of 6 kilograms of cocaine at Accra airport in Ghana.

These families have been collected together in the Pfam database using the prefix DUF followed by a number, with examples being DUF2992 and DUF1220. As of 2019, there are almost 4,000 DUF families within the Pfam database representing over 22% of known families. Some DUFs are not named using the nomenclature due to popular usage but are nevertheless DUFs. The DUF designation is tentative, and such families tend to be renamed to a more specific name (or merged to an existing domain) after a function is identified. History The DUF naming scheme was introduced by Chris Ponting, through the addition of DUF1 and DUF2 to the SMART database. These two domains were found to be widely distributed in bacterial signaling proteins. Subsequently, the functions of these domains were identified and they have since been renamed as the GGDEF domain and EAL domain respectively. Characterisation Structural genomics programmes have attempted to understand the function of DUFs through structure determination. The structures of over 250 DUF families have been solved. This (2009) work showed that about two thirds of DUF families had a structure similar to a previously solved one and therefore likely to be divergent members of existing protein superfamilies, whereas about one third possessed a novel protein fold. Some DUF families share remote sequence homology with domains that has characterized function. Computational work can be used to link these relationships. A 2015 work was able to assign 20% of the DUFs to characterized structural superfamilies. Pfam also continuously perform the (manually- verified) assignment in \\"clan\\" superfamily entries.  Frequency and conservation  Protein domains and DUFs in different domains of life. Left: Annotated domains. Right: domains of unknown function. Not all overlaps shown. More than 20% of all protein domains were annotated as DUFs in 2013. About 2,700 DUFs are found in bacteria compared with just over 1,500 in eukaryotes. Over 800 DUFs are shared between bacteria and eukaryotes, and about 300 of these are also present in archaea. A total of 2,786 bacterial Pfam domains even occur in animals, including 320 DUFs.  Role in biology  Many DUFs are highly conserved, indicating an important role in biology. However, many such DUFs are not essential, hence their biological role often remains unknown. For instance, DUF143 is present in most bacteria and eukaryotic genomes. However, when it was deleted in Escherichia coli no obvious phenotype was detected. Later it was shown that the proteins that contain DUF143, are ribosomal silencing factors that block the assembly of the two ribosomal subunits. While this function is not essential, it helps the cells to adapt to low nutrient conditions by shutting down protein biosynthesis. As a result, these proteins and the DUF only become relevant when the cells starve. It is thus believed that many DUFs (or proteins of unknown function, PUFs) are only required under certain conditions.  Essential DUFs  Goodacre et al. identified 238 DUFs in 355 essential proteins (in 16 model bacterial species), most of which represent single-domain proteins, clearly establishing the biological essentiality of DUFs. These DUFs are called \\"essential DUFs\\" or eDUFs.

It was founded as Shiji Public School on 18 September 1940 by ordnance expert . Overview The university was established on 18 September 1940, it now has around 26,000 students and 1,590 teachers. Chongqing University of Technology used to be named the Chongqing Technology Institute, one of four universities with a traditional ordnance department. It originated from the 11th Technical School of the Department of War Industry, which was founded on 18 September 1940. The 11th Technical School of the Department of War Industry was called 21-Factory Technical School in short, and its external anonym was \\"Shiji Public School\\". Although its public identity was technical school, it acted to train professionals in weapon production for the Nationalist government. Today the university is strong in the fields of engineering, economic management and basic engineering — the disciplines of automobile manufacturing and research in drive technology, thermal engine technology and transmission technology are top in the state. It has become one of the benchmark schools in China for its research in automobile design, thermal engine and automobile suspension systems. It established Chongqing Automobile Institute and the first CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) institute in China in a joint capital partnership with Changan Ford, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda. The university has diploma students, undergraduates and postgraduates. It grants bachelor's degree, master's degree and titles of researchers and associate researchers in institutes in Chongqing. Today it is a common tertiary institution supervised by the Chongqing government and Ministry of Ordnance Industry (currently under the auspices of China South Industries Group Corporation). History On 18 September 1940, its origin, the 11th Technical School of the Department of War Industry of National Government of the Republic of China was founded. It was jointly managed by Ministry of Defense and Department of War Industry of central National Government. In order to keep it confidential it was called \\"Shiji Public School\\". The principal was Lieutenant General Li Chenggan. In November 1949, the army of the Communist Party took Chongqing by storm. The 11th Technical School was renamed to Chongqing Polytechnic College, and controlled by military government of Southwest Bureau of the CCP. In April 1965, the institution was updated and renamed to Chongqing Industry College, under the fifth Ministry of Machine building. It had several key laboratories of Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Ordnance Industry. In fact it was one of the universities with ordnance department which served for national defense. In May 1999, it was renamed to Chongqing Institute of Technology and granted master's degrees. It was still controlled by Ministry of Ordnance Industry and later jointly supervised by the Chongqing government and Ordnance Industry Corporation. In March 2009, Ministry of Education of the PRC agreed to rename it \\"Chongqing University of Technology\\", and then the establishment of several key laboratories for automobile manufacturing was reported. On 16 May 2009, the university formally accepted the name, changing to \\"Chongqing University of Technology\\". It is jointly supervised by Chongqing government and China South Industries Group Corporation. It is one of the remaining four universities with ordnance department. Faculties Full-time teachers of Chongqing University of Technology account for 54% of the total number of teachers, which ranks top in Chongqing City and the southwestern area of China. In recent five years it has in sequence undertaken 1,390 state-level and province-level major research projects and horizontal cooperation projects including through the National Natural Science Foundation and National Social Science Foundation. Two of them have gained the National Science and Technology Award. Its vehicle engineering is state-level key discipline, and its province-level key disciplines are biological engineering, drive and thermal engine, automation, basic accounting and pharmaceutical engineering. The university also has over 30 university-level institutes and over 160 out- of-campus practice bases. Campus Old campus: No. 4 Xingsheng Road, Yangjiaping (杨家坪), Chongqing. Postcode: 400050.

It is the largest population-based prospective health project in US military history, currently collecting data on over 200,000 enrolled participants. Investigators that conduct the Millennium Cohort Study include uniformed and non-uniformed scientists from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Department of Veterans Affairs and academic institutions. right  Origin  After the 1991 Gulf War, the United States Department of Defense recognized the need to collect prospective exposure and health information that may be associated with the long-term health of service members . The Millennium Cohort Study was designed to address that need. Pilot studies were conducted in 2000; by mid-2001, the Millennium Cohort Study's first enrollment period was launched, collecting baseline data from over 77,000 people.  Overview  The most methodologically rigorous epidemiological study on American military personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan is funded by the US Department of Defense, and supported by military, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and civilian researchers. Over 200,000 military personnel are members of the cohort. The Millennium Cohort Study began with a random sample of US Military members including active duty, Reserve, and National Guard members from all services. Surveys are sent to this representative sample of US military personnel every three years until 2022, through email and the United States Postal Service, requesting that they submit their data online or via the mail service. Approximately 42% of Millennium Cohort participants have left military service and the study will continue to follow all participants through their Active duty, Reserve, National Guard careers and civilian endeavors.  Research  Prospective data analyses are underway to assess health outcomes including Suicide, Posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, hypertension, respiratory symptoms and illness, immune responses, chronic multi-symptom illness, CHD and CVD, and modifiable health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol use, sleep, and physical activity that may be associated with deployment in support of the current wars. Currently, more than 60% of Millennium Cohort participants have deployed in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Expansion  In 2011 the Millennium Cohort Study was expanded to include 10,000 spouses of Millennium Cohort members. The substudy, The Millennium Cohort Family Study's goal is to gain a more complete understanding of the military experience and its resultant impact on the health and well-being of service members and their families. In 2020 invitations were sent to an additional 500,000 service members, including active duty, Reserve, and National Guard personnel. Invited participants will receive an email to their Department of Defense (DoD)-registered email address. The new members will be asked to complete a confidential online survey asking for input on their individual experiences in the military. They will also be asked to participate in follow-up surveys through their military service and beyond.

He was born near Varanasi in a Brahmin family. In his childhood he went to Ghazipur to study under the tutelage of his uncle who was a follower of Ramanuja or Shri sect . After finishing his studies he travelled to many places. At Girnar in Kathiawar he was initiated into Yoga. He then came back to Ghazipur and built an underground hermitage in his house where he used to practise meditation and Yoga for days. He was noted for his humility, politeness and spirit of welfare. One night a thief entered his hermitage. When the thief ran away leaving the stolen things behind, as Pavhari Baba had woken up from sleep, he chased the thief and offered him the things he stole from his house. The incident had deep impact on the thief who later became a monk and a follower of Pavhari Baba. In 1890 Swami Vivekananda went to Ghazipur and met him. According to Sister Nivedita, Baba died by burning in 1898, which is considered as self-immolation.  Early life  Pavhari Baba gained popularity as a yogi, yet his life is shrouded with mystery. He was born in village premapur, post-premapur, Jaunpur in a Brahmin family. In his childhood he was taken to Ghazipur to study and there he lived in his uncle's house. His uncle was a Naishthika Brahmachari and a follower of Ramanuja or Shri sect. He owned a piece of land in Ghazipur which Pavhari Baba got in inheritance. He was a diligent student of Vyākaraṇa and Nyaya and had demonstrated mastery in many branches of Hindu philosophy in his youth.  Initiation into Yoga  In his youth, he visited many pilgrimages as a Brahmachari. He acquired knowledge of Dravidian languages. He had also acquaintance with the Vaishnavas of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's order. At Girnar in Kathiawar, he was first initiated into Yoga. He also became a disciple of a Sannyasi and from him he learned Advaita Vedanta.  Ascetic life at Ghazipur  Pavhari Baba owned a cottage in Ghazipur where he built an underground hermitage and used to practise Hatha yoga and meditation. After finishing his studies and travels, Pavhari Baba came back to Ghazipur, the place where he was brought up. Pavhari Baba renounced the world, worldly way of life, and built an underground hermitage (cave) where he used to stay alone with his followers one Cobra and mongoose.The cobra keeps his mani on his own head which gives bright light in the caves for study the saint. Vivekananda related this act of Pavhari Baba with the practice of Hindu yogi's who choose cave or similar spots to practice yoga where temperature is even and where there is not any distracting sound. In this cave he meditated for days. And thus he became known by the sobriquet Pavhari Baba which means pav(pawan means air, ahaari means food \\"air-eating holy man\\". People from far and wide sought to visit Baba. It is said he use to communicate with visitors from behind a wall as no one's shadow specially any women should fall on him as he was bal bramachari. Once he did not come out of his hermitage for five years and people thought he had died. But, later he came out from his place.  Remarkable incidents  Pvahari Baba was noted for his polite and kind behaviour. When he met Vivekananda he used expressions like \\"this servant\\", \\"my honour\\" etc. which surprised and pleased Vivekananda. People also used to admire his humility and spirit of welfare. Swami Nikhilananda mentioned an incident in his book Vivekananda: a biography. Once a dog ran away with a piece of bread from Pavhari Baba's hermitage which he kept as his food. Baba chased the dog, praying: \\"Please wait; my Lord; let me butter the bread for you\\". According to same biography of Nikhilananda, once a Cobra bit him, while he was suffering terrible pain, his remark was: \\"Oh, he was a messenger from my beloved.\\" One night when Pavhari Baba was sleeping, a thief entered his hermitage. When he had just finished stealing things, Pavhari Baba woke up. This frightened the thief, who then ran and abandoned his bundle of stolen items. Pavhari Baba chased the thief, caught him and requested him with folded hands to accept the goods which he had stolen from his hermitage saying: \\"All these are yours, my God\\". The thief was surprised by being addressed as \\"God\\" and felt remorse for the crime he had just committed. This incident changed the thief and he later became Pavhari Baba's disciple and gradually a saint himself.  Meeting with Swami Vivekananda  Swami Vivekananda met Pabhari Baba in Ghazipur in January–February, 1890. In January 1890, Swami Vivekananda went to Ghazipur to meet Pavhari Baba. In a letter dated 21 January 1890, Vivekananda wrote— > I reached Ghazipur three days ago... I again had a great mind to go over to > Kashi, but the object of my coming here, namely, an interview with the > Babâji (Pavhari Baba, the great saint), has not yet been realised, and. > hence the delay of a few days becomes necessary. In the next letter dated 31 January 1890, Vivekananda wrote about Baba's unwillingness to meet people. In the very next letter written just four days later, on 4 February 1890, Vivekananda informed that he had met Baba. In that letter Vivekananda wrote: > ...through supreme good fortune, I have obtained an interview with Babaji. A > great sage indeed! — It is all very wonderful, and in this atheistic age, a > towering representation of marvellous power born of Bhakti and Yoga!  Vivekananda's desire to become Baba's disciple and seeing Ramakrishna in dream  When Vivekananda went to Ghazipur, he was suffering from lumbago and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After the meeting with Baba, Vivekananda sought his refuge and desired to become his disciple. Baba also requested him to stay for few more days at Ghazipur, which Vivekananda accepted. Vivekananda wrote on 4 February 1890's letter: > I have sought refuge in his grace; and he has given me hope — a thing very > few may be fortunate enough to obtain. It is Babaji's wish that I stay on > for some days here, and he would do me some good. So following this saint's > bidding I shall remain here for some time. But the night before the religious initiation by Baba, Vivekananda reportedly had a dream in which he saw his master Ramakrishna looking at him with a melancholy face. That dream made Vivekananda realize that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he gave up the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.  Influence on Vivekananda  Though Vivekananda gave up the idea of becoming Pavhari Baba's disciple after seeing Ramakrishna's sad face in his dream the night before his religious initiation, Baba deeply influenced him. According to Sister Nivedita, Vivekananda always held Pavhari Baba second only to Ramakrishna. Vivekananda delivered a lecture \\"Sketch of the life of Pavhari Baba\\" which was later published as a booklet. Once Vivekananda asked Pavhari Baba the reason for his not coming out of his hermitage and doing service for the welfare of the society. Pavharai Baba replied: \\"Do you think that physical help is the only help possible? Is it not possible that one mind can help other minds even without the activity of the body?\\" Pavhari Baba advised Vivekananda to remain lying at the door of a teacher's house like a dog. Vivekananda interpreted this to mean staying loyal to the teacher and having patience and perseverance, which are essential to achieving success.  Death  The death of Pavhari Baba is rumoured to have been caused by his own hands, when he was near 100, while other sources have him dying peacefully in his cave. In the book The Master as I saw Him, Sister Nivedita claimed, Pabhari Baba died by burning in 1898. He did not come out of his hermitage for several days and then one day people noticed smoke coming out of his hermitage and also got smell of burning flesh. This was described as self-immolation. According to Swami Nikhilananda: > ...the saint, having come to realize the approaching end of his earthly > life, had offered his body as the last oblation to the Lord, in an act of > supreme sacrifice. Vivekananda was staying at Almora when he learned of Pavhari Baba's death.

History  After the success of the Aberdeen Student Show during the 1990s, several members of the script team, during the 1996 last night party, toyed with the idea of creating a more raucous version. For years, a substantial body of material had been rejected from the Show on the grounds that it was too \\"out of left field\\", not of a piece with the remainder of the production, or just indecent. Writers Greg Gordon, Andrew Brebner, Charles Sandison, Ewan MacGillivray and Grant Campbell started meeting on a regular basis, creating new characters and ideas. After a while, due to other commitments and relocations, only Gordon and Brebner remained; but by the end of 1997 they had enough material to put on a show. The then director of Student Show, John Hardie, was asked to direct the show, and the original cast, all Student Show alumni, were assembled. The first show, Last Tango in Powis was debuted at the Lemon Tree Theatre on 19 February 1998.  Language  The shows themselves use a large lexicon of words from the 'Doric' dialect which is particular to the North East of Scotland. Indeed it was this use of the Lowland Scots dialect that seemed to be one of the attractions to the BBC.http://www.scotsman.com/news/Fit-like-BBC-puts- Doric.5925347.jp The use of Doric allows for humour to be built on the language as well as the situations and characters in the sketches.  Influences  One of the major influences on the group is the group Scotland the What? who, like The Flying Pigs, also formed after meeting each other at the University of Aberdeen. John Hardie of the Flying Pigs is the son of Scotland the What? star, William \\"Buff\\" Hardie. The group cemented their reputation in the City and connection to STW? by performing at the 'Freedom of the City of Aberdeen' reception for Scotland the What?http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/councilnews/ci_cns/pr_whatscotland_021107.asp  Productions  *Last Tango in Powis (1998, Lemon Tree Studio Theatre) *Where Seagulls Dare (1999, Lemon Tree Studio Theatre) *Stanley Cooslick's Clockwork Sporran (2000, Lemon Tree Studio Theatre) *All Quiet on the Westburn Front (2001, Lemon Tree Studio Theatre) *Prime Cuts - The Best of Flying Pig (2001, Aberdeen Arts Centre) *The Madness of Kingwells (2002, Aberdeen Arts Centre) *The Hunchback of Walker Dam (2004, Lemon Tree Studio Theatre) *Best Back - The Best of Flying Pig (2004, HMT at Hilton) *The Seagull has Landed (2005, His Majesty's Theatre) *Desperate Fishwives- Stage Show (2007, His Majesty's Theatre) *Desperate Fishwives- Radio Show (2007, 2009, 2010, BBC Radio Scotland) *How to Look Good Glaikit (2009, His Majesty's Theatre) *Desperate Fishwives - TV Pilot (2010, BBC Scotland) *The Silence of the Bams (2011, His Majesty's Theatre) *Finzean in the Rain (2013, His Majesty's Theatre) *A Bit of Crackling (2015, His Majesty's Theatre) *The Seagull has Landed (2015, King's Theatre, Edinburgh) *Dreich Encounter (2016, His Majesty's Theatre) *Now That's What I Call Methlick (2018, His Majesty's Theatre)  BBC Scotland  In 2007 BBC Radio Scotland approached the Group, following their His Majesty's Theatre stage show, Desperate Fishwives, to make a show for radio.

A third series was broadcast in December 2010 throughout Christmas week, culminating in a special Christmas Day episode. In 2009, it was confirmed that the BBC were interested in creating a TV pilot, and in April 2010 BBC Scotland filmed this TV pilot on location in the North East using the \\"Desperate Fishwives\\" title.

Some CTUs specialise in different methodologies, such as randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, surgical trials, and health services research. Some specialise in one disease type, whereas others are generic units. Some CTUs focus on specific phases and types of clinical trials; others conduct all phases and types of trial. United Kingdom The UKCRC evaluates CTUs in the UK and they may be given either Full or Provisional CTU registration status. All Registered CTUs are required to provide evidence that their work is of high quality by demonstrating (1) experience of coordinating multi-centre randomised controlled trials or other well-designed studies, (2) a presence of a core team of expert staff to develop studies, (3) a presence of robust quality assurance systems and processes to meet appropriate regulations and legislation, and (4) evidence of longer-term viability of capacity for trials coordination and the development/maintenance of a trials portfolio. Provisional CTUs tend to be newer and evolving CTUs and have not yet built a track record but have relevant expertise and experience that is worth building on. Evaluation criteria for Provisional Registration were developed for CTUs that did not meet the criteria for Full Registration status, but that are working towards possessing sufficient expertise to enable Full Registration in the future. Medicinal clinical trials are only a subset of all trials undertaken by Registered Clinical Trials Units in the academic sector. Such Units may also specialise in surgical trials, therapy trials and other complex interventions such as educational interventions. In the United Kingdom, clinical trials of medicines are approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. This it does through its Clinical Trials Unit, which enforces standards through the Good Clinical Practice Inspectorate. In 2007, a revised version of Phase I clinical trial regulations was issued following the heavily publicized multiple organ failures in several volunteers for a study of TGN1412.

Cohen-Almagor received his D. Phil. in political theory from Oxford University in 1991, and his B.A. and M.A. from Tel Aviv University (both Magna cum Laude). In 1992-1995 he lectured at the Hebrew University Law Faculty. In 1995-2007 he taught at the University of Haifa Law School, Department of Communication, and Library and Information Studies University of Haifa. In 2019, he was Distinguished Visiting Professor to the Faculty of Laws, University College London (UCL). Raphael has served in various organizations, including as Chairperson of “The Second Generation to the Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance” Organization in Israel; Founder and Director of the Medical Ethics Think-tank at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute; member of the Israel Press Council, Chairperson of Library and Information Studies, and Founder and Director of Center for Democratic Studies, both at the University of Haifa. Cohen-Almagor was the Yitzhak Rabin - Fulbright Visiting Professor at UCLA School of Law and Dept. of Communication, Visiting Professor at Johns Hopkins University, and Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Presently he is Chair in Politics at the University of Hull, United Kingdom, and Director of the Middle East Study Group. In 2008-2009 he served as Acting Deputy Dean for Research at Hull Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Professor Cohen-Almagor has published numerous articles and book chapters in the fields of political science, law, Israel studies, philosophy, media ethics, medical ethics, education, sociology and history. Since 2000, he is writing a monthly Blog on Israeli politics, human rights concerns, scientific developments, the arts and other issues. The Blog, has more than 1000 subscribers in some thirty countries and was quoted by The Washington Post, The Ottawa Citizen, The Economist, The Jerusalem Post,The Baltimore Sun, among other newspapers.  The Democratic Catch  Cohen-Almagor argues that one of the dangers in any political system is that the principles that underlie and characterize it may, through their application, bring about its destruction. Democracy, in its liberal form, is no exception. Moreover, because democracy is a relatively young phenomenon, Cohen-Almagor asserts that it lacks experience in dealing with pitfalls involved in the working of the system. This is what he calls the “catch” of democracy.R. Cohen-Almagor, The Boundaries of Liberty and Tolerance (Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 1994); Speech, Media, and Ethics: The Limits of Free Expression (Houndmills and New York: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2005); The Scope of Tolerance (London and New York: Routledge, 2006). Cohen-Almagor maintains that the freedoms the media enjoy in covering events are respected as long as they do not imperil the basic values that underlie democracy. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right, an important anchor of democracy; but it should not be used in an uncontrolled manner.  Concern and Respect  Concern and respect are reiterated themes in Cohen-Almagor's scholarship. He argues that we should give equal consideration to the interest of others and grant equal respect to a person's life objects so long as they do not deliberately undermine the interests of others by interfering in a disrespectful manner. The popular culture of a democratic society is committed to seeking the influence of social cooperation that can be discerned on the basis of mutual respect between free and equal individuals. This line of reasoning should be supplemented, so Cohen-Almagor maintains, by our emphasis on the notion of concern, which is seen as the value of well-being. We ought to show equal concern for each individual's good, to acknowledge that human beings are not only rational creations but irrational, emotional creatures. In the context of medical ethics, treating people with concern means treating them with empathy – viewing people as human beings who may be furious and frustrated while, at the same time, are capable of smiling and crying, of careful decision-making, and of impulsive reactions. Concern means giving equal weight to a person's life and autonomy. This is a combination of mind, body, and communication between the agent and those around her bed.  Death with Dignity  Cohen- Almagor is a strong proponent of physician-assisted suicide and equally strong critic of euthanasia.R.

Cohen-Almagor, Euthanasia Policy and Practice in Belgium: Critical Observations and Suggestions for Improvement”, Issues in Law and Medicine, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Spring 2009), pp. 187-218R. Cohen-Almagor, Belgian Euthanasia Law - Critical Analysis, Journal of Medical Ethics, Vol. 35, Issue 7 (2009), pp. 436–439. Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide. People should have the ability to control the time and place of their death. Cohen-Almagor's thesis is that people, as autonomous moral agents, deserve to be treated with dignity. To treat a person with dignity requires respecting her choices and life decisions. Therefore, Cohen- Almagor calls to judge each case on its own merits and refrain from drawing sweeping conclusions that relate to categories of patients. One may try to prescribe detailed guidelines of conduct but, at the end of the day, the guidelines should be judged and evaluated in relation to each patient under consideration. The fear of sliding down the slippery-slope is, indeed, tangible. Cohen-Almagor prescribes cautionary measures and safety valves. Through real-life situations his plea for physician-assisted suicide is circumscribed.R. Cohen-Almagor, The Right to Die with Dignity: An Argument in Ethics, Medicine, and Law (Piscataway, NJ.: Rutgers University Press, 2001).  Freedom of Expression  Cohen-Almagor dedicates much of his scholarship to delineate the confines of free expression. He has formulated principles conducive to safeguarding fundamental civil rights. His focus is on the ethical question of the constraints on speech. He advances two arguments relating to the ‘Harm Principle’ and the ‘Offence Principle’. Under the ‘Harm Principle’, restrictions on liberty may be prescribed when there are sheer threats of immediate violence (incitement) against some individuals or groups. Under the ‘Offence Principle’, expressions which intend to inflict psychological offence are morally on a par with physical harm, so he argues there are grounds for abridging them. A case in point is the Illinois Supreme Court which permitted the Nazis to hold a hateful demonstration in Skokie. Cohen-Almagor argues that the decision was flawed. Similarly, allowing Jewish racists to march in an Arab town in Israel is flawed.R. Cohen-Almagor, Harm Principle, Offence Principle, and the Skokie Affair, Political Studies, Vol. XLI, No. 3 (1993), pp. 453-470. Reprinted in: Steven J. Heyman (ed.), Controversies in Constitutional Law: Hate Speech and the Constitution (New York and London: Garland Publishing Inc., 1996, Vol. II), pp. 277-294; The Offence to Sensibilities Argument as A Ground for Limiting Freedom of Expression, International Journal of Politics and Ethics, Vol. 2, Issue 2 (2002), pp. 101-117; The Offence to Sensibilities Argument as A Ground for Limiting Freedom of Expression, International Journal of Politics and Ethics, Vol. 2, Issue 3 (2002), pp. 189-209.  Social Responsibility  In recent writings, Cohen-Almagor calls to strike a balance between freedom of expression and social responsibility. Responsibility is commonly associated with accountability and answerability. We live within a community and have some responsibilities to it. The responsibilities are positive and negative. That is, we have a responsibility to better the society in which we live, and a responsibility to refrain from acting in a way that knowingly might harm our community. The responsibility is ethical in nature. We can reasonably expect people to know the difference between good and evil, and then to act accordingly. In the Internet context, Cohen-Almagor distinguishes between Netusers and Netcitizens. The term “Netuser” refers to people who use the Internet. It is a neutral term. It does not convey any clue as to how people use the Internet. It does not convey any appraisal of their use. The term “netcitizen”, on the other hand, is not neutral. It describes a responsible use of the Internet. Netcitizens are people who use the Internet as an integral part of their real life. That is to say, their virtual life is not separated from their real life. Even if they invent an identity for themselves on social networks such as Second Life, they do it in a responsible manner. They still hold themselves accountable for the consequences of their Internet use. In other words, netcitizens are good citizens of the Internet. They contribute to the Internet's use and growth while making an effort to ensure that their communications and Net use are constructive, fostering free speech, open access and social culture of respecting others, and not harming others. Netcitizens, asserts Cohen-Almagor, are netusers with a sense of responsibility.R. Cohen-Almagor, “Responsibility of and Trust in ISPs”, Knowledge, Technology and Policy, Vol. 23, Issue 3 (2010), pp. 381-396.  Multiculturalism  To what extent can liberal democracies interfere in internal affairs of their subcultures, especially when their conduct is illiberal? This question occupies much of Cohen-Almagor's scholarship on multiculturalism. In a piece co-authored with Will Kymlicka, Cohen-Alamgor contends that if an illiberal minority is seeking to oppress other groups, then intervention is justified in the name of self-defense. Both Cohen-Almagor and Kymlicka further assert that in the case of immigrants who come to a country knowing its laws, there is no objection to imposing liberal principles on them. The situation is more complicated with national minorities, particularly if (a) they were involuntarily incorporated into the larger state (as the Palestinians claim with regard to their incorporation into the Jewish state), and (b) they have their own formalized governments, with their own internal mechanisms for dispute resolution. In these circumstances, the legitimate scope for coercive intervention by the state may be limited. Cohen- Almagor and Kymlicka maintain that there are several things which liberals can do to promote respect for individual rights within non-liberal minority groups. Since a national minority which rules in an illiberal way acts unjustly, liberals have a right - indeed a responsibility - to speak out against such injustice, and to support any efforts the group makes to liberalize their culture. Since the most enduring forms of liberalization are those that result from internal reform, the primary focus for liberals outside the group should be to provide this sort of support. Moreover, incentives can be provided, in a non-coercive way, for liberal reforms. Cohen-Almagor and Kymlicka further recommend promoting the development of regional or international mechanisms for protecting human rights.Will Kymlicka and Raphael Cohen-Almagor, “Ethnocultural Minorities in Liberal Democracies”, in Maria Baghramian and Attracta Ingram (eds.), Pluralism: the philosophy and politics of diversity (London: Routledge, 2000), pp. 228-250. Reprinted in R. Cohen- Almagor (ed.), Challenges to Democracy: Essays in Honour and Memory of Isaiah Berlin (London: Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 2000), pp. 89-118.  Human Rights  Cohen-Almagor is a human rights and peace activist. He has written against administrative detention,R.

Cohen-Almagor, Israel and International Human Rights, Encyclopedia of Human Rights, ed. Frederick P. Forsythe (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), Vol. 3, pp. 247-257. the 1982 Lebanon War, and the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War.R. Cohen- Almagor and Sharon Haleva-Amir, The Israel-Hezbollah War and the Winograd Committee, Journal of Parliamentary and Political Law, Vol. II:1 (2008), pp. 113-130. He spoke in favour of separation between state and religion, women and minority rights, patients’ rights, a two state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. In 2000, he opened an international campaign to evacuate the Gaza Strip, seeing this move as the start of a Palestinian State (“Gaza First”). In late 2006 he called for early elections in Israel after he lost trust in Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the tragic architect of the Israel-Hezbollah War. This campaign ended in February 2009, when Israel held early elections that terminated the Olmert government. In 2009, Cohen-Almagor called upon Israel to institute a national enquiry commission to address all the issues mentioned in the Goldstone Report regarding Israel's war conduct during its Cast Lead Operation (2008–2009). During 2009-2011 he was engaged in a campaign which called for a prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas that would bring Gilad Shalit back home. That campaign ended in October 2011, when Gilad was united with his family, and more than 1000 Palestinians were released from Israeli jails. Since 2011, Cohen-Almagor is calling for a two state solution, believing this is the only viable and just option for both Israel and Palestine.R. Cohen-Almagor, Two-State Solution  The Way Forward, Annual Review of Law and Ethics, Vol. 18 (2012) and The Failed Peace Process in the Middle East 1993-2010, Israel Affairs, Vol. 18, No. 4 (October 2012), pp. 1-14.  Anti-Universalism  Unlike most liberals, Cohen-Almagor confines his scholarship to the democratic world. He says explicitly that he is concerned with all countries around the world, because he thinks that what he says is appropriate, simply because he is realistic. Cohen-Almagor believes that there are some basic universal needs that all people wish to secure such as food, raiment, and shelter. Sexual drives are universal and people need to have some sleep to be able continue functioning. He also believes that we should strive to universalise moral principles. But sociologically speaking we cannot ignore the fact that universal values do not underlie all societies. Some societies reject the moral notions of liberty, tolerance, autonomy, equality, and justice that liberal democracies promote. If a country is not founded on these notions, then it would be futile for us to speak about these values. Thus, his practical recommendations on freedom of expression, end-of-life and multiculturalism are restricted to the democratic world.  Grants and awards  In the course of his career, Professor Cohen-Almagor has won numerous grants, scholarships and fellowships from major institutions around the world including the Bogliasco Foundation, the British Council, the Canadian Government, The Fulbright Foundation, the Hastings Center, the Israel Ministry of Science, the Italian Foreign Office, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Volkswagen Education Foundation, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

It is the title track to his second album For Everyman, released in 1973.  Origin  Shortly after releasing his first album, Browne left Los Angeles where he'd grown up. He moved to the Bay Area of California where he looked for a house. He was invited to live with David Crosby on Crosby's boat, The Mayan. He stayed there several months, not finding a home to rent or purchase, before going on tour to support his recently finished and released album.VH1 Storytellers Classics 2000 While staying with Crosby, Browne was introduced to two of Crosby's neighbors, who also owned boats. The two friends along with Crosby, often talked about fulfilling their idyllic dream of simply sailing off into the \\"sunset,\\" presumably somewhere to the South Pacific. This was just a couple of years after Crosby, Stills & Nash had released their single \\"Wooden Ships\\" that contains the same theme. Crosby stated that the songwriters \\"imagined ourselves as the few survivors, escaping on a boat to create a new civilization.\\"Crosby, David. Liner Notes Crosby Stills & Nash Boxset, pg. 5DeCurtis, Anthony. Rolling Stone, Hall of Fame Review For Everyman, Aug. 5, 1999.DeCurtis, Anthony. Rolling Stone, Hall of Fame Review For Everyman, Aug. 5, 1999. Browne admits that the dreamers were in a bit of a \\"fog,\\" and composed his song as a response to their unrealizable dream. On his album \\"Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1,\\" Browne relays the story that the song was written \\"having spent some time with some people who were planning to sail away... I mean, and they had the boats to do it in, they knew what they were doing, they kinda had it all planned... Well, I won't say that they knew what they were doing, but they had a plan.\\" As Anthony DeCurtis told it in a 1999 retrospective album review of For Everyman, \\"The title track of Jackson Browne's second album, For Everyman, was a response to the escapist vision of Crosby, Stills and Nash's 'Wooden Ships.' As violence, fear and paranoia overtook Sixties utopianism, 'Wooden Ships' (written by Crosby and Stills, along with Paul Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane) imagined a kind of hipster exodus by sea from a straight world teetering on the edge of apocalypse: 'We are leaving/You don't need us,' the song declared. Browne wasn't giving up so easily... (He) sings in his characteristic long, fluid lines:\\" :Everybody I talk to is ready to leave with the light of the morning. :They've seen the end coming down long enough to believe that they've heard their last warning... :But all my fine dreams, well-thought-out schemes to gain the motherland :Have all eventually come down to waiting for Everyman. \\"Deliverance must come for everyone, Browne insisted, not just hippie troubadours,\\" wrote DeCurtis. Browne entitled the song \\"For Everyman,\\" taking the name for his song from the name of boat that had sailed to the South Pacific to protest the testing of nuclear weapons in the early 1960s. Crosby sings harmony on the song. Reception In her 1973 review of the album, Janet Maslin went straight to the title track as key on his second album of \\"inwardly panoramic songwriting of an apocalyptic bent:\\" \\"'For Everyman' is a more thoughtful, less impetuous reworking of 'Rock Me on the Water;' both songs provide visions of the apocalypse, but this time the image is significantly altered. 'Rock Me' was a fiery youthful fantasy shot through with contempt (and) dreams of escape... 'For Everyman' presents the crisis in gentler terms ... and offers an impassioned discerner of special wisdom ('I'm not trying to tell you that I've seen the plan/Turn and walk away if you think I am'). Most notably, the renegade spirit who once dreamed of being bathed by 'the sisters of the sun' while everything around him went up in flames is now ready to be left behind on the eve of the exodus — 'holding sand ... weighing all my fine dreams, well thought-out schemes ...,' and realizing that this time patience may make more sense than flight.\\" Critiquing the music, she wrote that she felt the song had one of the best arrangements on the album, describing how it \\"begins and ends with a low rumble from Russ Kunkel, then bursts out into a high-spirited release that mirrors the spirit of the song's resolution, simultaneously joyful and cautious.\\"Maslin, Janet. Rolling Stone, Review of For Everyman, Nov. 22, 1973.  Style  On the studio album, the song \\"For Everyman\\" is joined, through a crossfade, to the song preceding it, \\"Sing My Songs to Me.\\" This same structure is also used to join the first two songs on the album: \\"Take It Easy\\" plays into \\"Our Lady of the Well.\\" Browne, rarely, if ever, plays \\"Sing My Songs to Me\\" in concert when playing \\"For Everyman.\\" References Category:1973 singles Category:Songs written by Jackson Browne Category:Folk rock songs ","title":"For Everyman (song)"},{"id":"26955336","title":"MTHFD1L"},{"id":"26955350","text":"The Mynx Vascular Closure Device is an extravascular vascular closure device (VCD) whose deployment system is designed to minimize the discomfort commonly associated with closing the small hole in the artery following catheterization procedure. The device is manufactured by AccessClosure, Inc., a medical device company located in Mountain View, California. History The Mynx received FDA Premarket Approval (PMA) in May, 2007.US FDA/CDRH: New Device Approval – Mynx Vascular Closure System. https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/PMAApprovals/default.htm Retrieved April 2, 2010 Device description The device uses a soft, sponge- like sealant material to close the small hole in the femoral artery. The sealant works by rapidly absorbing blood and fluids around the puncture site, swelling in size and covering the hole. This seals the hole and stops the bleeding. The sealant material consists of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a water- soluble, non-thrombogenic, conformable, bio-inert polymer. PEG has an established safety profileD. Scheinert MD, et al.

Procedure The device utilizes a gentle, extravascular deployment method, which avoids cinching or tugging of the artery by placing the sealant on the outside of the artery.

The borough of Wallingford: Introduction and castle, A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3 (1923), pp. 517-531 Date accessed: 14 April 2010 History Chalmore Lock was built in 1838 by the Thames Navigation Commissioners at a place called Chalmore Hole between Cleeve Lock and Benson Lock. It was built as a summer or low-water lock. For much of the time the lock was open at both ends and the fall was only 18 inches when the water level reached its lowest in summer. It was described at the time of construction as \\"a weir and two pairs of gates similar to pound gates to pass boats when the weir is shut in\\". Its usefulness was demonstrated shortly after its construction, when a barge stranded upstream in the shallows was set in motion within five minutes of closing the gates. The lock was provided with a lock keeper and tolls were exacted for its use. However it fell into disrepair, and the Thames Conservancy was anxious to remove it. Nevertheless, from 1874 onwards, the inhabitants of Wallingford campaigned strongly to keep the lock fearing consequences to the town of its removal.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles pp197-200 In 1881 Thames Conservancy dredged the river below Wallingford Bridge at \\"enormous cost\\" and in the winter floating ice swept away much of the weir.South Oxfordshire District Council & Vale of White Horse District Council - Strategic Flood Risk Assessment Appendices In 1883 the lock was finally removed. Literature and the media Chalmore Lock gives rise to an anecdote in Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome.

Until 2001 it was part of the former district of Wilmersdorf. Geography Schmargendorf borders with the localities of Grunewald (with Grunewald Forest) in the west, Halensee in the north, Wilmersdorf in the north and east, as well as Dahlem (this one in Steglitz- Zehlendorf borough) in the south. The northeastern border with Berlin's inner city is marked by the Ringbahn line of the Berlin S-Bahn and the Stadtring motorway. History Village church The village in the Margraviate of Brandenburg was first mentioned as des or ’s Margreven Dorp (literally ) in 1354, contracted to Low German Smargendorp and later adapted to High German standard as Schmargendorf.One can find a comparable name construction with an abbreviated ’s with 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands, being one of the areas from where many then settlers in Brandenburg originated. It was probably established about 1220 by German settlers in the course of the Ostsiedlung under the co-ruling Ascanian Margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg, after the former Slavic territories had been conquered by their great- grandfather Albert the Bear. During the growth of the City of Berlin after the 1871 unification of Germany, many peasants profited by the real estate speculation, when Schmargendorf on the eastern rim of the Grunewald forest became a popular residential area. In 1899 the former village was separated from neighbouring Wilmersdorf and received municipal rights within the Brandenburgian Landkreis Teltow, whereafter the residents had the lavish Neo- Gothic town hall erected in 1902. On 1 October 1920 Schmargendorf was incorporated into Berlin by the \\"Greater Berlin Act\\".

This Vararuci is often identified with Kātyāyana. Kātyāyana is the author of Vārtikās which is an elaboration of certain sūtrās (rules or aphorisms) in Pāṇini's much revered treatise on Sanskrit grammar titled Aṣṭādhyāyī. Kātyāyana is believed to have flourished in the 3rd century BCE. However, this identification of Vararuci with Kātyāyana has not been fully accepted by scholars. Vararuci is believed to be the author of Prākrita Prakāśa the oldest treatise on the grammar of Prākrit language. Vararuci's name appears in a verse listing the 'nine gems' (navaratnas) in the court of one Samrat Vikramaditya. Vararuci appears as a prominent character in Kathasaritsagara (\\"ocean of the streams of stories\\"), a famous 11th century collection of Indian legends, fairy tales and folk tales as retold by a Saivite Brahmin named Somadeva.The Aithihyamala of Kottarathil Shankunni states that Vararuchi was the son of Govinda Swami i.e. Govinda Bhagavatpada. It also states that King Vikramadithya, Bhatti- minister of King Vikramaditya and Bhartruhari were his brothers. Vararuci is the father figure in a legend in Kerala popularly referred to as the legend of the twelve clans born of a pariah woman (Parayi petta panthirukulam). Vararuci of Kerala legend was also an astute astronomer believed to be the author of Chandravākyas (moon sentences), a set of numbers specifying the longitudes of the Moon at different intervals of time. These numbers are coded in the katapayādi system of numeration and it is believed that Vararuci himself was the inventor of this system of numeration. The eldest son of Vararuci of Kerala legend is known as Mezhathol Agnihothri and he is supposed to have lived between 343 and 378 CE. The name Vararuchi is associated with more than a dozen works in Sanskrit, and the name Katyayana is associated with about sixteen works. There are around ten works connected with astronomy and mathematics associated with the name of Vararuci. Vararuci, the astronomer Possibly there are at least three persons named Vararuci in the astronomical tradition of South India. Vararuci (Kerala, fourth century CE) This Vararuchi is the father figure in the astronomical tradition of Kerala. He is also the father figure in the legend of the twelve clans born of the Pariah woman. The eldest son of this Vararuci, the establisher of the first of the twelve clans, was one Mezhattol Agnihotri and he is supposed to have lived between 343 and 378 CE. Based on this, Vararuci is supposed to have lived in the first half of the 4th century CE. The manuscript tradition of Kerala ascribes to Vararuci the authorship of Chandravākyās (moon sentences)Chandravākyāni (Moon sentences of Vararuci) Ed. as Appendix II in Vākyakaraṇa. Ed. T.S. Kuppanna Sastri and K.V. Sarma, Madras, Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute, 1962, pp. 135 – 249. which is a set of 248 numbers for calculating the position of the sun and moon. This work is also known by the name Vararuci-Vākyās. Vararuci is also believed to be the originator of the Katapayadi notation of depicting numbers, which has been used in the formulation of Chandravākyās. Vararuci (Tamil Nadu, 13th century CE) This astronomer is the author of the well-known Vākyakaraṇa, which is the source book of the Vākya Panchānga, popular in South India, especially the Tamil region. This Vararuchi belonged to the Tamil region, as is clear from the introductory verses of the work. It has been shown that this treatise was originally produced around 1282 BCE, presumably in Kanchi in Tamil Nadu. The treatise is also known as Vākyapañcādhyāyī and is based on the works of Haridatta (c. 650 CE) of Kerala. Sundararaja, an astronomer from Tamil Nadu contemporaneous with Nilakantha Somayaji, has composed a commentary on Vākyakarana and the commentary contains several references to Vararuci. In five chapters Vākyakaraṇa deals with all aspects of astronomy required for the preparation of the Hindu almanac. Chapter I is concerned with the computation of the sun, the moon and the moon's nodes, Chapter II with that of the planets. Chapter III is devoted to problems involving time, position and direction and other preliminaries like the precession of the equinoxes. Chapter IV deals with the computation of the lunar and solar eclipses. Chapter V is devoted to computation of the conjunction of the planets and of the planets and stars. Vararuci (several persons) We could see many texts ascribed to Vararuci such as Kerala-Vararuchi-Vakya, Kerala-Vararuchi-proktha, Kerala-dvādaśa-bhāva-vākyāni, Vararuchi-Kerala, Bhārgava-pañcāṅga etc. The Vararuchi, who is the author of the above works on astrology might be identical to Vararuchi of Kerala, but it is not possible to assert that he is the same as the author of the Chandra-Vākyās. Vararuci, the grammarian=The author of Vartikas In ancient India, grammar was the first and most important of all sciences. When one had first studied grammar, he could go in for learning any other science. This historical mindset justifies the great respect and prestige attributed to the ancient grammarians of India like Pāṇini and Patanjali. Pāṇini was an ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian from Pushkalavati, Gandhara (fl. 4th century BCE). He is known for his Sanskrit grammar text known as Aṣṭādhyāyī (meaning \\"eight chapters\\"). The Ashtadhyayi is one of the earliest known grammars of Sanskrit. After Pāṇini, the Mahābhāṣya (\\"great commentary\\") of Patañjali on the Ashtadhyayi is one of the three most famous works in Sanskrit grammar. It was with Patañjali that Indian linguistic science reached its definite form. Kātyāyana (c. 3rd century BCE) was a Sanskrit grammarian, mathematician and Vedic priest who lived in ancient India. He is known as the author of the Varttika, an elaboration on Pāṇini grammar. Along with the Mahābhāsya of Patañjali, this text became a core part of the vyākarana (grammar) canon. (A vārttika is defined as a single remark or a whole work attempting to present a detailed commentary.) In many accounts Katyayana has been referred to as Vararuci. Kātyāyana's Vārtikās correct, supplement, eliminate as unnecessary, or justify the rules of Pāṇini. For more references on work relating to Kātyāyana's Vārtikās : In his Vajasaneyi Pratisakhya, he subjected about 1500 sutras of Panini to critical observations. A Prākṛt grammarian The term Prākṛt denotes a multitude of languages all originated from Sanskrit. They are all considered as derived from Sanskrit and developed by adopting deviations and by corruption. This is a group of Middle Indic, Indo-Aryan languages, derived from Old Indic dialects. There is no complete agreement on what languages are to be included in this group. Prakrit is also closely connected with the development of Buddhist and Jaina philosophical thought. Vararuci is the name of the author of the oldest extant grammar of Prakrit, titled Prākṛt Prakāśa. In this work Vararuci has considered four different dialects: Maharashtri the older form of Marathi, Sauraseni which evolved into the Braj language, Magadhi the former form of Bihari, and Paisaci a language no longer extant. The book is divided into twelve chapters. The first nine chapters containing a total of 424 rules are devoted to Maharashtri and of the remaining three chapters one each is devoted to Paisaci with 14 rules, Māgadhi with 17 rules, and Sauraseni with 32 rules respectively. The author of Prakrita Prakasa was also known by the name Katyayana, perhaps the gotra name of Vararuci. This gotra name was given to him by the unknown author of a commentary of Prakrita Prakasa named Prakritamanjari. In Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara and Kshemendra's Brihatkathamanjari one can see that Katyayana was called Vararuci. The oldest commentator of Prakrita Prakasa was Bhamaha an inhabitant of Kashmir who was also a rhetorician as well as a poet. Vararuci Śulbasūtras The Śulbasūtras are appendices to the Vedas which give rules for constructing altars. They are the only sources of knowledge of Indian mathematics from the Vedic period. There are several Śulbasūtras. The most important of these are the Baudhayana Śulbasūtra written about 800 BCE, the Apastamba Śulbasūtra written about 600 BCE, Manava Śulbasūtra written about 750 BCE and the Katyayana Śulbasūtra written about 200 BCE. Since Katyayana has been identified with one Vararuci, possibly the author of the Vartikas, Katyayana Śulbasūtra is referred to as Vararuci Śulbasūtra also. Vararuci, the littérateur Vararuci was also a legendary figure in the Indian lterary tradition. Author of Ubhayabhisarika Though littérateur Vararuci is recorded to have composed several Kavyas, only one complete work is currently extant. This is a satirical monologue titled Ubhayabhisarika. The work titled Ubhayabhisarika (The mutual elopement) appears in a collection of four monologues titled Chaturbhani, the other monologues in the collection being Padma-prabhritaka (The lotus gift) by Shudraka, Dhurta-vita-samvada (Rogue and pimp confer) by Isvaradatta and Padataditaka (The kick) by Shyamalika. The collection along with an English translation has been published in Clay Sanskrit Library under the title The Quartet of Causeries. Ubhayabhisarika is set in Pataliputra and it is dated to somewhere between 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE. It might be the earliest Indian play extant. Some scholars are of the opinion that the work was composed in the 5th century CE. Other works He is also said to have written two kavyas by names Kanthabharana (The necklace) and Charumati. There are several verses ascribed to Vararuci appearing in different literary works. Other works attributed to Vararuci are: Nitiratna, a book with didactic contents; Niruktasamuccaya, a commentary on the Nirukta of Yaska; Pushpasutra, a Pratishakhya of the Samaveda; a lexicon; and, an alamkara work. Vararuci, a 'gem' in the court of Samrat Vikramaditya Vararuci's name appears in a Sanskrit verse specifying the names of the 'nine gems' (navaratnas) in the court of the legendary Samrat Vikramaditya who is said to have founded the Vikrama era in 57 BCE. This verse appears in Jyotirvidabharana,For information about this treatise see : which is supposed to be a work of the great Kalidasa but is in fact a late forgery. This verse appears in the last chapter (Sloka 20 : Chapter XXII) of Jyotirvidabharana. That the great Kalidasa is the author of Jyotirvidabharana is difficult to believe because Varahamihira, one of the nine gems listed in the verse, in his Pancasiddhantika refers to Aryabhata, who was born in 476 CE and wrote his Aryabhatiya in 499 CE or a little later. Jyotirvidabharana is a later work of about 12th century CE. There might have been a very respected Vararuci in the court of one King Vikrama, but the identities of the particular Vararuci and the King Vikrama are uncertain. The names of the nine gems are found in the following Sanskrit verse: dhanvantarikṣapaṇakāmarasiṃhaśaṅku vetālabhaṭṭa ghaṭakarpara kālidāsāḥ  khyāto varāhamihiro nṛpate sabhāyāṃ ratnāni vai vararucirnava vikramasyā  The names of the nine gems and their traditional claims to fame are the following: *Dhanvantari (a medical practitioner), Kshapanaka (probably Siddhasena, a Jain monk, author of Dvatrishatikas), Amarasimha (author of Amarakosha, a thesaurus of Sanskrit ), Sanku (little known), Vetalabhatta (a Maga Brahmin known as the author of the sixteen stanza Niti-pradeepa (the lamp of conduct) in tribute to Vikramaditya), Ghatakarpara (author of Ghatakarpara-kavya (in which a wife sends a message, reverse of Meghaduta)), Kalidasa (a renowned classical Sanskrit writer, widely regarded as the greatest poet and dramatist in the Sanskrit language), Varahamihira (astrologer and astronomer), and Vararuchi (poet and grammarian). Vararuci of Kerala legends There are several versions of these legends. One of these versions is given in Castes and tribes of Southern India by Edgar Thurston. This seven volume work is a systematic and detailed account of more than 300 castes and tribes in the erstwhile Madras Presidency and the states of Travancore and Cochin. It was originally published in 1909. The Vararuci legend is given in Volume 1 (pp. 120 – 125) in the discussion on the Paraiyan caste. Thurston has recorded that the discussion is based on a note prepared by L.K. Anantha Krishna Aiyar. A slight variant of the legend can be seen in Aithihyamala by Kottarathil Sankunny (1855–1937). This work originally written in Malayalam and published as a series of pamphlets during the years 1909 – 1934 is a definitive source of myths and legends of Kerala. (An English language translation of the work has recently been published under the title Lore and Legends of Kerala.) The story of Vararuci is given in the narration of the legend of Parayi petta panthirukulam. Legend as per Castes and tribes of Southern India  In these legends, Vararuchi, a son of a Brahmin named Chandragupta and his Brahmin wife who was an astute astrologer, became king of Avanti and ruled till Vikramāditya, son of Chandragupta by his Kṣatriya wife came of age and the king abdicated in his favor. Once when he was resting under an aśvastha (ficus religiosa) tree he happened to overhear a conversation between two Gandharvās on the tree to the effect that he would marry a certain, just then born, paraiya girl. This he tried to prevent by arranging, with the help of the king, to have the girl enclosed in a box and floated down a river with a nail stuck into her head. After floating down the river through a long distance, the box came into the hands of a Brāhman who was bathing in the river. Finding a beautiful and charming little girl inside the box and accepting it as a divine gift he adopted her as his own daughter and helped her groom up accordingly. Vararuci in his travels happened to pass by the house of this Brāhman and the Brāhman invited him to lunch with him. Vararuci accepted the invitation on condition that the Brāhman had to prepare eighteen curries and would give him what remained after feeding a hundred other Brāhmans. The host was puzzled. But his adopted daughter was unfazed. She placed a long plantain leaf in front of Vararuci and served a preparation using ginger (symbolically corresponding to eighteen curries) and some rice which had been used an offering at the Vaisvadeva ceremony (symbolically equivalent to feeding a hundred a Brāhmans). Knowing this to be the work of the host's daughter and fully convinced of her superior intellect Vararuci expressed his desire to marry her. The desire was acceded to by the Brāhman. Days passed. One day while conversing with his wife about their past lives he accidentally saw a nail stuck in her head and he immediately knew her to be the girl whom he caused to be floated down a river. He realised the impossibility of altering one's fate and resolved to go on a pilgrimage with his wife bathing in rivers and worshiping at temples. At the end of these pilgrimages they reached Kerala and while in Kerala the woman bore him twelve children. All these children, except one, were abandoned on the wayside and were picked up members of different castes and were brought up according to the customs and traditions of those castes. They were all remarkable for their wisdom, gifted with the power of performing miracles, and were all believed to incarnations of Viṣṇu. These children are known by the names: Statue of Nārānat Bhrāntan (The madman of Nārāṇatt), one of the twelve children of Vararuci of Kerala legends. *Mezhathol Agnihotri (a Brāhman who had performed Yajñam or Yāgam ninety-nine times), Pākkanār (a Paraiya, bamboo basket maker by profession), Perumtaccan (a master carpenter and an expert in Vāsthu), Rajakan (a sage and a learned man raised by a washerman), Vallon (a Paraiya, sometimes identified with the Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar who composed Thirukkural), Vaduthala Nair (a Nair, an expert in martial arts), Uppukootan (a Muslim, a trader in salt and cotton), Akavūr Cāttan (a Vysya, a manager of Akavur Mana), Kārakkal Amma (Kṣatriya woman, the only girl of the twelve children), Pānanār (a Pānan, a singer in Thiruvarangu), Nārānat Bhrāntan (a Brahman, the madman of Nārāṇatt), and Vāyillākunnilappan (not adopted by anybody, deified as the god of silence sanctified on the top of a hill). There are several legends about these children of Vararuci. In one such legend, Pākkanār tries to dissuade a group of Brāhmans who had resolved to go to Benares from so doing, by telling them that the journey to the sacred city would not be of productive of salvation. To prove the fruitlessness of the journey, he plucked a lotus flower from a stagnant pool and gave it to the Brāhmans and instructed them to give it to a hand which would rise from the Ganges and to say that it was a present for Goddess Ganga from Pākkanār. They did as directed and returned with news of the miracle. Pākkanār then led them to a stagnant pool and said: \\"Please return the lotus flower, Oh! Ganga!\\". According to the legend, the same lotus flower instantly appeared in his hand. Legend as per Aithihyamala There is another legend regarding the circumstances leading to Vararuci’s arrival in Kerala. In this legend, Vararuci appears as a very learned scholar in the court of Vikramaditya. Once King Vikramaditya asked Vararuci to tell him about the most important verses in the whole of Valmiki's Ramayana. Since Vararuci could not give an immediate answer, the King granted him 40 days to find out the same and to report back to the king. If he were unable to find the correct answer, he would be required to leave the court. Vararuci left the court in search of an answer and during his wanderings, on the last night of the stipulated period, Vararuci happened to rest under a tree. While half awake and half asleep Vararuci happened to overhear a conversation of the Vanadevatas resting on the tree regarding the fate of a newly born Paraiah infant girl and they were telling each other that the poor Brāhman who does not know that the verses beginning with \\"māṃ viddhi..\\" is the most important verse in Ramayana would marry her. Vararuci most pleased with his discovery returned to the court and told the king the surprising answer. The king was very pleased and Vararuci prevailed upon Vikramiditya to destroy all pariah infant girls recently born in a certain locality. The girl was not killed instead was floated down a river with a nail stuck through the heads. The rest of the legend is as described in the first version of the legend. Vararuci of Kathasaritsagara Kathasaritsagara (\\"ocean of the streams of stories\\") is a famous 11th century collection of Indian legends, fairy tales and folk tales as retold by a Saivite Brahmin named Somadeva. Nothing is known about the author other than that his father's name was Ramadevabatta. The work was compiled for the entertainment of the queen Suryamati, wife of king Anantadeva of Kashmir (r. 1063–81). It consists of 18 books of 124 chapters and more than 21,000 verses in addition to prose sections. Vararuchi's story is told in great detail in the first four chapters of this great collection of stories. The following is a very brief account of some of the main events in the life of Vararuchi as told in this classic. It emphasises the divine ancestry and magical powers of Vararuchi. Once Pārvati pleaded with Shiva to tell her a story nobody had heard before. After much persuasions Shiva agreed and narrated the story of Vidyadharas. To ensure that nobody else would hear the story, Parvati had ordered that nobody be allowed to enter the place where they were and Nandi (The Vehicle of Lord Shiva) kept guard at the door. While Shiva was thus speaking to his consort in private thus, Pushpadanta, one of Shiva's trusted attendants, a member of his gana, appeared at the door. Having denied entry and overcame by curiosity, Pushpadanta summoned his special powers to move about unseen and entered the chamber of Shiva and eavesdropped the entire story as told by Shiva. Pushpadanta then narrated the entire story to his wife Jaya and Jaya retold the same to Parvati! Parvati became enraged and told Shiva: \\"Thou didst tell me any extraordinary tale, for Jaya knows it also.\\" Shiva, due to his meditational powers, immediately knew the truth and told Parvati of the role of Pushpadanta in leaking the story to Jaya. Having heard this, Parvati became exceedingly enraged and cursed Pushpadanta to be mortal. Then he together with Jaya fell at Parvati's feet and entreated her to say when the curse would end. \\"A Yaksha named Supratîka, who has been made a Pisacha by the curse of Kuvera, is residing in the Vindhya forest under the name of Kāṇabhūti. When thou shalt see him, and calling to mind thy origin, tell him this tale; then thou shalt be released from this curse.\\" Pushpadanta was born as a mortal under the name of Vararuchi in the city called Kausāṃbi. Somadatta, a Brāhman, was his father, and Vasudatta his mother. Vararuchi was also known as Kātyāyana. At the time of his birth there was a heavenly pronouncement that he would be known as Varauchi because of his interest (ruchi) in the best (vara) things. It was also pronounced that he would be a world-renowned authority on grammar. Vararuchi was divinely blessed with a special gift: who could get anything by heart by hearing only once. In course of time Vararuchi became a student of Varsha along with Indradatta and Vyādi. Though Vararuchi was defeated by Pāṇini in a test of scholarship, Vararuchi by hard work excelled Pāṇini in grammar. Later Vararuchi became a minister to King Yogananda of Pāṭaliputra. Once he went on a visit to the shrine of Durgā. Goddess Durga, being pleased with his austerities, ordered him in a dream to go to the forests of the Vindhya to behold Kāṇābhūti. Proceeding to Vindhya, he saw, surrounded by hundreds of Piśāchas, that Paiśācha Kāṇābhūti, in stature like a śāla tree. When Kāṇābhūti had seen him and respectfully clasped his feet, Kātyāyana sitting down immediately spoke to him thus: \\"Thou art an observer of the good custom, how hast thou come into this state?\\" When Kāṇābhūti finished his story, Vararuchi remembered his origin, and exclaimed like one aroused from sleep: \\"I am that very Pushpadanta, hear that tale from me.\\" and Vararuchi told all his history from his birth at full length. Vararuchi then went to the tranquil site of the hermitage of Badarî. There he, desirous of putting off his mortal condition, resorted for meditation with intense devotion to that goddess and she, manifesting her real form to him, told him the secret of that meditation which arises from fire, to help him to put off the body. Then Vararuchi, having consumed his body by that form of meditation, reached his own heavenly home. Vararuci in Pancatantra The characters in one of the several stories in Pancatantra are King Nanda and Vararuci. This story appear as the fifth story titled A Three in One Story in Strategy Four : Loss of Gains. Once upon a time, there was a much respected popular king called Nanda. He had a minister called Vararuchi. He was a very learned man well versed in philosophy and statecraft. Vararuchi's wife was one day annoyed with her husband and kept away from him. Extremely fond of his wife, the minister tried every possible tactics he could think of to please her. Every method failed. Finally he pleaded with her: \\"Tell me what can I do to make you happy.\\" The wife said sarcastically: \\"Shave your head cleanly and prostrate before me, then I will be happy.\\" The minister meekly complied with her wish and succeeded in winning back her company and love. King Nanda’s queen also enacted the same drama of shunning his company. Nanda tried every trick he knew of to win her affection. King also failed in his efforts. Then the King fell on her feet and prayed: \\"My darling, I cannot live without you even for a while. Tell me what should I do to win back your love?\\" The queen said: \\"I will be happy if you pretend to be a horse, agree to be bridled and to let me ride you. While racing you must neigh like a horse. Is this acceptable to you?\\" \\"Yes,\\" said the king and he did as his wife demanded. Next day, the king saw Vararuchi with a shaven head and asked him, \\"Vararuchi, why have you shaved your head all of a sudden?\\" Vararuchi replied: \\"O king, is there anything that a woman does not demand and a man does not readily concede? He would do anything, shave his head or neigh like a horse.\\" Raktamukha, the monkey, then told Karalamukha, the crocodile: \\"You wicked crocodile, you are a slave of your wife like Nanda and Vararuchi. You tried to kill me but your chatter gave away your plans.\\" That’s why the learned have said: Silence is golden. Parrots sing and betray Their presence to the hunter. The crane eludes the hunter By keeping his beak tightly shut.

History The LNMA Mykola Lysenko traces its origins to earlier music institutions in Lviv, going back to the 19th century, when Franz Xaver Mozart created the Saint Cecilia Society. In 1838, the first music society of Lviv was created under the name of Society for Teaching of Music in Galicia (). This by 1848 had become the Galician Music Society. In 1854, the society opened its Music Conservatory. Its first director was a pianist and composer Karol Mikuli, a pupil of Chopin, and in different years among the teachers were Ludwig Marek, Mieczysław Sołtys, his son Adam Sołtys, Henryk Melcer-Szczawiński, Józef Koffler, Ludomir Różycki, Vilém Kurz, Jan Gall, Wilhelm Stengel and others. The list of alumni includes some of the most renowned musicians of the 19th and the early 20th century Central Europe. Among them were composers Zdzisław Jachimecki, Vasyl Barvinsky, and Roman Palester; pianists such as Moritz Rosenthal, Mieczysław Horszowski, Raoul Koczalski, Stefan Askenase, and Aleksander Michałowski; and singers such as Adam Didur (bass), Solomiya Krushelnytska (soprano), Aleksander Myszuga (tenor), Marcelina Sembrich (coloratura soprano). Among the notable graduates were also Irena Anders, Olga Drahonowska-Małkowska, Henryk Mikolasch, Zofia Terné, and Ida Fink. As the education in most institutions of higher education in Austro-Hungarian Galicia was carried out mostly in Polish and German languages, in 1903 the Ukrainian minority of Lviv founded a separate Higher Musical Institute of Mykola Lysenko (). Its teachers included Stanyslav Lyudkevych and Vasyl Barvinsky, and among the students were Roman Sawycky, Daria Gordinskaya-Karanovich, and Galina Levitskaya. Simultaneously, the Galician Music Society continued to exist and prosper, and soon was renamed to the Polish Music Society in Lviv. Its conservatory, financing the society's daily operations, moved to a new building at Chorążczyzny Street (presently occupied by the Lviv Regional Philharmonic). Partially thanks to the Society's teachers, in 1911 the Lviv University opened a faculty of musicology, led by musicologist Adolf Chybiński. During World War I, the conservatory continued to function, but the Russian occupation of the city forced most of its students and teachers into a brief exile. A short-lived branch of the Polish Music Society was opened in Vienna. After the war, both Polish and Ukrainian societies continued to coexist until 1939. Following the joint Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland, the city had been occupied by the Soviet Union. Both societies were merged with the University's faculty of musicology into a new Lviv State Conservatory, M.V. Lysenko (). Following the war, the city was permanently annexed by the Soviet Union, and the conservatory continued to exist in a building formerly occupied by Academy of Foreign Trade in Lwów. However, after 1944 most of its Polish teachers and students were expelled, forced to emigrate and continued their careers in post-war Poland or abroad. Likewise, some Ukrainian teachers of the Higher Music Institute continued activities in exile in New York, from 1947, under the leadership of Roman Sawycky (1907–1960), creating the Ukrainian Music Institute of America. After the war, teachers in Lviv included Vsevolod Zaderatsky. Since 1992, the conservatory was called Higher State Music Institute. M.V. Lysenko and was changed in 2000 to Lviv State Musical Academy M.V. Lysenko. On September 13, 2007, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko signed a decree conferring the national status on the Lviv State Music Academy. Recent and current teachers at LNMA include: composers Mykola Kolessa, Myroslav Skoryk, conductor Yuri Lutsiv, Maria Boyko, organist Vladimir Ignatenko, professor of singing Igor Kushpler, violinist Lydia Shutko, director Igor Pilatyuk, pianist Oleg Krishtalsky, pianist Maria Krushelnytska, pianist Josef Ermin, pianist Ethella Chuprik, and others.

He became 2nd Duke of Cardona in 1513 and was also Viceroy of Sicily. Fernando's father Juan Ramón Folch IV de Cardona (1446–1513) was awarded the title Duke of Cardona in 1491 by King Ferdinand II of Aragón. Fernando's grandfather was Juan Ramon Folch de Cardona, 3rd count of Cardona, a.k.a. Juan Ramon Folch III, 3rd count of Cardona, 6th count of Prades, 3rd count of Cardona and Viceroy of Sicily (1477–1479). Fernand was also 2nd Marquis of Pallars, 7th Count of Prades, Viscount of Villamur, Baron of Entenza, Great Constable and Admiral of Aragon as well as a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece invested in 1519 by King Charles I of Spain. He was also made Grandee of Spain in 1520. Coat of Arms of the family Cardona, Barons, Viscounts, Counts, (since 1375), and Dukes, (since 1491), successively, since their beginnings around the 11th century, from the kingdom of Aragon - Catalonia. Their titles, several times linked with royal connections, were passed through male or female inheritors. Súria and Cardona, in Catalonia have provided for over 1000 years potassium salts for dried meat keeping and gunpowder manufacturing. A \\"Cardo\\" in Spanish is a \\"Thistle\\" plant for the Scots, hence, their coat of arms. Family and children He was married on 17 February 1498, at Epila, Zaragoza, Spain, to Francisca Manrique de Lara (deceased at Arbeca, prov. of Lerida on 21 August 1529), daughter of Pedro Manrique de Lara III, 1st duke of Nájera and the Portuguese Guiomar de Castro y Acuña. Francisca was the sister of Antonio Manrique de Lara, 2nd duke of Nájera. Don Fernando and Doña Francisca had no sons, but four daughters of whom the eldest, Juana Folch De Cardona y Manrique de Lara (Juana I, born circa 1490), inherited her father's titles — including the honour of Grandee of Spain — on her father's death in November 1543. Genealogical notes on the 3rd and 4th ruling duchesses of Cardona, Juana I, (1490 — start 1543 — 1564) and Juana II, (1530 — start 1564 — 1608)=Juana I Folch de Cardona Juana I had been married in Segorbe, 1516, to Alfonso de Aragon, 2nd duke of Segorbe, (1489–1563), a.k.a. Alfonso de Aragon y Portugal. The couple had 13 children (he had at least one more), of which only one son, Francisco, later Francisco de Aragón, 3rd duke of Segorbe, a.k.a. Francisco de Aragon y Folch de Cardona and 4th duke of Cardona, as well as four daughters, used their family names as \\"Aragon y Folch de Cardona\\". Juana II Folch de Cardona The eldest daughter was called Juana like her mother; as a token of remembrance of the Cardona family, she used the inherited ruling title Juana Folch de Cardona, 4th duchess of Cardona, but without the customary \\"Aragon\\" used by her father, the 2nd duke of Segorbe, her brother, Francisco, the 3rd duke of Segorbe, and by her sisters. Eventually, Juana II, sometimes described as 5th duchess, counting her brother named as Folch de Aragon but not Folch de Cardona, however, was the successor of Juana I, 3rd duchess of Cardona. She would marry Diego Fernandez de Cordoba, 3 marquis of Comares, a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, a.k.a. \\"El Africano\\" because of his long residential times in surrounding Muslim areas in North Africa, strongholds of Imperial Spain. Born in Oran, now in Algeria, in 1524, he died in his lands of Arbeca, Lerida, Catalonia, in 1601. Their son, Luis Ramon, died in 1596 before his mother Juana II, now 4th duchess of Cardona. Therefore, Juana's grandson Enrique de Aragón Folc de Cardona y Córdoba, born 1588 in Andalusia and deceased December 1640 in Perpignan, France) became the 5th Duke of Cardona in 1608. Some of Luis Ramon's brothers and sisters used the family name \\"Aragon\\" deriving from their Segorbe dukes ancestry; such did eldest daughter Juana de Córdoba Cardona y Aragón; while the \\"Fernandez De Cordoba\\" name was used by others as well. This is a fact probably alien to the European nobility but it was not very uncommon for the great Spanish nobility families of the Empire for several hundred years. Thus, the study of notorious old family pressure groups and rather elusive \\"power lobbies\\" could be very complicated and erroneous or at least misleading to process, without today's computer info retrievals, indeed, at least in the Spanish case. For example Antonio Fernández de Córdoba y Cardona who married Juana de Córdoba Cardona y Aragón, was NOT immediate family. The ducal coat of arms of the Segorbe dukes, a group of the \\"Aragon\\" family names, grafted to the \\"Folch de Cardona\\" family, who had their own much simpler ducal coat of arms, married since 1516, but keeping both family names depending on circumstances, group of influence, administrated lands, etc. Since the middle of the 16th century a line of the \\"Fernandez de Cordoba\\" families was grafted, too. The uses of the family names, \\"Aragon\\", \\"Folch de Cardona\\" and \\"Fernandez de Cordoba\\" could depend on personal circumstances, wealth and lands, etc. By the beginnings of the 18th century, they became intertwined with the dukes of Medinaceli who started to use \\"Fernandez de Cordoba\\", as the original \\"de la Cerda\\" ducal family ended their complicated family saga becoming political prisoners of the new Bourbon Royal Family, dying while in prison at Pamplona, Spain, in 1711. The actual duchess, holding a surprising number of all kinds of titles, several of them dukedoms, is a \\"Fernandez de Cordoba\\". The dukes of Medinaceli coat of arms. The dukedoms of Segorbe and Cardona consolidated together by marriages in 1516. By the second half of the 16th century, the 4th ruling duke, duchess Juana II Folch de Cardona, deceased 1608 had married the Andalusian 3rd marquis of Comares, a title of lesser rank, a \\"Fernandez de Cordoba\\", named \\"El Africano\\", because he was born in 1523, and lived for very long times in the Spanish naval strongholds in Algeria and Morocco, North Africa. At the beginnings of the 18th century the last \\"La Cerda\\" dukes of Medinaceli, descending from first rate medieval Castilian royalty through a woman who had married nevertheless a bastard of the French Counts of Foix towards the ends of the 14th century died in prison at Pamplona, Spain, in 1711, of the new Spanish Bourbon royal dynasty. Co-lateral \\"Fernandez de Cordoba\\" relatives received all these reunited dukedoms. The actual \\"ruling\\" duchess, head of all these ducal houses and many other interconnected titles, is a \\"Fernandez de Cordoba\\", too.

This section of the house was destroyed by an Allied bombing raid in 1943. The House of Sallust (also known in earlier excavation reports as the House of Actaeon) is a domus or elite residence in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii (VI, 2, 4). The oldest parts of the house have been dated to the 4th century BCE, but the main expansions were built in the 2nd century BCE during the Roman period. The long history of this structure provides important evidence about the development of elite residences in Pompeii. The house is located on the east side of the Via Consolare. It received its modern name from an election notice placed on the facade, recommending Gaius Sallustius for office. An alternative name is the House of A. Cossus Libanus, from a seal found in the ruins. The site was later damaged by a bomb in World War II, and was restored in 1970. Although some scholars date the excavation of this structure between 1805 and 1809 followed by the reproduction of its extensive artworks by artists until 1817, an entry dated April 29, 1775 in the Pompeianarum Antiquitatum Historia, a compilation of excavation notes, clearly indicates the house, or at least a portion containing the fresco of Actaeon, had been exposed much earlier and had already resulted in its designation as the House of Actaeon by that time. A dearth of records for 1805, 1808, and 1809 further complicates documentation of the excavation which was exacerbated by the turbulent political changes in Naples as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. Since archaeologists at Pompeii were subsidized by the government, this meant funds available for excavation shifted radically with each change of authority. In January 1799, with Napoleon's troops already stationed in Naples, a rebellion led by progressive aristocrats expelled King Ferdinand and established a republic for a few months. Then this newly established but poorly funded republic was overthrown by conservative forces who reinstated the king. In 1806, right in the midst of excavations of the house, Napoleon drove away King Ferdinand and imposed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as king until 1808, when Napoleon ordered the crown passed to his brother-in-law, Joaquim Murat. Murat’s consort, Napoleon’s younger sister, Caroline Bonaparte, invested her own funds into excavations, engaging six hundred workmen to continue the task. But, In June 1815, King Ferdinand returned again, now as King of the Two Sicilies, and sent Murat before a firing squad in September of that year. The archaeologists' funding dwindled drastically as the restored monarch cut the number of excavators at work in Pompeii from three hundred to a mere thirteen. History Plan of the House of Sallust (1817) House of Sallust Ground Plan (1902) The House of Sallust was among some of the most sumptuous dwellings found in Regio VI in the northwest part of Pompeii and was among the first to be uncovered and plundered during the explorations of the 18th century. The earliest work on the House of Sallust was directed by Francesco La Vega and then his brother Pietro who clearly demonstrated how archaeology during this early period was performed at the bequest and for the benefit of the aristocracy. Queen Maria Caroline of Bourbon, a sponsor and spectator of the excavations of the house, received particularly artistic finds as gifts and work would cease in a room once the finds were stripped. When the house was considered fully cleared in 1809, work turned to reproducing the remains and surviving frescoes with paintings and drawings. The house was originally a single symmetrical atrium house decorated in the Pompeian First Style from the Samnite Period, and was made of tufa blocks. The axially-aligned structure featured a central fauces, set between frontage shops, that lead to an atrium with compluvium and impluvium, three cubicula and alae that flanked the atrium on each side. A tablinum was placed at the rear of the atrium with an oecus and andron on the left and right side of the tablinum respectively. Behind the tablinum was an outdoor garden enclosed by the property wall. In successive building phases, additional shops were added on its west side and a peristyle (colonnaded porticus) was added to the garden. In the late Augustan period the house was converted into a hospitium, a hotel on a grand scale. A counter accessible both from the street and the atrium was constructed to encourage potential guests passing by as well as service existing visitors. Rooms were grouped into suites around the atrium and larger spaces 22 and 35 off the northeast corner of the atrium (see plan) provided indoor dining spaces while an outdoor masonry triclinium (25) covered by a pergola supported by two pilasters at the north end of the peristyle garden provided outdoor dining space. A hearth was constructed nearby for hot food preparation. A large window was installed in the tablinum (19) to provide guests with a view of the garden enhanced by the tablinum's elevation of three steps above the atrium floor. The tablinum was modified to allow access from either end of the colonnade and, although a relatively small 20 by 70 foot space, was painted on the back wall with a garden scene which served as a continuation of the real garden, incorporating garlanded columns, three fountains, and birds. Even with the addition of these new features, such as the peristyle garden which was imported from Greece in the 2nd century BCE, and the second atrium, which also became popular around this time, archaeologists point out that great care was exercised in the remodeling to preserve the original Samnite aesthetic characteristics.Its First Style decoration was retained in some of its public spaces over time, too, imitating the continued use of the First Style in Pompeii's temples, basilicas, and gymnasia into the imperial period. Retention of the old may have been used intentionally to generate creative contrasts. Professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill points out the First Style marble incrustation decoration of the House of Sallust's spacious atrium was carefully preserved over as long as two centuries while the adjoining peristyle was richly and charmingly decorated in the \\"modern\\" style of the imperial period. The House of Sallust is not unique in Pompeii in its use of decorative contrasts. The structure was eventually expanded to use almost all the garden space, but its development was cut short due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.  List of numbered rooms according to 1817 original floor plan  Mars, Venus and Cupid in Cubiculum (29) * 1. Principal entrance * 2. Vestibulum * 3. A shop with a counter and jars, probably for wine or oil * 4. Apartment connected with a doorway to apartment 5. * 5. Apartment connected with a doorway to Apartment 4. Grouping rooms into suites not only provided more spacious accommodation but allowed guests to pass in astonishment from one fine room to another elevating the perception of wealth of the master of the house. * 6. Compluvium for collecting rain water from the room. The bronze sculpture of Hercules and the Golden Hind was found here. * 7. Altar with niche for the household gods * 8. Tablinum with an adjoining room (9) with views of the porticus and garden. The inner room was probably a small triclinium or cubiculum and was adorned with representations of scenic masks. The space was originally accessed directly from the atrium but this doorway was blocked after the rear wall was replaced with a wide entrance to the porticus overlooking the viridarium. * 10. Cella familliaria or bed chamber less than 10 foot square. * 11. Alae - side recesses containing the sacred ancestral images. The ala on the left has a doorway to the adjoining room 12 that has a doorway to the colonnaded ambulatory (20) leading to the viridarium (19). A stairway was installed in (12) at a later time to access a new upper floor. The ala on the right has a doorway to an adjoining lararium or pinacotheca (picture gallery) (13). Later archaeologists identify room (13) as a wardrobe. * 14. Andron with opening to the columned porticus fronting the viridarium. The porticus was three feet above the viridarium (19), accessed by two flights of steps. In between the blue-accented columns of the porticus (15) and (16) were dwarf walls (plutei) forming a container for soil and plants watered by a gutter that collected rainwater from the roof. The back wall of the viridarium was painted with plants and birds to extend the garden view. On the right side of the viridarium was a cistern (17). On the left side of the viridarium was a covered triclinium (18) with pedestal for a table. A small altar was positioned in front of the triclinium on the left. Only the edges of this portion of the garden, which is higher than the floor of the colonnade, were planted. * 19. Fountain * 20. A roofed cistern * 21. Cubiculum * 22. A commode (latrine) * 23. Back entrance * 24. Passageway to a courtyard and perhaps access to the kitchen (26) * 25. Places for ashes or hearths for food preparation * 26 Kitchen with a latrine for the women's apartments on the left and, up a few steps, an elevated hearth on the right. To the left of the hearth is a three-foot deep arched recess (lararium?) * 27. Entrance to a third court (31) with cell for a porter. * 28. Altar with painting of Diana bathing and Actaeon with horns transforming into a stag, attacked by his own hounds, on the back wall of the gynaeceum. * 29. Small apartments or cubicula on the left and right back side of the gynaeceum. The cubiculum on the right with floor pavement and socle of different colored marbles featured a delicate painting of Mars and Venus with Cupid playing with Mars' shield and a scene of Paris and Helen on its rear inner wall, and had a recess for Penates or Lares. Its outer wall was painted with a scene of Phrixus and Helle with the ram. The outer wall of the cubiculum on the left was painted with a scene of Europa with the bull. *30. Large dining room. *31. Third courtyard, perhaps the gynaeceum or women's apartments, with porticus lined with octangular columns painted red. At first the colonnade had a flat roof, with an open walk above on the three sides, but when the large dining room (30) was constructed, the flat roof and promenade on that side were replaced by a sloping roof over the broad entrance to the dining room. Atrium of the house of Sallust used as a backdrop for 1827 La Scala Production of Giovanni Pacini's opera The atrium (cavaedium) featured opus signinum floor pavement with painted Ionic columns supporting the roof giving the space a monumental appearance. Its walls were painted to emulate slabs of marble typical of the First Style. The treatment of the entrances to the tablinum and the alae, with pilasters joined by projecting entablatures, the severe and simple decoration, and the admission of light through the compluvium increased the apparent height of the room and gave it an aspect of dignity and reserve. Sketch of a scene of sacrifice painted in the atrium Although emphasis on the vista from the front door to the tablinum on to the garden began to diminish in other atrium houses in the 1st century CE, this was not the case here.The Republican atrium-tablinum- peristyle matrix remained in place in the House of Sallust despite its conversion to a primarily public establishment, so patronus-client relationships may have persisted for its owner into the early Empire. The arrangement also facilitated the enticement of potential guests from the busy traffic on the Via Consolare. The expansions of the house to encompass more entertainment spaces, however, did emulate such proliferation by other wealthy residents during this period. A scene of sacrifice greeted visitors on a false door to the left of the tablinum. A priest, with his head covered, pours the contents of a patera into a tripod. Opposite the priest, a young man plays a double flute, his foot upon a scabellum, a percussion instrument played by the foot in dramatic performances. On the left and right, two assistants dressed in white tunics with narrow red stripes pour a liquid from drinking horns into paterae. The southeast quadrant of the house was obliterated in an Allied bombing raid in 1943, destroying the signature fresco of Actaeon and Diana. Only a small part of the atrium's once sumptuous decoration, that included dentil cornices and fluted pilasters that framed the alae and tablinum, survived. Examinations between 1817 and 1902, (See 1902 floor plan above) attributed additional rooms to the lower right corner of the house including a caupona, a Roman tavern equipped with dolia to serve hot food. The caupona had a rear doorway leading to two interconnected rooms, one with an external entrance probably for food deliveries, all labeled (5) on the 1902 plan. In the lower left corner of the structure, later archaeologists identified a bakery complex with a millroom with three mills, labeled (6) on the 1902 plan, with a stairway to an upper floor, an oven (7), a kneading room (8), and a kitchen (9). They also identified the enclosure of part of the upper left colonnade to form a room labeled (23) on the 1902 plan.

This hypothesis states that there may be common personality traits observable in people suffering from addiction; however, the lack of a universally agreed upon definition has marked the research surrounding addictive personality. Addiction is a fairly broad term; it is most often associated with substance abuse, but it can also be extended to cover a number of other compulsive behaviors, including sex, internet, television, gambling, food, and shopping. This is a fairly contentious topic, with many experts suggesting the term be retired due to a lack of cumulative evidence supporting the existence of addictive personality. However, different personality traits have been linked to various types of addictive behaviors, suggesting that individual addictions may be associated with different personality profiles. The strongest consensus is that genetic factors play the largest role in determining a predisposition for addictive behaviors. Even then, however, genes play different roles in different types of addictions. Forty to seventy percent of the population variance in the expression of addictions can be explained by genetic factors. Etiology The following factors are believed to influence addiction susceptibility. Psychological factors *Impulsivity *Sensation seeking *Nonconformity combined with weak commitment to socially valued goals for achievement *Social alienation and tolerance for deviance *Heightened stress coupled with lack of coping skills. Some claim the existence of “addictive beliefs” in people more likely to develop addictions, such as “I cannot make an impact on my world” or “I am not good enough”, which may lead to developing traits associated with addiction, such as depression and emotional insecurity. People who strongly believe that they control their own lives and are mostly self-reliant in learning information (rather than relying on others) are less likely to become addicted. However, it is unclear whether these traits are causes, results or merely associated coincidentally. For example, depression due to physical disease can cause feelings of hopelessness that are mitigated after successful treatment of the underlying condition, and addiction can increase dependence on others.  Genetic factors  Individual traits can share common underlying factors or interact. For example, depression, poor self-control, and compulsive behavior are linked to neurotransmitter abnormalities, i.e., biological mechanisms. In laboratory studies with rats, only some rats develop a pattern of self-administration of stimulant drugs, supporting the existence of some inherent propensity for addictive tendencies. In these rats, a positive correlation was found between locomotor response to novel stimuli and the amount of amphetamine self-administered during the first few days of testing. Twin and adoption studies have shown genetic factors account for 50-60% of the risk for alcoholism. In early adolescence, social and familial factors play a more important role in the initiation of drug use but their importance fades with progression into adulthood.  Environmental factors  Studies have found numerous environmental factors that correlate with addiction. Exposure to sustained stress in childhood, such as physical or sexual abuse, especially accompanied by unpredictable parental behavior strongly correlates with drug addiction and overeating in adulthood. A lack of social interaction has also been shown to correlate with addictive tendencies; rats reared in isolation were quicker to develop a pattern of cocaine self- administration than rats reared in groups. There is a gene/environment connection in that individuals with particular personality traits may self- select into different environments, e.g., they may seek out work environments where addictive substances are more readily available. Description People who suffer from an addictive personality spend excessive time on a behavior or with an item, not as a hobby but because they feel they have to. Addiction can be defined when the engagement in the activity or experience affects the person’s quality of life in some way. In this way, many people who maintain an addictive personality isolate themselves from social situations in order to mask their addiction. People that face this issue are currently defined to have a brain disease as promoted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other authorities. People who experience addictive personality disorders typically act on impulses and cannot deal with delayed gratification. At the same time, people with this type of personality tend to believe that they do not fit into societal norms and therefore, acting on impulses, deviate from conformity to rebel. People with addictive personalities are very sensitive to emotional stress. They have trouble handling situations that they deem frustrating, even if the event is for a very short duration. The combination of low self-esteem, impulsivity and low tolerance for stress causes these individuals to have frequent mood swings and often suffer from some sort of depression. A coping mechanism to deal with their conflicting personality becomes their addiction and the addiction acts as something that the person can control when they find it difficult to control their personality traits. People with addictive personalities typically switch from one addiction to the next. These individuals may show impulsive behavior such as excessive caffeine consumption, Internet use, eating chocolate or other sugar-laden foods, television watching, or even running. Extraversion, self-monitoring, and loneliness are also common characteristics found in those who suffer from addiction. Individuals who score high on self-monitoring are more prone to developing an addiction. High self-monitors are sensitive to social situations; they act how they think others expect them to act. They wish to fit in, hence they are very easily influenced by others. Likewise, those who have low self-esteem also seek peer approval; therefore, they participate in \\"attractive\\" activities such as smoking or drinking to try to fit in. People with addictive personalities find it difficult to manage their stress levels. In fact, lack of stress tolerance is a telltale sign of the disorder. They find it difficult to face stressful situations and fight hard to get out of such conditions. Long-term goals prove difficult to achieve because people with addictive personalities usually focus on the stress that comes with getting through the short-term goals. Such personalities will often switch to other enjoyable activities the moment that they are deprived of enjoyment in their previous addiction. Addictive individuals feel highly insecure when it comes to relationships. They may often find it difficult to make commitments in relationships or trust their beloved because of the difficulty they find in achieving long-term goals. They constantly seek approval of others and as a result, these misunderstandings may contribute to the destruction of relationships. People suffering from addictive personality disorder usually undergo depression and anxiety, managing their emotions by developing addiction to alcohol, other types of drugs, or other pleasurable activities. An addict is more prone to depression, anxiety, and anger. Both the addict's environment, genetics and biological tendency contribute to their addiction. People with very severe personality disorders are more likely to become addicts. Addictive substances usually stop primary and secondary neuroses, meaning people with personality disorders like the relief from their pain. Personality traits and addiction Addiction is defined by scholars as “a reliance on a substance or behavior that the individual has little power to resist.” Substance-based addictions are those based upon the release of dopamine in the brain, upon which the range of sensations produced by the euphoric event in the brain changes the brain’s immediate behavior, causing more susceptibility for future addictions. Behavior-based addictions, on the other hand, are those that are not linked to neurological behavior as much and are thus thought to be linked to personality traits; it is this type of addiction that combines a behavior with a mental state and the repeated routine is therefore associated with the mental state.  Drug Addiction  A group of British forensic psychologists and data scientists analysed a new large database of users of psychoactive substances. To analyse the predisposition to drug use, they utilised 7 psychological traits, the Five Factor Model supplemented by Impulsivity and Sensation seeking: *N Neuroticism is a long-term tendency to experience negative emotions such as nervousness, tension, anxiety and depression (associated adjectives: anxious, self-pitying, tense, touchy, unstable, and worrying); *E Extraversion is manifested in outgoing, warm, active, assertive, talkative, cheerful characters, often in search of stimulation (associated adjectives: active, assertive, energetic, enthusiastic, outgoing, and talkative); *O Openness to experience is a general appreciation for art, unusual ideas, and imaginative, creative, unconventional, and wide interests (associated adjectives: artistic, curious, imaginative, insightful, original, and wide interest); *A Agreeableness is a dimension of interpersonal relations, characterized by altruism, trust, modesty, kindness, compassion and cooperativeness (associated adjectives: appreciative, forgiving, generous, kind, sympathetic, and trusting); *C Conscientiousness is a tendency to be organized and dependable, strong-willed, persistent, reliable, and efficient (associated adjectives: efficient, organised, reliable, responsible, and thorough); *Imp Impulsivity is defined as a tendency to act without adequate forethought; *SS Sensation Seeking is defined by the search for experiences and feelings, that are varied, novel, complex and intense, and by the readiness to take risks for the sake of such experiences. These factors are not statistically independent but the condition number of the correlation matrix is less than 10 and the multicollinearity effects are not expected to be strong. The results of the detailed analysis of modern data support partially the hypothesis about psychological predisposition to addiction. The group of users of illicit drugs differs from the group of non-users for N, O, A, C, Imp, and SS. Symbolically, this difference can be illustrated as follows: {\\\\rm N}\\\\Uparrow,{\\\\rm O}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm A}\\\\Downarrow, {\\\\rm C}\\\\Downarrow, {\\\\rm Imp}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm SS}\\\\Uparrow (N, O, Imp, and SS scores are higher for users; A and C scores are lower for users). The hypothesis about importance of E for addiction was not supported by this aggregated analysis of use of all illicit drugs. Analysis of consumption of different drugs separately demonstrated that predisposition to use of different drugs is different. For all illicit drugs groups of their users have the following common properties: {\\\\rm O}\\\\Uparrow,{\\\\rm C}\\\\Downarrow, {\\\\rm Imp}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm SS}\\\\Uparrow (O, Imp, and SS scores are higher for users and C score is lower for users). Deviation of N, E, and A scores for users of different drugs can be different. For example, heroin users have average profile {\\\\rm N}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm E}\\\\Downarrow, {\\\\rm O}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm A}\\\\Downarrow, {\\\\rm C}\\\\Downarrow, {\\\\rm Imp}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm SS}\\\\Uparrow, whereas for LSD and Ecstasy (the latter being a so-called \\"Party drug\\") users N has no significant deviation from the population level and E can be higher. Several personality profiles of risky behaviour were identified by various researchers, for example {\\\\rm N}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm C}\\\\Downarrow (Insecures) and {\\\\rm E}\\\\Uparrow, {\\\\rm C}\\\\Downarrow (Impulsives, Hedonists). Various types of addictive personality have in common low C.  Internet Addiction  Internet addiction is associated with higher scores in neuroticism and lower scores in extraversion and conscientiousness. One explanation for the association with high neuroticism is that virtual environments may be regarded as more safe and comfortable by individuals with lower self-esteem and increased negative emotion (traits associated with high neuroticism) compared to real-life environments. Similarly, individuals with low extraversion that desire social interaction but are averse to face-to-face interaction may find the opportunity for online communication attractive. Controversy There is an ongoing debate about the question of whether an addictive personality really exists. There are two sides of this argument, each with many levels and variations. One side believes that there are certain traits and dimensions of personality that, if existent in a person, cause the person to be more prone to developing addictions throughout their life. The other side argues that addiction is in chemistry, as in how the brain’s synapses respond to neurotransmitters and is therefore not affected by personality. A major argument in favor of defining and labeling an addictive personality has to do with the human ability to make decisions and the notion of free will. This argument suggests human beings are aware of their actions and what the consequences of their own actions are and many choose against certain things because of this. This can be seen in that people are not forced to drink excessively or smoke every day, but it is within the reach of their own free will that some may choose to do so. Therefore, those with addictive personalities are high in neuroticism and hence choose to engage in riskier behaviors. The theory of addictive personalities agrees that there are two types of people: risk-takers and risk-averse. Risk-takers enjoy challenges, new experiences and want instant gratification. These people enjoy the excitement of danger and trying new things. On the other hand, risk-averse are those who are by nature cautious in what they do and the activities they involve themselves in. It is the personality traits of individuals that combine to create either a risk-taker or risk-averse person. Another important concern is the lack of evidence supporting the addictive personality label and the possibility of stigma. While there is a medical consensus surrounding the genetic components of addiction, there is no such consensus supporting the idea that specific personality types have a tendency towards addictive behaviors. In fact, continued use of this term in the absence of clear evidence could be damaging to the people who believe they have an addictive personality.

The road, known as Highway A104 in Uganda, continues into South Sudan as Highway A43. Location The Gulu–Nimule Road starts at Gulu and continues north, through Pabbo, Atiak, Bibia and Elegu, before ending in Nimule at the border between Uganda and South Sudan, a distance of approximately . The coordinates of the road near Atiak in Amuru District are 3°17'02.0\\"N, 32°07'04.0\\"E (Longitude:3.283889; Latitude:32.117778). Overview Before 2009, the Gulu–Nimule Road was a gravel-surfaced, two-lane road. It is a major route of transportation between Uganda and South Sudan. During the rainy season, the road became impassable, as was the case in 2008 when rains closed it for a week. In March 2009, the World Bank agreed to fund the engineering design of the improved road to an all-weather tarmac surface. Vice Consulting Engineers, a South African firm, was awarded the contract to design the road at a cost of US$800,000. The government of Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank will provide the loans to fund the construction, expected to cost US$102 million. Construct timeline After several delays, the contract for the Gulu–Atiak section, measuring , was awarded to China Henan International Corporation, a Chinese construction Group that had successfully completed civil engineering projects in various African countries, including Guinea, Liberia, Namibia, Rwanda and Tanzania. The costs for this section of the road was met by the Government of Uganda and the World Bank. Construction began in May 2012 and was expected to last two years. The remaining section of the road, between Atiak and Nimule, measuring , will be funded by the Government of Japan. That contract was awarded to China Railway Wuju Group Corporation, a division of China Railway Engineering Corporation. Construction of that section was commissioned in August 2013. Completion is expected in May 2016. On 21 July 2015, Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, officially commissioned the completed road.

The term was coined in 2008 by brothers Joel Gold and Ian Gold, a psychiatrist and a neurophilosopher, respectively, after the film The Truman Show. The Truman Show delusion is not officially recognized nor listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.Grohol, John M. \\"DSM-VI: Reality TV Disorder\\" on PsychCentral Background The Truman Show is a 1998 comedy drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol. Actor Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who discovers he is living in a constructed reality televised globally around the clock. Since he was in the womb his entire life has been televised, and all the people in his life have been paid actors. As he discovers the truth about his existence, Burbank fights to find an escape from those who have controlled him his entire life.Kershaw, Sarah \\"Look Closely, Doctor: See the Camera?\\" The New York Times (August 27, 2008) The concept predates this particular film, which was inspired by a 1989 episode of The Twilight Zone in its 1980s incarnation, titled \\"Special Service\\", which begins with the protagonist discovering a camera in his bathroom mirror. This man soon learns that his life is being broadcast 24/7 to TV watchers worldwide.\\"Movies That Stole Their Plots from 'The Twilight Zone'\\" Flavorwire. N.p., 13 Aug. 2012. Web. 10 Aug. 2014. Author Philip K. Dick wrote a novel, Time Out of Joint (1959), in which the protagonist lives in a created world in which his \\"family\\" and \\"friends\\" are all paid to maintain the illusion. Later science fiction novels repeat the theme. While these books do not share the reality-show aspects of The Truman Show, they do have in common the concept of a world that has been constructed by others, around one's personal aspects. Delusions Delusions - fixed, fallacious beliefs - are symptoms that, in the absence of organic disease, indicate psychiatric disease. The content of delusions varies considerably (limited by the imagination of the delusional person), but certain themes have been identified; for example, persecution. These themes have diagnostic importance in that they point to certain diagnoses. Persecutory delusions are, for instance, classically linked to psychosis. Cultural impact The content of delusions are invariably tied to a person's life experience, and contemporary culture seems to play an important role. A retrospective study conducted in 2008 showed how delusional content has evolved over time from religious/magical, to political and eventually to technically themed. The authors concluded that: > sociopolitical changes and scientific and technical developments have a > marked influence on the delusional content in schizophrenia. Psychiatrist Joseph Weiner commented that: > ...in the 1940s, psychotic patients would express delusions about their > brains being controlled by radio waves; now delusional patients commonly > complain about implanted computer chips.Wright, Suzanne \\"The Truman > Delusion\\" on WebMD The Truman Show Delusion could represent a further evolution in the content of persecutory delusions in reaction to a changing pop culture. > Because reality shows are so visible, it is an area that a patient can > easily incorporate into a delusional system. Such a person would believe > they are constantly being videotaped, watched, and commented upon by a large > TV audience. Reported cases While the prevalence of the disorder is not known, there have been several hundred cases reported. There have been recorded instances of people suffering from the Truman Show Delusion from around the world. Joel Gold, a psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City, and Clinical Associate Professor of psychiatry at New York University, and his brother Ian, who holds a research chair in Philosophy and Psychiatry at Montreal's McGill University, are the foremost researchers on the subject. They have communicated, since 2002, with over a hundred individuals suffering from the delusion. They have reported that one patient traveled to New York City after 9/11 to make sure that the terrorist attacks were not a plot twist in his personal Truman Show, while another traveled to a Lower Manhattan federal building to seek asylum from his show. Another patient had worked as an intern on a reality TV program, and believed that he was secretly being tracked by cameras, even at the polls on Election Day in 2004. He shouted that then-President George W. Bush was a \\"Judas,\\" which brought him to Bellevue Hospital and Gold's attention. One of Gold's patients, an upper-middle class Army veteran who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty in the belief that doing so would release him from the \\"show\\",Ellison, Jesse \\"When Life is Like a TV Show\\" Newsweek (August 2, 2008) described his condition this way: > I realized that I was and am the center, the focus of attention by millions > and millions of people ... My family and everyone I knew were and are actors > in a script, a charade whose entire purpose is to make me the focus of the > world's attention. The choice of the name \\"Truman Show Delusion\\" by the Golds was influenced by the fact that three of the five patients Joel Gold initially treated for the syndrome explicitly linked their perceived experiences to the film.\\"Reality Bites\\" National Post (July 21, 2008) Truman Syndrome In the United Kingdom, psychiatrists Paolo Fusar-Poli, Oliver Howes, Lucia Valmaggia and Philip McGuire of the Institute of Psychiatry in London described in the British Journal of Psychiatry what they referred to as the \\"Truman Syndrome\\": > [A] preoccupying belief that the world had changed in some way that other > people were aware of, which he interpreted as indicating he was the subject > of a film and living in a film set (a ‘fabricated world’). This cluster of > symptoms ... is a common presenting complaint in individuals ... who may be > in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. The authors suggest that the \\"Truman explanation\\" is a result of the patients' search for meaning in their perception that the ordinary world has changed in some significant but inexplicable way. Medical relevance The Truman Show delusion is not officially recognized and is not a part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. The Golds do not say that it is a new diagnosis but refer to it as \\"a variance on known persecutory and grandiose delusions.\\"  Filmmaker's reaction  After hearing about the condition, Andrew Niccol, writer of The Truman Show, said, \\"You know you've made it when you have a disease named after you.\\" See also *Dream argument *Five minute hypothesis *Frank Chu *Solipsism *Matrix hypothesis *Problem of other minds References Notes Further reading * * * * * * Category:Delusional disorders Category:Delusions ","title":"The Truman Show delusion"},{"id":"26955697","text":"The term convening authority is used in United States military law to refer to an individual with certain legal powers granted under either the Uniform Code of Military Justice (i.e. the regular military justice system) or the Military Commissions Act of 2009 (for the Guantanamo military commissions).

The brand markets upper market ties, hats, belts, shirts, shorts, swimwear, bags for men, women, and children. It has grown to a collection of retail stores and outlets across the United States. The company's main logo is a pink whale. Their clothing is considered preppy. History Shep and Ian Murray grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut and spent their summers on Martha's Vineyard, where they were introduced to the coastal lifestyle of sailing, fishing, and boating. The two brothers originally held jobs in New York City, but soon grew tired of the corporate lifestyle. Ian claims the duo \\"traded in [their] business suits for bathing suits\\" and “started making neckties so [they] didn’t have to wear them.” Before quitting their jobs, the two brothers opened credit cards so they could buy silk and launch Vineyard Vines. The company's entire startup capital was raised from the brothers' accrued credit card debt. Shep and Ian sold their neckties on Martha's Vineyard, selling out of a backpack from their boat or Jeep rather than a storefront. Initially, they offered four different styles of ties. After they sold 800 ties on a single weekend in July, Shep and Ian quickly re-ordered more, paid off their accrued debt, and moved into a new office. The Murray brothers claim that the business was founded through a philosophy of \\"living the good life,\\" which is reflected by their slogan \\"Every day should feel this good.\\" Shep Murray claims his goal is to be \\"a cross between Warren Buffett and Jimmy Buffett\\" in building the \\"lifestyle brand\\" he founded. Vineyard Vines is still owned outright by the two Murray brothers. Expansion Since the summer of 1998, the Vineyard Vines company has expanded nationally, particularly along the East Coast. Vineyard Vines has opened numerous company, outlet, and retail stores. In addition to these traditional channels, Vineyard Vines has expanded its sales to online shoppers. The company manufactures licensed NFL and MLB product, which it sells through its retail channels. Vineyard Vines also manufactures licensed college apparel, which is sold primarily through campus stores. Vineyard Vines was placed on Inc. magazine's list of the 5000 fastest-growing businesses in the U.S. in 2007. Between 2004 and 2007, the relatively new company's revenue tripled. In 2015, the company inaugurated a new headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. In January 2018, sportscaster Jim Nantz announced a partnership with Vineyard Vines to create a golf-oriented lifestyle clothing line set to launch in spring 2019.Hennessey, Stephen. \\"Yes, Jim Nantz will have his own Vineyard Vines golf apparel line\\", Golf Digest.com, 24 January 2018 (retrieved 8 February 2018). Stores A Vineyard Vines store in Manhattan The first stores were opened in Northeastern locations associated with the sea such as Martha's Vineyard. The first was in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard, followed by Greenwich, Connecticut. The company has expanded to more than 59 stores as well as 15 outlet locations across the U.S. states. Legal Matters An age and gender discrimination lawsuit was filed in mid June 2020 in federal court in Connecticut by a former senior vice president. The lawsuit also names the co-founders and co-CEO’s of the privately held company. “It appears to be an environment increasingly marked by age and gender discrimination and that was by design. As the complaint states, it was coming from the founders and the president of the company.” The complaint details the particulars of the firing of the company’s head of stores and the company culture that she alleges led to it, including a desire by the founders to replace older, female store employees with younger men. A group of consumers filed a lawsuit on Sept. 9 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Vineyard Vines LLC. The lawsuit alleges Vineyard Vines misleads shoppers about quality, pricing of outlet products. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's outlet and retail products, despite their similarity in appearance and classification, are misleading in pricing as the outlet products' pricing does not truly display the real suggested retail price identical to the price for the comparative product in the retail store. The plaintiffs allege the \\"invented price disparity\\" induces customers to purchase the outlet products and creates a feeling of savings, and increases the consumers' likelihood to purchase the product. The plaintiffs also allege consumers are led to believe that the outlet products are identical to the retail products without being informed that the products come from different manufacturing batches and are of lower quality than the true retail products.

They are situated next to the Rocky Run spring and a steep hill side. The original Rocky Run shelter sleeps six people, has a flat floor, and provides enough space to sit up. The new shelter can sleep up to sixteen and features a wood floor and a plywood-floored loft, as well as a covered front deck and large windows which flood the shelter with light. Accommodations available include two decks, a grill pit, porch swing, and semi-enclosed privy. Location The Rocky Run shelters are located on the western slope of South Mountain just south of Boonsboro. The shelters are situated about off the Appalachian Trail, and are connected to the main trail by a spur. Rocky Run is a hike from the Crampton Gap Shelter (going south) and from the Pine Knob shelter (going north).Appalachian Trail Shelters - Rocky Run Shelter. Accessed: 10 June 2012. History The original shelter was built in 1940 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and completed in 1941 by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) which currently maintains 240 miles of the Appalachian Trail from Pennsylvania to Virginia and an additional 1,000 miles of trails elsewhere in the region. The shelter is one of 15 remaining shelters built by the CCC on the Appalachian Trail, and of even fewer made from logs rather than stone. After falling into disrepair, the PATC considered tearing it down and building a larger one. However, noting its historical significance, the shelter was repaired in 2008. Volunteer crews also built another log shelter and a privy nearby. A new shelter costs about $7,000-$9,000 and takes 8–12 months of volunteer labor to build. Popularity The section of the Appalachian Trail in which Rocky Run is situated, consisting mostly of old logging roads, is considered one of the easier stretches of the trail. It is popular for this reason, and also because there are beautiful overlooks and historic Civil War sites nearby. Peak use season is around June, when there may be 10-15 people looking to use the shelters on any given weekday.

Therefore, many of these calques can also be considered Russianisms.  Russian  The poet Aleksandr Pushkin (1799–1837) was perhaps the most influential among the Russian literary figures who would transform the modern Russian language and vastly expand its ability to handle abstract and scientific concepts by importing the sophisticated vocabulary of Western intellectuals. Although some Western vocabulary entered the language as loanwords – e.g., Italian salvietta, \\"napkin\\", was simply Russified in sound and spelling to салфетка (salfetka) – Pushkin and those he influenced most often preferred to render foreign borrowings into Russian by calquing. Compound words were broken down to their component roots, which were then translated piece-by-piece to their Slavic equivalents. But not all of the coinages caught on and became permanent additions to the lexicon; for example, любомудрие (ljubomudrie) was promoted by 19th-century Russian intellectuals as a calque of \\"philosophy\\", but the word eventually fell out of fashion, and modern Russian instead uses the loanword философия (filosofija). * Russian любомудрие (ljubomudrie) calqued Greek-derived 'philosophy': ** Russ. root любить (ljubit' ) = Gr. φιλεῖν (filein) = 'to love'; ** Russ. root мудрость (mudrost' ) = Gr. σοφία (sofia) = 'wisdom' * Russian зависимость (zavisimost' ) calques Latin-derived 'dependence': ** Russ. root за (za) = Lat. de = 'down from' ** Russ. root висеть (viset' ) = Lat. pendere = 'to hang; to dangle' * Russian совпадение (sovpadenije) calques Latin-derived 'coincidence': ** Russ. prefix со- (so) = Lat. co- = 'in; with; together' ** Russ. prefix в- (v) = Lat. in- = 'in; into' ** Russ. root падать (padat' ) = Lat. cidere = 'to fall' * Russian полуостров (poluostrov) calques Latin-derived 'peninsula': ** Russ. root полу- (polu-) = Ger. halb = 'half; semi-' ** Russ. root остров (ostrov) = Ger. Insel = 'island' * Russian детский сад (detskij sad) calques German Kindergarten (both literally suggesting 'children's garden')  Greek  * Διαδίκτυο from English Internet * Γύρος (gyros) from Turkish döner * Ποδόσφαιρο from English football, referring specifically to association football * Τηλεόραση from television  Irish  * uisce beatha calques Latin aqua vitae – The English word whiskey is actually derived from this phrase  Finnish  Since Finnish, a Uralic language, differs radically in pronunciation and orthography from Indo-European languages, most loans adopted in Finnish either are calques or soon become such as foreign words are translated into Finnish. Examples include: * from Greek: sarvikuono (rhinoceros, from Greek ρινόκερος \\"rinokeros\\"), * from Latin: viisaudenhammas (wisdom tooth, from Latin \\"dens sapientiae\\"), * from English: jalkapallo (English \\"football\\", specifically referring to association football), * from English: koripallo (English \\"basketball\\"), * from English: kovalevy (English \\"hard disk\\"), * from French: kirpputori (flea market, French \\"marché aux puces\\"), * from German: lastentarha (German \\"Kindergarten\\"), * from German: panssarivaunu (German \\"Panzerwagen\\"), * from Swedish: pesukarhu (raccoon, from Swedish \\"tvättbjörn\\" and ultimately German \\"Waschbär\\"), * from Swedish: moottoritie (highway, from Swedish \\"motorväg\\"), * from Chinese: aivopesu (brainwash, from Chinese \\"xi nao\\"), * from Spanish: siniverinen (blue-blooded, from Spanish \\"de sangre azul\\")  Modern Hebrew  When Jews immigrate to Israel, they often Hebraize their surnames. One approach to doing so was by calque from the original (often German or Yiddish) surname. For instance, Imi Lichtenfield (itself a half-calque), founder of the martial art Krav Maga, became Imi Sde-Or. Both last names mean \\"light field\\". For more examples and other approaches, see the article on Hebraization of surnames. * mesilat barzel (obsolete term for railway) from German Eisenbahn (iron track); \\"sach-rachok\\" (a proposed term for telephone that became famous for not catching on) from German \\"Fernsprecher\\" (itself a calque from Greek \\"telephone\\") * \\"zarkor\\" (searchlight) from German \\"Scheinwerfer\\" (light-thrower=>zorek-or, contracted to \\"zarkor\\") * iton (newspaper) from German and Yiddish Zeitung (Zeit and Et both mean time or era,first syllable e become i with the -on suffix) * tappuach adamah (potato) from French pomme-de-terre * gan yeladim from German Kindergarten * kaduregel (כדורגל) (football, specifically association football/soccer) from English football; \\"kadursal\\" (basketball); \\"kaduryad\\" (handball);... * \\"kelev yam\\" (seal) from German \\"Seehund\\" (\\"sea dog\\") * \\"karnaf\\" (contraction of \\"keren af\\"/\\"nosehorn\\") from Greek rhinoceros, possibly via German Nashorn * names of many chemical elements are calqued from German and/or Greek: \\"meiman\\" (hydrogen) from Wasserstoff, \\"pachman\\" (carbon) from Kohlstoff, \\"chankan\\" (nitrogen) from Stickstoff, \\"chamtzan\\" (oxygen) from Sauerstoff, zarkhan (phosphorus) from Greek, ... Some others are derived from Biblical or Mishnaic Hebrew words: kesef (silver), barzel (iron), nechoshet (copper), zahav (gold), oferet (lead), ashlagan (potassium, from \\"ashlag\\"=potash), * many computing terms are calqued from English: \\"luach em\\" (motherboard), \\"me\`abed\\" (processor), \\"natav\\" (router), akhbar (mouse), cartis reshet (network card), sapak koach (power supply), mat\`en (charger),... Other terms are loanwords: \\"disq\\" (disk), ... Yet others are 'native' Hebrew words, either newly coined or adapted from earlier usage: \\"mikledet\\" (keyboard \\"typer\\"), \\"madpeset\\" (printer, by analogy with \\"mekhonat dfus\\"/printing press), \\"reshet\\" (network, from Hebrew for a net), ... According to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the more contributing languages have a structurally identical expression, the more likely it is to be calqued into the target language. In Israeli (his term for \\"Modern Hebrew\\") one uses má nishmà, lit. \\"what's heard?\\", with the meaning of \\"what's up?\\". Zuckermann argues that this is a calque not only of the Yiddish expression Was hört sich? (usually pronounced v(o)sérts´kh), but also of the parallel expressions in Polish, Russian and Romanian. Whereas most revivalists were native Yiddish-speakers, many first speakers of Modern Hebrew spoke Russian and Polish too. So a Polish speaker in the 1930s might have used má nishmà not (only) due to Yiddish Was hört sich? but rather (also) due to Polish Co słychać? A Russian Jew might have used ma nishma due to Что слышно? (pronounced chto slyshno) and a Romanian Israeli would echo ce se aude.See p. 62 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2009), Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns. In Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2 (2009), pp. 40–67. According to Zuckermann, such multi-sourced calquing is a manifestation of the Congruence principle.See p. 48 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns. In Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2 (2009), pp. 40–67.  Malayalam  Modern Malayalam is replete with calques from English.

Although he spoke other languages perfectly (Hebrew, Russian, Polish, German, possibly Ukrainian), he chose to write in Yiddish. Together with Solomon Ettinger, he was one of the first Yiddish-language writers of the 19th century and one of the most significant Yiddish writers to emerge before Mendele Mocher Sforim. He spent the first period of his life among the Hasidim, being himself a disciple of R. Nahman Bratzlaver (from Bratslav, a town in Ukraine, in Yiddish: בראָסלעוו) and the companion of Nathan Bratzlaver (Nathan of Breslov), the editor and publisher of Nahman's works. Later he abandoned his early associations, and removed to Odessa. By self-education he acquired a wide knowledge of law, literature, and science. He practised as a notary public, and was also a prolific writer of fiction. Like nearly all Russo-Jewish novelists, Aksenfeld was a realist. He derived the themes of his works from contemporary Jewish life, describing with the pen of an artist the conditions, manners, and customs of the ghetto in the Russian Empire at the beginning of the eventful reign of Czar Nicholas I. He was the author of about twenty works, of which only five—one novel and four dramas—were printed. The most important of his dramatic works is the play in verse, Der erschter jiddischer Rekrut in Russland (1861),Tom Sandqvist: \\"Dada East: The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire\\" (Cambridge, MA / London: MIT Press, 2006), p. 311 a tragedy which presents a remarkably vivid picture of the terrible commotion in the Russian ghetto when, in 1827, the ukase compelling the Jews to do military service was enforced for the first time (see Cantonist). His novel, Dos Sterntichl (1861) describes the seamy side of Ḥasidism, its intolerance, bigotry, and hypocrisy, and contrasts it with the fair-mindedness and honesty of progressive Judaism.

She was an iconic figure in the Argentinian theatre scene. Biography Luisa Vehil was born in 1912 in Montevideo, Uruguay, she belongs to an eight generation dynasty of actors originally from Catalonia; daughter and granddaughter of theatre players. Her brothers were Paquita and Juan. She was also the aunt of actors Miguel Ángel Solá and Mónica Vehil. Luisa moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina at an early age, and starred in her first movie in 1933, Los tres berretines, directed by Enrique Telémaco Susini. It was the second Argentine talk movie. She went on to appear in other minor 'talkies' throughout the '30s, working in tango- oriented films by famed tango writer Manuel Romero and Eduardo Morera. Opposite to Juan Perón regime she suffered an attack when playing the leading role in the play Fascination. Vehil's next big role was in Pampa bárbara, an epic western directed by Lucas Demare and Hugo Fregonese. It was her second and last screen appearance throughout the '40s; likewise, she acted in film once per decade – once in the '50s (En la ardiente oscuridad, by Daniel Tinayre, 1958) and once in the '60s (El bote, el río y la gente, 1960). Nevertheless, her main activity was the theater where she was regarded as one of the Grand-Dames of the national scene, a revered and iconic figure. She played Mary Stuart, Juana La Loca, Samuel Beckett's Happy Days, Madame Desmortes in Jean Anouilh's L'Invitation au Château and L'Alouette (The Lark), Alejandro Casona's Los árboles mueren de pie, etc. Between 1964–1967 she directed the Argentina's National Comedy and was also a member of the National Fund for Arts. She made a comeback in the '70s, appearing in films by Juan Bautista Stagnaro, Alejandro Doria and Luis Saslavsky. She would work with Doria one more time in 1982, in Los pasajeros del jardín. Turning to TV, Vehil starred in the hour-long program Navidad en el año 2000 in 1981 and hosted the show Las 24 horas from 1982 to 1985. Her last acting performance was in Kindergarten (1989), a controversial film by Jorge Polaco, censored one day short from its release (the first case of censorship in the country following the end of the Dirty War six years prior).

The serum was taken from the blood of horses. Infected children were injected in their abdominal skin by Dr. Paul Moser. Mortality rates from scarlet fever declined significantly following the use of the blood serum. Moser at first used scarlet fever serum primarily on the most severely sick persons. After achieving positive results it was applied in the first or second day following contraction of scarlet fever. In many cases the children treated demonstrated great improvement in a very short time, with their fevers going away quickly. Moser worked with four hundred children suffering from scarlatina at St. Anne's Hospital. The mortality rate of those he treated was 8.9%. This compared quite favorably when measured against the 13.09% among children in Vienna hospitals where the scarlet fever serum was not administered. Moser's antitoxin reduced the mortality of scarlet fever by 40%. At no time was the volume of serum available sufficient. As of November 1902 a strong concentrated scarlet fever serum was unavailable. Later serums 1903–1930 Dr. Aronson, a bacteriologistA Scarlet Fever Serum, New York Times, February 5, 1903, pg. 8. who worked at the Emperor and Empress Frederick Children's Hospital of Berlin, Germany, used a scarlet fever serum with positive results in early 1903.Scarlet Fever Serum Discovered, New York Times, February 3, 1903, pg. 9. Specialists at the Chicago, Illinois Board of Health claimed that Aronson was administering a scarlet fever serum which they had discovered. Aronson may have been the first to successfully segregate the scarlet fever bacillus. Perhaps this was a result of a micrococcus obtained from throat cultures. However, bacteriologists in the United States had been unsuccessful in similar experiments around this time.A Scarlet Fever Serum, New York Times, February 5, 1903, pg. 8. In July 1923 it was announced that two Italian scientists, Giovanni di Cristina and Giuseppe Carolla of Rome, Italy, had isolated the scarlet fever germ and developed a serum.Find Scarlet Fever Germ, New York Times, July 23, 1923, pg. 14. Dr. A. Raymond Dochez (1882 – June 30, 1964), a native of San Francisco, California, is credited with discovering a serum cure for scarlet fever at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, while he was a researcher there in 1924.

His own experiments with streptococcus led him to believe that scarlet fever was not a manifestation of the streptococcus bacillus. However, he thought that streptococcus might work as a conduit for the true scarlet fever bacillus. He contended that serums obtained from persons convalescing from scarlet fever were more effective than ones prepared from horse cultures.Scarlet Fever Far From Conquered, New York Times, July 23, 1930, pg. 10.

They are essentially virtual master objects that can, at various times, have physical incarnations of themselves. An object can be considered a spime when all of its essential information is stored in the cloud. Bruce Sterling sees spimes as coming through the convergence of six emerging technologies, related to both the manufacturing process for consumer goods, and through identification and location technologies. Depending on context, the term \\"spime\\" can refer to both—the archetype, as designed by the developer, or a user-specific instance of it. Origin The term spime was coined for this concept by author Bruce Sterling. It is a contraction of \\"space\\" and \\"time\\", and was probably first used in a large public forum by Sterling at SIGGRAPH Los Angeles, August 2004. The idea was further expanded upon in his book Shaping Things. Since, the use of the term by researchers and in industry has grown. Concept The six facets of spimes are: # Small, inexpensive means of remotely and uniquely identifying objects over short ranges; for example radio-frequency identification. # A mechanism to precisely locate something on Earth, such as a global-positioning system. # A way to mine large amounts of data for things that match some given criteria, like internet search engines. # Tools to virtually construct nearly any kind of object; computer-aided design. # Ways to rapidly prototype virtual objects into real ones. Sophisticated, automated fabrication of a specification for an object, through “three-dimensional printers.” # \\"Cradle-to-cradle\\" life-spans for objects. Cheap, effective recycling. With all six of these, one could track the entire existence of an object, from before it was made (its virtual representation), through its manufacture, its ownership history, its physical location, until its eventual obsolescence and breaking-down back into raw material to be used for new instantiations of objects. If recorded, the lifetime of the object can be archived and queried. Spimes are not defined merely by these six technologies; rather, if these technologies converge within the manufacturing process then spimes could indeed arise. Due to physical limitations and cost- effectiveness, objects that perform similar functions to a spime but exist in a heterogeneous ecosystem where some of their spime-like functionality is performed by and/or shared with other entities may be precursors to spimes. For example, integrating a GPS receiver into every object is currently impractical because of size, power, and cost, among other reasons, but a base station that provides location services for one or many nearby devices may be more practical.

Counterfeiting of electronic components can infringe the legitimate producer's trademark rights. Because counterfeit parts often have inferior specifications and quality, they may represent a hazard if incorporated into critical systems such as aircraft navigation, life support, military equipment, or space vehicles. The marketing of electronic components has been commoditized, making it easier for the counterfeiter to introduce substandard and counterfeit devices into the supply chain. Supply chain for electronic components *OCM (Original Component Manufacturers): Companies that design, market, and manufacture individual components *Franchise Distributor: Companies that are authorized to sell OCM material, governed by contracts. *Independent Distributor - Commonly known as electronic component \\"Brokers\\" *Wholesale Distributor: Companies that speculatively purchase excess inventories from component end-users and facilitate the redistribution of surplus, excess, and obsolete inventory Market forces facilitating trends According to a January 2010 study by the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, the number of counterfeit incidents reported grew from 3,868 in 2005 to 9,356 in 2008. Respondents to the survey cited the two most common types of counterfeit components were blatant fakes and used product re- marked as higher grade. This survey had 387 respondents representing all facets of the electronic component supply chain. All facets of the supply chain reported instances of counterfeit product. The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics estimates the global TAM for semiconductors will be in excess of $200 billion, thus the 387 respondents provide quantitative results for only a small portion of the total market. This increase in instances of counterfeit products entering the supply chain has been made possible by fundamental changes to the supply chain for electronic components as characterized by the following: *Globalization **Dot-Com boom-Bust – The massive investment in telecommunications and data bandwidth during the dot-com bubble made communication tools and services available at a very low cost to business. **Outsourcing and off-shoring – The gradual shift of manufacturing from North American and Europe to the Far East facilitates technology transfer and awareness. **IT System interoperability – Adoption of the Windows operating system ensured that all computer users could easily and efficiently share information. **Global shipping companies – FedEx, UPS, and DHL refined their business offerings to provide relatively inexpensive shipping for small packages. *CHINA and the WTO **December 11, 2001, China was admitted to the WTO, which ultimately resulted in lifting the ban on exports by non- government-owned and controlled business entities. *Global e-waste handling **In late 1989, in response to public outcry against exporting and dumping of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries, the Basel Convention was adopted in Basel, Switzerland. In the decades following this convention, most of the developed countries have adopted this convention with the major exception of the USA. During this period the United States has continued to export its hazardous e-waste to the developing world, primarily China, where e-waste recycling has become a way of life, despite its toxic effect on the people processing this waste.CBS News Follows America's Electronic Waste As It Is Illegally Shipped To Become China's Dirty Secret This e-waste provides the valuable raw materials for today's counterfeiter. Examples and counterfeiting techniques *Non-functional units *Sanding and re-marking *Blacktopping and re-marking *Device substitution *Die salvaging *Manufacturing rejects *Component lead re-attachment *Relabeling boxes These counterfeiting techniques are in constant improvement. Counterfeit avoidance strategies=Procurement and inspection By utilizing multiple different types of incoming inspection most counterfeit components can be discovered. *DNA marking. Botanical DNA as developed by Applied DNA Sciences and required by the DoD's Defense Logistics Agency for certain High Risk microcircuits to determine authenticity or provenance. Unique and un-copyable marks applied by manufacturer and/or distributor. *Visual external inspection for signs of resurfacing *Visual microscopic inspection of encapsulant finish and lead surfaces *X-Ray inspection **By comparing the internal structure (of a homogeneous sample, same date & lot code) of electronic components certain types of counterfeit parts can be discovered. The \\"blatant fake\\" counterfeit devices exhibit vast differences in internal structure including, but not limited to different die frames and different wire bonding. *X-RF Inspection **In the wake of the RoHS initiative, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to confirm RoHS status which is often overlooked by counterfeiters. *Decapsulation **By removing the external packaging on a semiconductor and exposing the semiconductor wafer or die microscopic inspection of brand marks, trademarks, and laser die etching can be used to determine authenticity. ***Chemical ****Technique utilizing heated acid to expose wafer or die packaged in plastics or resins ***Mechanical ****Technique utilizing cutting, cracking, or chipping the ceramic or metal to expose wafer or die for inspection. *SAM (scanning acoustic microscopy) **A scanning acoustic microscope can be used to discover evidence of resurfacing and blacktopping by revealing laser etching below blacktop material *Parametric testing a.k.a. curve tracing **An inexpensive and expedient method to determine of a sample of product has identical electrical characteristics *Leak testing (gross leak and fine leak) of hermetically sealed components *Functional electrical testing *QPL - Qualified Product List (military product) *QML - Qualified Manufacturers List (military product) *QSLD - Qualified Suppliers List of Distributors (military product) *QTSL - Qualified Testing Suppliers List (military product) *Stereo microscope, metallurgical microscope *Solderability testing Purchasing policies and procedures As the instances of counterfeit and substandard products continue to increase, industry is beginning to address these issues through development and implementation of industry standards. As the majority of the counterfeit components were entering the supply chain though unknowing, unsophisticated, and unaware Independent Distributors (Component Brokers). Continued work on awareness and industry standards continued with the formation of the G-19 Counterfeit Electronic Components Committee with representatives from all components of the supply chain.SAE Technical Committee G-19 Counterfeit Electronic Parts Committee SAE International (.doc file) In April 2009 SAE International released AS5553 Counterfeit Electronic Parts; Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation, and Disposition.Counterfeit Electronic Parts; Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation, and Disposition. Sae.org (2009-04-02). Retrieved on 2011-04-03. SAE International (SAE), has implemented new standards to prevent the dangers associated with the growing threat of counterfeiting, as have other Independent Distributors. AS6081 was issued in November 2012 and was adopted by the DOD. This standard provides uniform requirements, practices, and methods to mitigate the risks of purchasing and supplying fraudulent or counterfeit electronic parts for distributors. This standard requires organizations involved with the purchase, acceptance, and distribution of such parts to have a quality management system in place, to communicate and document contract provisions that establish purchasing controls, and to retain appropriate records for supply chain traceability. In addition, AS6081 requires the purchased products to be verified through external visual inspections and radiological examinations. While AS6081 covers distribution of components, AS5553A provides similar certification for manufacturers. Originally implemented in January 2013 in response to the increasing volume of fraudulent and counterfeit parts entering the aerospace supply chain, AS5553A was expanded to mitigate such risk on a global scale with regard to various sectors. Many of the requirements of AS5553A are similar to AS6081 and likewise aim to prevent the receipt and installation of fraudulent or counterfeit parts through uniform requirements, practices, and methods.

It was originally designed and implemented by Russell M. Taylor II at the Department of Computer Science of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. VRPN was maintained and supported by SensicsSensics http://sensics.com while it was business. It is currently maintained by ReliaSolve and developed in collaboration with a productive community of contributors. It is described more fully at vrpn.org and in VRPN-VRST{{cite journal last1=Taylor first1=Russell title=VRPN: a device-independent, network-transparent VR peripheral system journal=VRST '01 Proceedings of the ACM symposium on Virtual reality software and technology date=November 15 - 17, 2001 pages=55-61 doi=10.1145/505008.505019 url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=505019}. The purpose of VRPN is to provide a unified interface to input devices, like motion trackers or joystick controllers. It also provides the following: * Time-stamping of data * Multiple simultaneous access to peripheral devices * Automatic re-connection of failed servers * Storage and playback of sessions The VRPN system consists of programming interfaces for both the client application and the hardware drivers and a server application that communicates with the hardware devices. The client interfaces are written in C++ but has been wrapped in C#, Python and Java. A typical application of VRPN is to encode and send 6DoF motion capture data through the network in real time.  Networking  A VRPN client can establish a connection with a VRPN server (the device providing the data) in two ways: either over TCP (reliable, but less efficient), or over UDP (unreliable, but lower-latency and more efficient). The \\"unreliable\\" mode is generally preferred when the latency is critical. The \\"unreliable\\" connection initialization sequence makes use of both the TCP and UDP protocols. It works as follows: # the client opens a TCP socket for listening on an arbitrary port; # the client sends the port number of this socket, along with its own machine name, in a UDP datagram directed to a well known port of the VRPN server (the default is 3883); # the server opens a TCP connection with the client, to the port number communicated at step 2; # if the TCP connection is established, each device tells to the other the supported VRPN version; # if the versions are not compatible, the connection is dropped; # otherwise, each device begins to listen on a new UDP port (different from those used before) and sends the port number to the other device, by using the previously created TCP connection; # from now on, all the data is sent over the two UDP ports opened at step 6. The advantages of this approach are: fast connection time and fast failure detection during connection. However, the \\"unreliable\\" connection initialization protocol does not honor the strict layering protocol design principle, as the application-level VRPN payload leaks information about lower levels in the network stack, namely the machine names and TCP/UDP port numbers. Because of this design choice, it is impossible to establish a VRPN connection between two devices connected through a NAT: the router would need to translate not only the layer-3 information in the packet headers, but also the references to IP addresses and port numbers inside the VRPN payload. To deal with this problem, VRPN offers a second \\"reliable\\", TCP-only connection initialization mode, which is a standard TCP server-client interaction: the VRPN server listens on a well-known TCP port and the client initiates a connection. In this mode, all the data is sent on the same TCP connection, and no UDP communication is required.

Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity From Its Foundation In 1852 To Its Fiftieth Anniversary. p. 209: Philadelphia: Franklin Printing Company.Keehn, Roy D. (1910). Grand Catalogue of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity (7th ed.) p. 57. Chicago: Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Buchwalter received his early education in the district schools of Ross county, then became a student of the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, Ohio, and later changed his allegiance to Cornell University at Ithaca, New York, from which he received the degree of A.B. in 1869, being a member of the first class graduated from that institution. Education to the Bar In 1869, Morris L. Buchwalter transferred to the new Cornell University, where he became a founder of the New York Alpha chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. He was also the second President of the Irving Literary Society and roommate on Ithaca's Court Street with future Ohio Senator, Joseph Benson Foraker, who served with Morris's brother in the Tennessee campaign, which took the latter's life. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society, through the Cornell chapter. Immediately after receiving his diploma, he moved to Cincinnati and entered the Cincinnati Law School, from which he graduated in 1870 with the degree of LL.B. He began general practice in the city and gained recognition as an energetic, reliable and progressive young lawyer who shirked no responsibility and spared no time or effort in sustaining any cause in which he was engaged. His lifelong support for higher education peaked when he served as trustee for the University of Cincinnati, an institution for which he served in the same manner as his friends John Andrew Rea (as regent for the University of Washington), and Joseph B. Foraker(as trustee of Cornell University). Morris was also the first President, Cornell Alumni Association and Class Secretary, Class of 1869, for many years. The City of Cincinnati would eventually number Judge Buchwalter among its esteemed citizens, a man who possessed a high degree of confidence from the people of the city. As the years passed, he gained a prominent position at the bar. On November 4, 1881, he was appointed by Governor Charles Foster, judge of the common-pleas court of the first judicial district of Ohio to fill a vacancy caused by the election of Judge Nicholas Longworth to the Supreme Court of Ohio. He, having been regularly elected for the full term in that court and subsequently reelected for a second and third term, and having also been endorsed by the vote of the bar of Hamilton county during three judicial elections, his judicial service ended February, 1897. Judge Buchwalter was thought to be a highly impartial jurist, and his decisions ranked among the clearest expositions of law enunciated from the common pleas bench in the 19th century. :15pxThis section incorporates text from the entry \\"Morris Lyon Buchwalter\\" in Cincinnati, the Queen City, 1788-1912, Volume 4, (S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1912) a publication now in the public domain. Jurisprudence An example of Buchwalter's labour jurisprudence is N. & C.G. Parker v. Bricklayers' Union No. 1. The action was brought by members of a contractors' union against a bricklayers' union and its various members and officers active in the controversy. The issue at hand was the lawfulness of 'boycotting'. Judge Buchwalter charged the jury that contractors: > may combine for the honest purpose of benefitting their order by encouraging > favorable terms to their employers in the purchase of material, and to > procure contracts for such contractors as employ members of their union; but > they become engaged in illegal enterprise whenever they agree to accomplish > their purpose by threats, intimidation, violence or like molestation, either > toward the apprentice, the expelled member, the non-union workman, the > contractor and the employer, the material man or the owner who proposes to > make a contract.\\"N. & C.G. Parker v. Bricklayers' Union No. 1. Et. Alia > (Hamilton Common Pleas), 10 Ohio Decisions Reprint (1899) pp. 223 and 459 In 1885, the Judge heard a case involving the menace of roller coasters: > Now that a \\"roller coaster\\" is ready to be launched upon the local public at > Savin Rock, it is interesting to learn from the Boston Herald that Judge > Buchwalter of Cincinnati, has been occupied an entire day with the hearing > of testimony in a complaint case against one of them.

The plaintiffs allege that the \\"roller coaster\\" or circular > gravity railway, recently constructed on the Bellevue house grounds, is a > nuisance to the neighborhood, on account of the noise it produces; that it > prevents sleep, tortures invalids and nervous people, interrupts > conversations, and will depreciate the value of property in that vicinity > unless its further operation is enjoined, which the plaintiffs pray the > court may be done by a perpetual injunction.New Haven Register, Witnesses > Broken Down. They Could Not Describe the Fearful Noise of the \\"Roller > Coaster.\\" , July 15, 1885 But it was in the area of civil liberties that Buchwalter stepped out in front of his peers. In the extradition proceeding regarding the Reverend A. Hampton, an African-American accused of murder, Buchwalter refused extradition to authorities from the Commonwealth of Kentucky until he had assurances from Governor Brown and the Sheriff of Green County, Kentucky, that Hampton would be protected from mob violence. Vigilantes had recently lynched a black man and a black boy in Green County. Buchwalter had also extradited two men, one to George and the other to Kentucky, only to receive reports that mobs killed both. This was not solely due to Southern intolerance for African-Americans. The Kentucky case involved an Italian-American. Buchwalter's order from the bench included an admonishment against vigilante justice on the other side of the Ohio river: \\"I determined then I would never send another prisoner South unless I had assurance he would be protected from a mob and given a fair trial.\\"Lewiston Daily Sun \\"To Prevent Lynching, Ohio Judge Demands Assurance for Protection of Colored Persons\\" January 1, 1895), p. 1. It was thought for a while in 1895 that the position of Buchwalter would lead to an intrastate solution to the growing problem of lynching, forcing violent States such as Kentucky to use the good offices of States known for order and pacificity, such as Illinois and Pennsylvania. The trend did not abate, and the matter was taken up by the Federal government only in the 1960s. The reaction in Cincinnati was more direct. A chapter of the Anti-Lynching League of the United States was formed in the Queen City in response to Buchwalter's opinion. Personal life On May 14, 1873, Buchwalter married Miss Louise Zimmerman, a daughter of the Honorable John Zimmerman, of Wooster, Ohio. Mrs. Buchwalter died in 1902, leaving six children, namely: Luther L., who engaged in the manufacturing business at Springfield, Ohio; Robert Z., an attorney of Cincinnati; Margaret L., the wife of Dr. H. B. Martin, of Springfield; Helen E., the wife of John Van Nortwick, of Batavia, Illinois; Morris, who resided at Hallsville, Ohio; and Louise, who married H. Cameron Forster, of Middletown, Ohio. On the 22d of July, 1909, the Judge married a second time, to Mary F. Knox, of Lakewood, New Jersey, formerly registrar of Smith College, a daughter of Rev. Charles E. Knox, deceased, formerly president of the German Theological Seminary, of Newark, New Jersey. Politically, Buchwalter identified with the Republican Party, being a bridge figure between the abolition movement and the Progressive era. He wrote an extensive study of Free Masonry and belonged to the Scottish Rite, being a thirty-third degree member of the order having been elected as such in 1894. He held membership in the Loyal Legion of Ohio, on account of his brother, Luther M., who was a captain in Company A, Seventy-Third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and gave up his life for the Union at the midnight battle of Lookout Valley (Wauhatchie). When he died, Morris was interred at Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery, 69 paces from the grave of his fraternity brother, Senator Joseph Benson Foraker, both of whom graduated with Cornell University's first Class in 1869. Buchwalter died on March 12, 1924 at the age of 78.

Situated on Powell and Market streets, next to the Powell Street cable car turntable, Hallidie Plaza and the Powell Street BART Station entrance, it is one of the few structures that survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The site formerly housed Baldwin's Hotel and Theatre, which was destroyed by fire in 1898. It was later purchased by James L. Flood, who constructed the building as a tribute to his father, James Clair Flood (1826–1889, the Comstock Lode millionaire). In 2003, it was still owned by the Flood family. John King, the architecture critic of the San Francisco Chronicle, praised the Flood Building as \\"twelve stories of orderly pomp with a rounded prow that commands the corner of Powell and Market Streets ... Every detail is rooted and right, from the tall storefronts that beckon cable car daytrippers to the baroque cliff of the sandstone façade with its deep-chiseled windows and just enough ornamentation to enliven the mass rather than clutter the scene.\\" Major tenants The Southern Pacific Railroad company maintained its headquarters in the building after its earthquake renovations from 1907 until 1917 when it moved to its own building now at One Market Plaza. The F. W. Woolworth Company store located on basement level and first and second floors was the largest in the chain until 1992, when it was downsized, and later closed in 1996. More recent major tenants include the flagship stores for retailers Gap, Urban Outfitters, and Anthropologie. The Pinkerton Detective Agency had an office in Room 314 of the building, and employed Dashiell Hammett, an author of hard- boiled detective novels, as an operative.

Hallidie Plaza was designed jointly by Lawrence Halprin, John Carl Warnecke, and Mario Ciampi and opened in 1973. In 1997, a perforated stainless steel- screened elevator was added to provide access to the plaza and station for disabled people. Although Powell Street station is one of the busiest stations in the BART system, Hallidie Plaza is relatively underused and has been criticized for its isolation from Market. Location and history Escalator at the eastern tip of East Hallidie Plaza, with Flood Building in the background (2009) Hallidie Plaza lies within the triangular block bounded by Market, Mason, and Eddy, north of Market; the plaza is below grade, crossed by a bridge carrying Cyril Magnin/5th which divides the plaza into eastern and western parts. The western part receives relatively little use. It is just south of the Flood Building, One Powell Street, and the cable car turntable at Powell and Market streets, and lies across Market from the Westfield San Francisco Centre mall. Hallidie Plaza also includes the Powell Street mall, which is the one-block-long portion of Powell south of Eddy that has been closed to road traffic. Concept and design After San Francisco Bay Area voters approved the creation of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in 1962, the report What to Do About Market Street was published later that year. In it, Halprin and Associates, led by landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, called for pedestrian arcades to connect the planned transit station with parking garages, north or south of Market, in this retail district. Two potential sites were examined in the 1965 Market Street Design Report, written by the firms led by Mario J. Ciampi and John Carl Warnecke; one site was the triangular block eventually selected, bounded by Mason, Eddy, and Market; the other site was south of Market across from the Phelan Building. By 1967, Ciampi and Warnecke had refined the design for the planned Powell Station Plaza; the 1967 site and design largely matched the eventual implementation of Hallidie Plaza, a sunken triangular plaza with escalators parallel to Market Street at the eastern and western ends. However, the 1967 plan called for more gradual amphitheater-style steps leading north to street level. The three architecture firms formed the Market Street Joint Venture Architects in 1968 to take on the Market Street Redevelopment Project in 1968, which also encompassed the design for two other large plazas along Market: United Nations Plaza at the neighboring station and Embarcadero Plaza near the San Francisco Ferry Building. Hallidie Plaza opened in 1973, as a central element of a remodeling of Market Street spurred by BART reconstruction after the double- deck Market Street Subway tunnel was built using cut-and-cover construction. It was named after Andrew Smith Hallidie, who developed the world's first cable car system in 1873. As built, the plaza sits below street level, built with granite walls, terraced concrete planters and brick paving laid in a herringbone pattern, extending into a walkway underneath Cyril Magnin Street. Mezzanine levels are provided on both the eastern and western portions of the plaza, and wood slat benches were originally installed on the lower and mezzanine levels of the plaza. In addition to the eastern and western escalators, the plaza can be accessed from street level via stairs in both portions, parallel to Cyril Magnin/5th. The plaza also contained a visitor information center off the tunnel under Cyril Magnin/5th from 1976 until it moved to Moscone Center at the end of 2018. Updates East Hallidie Plaza and entrance (2010); elevator and screen are prominent at right. Construction of an elevator started in 1997; Michael Willis was the architect responsible for the perforated metal design. The $510,000 elevator was approved after a lawsuit from disability rights activists charged that Hallidie Plaza was not accessible. The San Francisco Arts Commission was involved in the approval process, and took the opportunity to create a new public sculpture. During the administration of Mayor Willie Brown, more frequent police patrols initially displaced homeless residents from Civic Center Plaza to UN Plaza and Hallidie Plaza; a committee of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to bring the latter two under the city's Parks code which would allow stricter enforcement of laws criminalizing vagrancy; the full Board passed the measure in late January 1999. John King noted that making the plazas more unwelcoming did not discourage the homeless from gathering and recommended instead \\"the city should strive for places that are vibrant and attract all walks of life.\\" Indeed, after Cable Car Coffee opened up a branch location in Hallidie Plaza in June 1998, the increase in retail activity depressed the number of homeless in the plaza. The wood slat benches were removed in 1998, along with trees along the northeastern edge. Cable Car Coffee kiosk in East Hallidie Plaza (2009) In 2003, the mezzanine terrace was closed after reports of criminal activity; the benches were removed and the terrace was reopened in 2005. In 2009, it was proposed to close the western part of the plaza; the area west of 5th/Cyril Magnin would be covered and a cistern would be installed in the below-grade space, while the new deck would be used for cafe seating and public performances. The cistern would be used to hold groundwater pumped from Powell Street station; the station requires continuous pumping to prevent flooding from underground creeks. The city kicked off the Better Market Street project in 2012, aimed at improving the appeal of Market for the first time since the Market Street Redevelopment Plan was completed in the 1970s. The Union Square Business Improvement District (USBID) released its Public Realm Design Manual in 2015, including a section entitled \\"Activating Hallidie Plaza\\" with suggestions to improve the site's usability and attract retail development. A sign with the names and distances to the nineteen sister cities of San Francisco was installed at Hallidie Plaza in late June 2018. USBID has studied the possibility of adding flags of the sister cities to Hallidie Plaza and installing the large sculpture R-Evolution by Marco Cochrane to attract more activity. Reception San Francisco Chronicle urban design critic John King has described Hallidie Plaza as desolated, denounced its design as deeply flawed, and commented that \\"what was envisioned as a grand entrance instead is a void to avoid, a deep, angled space beloved by none but too pricey to fix.\\" King also said the plaza was \\"flawed from the start, products of a 1960s-era planning mentality that says spaces work best when they're kept apart from traffic and noise.\\" In contrast, architect Lajos Héder said the contrast created by the \\"technologically oriented BART environment [opening] directly onto the visual and social complexity of the San Francisco street scene ... has a genuine aesthetic value that transcends that of many more harmoniously integrated situations. It is a piece of powerful urban theater, by virtue of the impressions and lessons imparted by its contrasts.\\" Clare Cooper Marcus faulted the lack of interesting features and the dramatic difference in elevation for its paucity of users: \\"At Hallidie Plaza in San Francisco, there is little to look at beyond a large expanse of brick paving, glaring granite walls (on a hot day it is like an oven), small trees that offer no shade, and colorless planters. ... It is little wonder that the seats at the intermediate and upper levels, where passersby and traffic on Market Street create some interest, are always more heavily used than are those in the sunken plaza areas.\\" Hank Donat called the metal-screened elevator added in 1997 \\"San Francisco's Poop Chute\\", describing it as \\"a hideous and cold addition to the open plaza.\\" On April 30, 2018, BART started a pilot program to provide elevator attendants to discourage drug use and the elimination of human waste in the elevators at Powell Street and . The pilot was expanded to the other two downtown BART stations in 2019.

The term “configurations” is mostly used by comparative anthropological studies and by cultural history. Configurational analysis became a special method by the Stuttgart school of Historical Behaviour Studies during the 1970s and later by body culture studies in Denmark. Configurational analysis is marked by its distance towards the history of ideas and intentions, which are conceived as mainstreams in historical studies. Configurations of human behaviour and movement have attracted special attention in the framework of phenomenology (→Phenomenology (philosophy)) and particularly in materialist phenomenology.  Configurations in earlier cultural studies  Configurations in different cultures were studied since early twentieth century. Ruth Benedict (1934) contributed to the anthropology of Native Americans by using the term of “configurations” as a translation of German “Gestalt :de:Gestalt”. Configuration denoted a whole of social attitudes, practices and beliefs and was nearly identical with “culture”. It was used for comparison – between the Hopi Indians and the Indians of the prairies, between Japanese and Western culture – and in a perspective of cultural relativism: Each culture has configurations of its own.Benedict, Ruth 1934: Patterns of Culture. Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin Gaston Bachelard (1938) used the term ”diagram” to describe an order of conceived reality both in scientific and in literary understanding. This was his key to a \\"materialist psychoanalysis\\".Bachelard, Gaston 1938: La psychanalyse du feu; English 1964: Psychoanalysis of fire. Boston: Beacon Bachelard’s approach became later a source of inspiration for Michel Foucault. Norbert Elias (1939, 1970) described certain patterns of relations between human beings as figuration – in English: ”configuration” – becoming visible in play of cards, dance and football. He described these configurations as das sich wandelnde Muster, das die Spieler miteinander bilden (the changing pattern, which players form with each other), Spannungsgefüge (relations of suspense), Interdependenz der Spieler (interdependence of players), and das fluktuierende Spannungsgleichgewicht, das Hin und Her einer Machtbalance (the fluctuating balance of suspense, the to-and-fro of a balance of power).Elias, Norbert 1939: Über den Prozess der Zivilisation. Soziogenetische und psychogenetische Untersuchungen. Frankfort/ Main Suhrkamp; English 1982: The Civilizing Process. Oxford Blackwell. This became a key to his sociology of civilization. Michel Foucault (1966) used the term la configuration in historical studies of philosophy, in order to characterize “the order of the things”, patterns of knowledge changing in epistemological disruptions. The configurations of savoir changed, according to Foucault, in following historical steps:Foucault, Michel 1966: Les mots et les choses. Paris: Gallimard; English 1970: The Order of Things. An Archeology of the Human Sciences. New York: Pantheon : The Renaissance focused on the chains of similarities, going from sign to sign. Miguel de Cervantes shaped an ironical picture of this configuration by the phantasmas of Don Quixote (part 1 - 1605). : The 18th century constructed the tableau as a universal grammar. On this base, Linné constructed the genealogical trees of plants and animals as a tableau of life. An ironical picture of this configuration was given by Laurence Sterne in his The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (part 1 - 1759). : The 19th century discovered progress and evolution – in life science as natural history, in economy as production, and in language as linguistic history. On the background of these modern configurations, which took their form around 1800, individual subjectivity was constructed, as well as the dynamic of industrial life developed. There are indicators that these configurations may disappear or transform again in a post-modern age.  Configurations in historical behaviour studies  Configurational analysis (in German Konfigurationsanalyse) became a particular methodological approach in the framework of Historical Behaviour Studies, as they were developed at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970s by the historians August Nitschke and Henning Eichberg. Nitschke analyzed raum-zeitliche Muster (patterns of space and time) and Körperanordnungen (orders of the body) as “configurations” when comparing patterns of art and patterns of social behavior. Configurations were similarities, analogies and changing patterns of figures in a given space.Nitschke, August 1975: Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen. Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog; id. 1975 (ed.): Verhaltenswandel in der industriellen Revolution. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer Verlag This analytical approach was comparable to concepts, which in recent time have challenged historiography: mentality (Georges Duby), affect control (Norbert Elias) (→Affect control theory), perception (Lucien Febvre), structural thinking (Claude Lévi-Strauss), needs (David McClelland), and interaction (George Herbert Mead).Nitschke, August 1981: Historische Verhaltensforschung. Stuttgart: Ulmer The configurational approach contrasted deliberately with the mainstream of historiography explaining history by the aims of its actors (pragmatism), as an expression of weltanschauung (psychology and history of ideas) or by interests (in social history).Nitschke, August 1975: Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen. Stuttgart-Bad-Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog The configurational analysis was especially applied to comparative and historical studies of sport and dance as indicators of social change. The comparative analysis of athletics, ball games, equestrianism, martial arts, gymnastics, and dance showed some common configurations as: the functional parceling of space, a new dynamic of “progress” and speed, the modern taste of suspense, the principle of competition, and the production of result tables. The configurations of movement culture prefigured the patterns of productivity orientation, which characterized the Industrial Age.Eichberg, Henning 1978: Leistung, Spannung Geschwindigkeit. Sport und Tanz im gesellschaftlichen Wandel des 18./19. Jahrhunderts. Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta The applied concept of “configuration” was here different from \\"system\\" (→cultural system) (being more static and systematic, and related to the negative term of the non- systematic), from “style” (being more aesthetic and having undertones of taste, subjectivity and stylization), and from “structure” (having undertones of “the functional”, as a heritage from structural functionalism in sociology). In contrast to these terms, configuration denotes a more dynamic pattern in change. Configurations as patterns of behaviour, movement and thinking reflect man's perception of reality. They give an epochal pattern of perception which concurrently defines a framework for action. But in no way they describe the whole reality of an epoch. Furthermore, their power to explain individual actions is limited. The epochal \\"reality\\" is no straitjacket which does not allow freedom of action. Nevertheless, in each epoch there are typical ways to act or to behave, to move or to think. They correspond with the way people perceive reality. Acting or thinking in this way may be right or wrong – it is typical anyway.Nitschke, August (1962): Heilige in dieser Welt. Persönliche Autorität und politische Wirksamkeit. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer; Kalckhoff, Andreas (1982): \\"Historische Verhaltensforschung: Ethnologie unserer Vergangenheit. Die Konfiguration eines Aufstandes im 10. Jahrhundert\\", in Gehlen, Rolf & Wolf, Bernd (eds.): Werner Müller zu seinem 75.Geburtstag, Unter dem Pflaster liegt der Strand 11. Berlin: Karin Kramer.  Configurations in body culture studies  Studies of body culture, which spread in Denmark during the 1980s, developed the configurational analysis further, revealing inner tensions and contradictions of a given society.Dietrich, Knut 2001 (ed.): How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport. University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences; Eichberg, Henning 1998: Body Cultures. London: Routledge; id. - 2001: “Thinking contradictions. Towards a methodology of configurational analysis, or: How to reconstruct the societal signification of movement culture and sport.” In: Knut Dietrich (ed.): How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport. University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences, 10-32; id. 2010: Bodily Democracy. London: Routledge The configurative approach was applied to the analysis and especially to comparison of different fields of activities: popular festivity, fitness culture (→physical fitness), sportive and non-sportive ball games, sport racing and parcour, different outdoor activities, and different health cultures. Configurational analysis focused on bodily movement in time and space, on the energy of movement, on interpersonal relations, and on the objectification of movement. Above this basis, analysis included the superstructure of institutions and ideas (→Base and superstructure), which organize and reflect collective actions and interests. : Time of bodily movement is marked, among others, by contradictions between acceleration and slowness – between living rhythm and mechanical pace – between linear-abstract and irreversible time – between cyclical, progressing and situational time. Historical change saw for instance the transformation from the noble exercises of the eighteenth century with their circulating and formally measured patterns to modern gymnastics and sports with their patterns of speed, acceleration, and flow, which characterized industrial behaviour more generally. : Space of bodily movement is characterized by contradictions between the straight line and the labyrinth – between connection and parcellation of spaces – between geometrical and directed space – between space, place and intermediary space. Foucault's study of the panopticon as a specific modern way of organising the space of movement and bodily visibility around 1800 showed the societal depth of this analysis. : Energy of bodily movement consists of a multiplicity of different atmospheres, radiations, moods and modes of attunement. Modern suspension (suspense, tension, thrill, excitement – in German Spannung') emerged in eighteenth and nineteenth century’s boxing and ball games at the same time as it appeared in detective novels. This coincidence was illustrative for the configurational change towards industrial society. Social energy was also illustrated by the study of laughter in the tradition of Mikhail Bakhtin's analysis of Renaissance society. : Interpersonal relations in bodily movement tell about power and gender – about winners and losers – about you- and we-relations in motion. The study of sports has especially been enriched by the attention to gender unbalances in body culture. : Objectification of bodily movement is especially characteristic for modern body cultures. Bodily movement is reified in a tension between process and result – between social production, reproduction and a-productive encounters in bodily activity – between producing data or pictures by movement. The production of records by modern sports has been a central point for understanding modern industrial behaviour. : Above these basic body-cultural processes, body culture shows patterns of organizational and institutional character as well as the meanings and ideas, which are ascribed to bodily practices. Mainstream studies of sport often over-emphasize these superstructures (→Base and superstructure), while the configurational analysis of body culture gives priority to the focus on bodily practice, in the framework of a materialist phenomenology.  Further configurational approaches  Configurational analysis can be compared with other contemporary approaches in cultural and social studies. : Pierre Bourdieu (1966/67, 1979) launched the concept of ”habitus” to describe patterns of action, of bodily practice and presentation, of taste and aesthetic form (comparable to the Gothic style of Medieval cathedrals). Like configuration, habitus was illustrative for a certain homology, which could be found inside a given social formation or class and as distinction between different social classes.Bourdieu, Pierre 1966/67: \\"Champs intellectuel et projet créateur.\\" In: Temps modernes, 22, 865-906; id. 1979: La distinction. Paris: Minuit. – English 1984: Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste. London: Routledge : Peter Sloterdijk (1998/99) developed a cultural ”morphology”, which described the psychosocial geometry of people’s living space and inhabitations, their world and their understanding of God. Micro- and macrospheres were related to each other by characteristic configurations.Sloterdijk, Peter 1998/2004: Sphären. Plurale Sphärologie. Vols.1-3, Frankfurt/Main: Suhrkamp In any of these approaches, “configuration” made it possible to compare concrete human practice – i.e. “material” bodily phenomena – with larger spheres of society and culture.

Accident Flight 1216 was a special charter transporting Guatemalan students home from universities in Cuba. The aircraft took off from José Martí International Airport in Cuba with 296 passengers and 18 crew on board. After a two-hour flight the aircraft was cleared to land on Runway 19 at La Aurora International Airport. On landing the pilots were unable to stop the aircraft and it ran off the end of the runway and down a slope, crashing into ten houses. The accident killed 18 people in all: eight passengers and eight crew members on board the aircraft, and two occupants of the houses. There were 298 passengers and crew who survived; however 37, passengers and crew and another 20 people on the ground were injured in the accident. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off. The crash occurred in the La Libertad neighborhood. Jorge Toledo, the Cuban pilot, was among the dead. Cause The accident was investigated by the Sección de Investigación de Accidentes of Guatemala's Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil. The investigation found that the aircraft touched down too far along the wet runway with insufficient deceleration, and that the crew had failed to initiate a go-around. The spoilers was found in the down and locked position, while the FDR showed them deployed. The handle for the spoilers in the cockpit was found in an undefined position.

There are two basic types: inhibitory priority effects occur when a species that arrives first at a site negatively impacts a species that arrives later by reducing the availability of space or resources. Facilitative priority effects occur when a species that arrives first at a site alters abiotic or biotic conditions in ways that positively impact a species arriving later. Priority effects are a central and pervasive element of ecological community development. These effects have important implications for natural systems as well as ecological restoration efforts. Theoretical foundation=Community succession theory Early in the 20th century, Frederic Clements and other plant ecologists suggested that ecological communities develop in a linear, directional manner towards a final, stable end-point: the climax community. Clements indicated that a site's climax community would reflect local climate. He conceptualized the climax community as a \\"superorganism\\" that followed a defined developmental sequence. Early ecological succession theory maintained that the directional shifts from one stage of succession to the next were induced by the plants themselves. In this sense, succession theory implicitly recognized priority effects; the prior arrival of certain species had important impacts on future community composition. At the same time, the climax concept implied that species shifts were predetermined. A given species would always appear at the same point during the development of the climax community, and always have the same impact on community development. This static view of priority effects remained essentially unchanged by the concept of patch dynamics, which was introduced by Alex Watt in 1947. Watt conceived of plant communities as dynamic \\"mechanisms\\" that followed predetermined succession cycles. Although Watt questioned the idea of a stable endpoint to community development, he seemed to agree with Clements that each particular species had a predetermined role to play in community development. They viewed succession as a process driven by facilitation, in which each species made local conditions more suitable for another species. Individualistic approach In 1926, Henry Gleason presented an alternative hypothesis in which plants were conceptualized as individuals rather than components of a superorganism. Gleason suggested that the distribution of various species across the landscape reflected species-specific dispersal limitations and environmental requirements rather than predetermined associations among species. Gleason set the stage for future research on priority effects by explaining that initially identical ponds colonized by different species could develop through succession into very different communities. Thus, Gleason contested the idea of a predetermined climax community and recognized that different colonizing species could produce alternative trajectories of community development. Frank Egler (1954) built on Gleason's hypothesis by developing the Initial Floristic Composition model to describe community development in abandoned agricultural fields. According to this model, the set of species present in a field immediately after abandonment had strong influences on community development and final community composition. Although rooted in succession theory, this approach foreshadowed the development of alternative stable state and community assembly theory. Alternative stable states In the 1970s, it was suggested that natural communities could be characterized by multiple or alternative stable states. In accordance with the conclusions of Gleason and Egler, multiple stable state models indicated that the same environment could support several different combinations of species. Theorists argued that historical context could play a central role in determining which stable state would be present at any given time. Robert May explained, \\"If there is a unique stable state, historical accidents are unimportant; if there are many alternative locally stable states, historical accidents can be of overriding significance.\\" Community assembly theory The development of assembly theory followed from the emergence of alternative stable state theory. Assembly theory explains community development processes in the context of multiple stable states. It asks why a particular type of community developed when other stable community types were possible. In contrast to succession theory, assembly theory was developed largely by animal ecologists and explicitly incorporated historical context. In one of the first models based on this theory, Jared Diamond (1975) developed quantitative \\"assembly rules\\" to predict avian community composition on an archipelago. Although the idea of deterministic community assembly quickly drew criticism, the assembly approach, which emphasized historical contingency and multiple stable states, continued to gain support. Drake (1991) used an assembly model to demonstrate that different community types would result from different sequences of species invasions. In Drake’s model, early invaders had major impacts on the invasion success of species that arrived later. Other modeling studies suggested that priority effects may be especially important when invasion frequency is low enough to allow species to become established before replacement, or when other factors that could drive assembly (e.g., competition, abiotic stress) are relatively unimportant. In a 1999 review, Belyea and Lancaster described three basic determinants of community assembly: dispersal constraints, environmental constraints, and internal dynamics. They identified priority effects as a manifestation of the interaction between dispersal constraints and internal dynamics. Empirical evidence On January 25, 2007, a search of the ISI Web of Science citation index using the key word \\"priority effect*\\" returned 65 ecology-related studies. The first study to explicitly mention priority effects was published in 1983. Although early research focused on animals and aquatic systems, more recent studies have begun to examine terrestrial and plant-based priority effects. Inhibitory priority effects have been documented more frequently than facilitative priority effects. Priority effects among species within the same trophic level and functional group, or guild, have been documented more frequently than effects across trophic levels or guilds. Studies indicate that both abiotic (e.g. resource availability) and biotic (e.g. predation) factors can affect the strength of priority effects. Marine Most of the earliest empirical evidence for priority effects came from studies on aquatic animals. Sutherland (1974) found that final community composition varied depending on the initial order of larval recruitment in a community of small marine organisms (sponges, tunicates, hydroids, and other species). Shulman (1983) and Almany (2003) found strong priority effects among coral reef fish. The former study found that prior establishment by a territorial damselfish reduced establishment rates of other fish. The authors also identified cross-trophic priority effects; prior establishment by a predator fish reduced establishment rates of prey fishes. In the late 1980s, several studies examined priority effects in marine microcosms. Robinson and Dickerson (1987) found that priority effects were important in some cases, but suggested, \\"Being the first to invade a habitat does not guarantee success; there must be sufficient time for the early colonist to increase its population size for it to pre-empt further colonization.\\" Robinson and Edgemon (1988) later developed 54 communities of phytoplankton species by varying invasion order, rate, and timing. They found that although invasion order (priority effects) could explain a small fraction of the resulting variation in community composition, most of the variation was explained by changes in invasion rate and invasion timing. These studies indicate that priority effects may not be the only or the most important historical factor affecting the trajectory of community development. In a striking example of cross-trophic priority effects, Hart (1992) found that priority effects explain the maintenance of two alternate stable states in stream ecosystems. While a macroalga is dominant in some patches, sessile grazers maintain a \\"lawn\\" of small microalgae in others. If the sessile grazers colonize a patch first, they exclude the macroalga, and vice versa. Amphibian In two of the most commonly cited empirical studies on priority effects, Alford and Wilbur documented inhibitory and facilitative priority effects among and toad larvae in experimental ponds. They found that hatchlings of a toad species (Bufo americanus) exhibited higher growth and survivorship when introduced to a pond before those of a frog species (Rana sphenocephala). The frog larvae, however, did best when introduced after the toad larvae. Thus, prior establishment by the toad species facilitated the frog species, while prior establishment by the frog species inhibited the toad species. Studies on tree frogs have also documented both types of priority effect. Morin (1987) also observed that priority effects became less important in the presence of a predatory salamander. He hypothesized that predation mediated priority effects by reducing competition between frog species. Studies on larval insects and frogs in water-filled tree holes and stumps found that abiotic factors such as space, resource availability, and toxin levels can also be important in mediating priority effects. Terrestrial Terrestrial studies on priority effects are rare. The aforementioned ISI Web of Science search retrieved only 19 studies on fully terrestrial organisms, and all of these studies were published during or after 1993. Most studies have focused on arthropods or grassland plant species. In a lab experiment, Shorrocks and Bingley (1994) showed that prior arrival increased survivorship for two species of fruit flies; each fly species had inhibitory impacts on the other. A 1996 field study on desert spiders by Ehmann and MacMahon showed that the presence of species from one spider guild reduced establishment of spiders from a different guild. More recently, Palmer (2003) demonstrated that priority effects allowed a competitively subordinate ant species to avoid exclusion by a competitively dominant species. If the competitively subordinate ants were able to colonize first, they altered their host tree’s morphology in ways that made it less suitable for other ant species. This study was especially important because it was able to identify a mechanism driving observed priority effects. With the exception of an early study exploring the facilitative effects of litter deposition, studies that explicitly addressed terrestrial plant priority effects began to appear in the literature around the year 2000. A study on two species of introduced grasses in Hawaiian woodlands found that the species with inferior competitive abilities may be able to persist through priority effects. At least three studies have come to similar conclusions about the coexistence of native and exotic grasses in California grassland ecosystems. If given time to establish, native species can successfully inhibit the establishment of exotics. Authors of the various studies attributed the prevalence of exotic grasses in California to the low seed production and relatively poor dispersal ability of native species. Emerging concepts=Long-term implications: convergence and divergence Although many studies have documented priority effects, the persistence of these effects over time often remains unclear. Young(2001) indicated that both convergence (in which \\"communities proceed towards a predisturbance state regardless of historical conditions\\") and divergence (in which historical factors continue to affect the long-term trajectory of community development) are present in nature. Among studies of priority effects, both trends seem to have been observed. Fukami (2005) argued that a community could be both convergent and divergent at different levels of community organization. The authors studied experimentally-assembled plant communities and found that while the identities of individual species remained unique across different community replicates, species traits generally became more similar. Trophic ecology Some studies indicate that priority effects can occur across guilds or trophic levels. Such priority effects could have dramatic impacts on community composition and food web structure. Even intra-guild priority effects could have important consequences at multiple trophic levels if the affected species are associated with unique predator or prey species. Consider, for example, a plant species that is eaten by a host- specific herbivore. Priority effects that influence the ability of the plant species to establish would indirectly affect the establishment success of the associated herbivore. Theoretical models have described cyclical assembly dynamics in which species associated with different suites of predators are able to repeatedly replace one another. Intraspecific aggregation In situations where two species are introduced at the same time, spatial aggregation of a species' propagules could cause priority effects by initially reducing interspecific competition. Aggregation during recruitment and establishment could allow inferior competitors to coexist with or even displace competitive dominants over the long-term. Several modeling efforts have begun to examine the implications of spatial priority effects for species coexistence. Rejmanek (2002) suggested that only 10 empirical studies examining intraspecific aggregation had been published by 2002. Mechanisms and new organisms The literature on priority effects is currently growing in both depth and breadth. A few studies have begun to explore the mechanisms driving observed priority effects. Moreover, although past studies focused on a small subset of species, recent papers indicate that priority effects may be important for a wide range of organisms, including fungi, birds, lizards, and salamanders. Ecological restoration Priority effects have important implications for ecological restoration. In many systems, information about priority effects can help practitioners identify cost-effective strategies for improving the survival and persistence of certain species, especially species of inferior competitive ability. For example, in a study on the restoration of native Californian grasses and forbs, Lulow (2004) found that forbs could not establish in plots where she had previously planted bunchgrasses. When bunchgrasses were added to plots where forbs had already been growing for a year, forbs were able to coexist with grasses for at least 3–4 years. Lulow’s results suggested that planting forbs before grasses might improve forb persistence in this system.

It was written by Dave Erickson, directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton and originally aired on October 15, 2008 in the United States. Plot Utility company employees working near Highway 44 dig up three skeletons while laying pipes. When SAMCRO hear the news, an emergency club meeting is arranged. Clay tells the crew that the bodies are Mayans killed in the SAMCRO-Mayan War of '91, and they need to stop them from being identified. In truth, however, one of the bodies actually belongs to Lowell Harland, Sr., a mechanic at Clay's garage who was killed for being a \\"junkie rat\\". Lowell Sr.'s son, Lowell, Jr., is now also a mechanic at the garage and a former drug addict. Tig is the only patch holder besides Clay who knows that Lowell, Sr. was murdered. To raise funds to buy more guns from the True IRA, the club decides to enter Half-Sack into a bare-knuckle boxing competition. Half-Sack, the former lightweight champion, is told to win his first five fights then take a dive in the sixth. This will allow SAMCRO to bet on his underdog opponent and earn a large pay-off. He is trained by Chibs, who recently returned from his trip with Michael McKeavey. Chibs insists Half-Sack has \\"no booze, no weed and no pussy\\". This means that Cherry must be kept away from him. To test her loyalty to Half-Sack, Bobby tries to have sex with Cherry at his house, but she refuses his advances. That night, Clay, Tig and Jax go to the morgue to steal the bodies. In order to sneak in unnoticed, they must make sure no one is around; Tig shows the bite mark on his buttocks to the female doctors standing nearby, who flee in disgust. Clay tells Jax to wait outside and keep guard. Upon finding the first dead man, Tig sets about removing his teeth with pliers – until Jax appears and offers to lend a hand. He discovers that the body has already been identified and that it is Lowell Sr. Clay claims that Lowell, Sr. was killed by the Mayans and, after exacting revenge on his killers, Clay and Tig buried all three bodies together. At the police station, Agents Hale and Stahl, having identified the bodies, suspect Clay of the murders and decide to use their suspicions to turn Lowell, Jr. against SAMCRO. They bring him to the station and tell him of his father's fate and where he was buried. Later, at the garage, Clay tries to convince Lowell otherwise, telling him the same story he told Jax earlier. Lowell seems to have believed the police’s story, however, and goes missing. Worried that he may be a liability to the club, Clay heads off to track down and kill him. He finds Lowell at a motel and puts a gun to his head, preparing to kill him. However, he has a change of heart and decides to tell Lowell the truth and bring him home. Reception Zach Handler of The AV Club gave \\"Old Bones\\" a B rating, stating; \\"\\"Old Bones\\" felt mostly like set-up.

Recruits from the Pittsburgh area and Allegheny County organized at Camp Copeland from September 2–19, 1862 into the 155th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. Edward J. Allen served as the first colonel. After initial training and drilling, the regiment moved via train to Washington, D.C. where it joined the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division of the Union Fifth Corps. From there, it went to Sharpsburg, Maryland, after the Battle of Antietam. Their first introduction to battle came on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg where the color guard suffered heavy casualties in an ill-fated assault. During its first years, the regiment wore the regulation uniform of the Union Army, but in February 1864 they, along with the 140th New York received a uniform inspired by the French Zouave uniform. Another regiment in the brigade, the 146th New York Volunteer Infantry, had already been issued their Zouave uniform in June 1863. The 140th New York wore a predominately dark blue Zouave uniform with red trim. The 146th New York wore a light blue uniform with red and yellow trim. The 155th Pennsylvania uniform was French blue (not dark blue) with yellow trim that featured very large yellow \\"tombeaux\\", a stylized false pocket on the front left and right breasts of the jacket. A red Zouave sash with yellow trim, a red fez with yellow trim with a dark blue tassle attached, completed the uniform. Slight variations in jacket styles can be seen in the unit's regimental history entitled \\"Under the Maltese Cross\\" published in 1910. The 155th Pennsylvania along with the 140th New York and the 146th New York became the \\"Zouave Brigade\\" in the Army of the Potomac's Fifth Corps. The brigade would later grow with the addition of the 5th New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment, however the 155th would be transferred to another brigade due to a disagreement between the regiment's colonel and the brigade commander. Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Alfred L. Pearson, commander of the regiment at the Battle of Lewis's Farm on March 29, 1865, was awarded the Medal of Honor on September 17, 1897, for his actions leading a counterattack which regained lost ground and repulsed the Confederates, driving them back to their original positions.

While serving with the union in California, she helped pioneer SEIU's use of card check agreements, non-traditional collective bargaining agreements, comprehensive campaigns, and system-wide health care organizing strategies. Henry is included in Time magazine 's 100 Most Influential People of 2020. Early life and union career Henry was born in 1958 in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.Evans, M. \\"United She Stands\\", Modern Healthcare. November 27, 2006.Vesely, \\"Doing Their Part for Reform\\", Modern Healthcare. April 20, 2009. Her father was a salesman and her mother was a teacher, and both were devout Catholics. Henry credits her faith with giving her an interest in social justice issues. The oldest girl in a family of 10 children, she attended Marian High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. She gained a favorable impression of labor unions from hearing and reading about the work of the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the heavily unionized automotive industry. She worked in a local hospital while in high school to earn money. In college, Henry initially wanted to become an urban planner. She continued to work in hospitals as an undergraduate student, and also as a medical assistant for the American Red Cross. She earned her bachelor's degree from Michigan State University in 1979, majoring in urban planning and labor relations. While in college, she was a volunteer lobbyist for a grassroots group, and worked alongside union lobbyists on various issues. Her first job out of college was with the American Foreign Service distributing food stamps to the needy.Pondel, E. \\"SEIU Getting Healthier\\", Daily News of Los Angeles. September 1, 2003. When a member from the United Auto Workers suggested that the way to end hunger was to enable people to obtain well-paying jobs, Henry began considering union organizing. Henry joined SEIU as a researcher in 1980. She had a natural gift for organizing, later saying, \\"I was always asked to get everybody organized to get on the bus and to get everyone to the dinner table on time.\\"Greenhouse, S. \\"New Union Leader Wants Group to Be More of a Political Powerhouse\\", New York Times. May 9, 2010. Her experiences as a health care worker prompted her to work for a union that was involved in health care organizing. She joined SEIU because it was one of the few unions hiring women as organizers at the time. During the 1980s, Henry held 18 jobs within the SEIU in California. She served as the San Francisco-area strike coordinator during a 1986 strike by more than 9,000 clerks, certified nursing assistants, and technicians against 14 Kaiser Permanente hospitals and health care facilities throughout California.Leavitt, \\"Kaiser Permanente Strike Spreads to California\\", United Press International. October 27, 1986. She helped pioneer SEIU's use of card check agreements , non-traditional collective bargaining agreements, and system-wide health care organizing strategy. In 1993, she was named director of the 475,000-member health care division of SEIU.Rosenblatt, \\"Battle Over Health Care Reform Shifts to State,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 9, 1994; Shuit, \\"Defeat May Prove Fatal for Large-Scale Health Reforms\\", Los Angeles Times.

Henry was elected to SEIU's Executive Board in December 1995 after President John Sweeney resigned after his election as President of the AFL-CIO.\\"John Sweeney Steps Down From Top SEIU Post\\", Service Employees International Union, December 12, 1995. SEIU President Andrew Stern named Henry his assistant for organizing in 1996. Henry was named assistant to then-SEIU Executive Vice President Eliseo Medina in 1998. She remained active in the union's health care organizing, however, representing SEIU in its talks in 1999 to secure a card check agreement with the Catholic Healthcare West hospital chain.\\"Talks Falter in Effort to Form Union for Catholic Healthcare West Hospital Workers\\", Associated Press. August 6, 1999. More than 17,000 new members at 27 hospitals were organized under that agreement. She was also involved in SEIU's successful negotiations with Tenet Healthcare for a card check agreement.White, \\"Unions Battle for Nurses\\", Los Angeles Times, August 3, 2003. She was named SEIU's Southern California organizing director in 2000, the international union's chief healthcare strategist in 2004, and elected an Executive Vice President of the union in 2004.\\"Mary Kay Henry\\", Modern Healthcare. April 20, 2009.Evans, M. \\"Laboring for Union Nurses\\", Modern Healthcare. May 23, 2005.

August 1, 2005.Despite her rise in the union, Henry still oversaw SEIU's health care organizing efforts (see Evans, M. \\"United She Stands\\", Modern Healthcare, November 27, 2006). She helped negotiate a \\"no-raid agreement\\" between SEIU and the United American Nurses in 2006. In her first 25 years with SEIU, Henry played a major role in organizing drives at Beverly Enterprises, Catholic Health Care West, Tenet Healthcare, and HCA, Inc. Stern relied on her to coordinate and lead important legislative efforts. SEIU Executive Vice President Dennis Rivera took over Henry's healthcare organizing duties in early 2007.Evans, M. \\"SEIU's Power Player\\", Modern Healthcare. February 5, 2007. Henry and Medina helped plan the breakup of SEIU United Healthcare Workers West (UHW-West), a 140,000-member SEIU local, and force half its membership into a new statewide local which SEIU claimed would have enhanced collective bargaining and lobbying power.Robertson, K. \\"SEIU Plans to Form New Union of Health-Care Workers\\", San Francisco Business Times. January 9, 2009; Larrubia, E. \\"SEIU to Create a Giant Branch\\", Los Angeles Times. January 11, 2009. UHW-West leaders balked at the plan, SEIU established a trusteeship over UHW-West, UHW-West leaders challenged the trusteeship and established an independent union (the National Union of Healthcare Workers, or NUHW), and the two unions began fighting over who would represent more than 100,000 employees in 350 bargaining units.Brenner, M. \\"SEIU Launches Takeover of United Healthcare Workers-West\\", Labor Notes.

SEIU presidency On April 13, 2010, several media sources reported that Stern would resign immediately as president of the union.McDonnell, Pringle, and Nicholas, \\"SEIU President Andy Stern Reportedly Will Step Down Soon\\", Los Angeles Times.

April 13, 2010.MacGillis, A. \\"At Peak of Influence, SEIU Chief Set to Leave\\", Washington Post. April 14, 2010. Stern resigned on Thursday, April 15. Anna Burger, SEIU's Secretary-Treasurer and the Chair of the Change to Win Federation, was named SEIU's interim president, to serve for 30 days until the SEIU Executive Board could name a permanent successor. Burger was widely considered to be Stern's likely successor.Carlson, J. \\"A Stern Farewell\\", Modern Healthcare. April 19, 2010. Henry was considered a dark horse candidate, although likely to challenge Burger for the presidency. Several SEIU insiders urged Dennis Rivera to seek the presidency as well.Gonzalez, J. \\"Labor Union Surprise Exit\\", New York Daily News. April 14, 2010. Stern, however, publicly endorsed Burger for the position.McDonnell, P. \\"SEIU Rift Opens Over President's Successor\\", Los Angeles Times. April 27, 2010.McDonnell, P. \\"Path Cleared for New SEIU Chief\\", Los Angeles Times. April 29, 2010. Support for Henry's candidacy swiftly grew. Within days of Stern's resignation announcement, four Executive Vice Presidents with the international union sent an e-mail announcing their support for her.Hananel, S. \\"Powerful Union Closer to Picking New Leader\\", Associated Press. April 29, 2010. \\"Mary Kay's greatest strength is her ability to build consensus and create a highly effective team around shared goals and responsibilities. Mary Kay is the type of leader who motivates rather than demands\\", the note said. The e-mail also cited the need \\"to return to organizing as our top priority\\" and \\"to restore our relationships with the rest of the union movement and our progressive allies.\\"Scanlon, \\"Meet Big Union's New Boss\\", Washington Times. May 11, 2010. Twelve days after Stern's announcement, national media reported more local unions representing more than 60 percent of SEIU's 1.9 million members had agreed to support Henry's candidacy.Greenhouse, S. \\"Grass-Roots Choice Leads Race for Top Union Post\\", New York Times. April 27, 2010. Among the reasons why local union leaders backed Henry were the desire to have a fresh person in the leadership role, Henry was seen as a consensus builder, Burger was seen as too close to the authoritarian Stern, and Henry was viewed as more focused on organizing new members (while Burger was seen as focused on SEIU's political activity). National press reported that some local and regional SEIU leaders felt Henry would be less likely to continue Stern's local union merger program and more conciliatory to breakaway unions such as those in California. But Burger's backers countered that Henry had never led a local union, had little on-the-ground organizing experience, and had associated with many SEIU staff and elected leaders tainted by recent scandals over financial impropriety. Despite these charges, several large union locals in California and New York backed Henry. Support for Henry also seemed to gain momentum when she told members of the international union's Executive Board that she favored letting local unions, not leaders based in Washington, D.C., set the union's agenda.Weber, J. \\"Union Leadership Election May Signal Shift in Strategy\\", Washington Times. April 30, 2010. In a memo sent to SEIU leaders nationwide, Henry said, \\"Our local unions and divisions should drive our national priorities, not the other way around.\\" On April 28, Burger withdrew as a candidate for the presidency. Burger said she would not resign as the union's Secretary-Treasurer, and endorsed Henry.\\"Digest\\", Washington Post. April 29, 2010. Mary Kay Henry was elected President of SEIU by the international union's Executive Board on May 8, 2010, to serve the two remaining years of Stern's term. Her original term as President expired in 2012. After her election, Henry said her major priorities as union president would be to advocate for labor rights, immigrants' rights, and LGBT rights. However, she said she did not foresee bringing SEIU back into the AFL-CIO and refused to end the union's battles with its breakaway California locals. A few days after her election, Henry began conducting a review of the duties and assignments of SEIU's top leadership and staff (including Secretary-Treasurer Burger), noting, \\"It is the prerogative of the president to reassign responsibilities.\\"Murray, M. \\"New SEIU President Eyes Leadership Shake-Up\\", Roll Call. May 12, 2010.Murray, M. \\"Burger Not Yet on the Griddle, SEIU Chief Says\\", Roll Call. May 17, 2010. Burger denied that she was thinking of quitting the union due to the review. Awards In 2019 the winner of the Eugene V. Debs Award was Mary Kay Henry on behalf of the SEIU. Personal life Henry is a lesbian, and co-founder of SEIU's Lavender Caucus, a gay and lesbian group within the international union dedicated to improving rights for LGBTQ people within unions and at the workplace. She and her partner, Paula Macchello (a senior strategic organizer with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters), are both advocates for same-sex marriage.\\"Voice for Equality: Mary Kay Henry\\", Freedom to Marry.

Henry used to be a labor adviser to the Catholic Health Care and Work Subcommittee of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Modern Healthcare magazine, an influential trade publication in the U.S. health care industry, named Henry as one of its \\"Top 25 Women in Healthcare\\" in 2009.

Notice the young cottonwood and sycamore trees at the left. Riparian-zone restoration is the ecological restoration of riparian-zone habitats of streams, rivers, springs, lakes, floodplains, and other hydrologic ecologies. A riparian zone or riparian area is the interface between land and a river or stream. Riparian is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen terrestrial biomes of the earth; the habitats of plant and animal communities along the margins and river banks are called riparian vegetation, characterized by Aquatic plants and animals that favor them. Riparian zones are significant in ecology, environmental management, and civil engineering because of their role in soil conservation, their habitat biodiversity, and the influence they have on fauna and aquatic ecosystems, including grassland, woodland, wetland or sub-surface features such as water tables. In some regions the terms riparian woodland, riparian forest, riparian buffer zone, or riparian strip are used to characterize a riparian zone. The perceived need for Riparian-zone restoration has come about because riparian zones have been altered and/or degraded throughout much of the world by the activities of mankind affecting natural geologic forces. The unique biodiversity of riparian ecosystems and the potential benefits that natural, vegetated riparian have to offer in preventing erosion, maintaining water quality that ranges from being decent to completely healthy, providing habitat and wildlife corridors, and maintaining the health of in-stream biota (Aquatic organisms) has led to a surge of restoration activities aimed at riparian ecosystems in the last few decades. Restoration efforts are typically guided by an ecological understanding of riparian-zone processes and knowledge of the causes of degradation. They are often interdependent with stream restoration projects.  Causes of riparian- zone degradation  Riparian-zone disturbance falls into two main categories: hydrologic modifications that indirectly impact riparian communities through changes in stream morphology and hydrologic processes, and habitat alterations that result in direct modification of riparian communities through land clearing or disturbance.  Hydrologic modifications  Dams and diversions = Dams are built on rivers primarily to store water for human use, generate hydroelectric power, and/or control flooding. Natural riparian ecosystems upstream of dams can be destroyed when newly created reservoirs inundate riparian habitat. Dams can also cause substantial changes in downstream riparian communities by altering the magnitude, frequency, and timing of flood events and reducing the amount of sediment and nutrients delivered from upstream. Diverting water from stream channels for agricultural, industrial, and human use reduces the volume of water flowing downstream, and can have similar effects. In a natural riparian system, periodic flooding can remove sections of riparian vegetation. This leaves portions of the floodplain available for regeneration and effectively “resets” the successional timeline. Frequent disturbance naturally favors many early- successional (pioneer) riparian species. Many studies show that a reduction in flooding due to dams and diversions can allow community succession to progress beyond a typical stage, causing changes in community structure. Changing flood regimes can be especially problematic when exotic species are favored by altered conditions. For example, dam regulation changes floodplain hydrology in the southwest US by impeding annual flooding cycles. This modification has been implicated in the dominance of saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) over the native cottonwood (Populus deltoids). Cottonwoods were found to be competitively superior to saltcedar when flooding allowed seeds of both species to cogerminate. However, the lack of flooding caused by altered hydrology creates more favorable conditions for the germination of saltcedar over cottonwoods. = Groundwater withdrawals = Riparian zones are characterized by a distinct community of plant species that are physiologically adapted to a greater amount of freshwater than upland species. In addition to having frequent direct contact with surface water through periodic rises in stream water levels and flooding, riparian zones are also characterized by their proximity to groundwater. Particularly in arid regions, shallow groundwater, seeps, and springs provides a more constant source of water to riparian vegetation than occasional flooding. By reducing the availability of water, groundwater withdrawals can impact the health of riparian vegetation. For example, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), and San Joaquin willow (Salix gooddingii), common riparian species in Arizona, were found to have more dead branches and experienced greater mortality with decreasing groundwater levels. Plant community composition can change dramatically over a gradient of groundwater depth: plants that can only survive in wetland conditions can be replaced by plants that are tolerant of drier conditions as groundwater levels are reduced, causing habitat community shifts and in some cases complete loss of riparian species. Studies have also shown that decreases in groundwater levels may favor the invasion and persistence of certain exotic invasive species such as Saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis), which do not appear to show the same degree of physiologic water stress as native species when subjected to lower groundwater levels. = Stream channelization and levee construction = Stream channelization is the process of engineering straighter, wider, and deeper stream channels, usually for improved navigation, wetland drainage, and/or faster transport of flood waters downstream. Levees are often constructed in conjunction with channelization to protect human development and agricultural fields from flooding. Riparian vegetation can be directly removed or damaged during and after the channelization process. In addition, channelization and levee construction modify the natural hydrology of a stream system. As water flows through a natural stream, meanders are created when faster flowing water erodes outer banks and slower flowing water deposits sediment on inner banks. Many riparian plant species depend on these areas of new sediment deposition for germination and establishment of seedlings. Channel straightening and levee construction eliminate these areas of deposition, creating unfavorable conditions for riparian vegetation recruitment. By preventing overbank flooding, levees reduce the amount of water available to riparian vegetation in the floodplain, which alters the types of vegetation that can persist in these conditions. A lack of flooding has been shown to decrease the amount of habitat heterogeneity in riparian ecosystems as wetland depressions in the floodplain no longer fill and hold water. Because habitat heterogeneity is correlated with species diversity, levees can cause reductions in the overall biodiversity of riparian ecosystems.  Habitat alteration  Land clearing = In many places around the world, vegetation within riparian zones have been completely removed as humans have cleared land for raising crops, growing timber, and developing land for commercial or residential purposes. Removing riparian vegetation increases the erodibility of stream banks, and can also speed the rate of channel migration (unless the newly cleared banks are lined with riprap, retaining walls, or concrete). In addition, removal of riparian vegetation fragments the remaining riparian ecosystem, which can prevent or hinder dispersal of species between habitat patches. This can diminish riparian plant diversity, as well as decrease abundances and diversity of migratory birds or other species that depend on large, undisturbed areas of habitat. Fragmentation can also prevent gene flow between isolated riparian patches, reducing genetic diversity. = Livestock grazing = Cattle have a propensity to aggregate around water, which can be detrimental to riparian ecosystems. While native ungulates such as deer are commonly found in riparian zones, livestock may trample or graze down native plants, creating an unnatural amount and type of disturbance that riparian species have not evolved to tolerate. Livestock grazing has been shown to reduce areal cover of native plant species, create disturbance frequencies that favor exotic annual weeds, and alter plant community composition. For example, in an arid South African ecosystem, grazing was found to cause a reduction of grasses, sedges, and tree species and an increase in non- succulent shrubs. = Mining = Mining stream channels for sand and gravel can impact riparian zones by destroying habitat directly, removing groundwater through pumping, altering stream channel morphology, and changing sediment flow regimes. Conversely, mining activities in the floodplain can create favorable areas for the establishment of riparian vegetation (e.g., cottonwoods) along streams where natural recruitment processes have been impacted through other forms of human activity. Mining for metals can impact riparian zones when toxic materials accumulate in sediments. = Invasive exotics = The number and diversity of invasive exotic species in riparian ecosystems is increasing worldwide. Riparian zones may be particularly vulnerable to invasion due to frequent habitat disturbance (both natural and anthropogenic) and the efficiency of rivers and streams in dispersing propagules. Invasive species can greatly impact the ecosystem structure and function of riparian zones. For example, the higher biomass of dense stands of the invasive Acacia mearnsii and Eucalyptus species causes greater water consumption and thus lower water levels in streams in South Africa. Invasive plants can also cause changes in the amount of sediment that is trapped by vegetation, altering channel morphology, and can increase the flammability of the vegetation, increasing fire frequency. Exotic animals can also impact riparian zones. For example, feral burros along the Santa Maria river strip bark and cambium off native cottonwoods, causing tree mortality.  Methods  Methods for restoring riparian zones are often determined by the cause of degradation. Two main approaches are used in riparian-zone restoration: restoring hydrologic processes and geomorphic features, and reestablishing native riparian vegetation.  Restoring hydrologic processes and geomorphic features  When altered flow regimes have impacted riparian zone health, re- establishing natural streamflow may be the best solution to effectively restore riparian ecosystems. The complete removal of dams and flow-altering structures may be required to fully restore historic conditions, but this is not always realistic or feasible. An alternative to dam removal is for periodic flood pulses consistent with historical magnitude and timing to be simulated by releasing large amounts of water at once instead of maintaining more consistent flows throughout the year. This would allow overbank flooding, which is vital for maintaining the health of many riparian ecosystems. However, simply restoring a more natural flow regime also has logistical constraints, as legally appropriated water rights may not include the maintenance of such ecologically important factors. Reductions in groundwater pumping may also help restore riparian ecosystems by reestablishing groundwater levels that favor riparian vegetation; however, this too can be hampered by the fact that groundwater withdrawal regulations do not usually incorporate provisions for riparian protection. The negative effects of channelization on stream and riparian health can be lessened through physical restoration of the stream channel. This can be accomplished by restoring flow to historic channels, or through the creation of new channels. In order for restoration to be successful, particularly for the creation of entirely new channels, restoration plans must take into account the geomorphic potential of the individual stream and tailor restoration methods accordingly. This is typically done through examination of reference streams (physically and ecologically similar streams in stable, natural condition) and by methods of stream classification based on morphological features. Stream channels are typically designed to be narrow enough to overflow into the floodplain on a 1.5 to 2 year timescale. The goal of geomorphic restoration is to eventually restore hydrologic processes important to riparian and instream ecosystems. However, this type of restoration can be logistically difficult: in many cases, the initial straightening or modification of the channel has resulted in humans encroaching into the former floodplain through development, agriculture, etc. In addition, stream channel modification can be extremely costly. One well-known example of a large-scale stream restoration project is the Kissimmee River Restoration Project in central Florida. The Kissimmee River was channelized between 1962 and 1971 for flood control, turning a meandering 167 km of river into a 90 km drainage canal. This effectively eliminated seasonal inundation of the floodplain, causing a conversion from wetland to upland communities. A restoration plan began in 1999 with the goals of reestablishing ecological integrity of the river-floodplain system. The project involves dechannelizing major sections of the river, directing water into reconstructed channels, removing water control structures, and changing flow regimes to restore seasonal flooding to the floodplain. Since the completion of the first phase of restoration, a number of improvements in vegetation and wildlife communities have been documented as the conversion from uplands back to wetlands has begun to take place. Breaching levees to reconnect streams to their floodplains can be an effective form of restoration as well. On the Cosumnes River in central California, for example, the return of seasonal flooding to the floodplain as a result of levee breaching was found to result in the reestablishment of primarily native riparian plant communities. Dechannelisation of shorter reach (2 km long) and lowered levee are also been proved to be an effective restoration approach together with natural (or near natural) flooding regime in order to improve soil processes spatial and temporal heterogeneity typical of natural floodplains Stream channels will often recover from channelization without human intervention, provided that humans do not continue to maintain or modify the channel. Gradually, channel beds and stream banks will begin to accumulate sediment, meanders will form, and woody vegetation will take hold, stabilizing the banks. However, this process may take decades: a study found stream channel regeneration took approximately 65 years in channelized streams in West Tennessee. More active methods of restoration may speed the process along.  Restoration of riparian vegetation  The revegetation of degraded riparian zones is a common practice in riparian restoration. Revegetation can be accomplished through active or passive means, or a combination of the two. = Active vegetation restoration = A lack of naturally available propagules can be a major limiting factor in restoration success. Therefore, actively planting native vegetation is often crucial for the successful establishment of riparian species. Common methods for actively restoring vegetation include broadcast sowing seed and directly planting seeds, plugs, or seedlings. Reestablishing clonal species such as willows can often be accomplished by simply putting cuttings directly into the ground. To increase survival rates, young plants may need to be protected from herbivory with fencing or tree shelters. Preliminary research suggests that direct-seeding woody species may be more cost-effective than planting container stock. Reference sites are often used to determine appropriate species to plant and may be used as sources for seeds or cuttings. Reference communities serve as models for what restoration sites should ideally look like after restoration is complete. Concerns about using reference sites have been raised however, as conditions at the restored and reference sites may not be similar enough to support the same species. Also, restored riparian zones may be able to support a variety of possible species combinations, therefore the Society for Ecological Restoration recommends using multiple reference sites to formulate restoration goals. A practical question in active vegetation restoration is whether certain plants facilitate the recruitment and persistence of other plants (as predicted by theories of succession), or whether initial community composition determines long-term community composition (priority effects). If the former applies, it may be more effective to plant facilitative species first, and wait to plant dependent species as conditions become appropriate (e.g., when enough shade is provided by overstory species). If the latter applies, it is probably best to plant all desired species at the outset. As a critical component of restoring native riparian communities, restoration practitioners often have to remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing. This can be accomplished through herbicide application, mechanical removal, etc. When restoration is to be done on long stretches of rivers and streams, it is often useful to begin the project upstream and work downstream so that propagules from exotic species upstream will not hamper restoration attempts. Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants. = Passive vegetation restoration = Active planting of riparian vegetation may be the fastest way to reestablish riparian ecosystems, but methods may be prohibitively resource-intensive. Riparian vegetation may come back on its own if human-induced disturbances are stopped and/or hydrologic processes are restored. For example, many studies show that preventing cattle grazing in riparian zones through exclusion fencing can allow riparian vegetation to rapidly increase in robustness and cover, and also shift to a more natural community composition. By simply restoring hydrologic processes such as periodic flooding that favor riparian vegetation, native communities may regenerate on their own (e.g., the Cosumnes River floodplain). The successful recruitment of native species will depend on whether local or upstream seed sources can successfully disperse propagules to the restoration site, or whether a native seed bank is present. One potential hindrance to passive vegetation restoration is that exotic species may preferentially colonize the riparian zone. Active weeding may improve the chances that the desired native plant community will reestablish.  Restoring animal life  Restoration often focuses on reestablishing plant communities, probably because plants form the foundation for other organisms within the community. Restoration of faunal communities often follows the “Field of Dreams” hypothesis: “if you build it, they will come”. Many animal species have been found to naturally recolonize areas where habitat has been restored. For example, abundances of several bird species showed marked increases after riparian vegetation had been reestablished in a riparian corridor in Iowa. Some riparian restoration efforts may be aimed at conserving particular animal species of concern, such as the Valley elderberry longhorn beetle in central California, which is dependent on a riparian tree species (blue elderberry, Sambucus mexicana) as its sole host plant. When restoration efforts target key species, consideration for individual species’ needs (e.g., minimum width or extent of riparian vegetation) are important for ensuring restoration success.  Ecosystem perspectives  Restoration failures may occur when appropriate ecosystem conditions are not reestablished, such as soil characteristics (e.g., salinity, pH, beneficial soil biota, etc.), surface water and groundwater levels, and flow regimes. Therefore, successful restoration may be dependent on taking a number of both biotic and abiotic factors into account. For example, restoration of soil biota, including symbiotic myccorhizae, invertebrates, and microorganisms may improve nutrient cycling dynamics. Restoration of physical processes may be a prerequisite to the reestablishment of healthy riparian communities. Ultimately, a combination of approaches taking into account causes for degradation and targeting both hydrology and the reestablishment of vegetation and other life forms may be most effective in riparian zone restoration.

The primary focuses are plants and animals that are native to California, specifically Kern County. The California Living Museum is accredited by the Zoological Association of America (ZAA). History CALM was founded in 1983. Its purpose was to provide a place to both educate the public about native wildlife, as well as to help injured and orphaned wild animals. Those that could be released into the wild would be, while others would be cared for in the facility. A campaign went out to many service organizations to sponsor buildings within the facility. After three years, the zoo was opened to the public. In 1998, the day-to-day operations of The California Living Museum were transferred to the Kern Superintendent of Schools offices (KCSOS). The zoo and botanical gardens became an official school site. CALM provides education to more than 13,000 Kern County school children annually through on-site programs. Many programs are also presented off-site to classrooms, organizations and at community events. CALM received accreditation from the Zoological Association of America (ZAA) in 2010.CALM Receives National Accreditation. Critter Capers. Spring 2010. Page 1. Description CALM is and contains a wide variety of plants and animals from around Kern County. The California Living Museum exists to display and interpret native California animals, plants, fossils and artifacts to teach a respect for all living things through education, recreation, conservation and research. Located on 14 park-like acres, CALM's zoo features over 80 species of medically unreleasable animals. Only animals injured or who cannot survive in their native environment are housed at CALM. Several endangered species may be seen on exhibit. Natural exhibits include: • An open black bear exhibit, • Cats of California exhibit featuring mountain lions and bobcats, • Bird of Prey Exhibit with hawks, owls and eagles, • A mammal round that houses several species of foxes, • A waterfowl pond that attracts spring and fall migrants and hosts resident mallards, • A deer yard, • An underground reptile house, and • A contact area with domestic animals. The DiGiorgio Education Center, which is the visitor's first stop, houses the gift store, a reading library, Miocene and Pleistocene fossils, and children's discovery rooms with rotating interactive activities. CALM also provides services which include birthday parties, weddings and other group events. The California Living Museum is a permitted rehabilitation facility and has a staff trained to care for injured wildlife. The primary goal of rehabilitation is to release the wildlife back into their natural habitat. CALM rehabilitates approximately 300-500 injured and orphaned animals annually. In addition to animals, CALM also contains several plant communities. These replicate a variety of environments from around Kern County, from the mountains, to the Mojave Desert. Such walks include the “Trees of California,” which showcases the trees found of the western and eastern mountain ranges. The riparian is a miniature replica of the Kern River, as it descends from the mountains to the valley floor. There is also a desert community, used to replicate the eastern desert.FAQ . CALM.

During the Christmas season, from November 28 to December 30, CALM hosts a month-long event called “HolidayLights at CALM.” The zoo is decorated with millions of lights to form scenes of animals and Kern County landscapes. Certain areas flash in sequence to music playing at each scene, while others feature lite displays of native animals. The displays are designed by Josh Barnett’s Lightasmic.

He is best known for invention of the cryotron, a superconductive computer component that is operated in liquid helium at a temperature near absolute zero. Other inventions were ferroelectric memory, content addressable memory, non- destructive sensing of magnetic fields, and writing printed circuits with a beam of electrons. Early Life Dudley A. Buck was born in San Francisco, California on April 25, 1927. Dudley and his siblings moved to Santa Barbara, California, in 1940. In 1943, Dudley Buck earned his amateur radio license W6WCK and a First Class Radiotelephone Operator license for commercial work. He worked part-time at Santa Barbara radio station KTMS until he left to attend college at the University of Washington under the U.S. Navy V-12 program. After graduating from the University of Washington in 1947, Buck served in the U.S. Navy for two years at Nebraska Avenue in Washington, D.C. where he began doing work and scientific advising for the agency that would later become the National Security Agency. He entered the reserves in 1950 and then began his career at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Career Buck began as a research assistant while a graduate student at MIT in 1950. His first assignment was on the I/O systems of the Whirlwind computer. He was assigned to work with another graduate student, William N. Papian, who in the Fall of 1949 Jay Forrester had \\"selected.. to work testing individual cores by the dozen .. and to pick out cores exhibiting exceptionally good properties.\\".Project Whirlwind, p. 184 Subsequently they worked with various manufacturers developing the ferrite materials to be used in coincident- current magnetic core memory. In late 1951, Dudley Buck proposed computer circuits that used neither vacuum tubes, nor the recently invented transistor. It is possible to make all computer logic circuits, including shift registers, counters, and accumulators using only magnetic cores, wire and diodes. Magnetic logic was used in the KW-26 cryptographic communications system, and in the BOGART computer. FeRAM was first built by Buck as part of his thesis work in 1952. In addition to its use as computer memory, ferroelectric materials can be used to build shift registers, logic, and amplifiers. Buck showed that a ferroelectric switch could be useful to perform memory addressing. Buck completed his S.M degree in 1952. His thesis for the degree was Ferroelectrics for Digital Information Storage and Switching. The thesis was supervised by Arthur R. von Hippel. In this work he demonstrated the principles of storing data in ferroelectric materials; the earliest demonstration of Ferroelectric memory, or FeRAM. This work also demonstrated that ferroelectric materials could be used as voltage controlled switches to address memory, whereas close friend and fellow student Ken Olsen's saturable switch used ferrites and was a current operated switch. The basic idea for the cryotron was entered into his MIT notebook on December 15, 1953. By 1955, Buck was building practical cryotron devices with niobium and tantalum. The cryotron was a great breakthrough in the size of electronic computer elements. In the next decade, cryotron research at other laboratories resulted in the invention of the Crowe Cell at IBM, the Josephson Junction, and the SQUID. Those inventions have today made possible the mapping of brain activity by magnetoencephalography. Despite the need for liquid helium, cryotrons were expected to make computers so small, that in 1956, Life Magazine displayed a full-page photograph of Dudley Buck with a cryotron in one hand and a vacuum tube in the other. Dr. Buck earned a Doctor of Science from M.I.T. in 1958, and would go on to become a professor. By 1957, Buck began to place more emphasis on miniaturization of cryotron systems. The speed that cryotron devices could attain is greater as size of the device is reduced. Dr. Buck, his students, and researcher Kenneth R. Shoulders made great progress manufacturing thin-film cryotron integrated circuits in the laboratory at MIT. Developments included the creation of oxide layers as insulation and for mechanical strength by electron beam reduction of chemicals. This work, co- authored with Kenneth Shoulders, was published as \\"An Approach to Microminiature Printed Systems\\". It was presented in December, 1958, at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Philadelphia. Per a request by chairman Dr. Louis Ridenour, Solomon Kullback appointed Buck to the National Security Agency Scientific Advisory Board Panel on Electronics and Data Processing that same month. Another key invention by Dr. Buck was a method of non-destructive sensing of magnetic materials. In the process of reading data from a typical magnetic core memory, the contents of the memory are erased, making it necessary to take additional time to re-write the data back into the magnetic storage. By design of 'quadrature sensing' of magnetic fields, the state of magnetism of the core may be read without alteration, thus eliminating the extra time required to re-write memory data. Dudley Buck invented recognition unit memory.Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology vol 2 p. 283 Also called content addressable memory, it is a technique of storing and retrieving data in which there is no need to know the location of that data. Not only is there no need to query an index for the location of data, the inquiry for data is broadcast to all memory elements simultaneously; thus data retrieval time is independent of the size of the database. Awards In 1957, the Institute of Radio Engineers awarded Dudley Buck the Browder J. Thompson award for engineers under the age of 30. Death and Legacy Buck died suddenly May 21, 1959, just weeks after his 32nd birthday.Milestones, Jun. 1, 1959. TIME (1959-06-01). Retrieved on 2013-11-20. His close associate Louis Ridenour died the same day. Their deaths have been the subject of some speculation, with some claiming that Buck and Ridenour's deaths were related.https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/inventions/airbrushed- from-history-the-mysterious-death-of-the-little-known-forrest-gump-of-cold- war-computing/news-story/4da4ee5ec7351dac8680a205781ece35 However, Buck's son, Douglas Buck, freely admitted that he had no evidence to support such claims, so speculation on Buck's death remains based on circumstantial evidence.https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and- life/entertainment/books/little-known-cold-war-scientists-death-a- mystery-497358941.html His biography was published in October 2018, The Cryotron Files by Iain Dey and his son Douglas Buck.

During his tenure, the Savannah Bank was closed down in February 2002, a controversial move that he claimed was due to non-compliance with regulations rather than financial distress. In July 2002, as Minister of Finance, he announced that Nigeria's GDP had grown by 4% annually by the World Bank's estimate, the highest rate for ten years. He describes himself as god-father of Ogun politics, leading the conservative group of the Ogun State PDP. He claimed to have installed Gbenga Daniel as governor, but by 2010 had become an opponent of Daniel. Minister for Commerce and Industry His ministerial nomination in March 2010 by Acting President Goodluck Jonathan was controversial, since he had apparently not been on the list of ministerial nominees in Ogun State submitted by Governor Gbenga Daniel. Some leaders of the PDP state chapter wrote a petition protesting the nomination to the national PDP chairman, Prince Vincent Ogbulafor. On assuming office on 6 April 2010 as Minister of Commerce and Industry he called for a 100% improvement in the quality of implementation of the nation's budget.

Name  The name \\"Vigilantia\\" is Latin for \\"alertness, wakefulness\\". Itself deriving from \\"vigilia\\" (watch, watchfulness) and \\"vigil\\" ((1)adjective: awake, watching, alert (2)noun: watchman, sentinel).Douglas Harper, Online Etymological Dictionary. Entries \\"vigil\\", \\"vigilance\\", \\"vigilant\\", \\"vigilante\\".  Family  Justinian (b. 482) and Vigilantia were children of a sister of Justin I (r. 518–527), founder of the Justinian dynasty. The family originated in Bederiana, near Naissus (modern Niš in Serbia) in Dacia Mediterranea.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1980), pp. 648–649 Procopius, Theodorus Lector, Zacharias Rhetor, Victor of Tunnuna, Theophanes the Confessor and Georgios Kedrenos consider Justin and his family Illyrians, though Kedrenos is uncertain. Evagrius Scholasticus, John Malalas, the Chronicon Paschale, the Suda, Joannes Zonaras and the Patria of Constantinople consider them Thraco-Romans. While Procopius reports them to be of peasant origins, Zonaras is the only source describing Justin I as a former herder.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1980), p. 648 Justinian was reportedly born in Tauresium, near Scupi, where their parents had apparently settled. Their father was named Sabbatius, while the name of their mother is not actually recorded.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1980), pp. 645–646 The name \\"Bigleniza\\" was assigned to the mother of Justinian and Vigilantia by Niccolò Alamanni (1583–1626), citing as his source a \\"Life of Justinian\\" (Latin: Vita Iustiniani) by \\"Theophilus Abbas\\", a supposed contemporary of Procopius. Despite repeated searches, this source has never been located by another scholar. Alamanni was trusted as a reliable source by several later authors, including Edward Gibbon, who in his The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire quotes the name Bigleniza and other details deriving from Alamanni. Since the name seemed to be Slavic in origin, later theories would develop on the Slavic origins of Justinian and his family. In 1883, James Bryce discovered a \\"Vita Justiniani\\" manuscript in the Palazzo Barberini. It only dated to the 17th century and contained all the facts mentioned by Alamanni, including Bigleniza considering her daughter-in-law Theodora, \\"not a gift of God but a gift of the devil.\\" Bryce suggested this manuscript as Alamanni's source. Its authenticity however was doubtful, and Konstantin Josef Jireček considered this manuscript to be the work of Ivan Tomko Marnavich (1579–1639), archdeacon of Agram (Zagreb). Any other sources he used, if any, are unclear.James Bryce, \\"Life of Justinian by Theophilus\\" (1887) Marnavich was a translator of medieval texts, particularly hagiographies.Fine (2006), p. 421 Bigleniza is merely a translation of Vigilantia to Slavic, following the long-standing theory that mother and daughter had the same name. Whilst Vigilantia's relation to Justinian is mentioned by numerous historians, only Victor of Tunnuna names her husband and father of Justin II, Dulcidius (his name is also rendered as Dulcissimus).Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 754Martindale, Jones & Morris (1980), p. 1165  Succession of Justinian  Vigilantia is one of the figures featured in In laudem Justini minoris (\\"In praise of the younger Justin\\"), a poem by Flavius Cresconius Corippus written on the occasion of the accession of Justin II. It is more a eulogy than an actual chronicle. Both Vigilantia and her daughter-in-law Sophia, are called \\"divae\\", Latin for \\"divine ones, goddesses\\", and sources of the poet's inspiration, standing in for the Muses in that respect. Sophia, a niece of Theodora. is likely to have been his patroness and may have commissioned the poem. The Byzantinist Lynda Garland suggests that both Sophia and Vigilantia were Corippus' actual sources on various events, including \\"behind the scenes\\" activities.Garland (1999), p. 41  Marriage and children  Vigilantia and Dulcidius/Dulcissimus were parents of three known children: *Justin II, Byzantine emperor.
