It was founded in 1998 by Air Force veteran Michael Hackley and his wife, Ladina Hackley, as the Grill Store & More, and later rebranded as BBQGuys as the store transitioned to online retail during the dot-com bubble. In 2019, BBQGuys was awarded the Small Business of the Week by the United States Senate Committee. History leftIn 1998, husband and wife Michael and Ladina Hackley founded the Grill Store & More in Baton Rouge, on Tiger Bend Road. The couple were inspired to start their own barbecue grill retailer after passing by a Barbecues Galore store in Des Moines, Iowa, and started their business without financial or investor capital. When Grill Store & More suffered financial difficulties during the dot-com bubble, Michael Hackley transitioned his business to e-commerce under the bbqguys.com website. Online success resulted in the closure of the company's three brick and mortar stores within a year. Selling from their homes in 2003, Shopperschoice.com was launched in 2004. Between 2003 and 2016, Shopperschoice.com grew from five to 140 employees. Mike Hackley and Corey Tisdale founded Blaze Outdoor Products to manufacture grills, smokers, and drawers. The company was named Small Business of the Week by the United States Senate Committee in 2019, by which time it wasb on the Inc. 5000 list for 11 consecutive years. The same year, Shopperschoice.com consolidated its brand under BBQGuys.com, the original name of the company. BBQGuys expanded its headquarters in September 2019 to accommodate 50 new customer support positions in the company. According to Louisiana Economic Development, the expansion also created 22 jobs indirectly. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, BBQGuys was able to continue hiring, while transitioning about 90 percent of their team to remote work. Warehouse workers unable to work from home were protected by new safety guidelines, facility procedures, and sanitation infrastructure.

Talley (right) receiving the Distinguished Service Medal from Major-General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. (left) Benjamin Branche Talley (July 29, 1903November 27, 1998) was an American engineer. He was involved in military construction in Alaska before and after World War II, and earned the nickname \\"the Father of Military Construction in Alaska\\". He was involved in planning the Normandy landings and Battle of Okinawa during World War II. After the war, Talley led various engineering districts, including the North Atlantic Division, before retiring as a brigadier general in 1956. After retirement, he was involved in civil engineering and oversaw the reconstruction of central Alaska after the Good Friday earthquake.  Early and personal life  Talley was born in Greer County, Oklahoma on July 29, 1903. He graduated from high school in Enid, Oklahoma, and attended Oklahoma A&M; College. Talley graduated from Georgia Tech in 1925 with an electrical engineering degree, and from the Graduate Engineering School of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1926. Talley joined the United States Army in June 1926. He was married twice and survived by a son.  Army service  As a lieutenant, Talley was stationed with the 2nd Engineer Battalion in Texas and Colorado before attending the Engineer School in Virginia. He was then involved in the Nicaragua Canal Survey and assisted in the aftermath of the 1931 Nicaragua earthquake. Talley was assigned to put out the ensuing fire after the earthquake hit Managua. When Talley returned to the United States, he worked to make maps based on aerial photographs for nine years, publishing the textbook Photogrammetry. He also invented a 'portable stereocomparagraph' and lectured at Harvard University. In 1940 Talley traveled to Yakutat, Alaska and supervised the construction of Elmendorf Air Force Base. In 1941 he became engineer for Army construction in Alaska, supervising the construction of a secret base on Umnak. As a result of the base's construction, Dutch Harbor was protected from a Japanese attack. Talley continued to work on bases in Alaska. His obituary wrote that he \\"supervised virtually all Army and Army Air Corps projects in Alaska as the military prepared for the Japanese invasion of Alaska.\\" On January 11, 1943 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for \\"exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service as officer in charge of Alaska construction\\". In June 1943 Talley traveled to Europe, where he helped plan the Normandy landings and served as the V Corps' deputy chief of staff. He was present at the landing on Omaha Beach, reporting on the landing's progress. He was given command of the beach, overseeing supplies as they flowed into the region. As commander of the area, he oversaw up to 63,000 soldiers responsibility that the Anchorage Daily News considered was typically held by a three star general. For this he earned the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Service Cross. In December 1944 he assumed command of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade. Talley was awarded the Croix de guerre with palm in 1945. Under Talley's command, the brigade headquarters returned to England, and embarked for the United States on 23 December. It arrived at Fort Dix, New Jersey, on 30 December. After four weeks leave, it reassembled at Fort Lewis, Washington. Part of the brigade headquarters went by air to Leyte to join the XXIV Corps for the invasion of Okinawawhich Talley helped plan, while the rest traveled directly to Okinawa on the USS Achernar. The brigade was in charge of unloading on Okinawa from 9 April to 31 May. It then prepared for the invasion of Japan. This did not occur due to the end of the war, and the brigade landed in Korea on 12 September 1945. Talley was deputy commander of the Army Special Forces in Korea after victory over Japan. Talley was subsequently district engineer for Huntington, West Virginia and later Louisville, Kentucky. He then attended the National War College and was \\"chief of the estimates branch of the intelligence division on the Army General Staff\\", briefing the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the Soviet Union's military capacity during the Korean War and other relevant intelligence. In March 1952 it was reported that Talley had been promoted to division engineer of the North Atlantic Division by Lieutenant General Lewis A. Pick. As division engineer, he oversaw construction projects totaling around $900 million. On April 7, 1955 he was promoted to brigadier general. Talley became division engineer of the Mediterranean Division, Nouasseur Air Base in 1955. He retired as a brigadier general on April 30, 1956.  Retirement and death  After retirement, Talley lived in New York City and Oklahoma. He worked for Raymond International and supervised the construction of 11 buildings in Bras√≠lia as the Brazilian capital was under construction. He was resident manager of the Metcalf and Eddy group, and oversaw the group as it rebuilt Anchorage, Alaska after the 1964 Alaska earthquake and worked in Da Nang during the Vietnam War.\\"Alaskan Gen.

In the game, the player is encouraged to \\"jump a skipping rope\\", by performing motions using the Joy-Con controllers, every day a specified number of times. The game was developed by a small group to keep active at home during shelter-in-place orders of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released for free on the Switch's Nintendo eShop in June 2020. It was originally intended to be removed from the eShop three months later, but Nintendo later announced that the game would stay available until further notice. Gameplay In Jump Rope Challenge, the player uses Joy-Con controllers in a basic skipping rope motion in conjunction with jumping up and down to emulate jumping a skipping rope. The in-game screen displays an anthropomorphic rabbit character skipping alongside the player, as well as counting the number of jumps the player does. Initially, the game sets the player the task of reaching at least 100 jumps every day, although this goal can be manually increased. The players' total jumps for each day are recorded in a timeline, allowing the player to see how much they have progressed. Jump Rope Challenge can also be played in multiplayer with 2 players, with the players holding one Joy-Con each. Development and release During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nintendo developers were to work from home due to stay-at- home orders. Because of the orders, some developers could not get the exercise they would typically get outside of the home. Jump Rope Challenge was developed by a small team of developers working at home to be able to keep active in their houses during the pandemic. Jump Rope Challenge was released over digital distribution on the Nintendo eShop on June 16, 2020, after a surprise announcement from Nintendo on Twitter. The game was released as a free download, and was intended to only be available for a limited time, as Nintendo planned to remove it from the eShop on September 30, 2020. Nintendo stated that over 200 million jumps had been performed in the game three days after release. A free update to the game, released on July 1, 2020, adds the ability to double-under as well as new backgrounds and costumes for the bunny to wear based on Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, and Wario from Super Mario, Link from The Legend of Zelda, Samus Aran from Metroid, Isabelle from Animal Crossing, the Inklings from Splatoon, and the Arcade Bunny from Nintendo Badge Arcade. On September 30, 2020, Nintendo announced that 2.5 billion jumps were recorded in the game and, as new players joined the game, that the game would not be removed from the Nintendo eShop on September 30, 2020, and would remain available until further notice.  Reception The game was reviewed positively by Ollie Reynolds of Nintendo Life, saying that using the Joy-Cons as a skipping rope felt authentic, while also praising the game's visuals and the game being free, though criticizing the game not keeping the player's attention and the sound effects that played on the game's cat background.

Cimbala notes that Lewis was more accepted by the people of Atlanta at this point, as he had \\"different priorities\\": namely, \\"business and boosterism, not blacks\\". This increased popularity led to his filling several civic roles, including assistant secretary of the 1881 International Cotton Exposition and secretary of the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition ; as well, he was named Postmaster of Atlanta in 1889 or 1890, a position he held for four years. Cimbala further observes that, following Lewis's death in Chicago, the Atlanta Constitution published an obituary that detailed Lewis's military record and activities with veterans' organizations, but omitted all mention of the Freedmen's Bureau, stating only that Lewis \\"came to Georgia to reside\\".

It includes 94 apartment units, retail space, and a restaurant. It previously operated as Kings Inn, a hotel and casino. The hotel opened in September 1974, and the casino opened the next year. The casino closed in 1982, following financial issues, and the hotel closed on July 12, 1986, because of fire code violations. Although there were plans to reopen the building, it ultimately sat vacant for the next three decades. In the 2000s, two separate plans were proposed to redevelop the building into residential units, with retail space on the ground floor. Neither plan materialized, due to financial problems. Reno mayor Bob Cashell considered the dilapidated building a major blight on the city and wanted it demolished. The building was eventually sold in 2014, and redeveloped as 3rd Street Flats. It opened to residential tenants on December 26, 2016. History=Early years The Kings Inn was owned initially by three Reno businessmen: retired colonel Matthew Chotas, Joseph Fischer, and Bob Scoggin. The designer and building consultant was Ed Kenney and Associates. Excavation was underway in September 1973, after approximately a year of planning. The hotel was topped off on March 29, 1974. Four months later, California businessman Gust Mazoros filed a lawsuit against the owners, stating that he was owed $275,000 for helping to finance the project. The Kings Inn was expected to open in August 1974, but construction was delayed for a month due to local trade union strikes. In September 1974, Allan Bergendahl, a California developer, became the majority owner of the Kings Inn. Chotas, Scoggin and Fischer retained a small interest. Bergendahl was the president of GMFC Inc., located in Downey, California. He had been interested in owning a hotel-casino in Reno since 1968. Part of the hotel opened in early September 1974, and the remainder was finished at the end of the month. The restaurant was expected to be opened several weeks later, while the casino would take several months to finish. The seven-story Kings Inn hotel was part of the Best Western chain. It had 168 rooms, two floors of underground parking, and a third-floor pool for guests. It also had a 24-hour restaurant known as King Joe's, the Circle Bar, the King's Lounge, and live singing entertainment. Bergendahl applied for a gaming license to operate 150 slot machines and 12 table games. He received state approval in August 1975, and opened the casino that month. The casino lost $100 on its first night of operation. Marshall P. Davis, a former minority owner of the Kings Inn, sued Bergendahl and the original trio of owners in 1976, for more than $40,000. Davis alleged that the trio, who were his business partners, had sold the Kings Inn without his approval and without compensating his interest in the property. In 1977, representatives from the NAACP joined a picketing at the Kings Inn, which had recently been accused of harassing black customers. In 1980, two lenders sued the Kings Inn for failure to make lease payments on equipment and furniture. Financial problems pushed the property into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 1981. Sherwood & Roberts, a mortgage company, was owed $4 million after previously providing a construction loan for the project. The company proceeded with a foreclosure auction, and Bergendahl became the sole owner in May 1982, after bidding $3.95 million. The casino portion was closed that year, and the 152-room hotel was forced by the city to close on July 12, 1986, because of fire code violations. The closure was unexpected, and several guests had to be relocated. The hotel had previously received an extension two years earlier to deal with the issues, but a request for a second extension was denied. The hotel was expected to reopen once the violations were corrected. It was believed that a new sprinkler system could cost up to $70,000. Bergendahl died later in 1986, and his family inherited the Kings Inn. Failed plans An international marketing campaign was launched in 1989 to find a buyer for the Kings Inn, which was appraised at $6.2 million. The marketing efforts generated interest from several prospective buyers. An auction had been set for the Kings Inn, but it was put on hold after a potential buyer expressed interest in the property. Ownership ultimately remained with Bergendahl's family; in 1992, they had plans to reopen the Kings Inn. Such plans did not materialize, and the building came to be considered an eyesore. GMFC did not respond to violations regarding the condition of the building, and in 1997, the Reno City Council voted to place a nearly $12,000 lien on the property. The cost would pay to have the building painted and repaired, in order to repel vagrants. In 2000, GMFC sold the Kings Inn to Nationwide Capital Services, based in Oakland, California. The company paid $3.2 million for the Kings Inn and paid an additional $500,000 in delinquent property taxes. The company began studying possible uses for the building, with the intention of reusing rather than demolishing it. The company decided to include residential space on the upper floors and a restaurant and retail space on the ground floor. No casino space was planned. The company hoped to begin and finish construction in 2001. These plans also did not materialize, as Nationwide faced financial problems. Early into Bob Cashell's first term as Reno mayor, he focused on the Kings Inn and its building code violations. At the end of 2002, Cashell included the Kings Inn on his list of blighted properties that needed to be cleaned up. The city intended to acquire the building for an upcoming train trench project. The property's underground parking would be used to replace other parking that would become inaccessible during trench construction. By early 2003, Nationwide had entered bankruptcy, complicating the city's plan to condemn the building for its trench project. The city wanted to proceed with acquiring the Kings Inn through eminent domain, but was unable to do so while it was in ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, thus preventing the city from taking action to condemn it. In 2004, Cashell named the Kings Inn as the top blight in the city and said that immediate action was required, calling the building a danger to the public: \\"It's life threatening. You've got windows broken out. You've got people living in there.\\" GMFC regained ownership of the Kings Inn later in 2004, and the company had various ideas for redeveloping it. In June 2005, GMFC transferred ownership to a joint partnership with North River Development, a company based in the San Francisco Bay Area. The companies had plans to convert the building into condominiums. The building would be gutted and rebuilt, and five additional floors would be added. The final project would feature 99 condominium units, and retail space on the ground floor. In January 2006, the Reno Planning Commission approved new plans for a total of 130 condominiums. The plan would include the addition of eight stories to the existing seven-story building. Asbestos would need to be removed from the original building before its interior could be stripped down. In addition to the retail space, the developers also considered adding a grocery store to the first floor. The redeveloped building would be known as DeNovo. The project's architectural firm was Cathexes, a Reno-based company. James Molder, senior project manager of Cathexes, said the additional floors would not be an issue thanks to the building's concrete columns: \\"Structurally, this building is in great shape even though it looks terrible from the street level. Our tests have determined it has excellent load-bearing capacity. We will need to expand the size of some of the footings, but the builders of this back in the 1970s did a really solid job.\\" Unit pricing would range between approximately $200,000 and $1 million. Much of the interior would be rebuilt, and the building would implement green features such as recycled carpet, solar panels, and energy efficient lighting. Kings Inn, July 2012 Interior demolition and asbestos removal was underway in February 2006. New construction for DeNovo was scheduled to begin in March 2007, with the first residential units scheduled for completion in mid-2008. Full completion was expected in 2009. North River Development received a $3.5 million loan for the project from Integrated Financial Associates, based in Las Vegas. North River Development defaulted on the loan in 2007, before construction began. In 2009, the Reno City Council expressed interest in paying off the delinquent property taxes and purchasing the Kings Inn. In 2011, the Kings Inn was sold through a trustee sale to Integrated Financial Associates for $500,000. More than $360,000 was owed in delinquent and current property taxes. George Flint, a lobbyist for the Nevada Brothel Association, suggested in 2012 that the local government legalize prostitution and use the Kings Inn as a red-light district. The idea never materialized. As Cashell neared the end of his final mayoral term in 2014, he said, \\"I guess I'm real sorry the King's Inn is still standing. I've wanted to drive a bulldozer through the front of that thing since I took office.\\" Redevelopment Amador Bengochea announced in July 2014 that he was in the process of purchasing the Kings Inn, with plans to add a residential component to the facility. Bengochea was a Las Vegas developer and the owner of Bentar Development. Bengochea said, \\"I was just driving by here and it looked like a real interesting building. A lot of people won't even touch this place, but I think I can do a real good job with it.\\" Bengochea said the concrete building had \\"good bones\\" and that he did not want it to go to waste. He said that it \\"looked like a solid building. It would be a challenge (to clean up) but it did seem to be worth preserving. The city of Reno wanted to level it.\\" The Reno City Council gave tentative approval to Bengochea's request for public financing, to redevelop the building as affordable housing. It was later announced that First Independent Bank financed the project. Bengochea's purchase was finalized in November 2014, at a cost of $1.35 million. Bengochea partnered with a Reno company, Basin Street Properties, to redevelop the Kings Inn as 3rd Street Flats, an upscale 94-unit apartment building. The target demographic would consist of professionals in their late 20s and early 30s. The project would also include restaurant, retail and grocery space on the ground floor. The building interior was stripped down throughout 2015, with new construction beginning at the end of the year. Among the extensive clean-up work was the removal of asbestos from the building. The interior of the Kings Inn had also been infested with pigeons. The conversion of the building into apartments was part of an effort to revitalize the downtown area. The cost of the conversion was expected to be $10 million, with completion initially scheduled for mid-2016. 3rd Street Flats opened to residential tenants on December 26, 2016. The building was redeveloped with technologically advanced features, such as USB plugs in each unit. Reno mayor Hillary Schieve praised the redevelopment of the building. The property includes of retail space, a pet-grooming facility, and a fenced- in courtyard with a dog park. A neon sign from the former casino, depicting a king's crown, was installed in the new facility's tenant lounge to honor the building's past history. In 2017, the project won a Summit Award for \\"Mixed- Use Development of the Year\\". 3rd Street Flats includes three retail spaces on the ground floor. Bab Caf√©, a South Korean restaurant chain, opened its first U.S. location in one of the spaces on May 1, 2017. Bentar Development and Basin Street Properties sold the building in July 2017. LandCap Investment Partners, a mixed-used and housing investment firm, purchased it for $18.5 million. At the time, the apartment units were 90 percent occupied. Three months after the sale, a convenience store known as The Urban Market opened to the public in one of the ground-floor spaces.

The party was led by politician Frank Marshall Jim√©nez, denoted anti-communist and anti-Calderonista, who became a member of the Legislative Assembly. History Marshall was the son of an American mining businessman who died at the hands of Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua. His stepfather, Ricardo Steinvorth, of German origin, sent him to live in Germany where he was educated in the 1930s during the times of the Third Reich and even belonged to the Hitler Youth, but returned to Costa Rica after the Second World War sparked. The Calder√≥n Guardia government declared war on Germany and brought all Costa Rican citizens and residents of German, Italian and Japanese origin into a concentration camp located in front of the Mercado Central on Avenida San Mart√≠n, San Jos√©, and their properties were confiscated. His stepfather was deported to the United States, although he would later be released. Marshall would since then be a bitter opponent of the government of Calder√≥n Guardia and his communist allies, for which he fought alongside rebel caudillo Jos√© Figueres and other opposition figures against the \\"Caldero-communists\\" during the war of 48. The rebel faction won and Calder√≥n alongside other defeated political leaders including the Secretary General of the Costa Rican Communist Party Manuel Mora Valverde escaped to exile. Later in 1955 a Nicaraguan-endorsed invasion attempt by Calderonista forces was also repelled and Marshall help the then constitutional government of Figueres with its Revolutionary Civic Union forces. Later on January 17, 1957 the group would turn into a political party recognized by the Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica, and would gain seats on two elections; the 1958 Costa Rican general election and the 1966 Costa Rican general election. In the 1962 Costa Rican general election the party did not ran to avoid dividing the anti-Calderonista vote as Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Guardia (who had returned earlier to the country after receiving a general amnesty thanks to President Mario Echandi) was running for president.

Biography She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 30 January 1870 to Benjamin Bakewell (an executive with Bakewell, Pears & Co.) and Ellen Frances Boardman (daughter of Rev. Henry Augustus Boardman). She was often known to her family as \\"Effie\\" or \\"Miss Ef\\". She studied at the Pittsburgh School of Design, and then under William Merritt Chase on Long Island. While in New York, she met Mary Helen Wingate Lloyd, who remained a lifelong friend. Bakewell spent time in Europe, where she studied painting in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian. In 1902, she studied under T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at his Doves Bindery, and continued her study of bookbinding back in Paris. Upon her return to the United States the following year, she lived with her sister Mary in the Sewickley neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where she established her own bindery. In Pittsburgh, she taught Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt (and, briefly, a group of Hunt's friends). Due to a detached retina, she was forced to bring her bookbinding activities to a close. Throughout her life, she maintained close ties to both the American and European bookbinding communities. During the First World War, Bakewell travelled to Europe to assist with relief efforts. With funding from her friend Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt and her husband Roy A. Hunt, Bakewell worked to help orphans and child refugees.

The museum is housed in a recently restored 16th to 17th- century house which includes an upper-floor apartment known as a douiria (or dwiriya). It was recently converted to a Museum of Music, with permanent and temporary exhibits.  History  Stucco decoration in the main salon The house is located in the Mouassine district, which was the subject of significant development in the Saadian period (16th and early 17th century). In the 1560s Sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib ordered the relocation of the Jewish community, which until then had occupied this district, to a new Mellah district next to the Kasbah of the city. This liberated new land which was subsequently redeveloped into new \\"model\\" neighbourhoods centered around the newly constructed Mouassine Mosque and religious complex (as well as the Bab Doukkala Mosque complex further west). This enticed a relatively large number of bourgeois or aristocratic families to build their residences here, resulting in a concentration of structures dating from the Saadian period in this area. Examples of such Saadian-era houses include the Dar Cherifa (formerly Dar Ijimi), the Dar al-Mas'udiyyin, and the Dar al-Masluhiyyin (known also as Ksour Agafay). (Some of these houses today have been converted into caf√©s, restaurants, and hotels.) The building which the Mouassine Museum occupies today is located right next to the southeastern corner of the Mouassine Mosque, along Derb el Hammam street (named after the bathhouse of the mosque). It consists of a residential home which includes a douiria (or dwiriya), a small house or upper floor apartment which was used to receive guests, often integrated to a larger riad or mansion. It was built by an aristocratic Sharifian family in the 1560s, at the time when this neighbourhood was being created by the Saadians. Some of the painted sun motifs in the house, however, appear to date from the reign of the later Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma'il in the late 17th or early 18th century. In recent times, the house was inhabited by the local Mellakh family (which included the painter Abdelhay Mellakh) since at least 1954 before being bought in 2012 by Patrick Manac‚Äôh and Hamid Megani, co-founders of another museum in the city, the Maison de la Photographie (\\"House of Photography\\"). Although some of the old wooden doors and ceilings were visible, Manac'h suspected that the original walls of the house might be hidden beneath the recent layers of plaster, and recruited the help of Xavier Salmon, a curator at the Louvre Museum, to investigate. They conducted tests and discovered that under the thick layers of modern white plaster was the original pinkish gypsum-based stucco of the historic douiria. With the help of Salmon and other experts, a team of craftsmen were recruited to carefully remove the modern plaster and painstakingly restore the original decoration. Even some of the original colours had been preserved; an uncommon case for Saadian-era buildings. The historic house was opened as a museum and cultural venue in 2014 and in 2019 it also became a museum of Moroccan music, in addition to hosting regular musical performances. Painted wood ceilings in one of the side rooms  Architecture  The douiria or apartment is located on the upper floor of the house and is reached via a short staircase. This leads to a square salon covered by a wooden ceiling with a central skylight. On two sides of the salon, facing each other, are large alcoves which served as seating areas and are sheltered by their own wooden canopies or ceilings. The two other sides of the salon have large doorways leading to side rooms which might have been used as bedrooms or secondary salons. The main central room is particularly rich in decoration, with carved stucco featuring geometric patterns and Kufic letter motifs as well as sculpted and painted wooden ceilings. The side rooms also have painted ceilings, featuring motifs from the time of Sultan Moulay Ismail (late 17th to early 18th century).  References  Further reading  * Salmon, Xavier (2015).

Sambrooks, former CEO of Midstates, received $5.3 million in compensation in 2019, $1.1 million in 2018, $2.7 million in 2017. The 2019 compensation included $3.5 million in severance benefits. Likewise, Scott C. Weatherholt, EVP and general counsel, received $3 million compensation in 2019 (including $1.9 million in severance benefits), $1.6 million in 2018, and $416,000 in 2017. Before the merger, the company bought back $1.3 million in stock in early 2019, having approved up to $25 million of buyback in 2018. After the mid-2019 merger, another $25 million buyback was approved, and the company purchased $24.9 in stock in late 2019. Amplify's 2019 gross income was $275.6 million, versus $340 million in 2018. Two dividends were issued in 2019 totaling $15.9 million. The company had a revolving credit line with Bank of Montreal for $450 million; the company had an average of $265 million borrowed. The line of credit was reduced to $285 million in June 2020, and would be reduced monthly until it was at $260 million. In June the company had $264 million used in the line of credit. Fir Tree Capital Management, a hedge fund founded by Jeff Tannenbaum, owns approximately 27.7% of Amplify's outstanding stock. Brigade Capital Management owns approximately 10.7%.

Logo for Jeff Anderson and Associates  Firm History  Jeff Anderson founded Jeff Anderson & Associates in November 1981. At the time, Jeff Anderson & Associates focused on cases related to civil rights and poverty law. In 1984, Jeff Anderson & Associates filed its first case on behalf of a survivor who had been the victim of childhood sex abuse by a priest. Jeff Anderson & Associates filed the lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, the first case of childhood sexual abuse against a Catholic diocese in America. Following the case, Jeff Anderson & Associates focused on pursuing claims on behalf of survivors of childhood sex abuse.  Offices  Jeff Anderson & Associates has its headquarters and home office in St. Paul and also has offices in California, New Jersey, and New York. In 2011, the firm opened its first international office in London.  Notable Cases  Since the 1980s, Jeff Anderson & Associates have filed thousands of cases on behalf of survivors of childhood sexual abuse. High- profile cases include: * Gregory Riedle, et al. v. The Diocese of Winona, The Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, St. Thomas Aquinas in St. Paul Park, and Thomas Adamson. Filed in 1984, the case was the first lawsuit of childhood sexual abuse against a Catholic diocese. Gregory Riedle was abused for approximately two years by Fr. Thomas Adamson while serving as an altar boy at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church of St. Paul Park. The case became public in 1987 and was eventually settled out of court. * Thomas Mrozka v. The Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, et al. The case also involved childhood sexual abuse perpetrated by Fr. Thomas Adamson. A jury awarded the survivor, Thomas Mrozka, $855,000 in compensation and $2.7 million in punitive damages. A trial court later reduced the punitive damages. * Darryl Bassile v. Covenant House, et al. Darryl Bassile says he was sexually assaulted numerous times between 1973 and 1974 by Covenant House founder Fr. Bruce Ritter. The case was dismissed in 1993 because of the statute of limitations. * Tietge v. Western Province of the Serv√≠tes, Inc. In 1997, a California appeals court partially reversed a trial court ruling that dismissed Michael Tietge's sexual abuse claim by Br. Gregory Atherton because of the statute of limitations. Due to a change in law that extended the statute of limitations, Tietge had the opportunity to pursue a case against Atherton, but not the religious order. * John Doe 1-22 v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Fall River, Diocese of Crookston, Servants of the Paraclete, and James Porter. Filed in 1992, the case brought by 22 survivors who had been abused by Catholic priest Fr. James Porter. The plaintiffs were among hundreds of survivors who came forward. The case was settled in 2001 after nine years of litigation. * John Doe, a.k.a. James and John Howard v. Catholic Bishop of Stockton. In 1998, a jury awarded $24 million in punitive damages and $6 million in compensatory damages to John and James Howard, who were abused by Fr. Oliver O'Grady. A letter written by O'Grady in which he admitted to abusing children proved that the Los Angeles Cardinal Archbishop Roger Mahony and other Archdiocesan officials were aware of O‚ÄôGrady‚Äòs crimes. At the time, it was the largest verdict against the Catholic Church in California. * John Doe 1 v. Archdiocese of Milwaukee. The case, which eventually reached the Wisconsin Supreme Court, centered on claims of negligence and fraud related to knowledge of a priests' prior sexual molestation of children. The Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed the negligence claims because of the statute of limitations, but upheld the fraud claim for intentional misrepresentation. * John V. Doe v. Holy See. The case sought to hold the Vatican liable for actions and damages committed by Catholic priests and leaders in the United States. A U.S. District Court judge ruled that the Holy See cannot be found liable. * Doe 1 v. Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and Diocese of Winona. The case was filed under the Minnesota Child Victims Act for abuse perpetrated by Fr. Thomas Adamson. The case was settled October 2014. * Bill Weis v. Diocese of Duluth. In November 2015, a Ramsey County jury awarded Bill Weis a $4.9 million verdict. Documents showed the Diocese of Duluth knew about childhood sexual abuse claims against Fr. J. Vincent Fitzgerald and allowed him to continue working with children. The Diocese of Duluth filed for bankruptcy after the verdict. * Laura Stearns v. The Children‚Äôs Theatre Company and Jason McLean. Laura Stearns filed a claim against the Children‚Äôs Theatre Company for sexual abuse she endured as a child by former teacher Jason McLean. McLean was accused of childhood sex abuse by Stearns and several other former theatre students. The jury found the Children‚Äôs Theatre Company negligent but not liable and decided it should be McLean who pays for the damage caused to Stearns.  Boy Scouts' \\"Perversion Files\\"  In 2012, Jeff Anderson & Associates uncovered a trove of the Boy Scouts' \\"perversion files.\\" A lawsuit that year had prompted the Boy Scouts to release the confidential files of over 1,200 known or suspected child abusers. The Perversion Files dated back to 1944 and also contained the names of 12,254 survivors of childhood sex abuse and identified nearly 8,000 perpetrators believed to have sexually abused children. Jeff Anderson & Associates learned about the additional files while Janet Warren, a professor at the University of Virginia's medical school, was testifying for an unrelated case. Warren had worked for five years with the Scouts to review the ‚Äúperversion files‚Äù and evaluate how the Boy Scouts had handled the issue of child sexual abuse within the organization from 1944 to 2016. Jeff Anderson & Associates attempted to make the files public, but were forced to return the copies they obtained of the files after a court sided with the Boy Scouts of America in 2019.  Notable Attorneys  Jeff Anderson is the founder of Jeff Anderson & Associates. Since 1983, he has filed thousands of cases against the Catholic church on behalf of survivors of childhood sex abuse. He was described as ‚ÄúOne of the foremost attorneys in this area‚Ä¶‚Äù by Matt Carroll of the Boston Globe‚Äôs Spotlight reporting team. Mike Finnegan is an attorney at Jeff Anderson & Associates who has spent over 15 years working with survivors of childhood sex abuse. Mike led a federal lawsuit that forced the Vatican to produce documents in a child sex abuse case for the first time.

Together with his brother Israel, they own 29% of the company. He was previously CEO of Cinema City International, originally founded by his grandfather. His family has had interests in the cinema business since the 1930s. Early life and family Moshe Joseph Greidinger, known as \\"Mooky\\", was born in December 1952. He studied economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. His mother was Dahlia Katzenelbogen-Katz (1926-1979), a scientist who helped develop the country's chemical industry. His father was Coleman Kenneth \\"Kenny\\" Greidinger. His paternal grandfather Moshe Greidinger, after whom he was named, and grandmother Rebecca Chissick Greidinger, had emigrated from Romania and had business interests in food, shipping, and real estate. The senior Moshe Greidinger invested in his first cinema, in Hadar, Haifa, in 1930. He opened the Armon cinema in Haifa in 1935. After his death in 1946, his son Kenny expanded the cinema business. Young Mooky worked at the ticket desk, in the projection room, and as an usher in his father's cinemas throughout his school years. He joined his father's business in 1976, and encouraged the company‚Äînow called Cinema City International‚Äîto expand overseas with a location in Hungary in 1997. Career In May 2014, Mooky Greidinger joined the board of directors of Cineworld as CEO, having previously been CEO of Cinema City International. Cinema City International was Europe's third largest cinema operator until its takeover by Cineworld in 2014. Following the takeover, Cinema City owned 24.9% of the combined Cineworld group. In 2017, Cineworld announced its agreement to acquire Regal Entertainment Group for $3.6 billion, giving it more than 9,500 screens in 10 countries. In 2020, Cineworld was due to buy Canada's Cineplex Entertainment for US$2.1 billion, making it the world's largest cinema chain (ahead of AMC Theatres) with over 11,000 screens. However, on 12 June 2020, Cineworld abandoned the takeover before the end of June deadline, citing \\"certain breaches\\" of contract, and a legal battle is likely. In July Cineworld sued Cineplex for $1.1 billion in damages; Cineplex planned to counter-sue for around $12 million. As of January 2020, Mooky Greidinger and his brother Israel Greidinger, who is deputy CEO of the company, own 29% of Cineworld. According to a Globes article of January 2020, \\"Those who know the Greidingers say they are not so much consumed with making money as becoming the world's number one cinema chain\\".

Spanning a wide variety of media, such as photography, drawings, and sculptures, Moul√®ne's practice examines the relationship between systems and orders. Moul√®ne has stated that he subscribes to the notion of a 'disjunction,' whereby he follows a principle of discrepancies as a way to \\"find new dialectical knowledge.\\" His interests include the \\"symbolic position of the author\\" and authorship; processes of production, repetition, and accumulation; labor and social space; and the intersection of advanced technology and contemporary material culture, among others. Moul√®ne identifies himself as a \\"technicien libertaire\\" (life itself as a technique), who transforms \\"the process of perception as an aesthetic end in itself to one that incorporates everyday life\\" in his work.  Early Life and Career  Moul√®ne began studying art in 1972 at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Versaille, where he became friends with the artist Michel Journiac. Journiac introduced Moul√®ne to artists in the Art Corporel movement, such as Gina Pane and Hermann Nitsch. He received his both his BA (1978) and MA (1979) at the Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne. In 1983, Moul√®ne began Disjonctions/ (1983‚Äì99), an early series of sixty photographs that document uneventful street scenes. Yasmil Raymond has noted that the Disjonctions \\"confers a lack of identity and congruity,\\" resisting the commonality expected of a series. In 1990, Moul√®ne participated in the exhibition De Afstand at the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam, alongside Andreas Gursky, Craigie Horsfield, Christopher Williams. This exhibition spurred Moul√®ne's practice to diverge \\"in terms of his method of production\\" and shaped his subsequent series.  Work  Moul√®ne's work has been described as a self-reflective process of interrogation that generates variations; distresses order; and produces \\"certainty through negation.\\" Moul√®ne organizes his works into categories and subcategories, establishing an ontological distinction for himself and indicating his processes of production and the rhetoric of the images. Several philosophers, such as Reza Negarestani and Alain Badiou, have written on Moul√®ne, particularly in relation to abstraction. Negarestani had written that \\"if abstraction in contemporary art is a part of that self- reflexive history that contributes to the isolation of art from other fields of thought and,\\" \\"then Moul√®ne's work should be understood as a genuine struggle against this self-inflected sequestration.\\" Disagreeing with Negarestani, Badiou had written that there is a \\"difference between abstraction as practiced in the sciences and abstraction as it enters into the creation of a work of art,\\" and Moul√®ne's works return \\"to the self-evidence of an object.\\"  Major Works and Series  Documents/ (1989-) = Documents/ is a body of work began in 1989 with a distinct first-person narrative. It contains Moul√®ne's repeated visits to a particular site, the systematic compilation of a particular collection of objects, and the acquisition of products manufactured. Corinne Diserens has described the series as a \\"subversion of the habits and the reading codes\\" that images induce. By the late 1990s, Moul√®ne simultaneously began work on different series and organized the images into subgroups within the broader category of Documents/. Included in this are: * Objets de gr√®ve (39 Strike Objects) (1999-2000): this is a series of photographs documenting products made by French industrial workers on strike, and sold in the black market to help fund their cause. For instance, \\"Bleu Gauloises bleues\\" (2000) shows a Gauloises cigarette with an inscription: \\"Cigarettes manufactured by the workers in dispute.\\" Furthermore, Moul√®ne's photographs contain a disclaimer, in which he notes that they are not by Moul√®ne but simply \\"made visible by him.\\" This emphasizes the power struggles in the making of artwork and the post- production, as well as notes the artist's interest in \\"the social conditions in which the artist and the labourer operate in the contemporary world.\\" * Produits de Palestine (2004-2005): this is a series of photographs documenting products made in the occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and West Bank and branded as Palestinian. Due to the sanctions, the objects cannot circulate around the world \\"in the way they now circulate as photographs.\\" Flash Art has remarked that Moul√®ne's work \\"carry a strange form of tautology at the core of their very existence...While 'not producing' the objects, workers have nonetheless produced them, and so the markers of stoppage must be conveyed by other means.\\" = Opus (1995-) = In the mid 1990s, Moul√®ne initiated a parallel project consisting of three-dimensional objects and termed them \\"Opus.\\" In this series, Moul√®ne explores materials‚Äîboth manufactured and found, and industrial and organic. These works, including bronze, cement, tobacco, and wood, are each identified with a title as well as the city, month, and year in which they were fabricated. On Moul√®ne's dual practice in photography and three-dimensional object, Nathalie Delbard has written that Moul√®ne modifies \\"the aesthetic regime each of them belongs to in order to expose its implicit structures.\\" The subsets within \\"Opus\\" are influenced by topology, and mathematical structures and theories, with an emphasis on protocol and transformation. Particularly important is knot theory, which Moul√®ne considers as \\"tools to describe complexity.\\" = Bi-Face (2016) = In 2016, as a part of the retrospective Jean-Luc Moul√®ne at the Centre Pompidou, Moul√®ne created thirty-two new works, one of which was Bi-Face (2016), a large sculpture in coated and painted hard foam. With no visible joints or cracks, and no signs of making, Bi-Face was presented on the floor. In The Burlington Magazine, Luke Naessens describes the presentation as a \\"minimalist literalness,\\" which was \\"very much in the visitor's physical space.\\" He further notes that the work explores the blurring of \\"material and the imagistic, the sexual and the mechanical, the bodily and the abstract.\\" More or Less Bone (Formal Topological Optimization) (2018-2019) In 2019, Moul√®ne had his first institutional exhibition in North America since 2011 at the SculptureCenter. In the exhibition, Moul√®ne premiered More or Less Bone (Formal Topological Optimization), a monumental new work in fiberglass and epoxy paint. For the work, Moul√®ne collaborated with engineers from Aerospace Valley in France with expertise in formal optimization‚Äîwhen the form of an object is defined a process that identifies the \\"most efficient, least wasteful\\" solution within a set of variables. Moul√®ne proposed to produce an optimized form connecting a sphere, a spiral staircase, and a knucklebone; he and the engineers then \\"manipulated the form of this 'object of juncture' to account for a set volume, scale, terrestrial gravity, the material properties of fiberglass, and environment conditions.\\" Mark Bechtel notes that More Or Less Bone is \\"derived from a mutable relationship that is equivalent in all its variations by topological terms,\\" telegraphing \\"limitless possibilities while seemingly remaining under absolute control.\\"  Exhibitions  Moul√®ne's works have been exhibited in the Venice Biennial (2019, 2003); the Taipei Biennial (2016 and 2004); the Sharjah Biennial (2010); the First International Biennial of the Image (Laos, 2007); the Sao Paulo Biennial (2002); and Documenta X (1997).

It will house the Wayne State Warriors (NCAA) Men's and Women's basketball teams along with a Detroit Pistons NBA G League team. It will be owned by Wayne State University. History On May 1,2019, Wayne State University entered into a partnership with the Detroit Pistons to construct a new arena. The $25 million dollar arena will be constructed near the corner of Trumbull and Warren Avenues. The Pistons desire to bring their NBA G League affiliate closer to home was a factor in their decision, since their current affiliate, the Grand Rapids Drive, play 150 miles west of Detroit. Discussions have occurred about bring the Drive to Detroit but the team ownership has indicated that it would prefer to remain in the Grand Rapids area. Controversy The partnership between Wayne State and the Pistons was negotiated in secret at the request of the Pistons, contrary to the Open Meeting Laws that govern all publicly elected officials in the state of Michigan (members of the Wayne State Board of Governors are publicly elected in state-wide partisan elections). Plans for the Wayne State Arena were announced less than 12 hours before the University Board met to sign the contract. At the meeting, the Arena was the first agenda item followed immediately by a university press conference announcing the partnership. There was no time provided for public comment despite the arena's location in a dense residential neighborhood. https://bog.wayne.edu/meetings/330/01_May_2019_OP_DRAFT.pdf The land the arena is being built on is zoned R-3 by the city of the Detroit, however, as a public university, Wayne State is not required to conform to city zoning or building ordinances. Additionally, a popular public access baseball diamond was destroyed during the construction of the arena despite appearing on pertinent press releases and the current Wayne State master plan.

It was the first television station established in Pueblo. The station shut down due to financial difficulties, competition from a second station in Pueblo and two outlets in Colorado Springs, and network affiliation changes in Denver that affected its main programming source. History KDZA-TV began telecasting March 16, 1953. It was owned by Dee B. Collins alongside independent AM outlet KDZA (1230 AM). Much of its programming, including network fare, was fed to it by a microwave relay between Pueblo and KFEL-TV (channel 2) at Denver. Gene O'Fallon, who owned KFEL-TV, filed to buy KDZA radio and television from Collins for $350,000, including the assumption of $100,000 in payments to DuMont Laboratories for the channel 3 transmitter, at the end of July. Four months later, O'Fallon dropped the deal, though KDZA-TV continued taking programs from KFEL-TV, including live basketball games. The move came as KFEL- TV lost both of its major network affiliations in the final quarter of 1953 to new Denver outlets KLZ-TV (CBS) and KOA-TV (NBC) and after a second Pueblo television station, KCSJ-TV (channel 5), began broadcasting as an NBC affiliate. Ultimately, continued operation and program feeds from Denver proved uneconomical to continue. On May 7, 1954, channel 3 went silent to repair its equipment, but by then it was an open secret that the station was in financial woes. It never returned, opting not to ask the Federal Communications Commission for continued authority to remain silent. KDZA-TV was the third VHF station to close completely for economic reasons, after KFXD-TV in Nampa, Idaho, and KFOR-TV in Lincoln, Nebraska, which had shut down in August 1953 and March 1954, respectively. The channel 3 allocation was moved to Alamosa in 1955 at the petition of KCSJ-TV, which intended to build a satellite station there. No full-power station ever appeared on the channel, but a translator of KRDO-TV was authorized to use it in December 1965. The full-power allocation was shifted from Alamosa to Glenwood Springs in January 1980 upon the petition of Western Slope Communications, which built and signed on KCWS there in 1984.

The sisters were both appointed Dames Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours.  Background and personal life  Jools Topp and her twin sister Lynda were born on 14 May in 1958 in Huntly, to Jean and Peter, and grew up on a dairy farm in Waikato. Topp also has an older brother called Bruce. Topp attended Ruawaro Combined School during the 1960s and early 1970s. The twins have been singing together since they were five years old and their brother gave them a guitar when they were 11. After leaving school in 1976, Jools and Lynda Topp joined the New Zealand Territorial Force and were posted at the Burnham Military Camp near Christchurch for six weeks. When they were 17, they performed at the Victorian Coffee Lounge (Montreal Street, Christchurch Central City). This brought them into contact with radical lesbian feminists. They both started identifying as lesbian from the late 1970s. Much of their life has been in the public eye and their mother was interviewed by Radio New Zealand about the closure of the New Zealand Woman's Weekly magazine in 2020 talking about how much her daughters had been featured in these magazines. On the birth of a new generation with Lynda being a grandparent and Jools being a grand aunt they admitted they didn't expect it when they were younger because as they said: \\"We're all gay\\", referring also to their brother.  Horses  Jools Topp is a skilled horsewoman and for many years had a property in Helensville, north of Auckland, with her partner. They had dogs, chickens, cattle, cats and about ten horses with an equestrian area. Called Liberty Circle Ranch, Topp's property helped families to rehabilitate and train horses through the business NZ Horse Help run by Teresa Trull and Michaela Evans. It was said Topp \\"answers her phone while riding her horses bareback in her arena\\". The property was sold when the couple split up after 17 years together.  Breast cancer  Jools Topp was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2006 at the age of 48. Originally examined by a physician in January 2006, nothing was done as it was not detected by a mammogram. Topp was diagnosed seven months later when the breast cancer showed up with an ultrasound exam. She recovered well after receiving a mastectomy in October 2006 and several months of chemotherapy.  Career  The Topp Twins in 1981 Jools Topp along with her sister Lynda has had a long career in entertainment in New Zealand. They sing country and folk music with harmonies often to raise people's social consciousness. As entertainers, Lynda Topp leads the comedy and \\"works the audience\\", and mostly Jools plays the guitar and leads the song making. Lynda particularly focused on yodelling. The Topp Twins' popularity arose from a regular stint busking in Auckland when they were in their early 20s. They got taken to court for causing obstruction on Queen Street because their crowd was too big. They won the case and benefited from the publicity. Soon after that they travelled and performed to university crowds around New Zealand. They are well known for their costumed comedic characters such as Ken & Ken, and Camp Leader and Camp Mother. They have been a lot on television in character including in 2000 hosting a quiz show called Mr and Mrs, in which couples answered questions about how well they knew each other, and a 2014 to 2016 a cooking show called Topp Country.

Signed and dated by the artist (HANNIBAL CARRACTIVS BON. F. MDLXXXVIII), it is also known as Madonna and Child with Saints Francis, Matthew and John the Baptist, Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saint Matthew and the St Matthew Madonna. It was originally produced as an altarpiece for the merchants' chapel in the basilica of San Prospero in Reggio Emilia, one of several works the artist produced whilst in the city in the 1580s and 1590s. It then entered the Este collections in Modena, from which it was sold in 1746 as part of the Dresden sale to Augustus III, taking it to its present homeDonald Posner, Annibale Carracci: A Study in the reform of Italian Painting around 1590, Londra, 1971, Vol. II., N. 45, pp. 20-21.. Paolo Veronese, Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, 1571, Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice The work shows a stronger Venetian influence than any of the artist's earlier works and its precise dating allows art historians to date his study trip to Venice to 1587-1588 Alessandro Brogi, Un \\"furioso amore per la vera grande pittura italiana\\", in Daniele Benati and Eugenio Riccomini (ed.s), Annibale Carracci, Catalogo della mostra Bologna e Roma 2006-2007, Milano, 2006, p. 181.. One clear influence on its composition is Paolo Veronese's Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine, from which it borrows its diagonals, the position of the Madonna and saints and the red drape hanging from columns Donald Posner, Annibale Carracci: A Study in the reform of Italian Painting around 1590, op. cit., Vol. I, pp. 44-45.. Carracci did not entirely reject his previous style, however, and so these lessons from Veronese are translated into a less otherwordly idiom, closer to the viewer's lived experience - Carracci opts for a glimpse of a landscape background rather than the celestial blue of so many of Veronese's works and the saints humbly clothed and standing on bare earth rather than the richly-dressed figures on stairs in Veronese's work.

It is the first Microphones' release in 17years, following 2003's Mount Eerie, and comprises a single 44-minute song. The release follows musician Phil Elverum's 2019 return to the Microphones as a musical project in live performance. Recording and release After performing a show under the Microphones name in 2019, Elverum felt a desire to return to the project. Speaking to NPR about the recording, Elverum explained that the releasing the name under his old moniker was part of a self-imposed writing assignment as a musician. Elverum wanted the album to, instead of answering questions, express \\"how it is. The true state of all things is a waterfall\\".  Short film  On August 6, an album length short film was released to correspond with the release of the album. Distinct from traditional music videos, Elverum described it as a \\"lyric video\\", as well as \\"a slideshow, a powerpoint presentation, a flip book and a documentary\\". It consists of over 800 printed photos taken by Elverum, synched to the lyrics and at times featuring the people and places discussed in the lyrics. It took Elverum three weeks to produce.  Music and lyrics  Microphones in 2020 is comprised of one, 44-minute song. It begins with a seven minute intro composed of two double-tracked and out of phase chords played on an acoustic guitar. Elverum explained that his reasoning for the length as \\"wanting to push up against the edges, similar to extreme drone music, the way that it wears down at your sense of time and reality and makes you forget yourself,\\" as well as symbolically representing the time between Mount Eerie and Microphones in 2020. Reception The staff of Album of the Year characterizes the reception as an 85 out of 100 and AnyDecentMusic? sums up crticial consensus as an 8.4 out of 10. Chris DeVille of Stereogum praised the album writing that \\"Microphones in 2020 affirms the value of sifting through the past from time to time, so long as you spring forward. It works so well not because it tears down those old foundations, but because it builds so beautifully upon them.\\" The site listed it as the album of the week. A brief review in Mojo gave it four out of five stars, calling it \\"intimate\\" and \\"absorbing\\". Matt Bobkin of Exclaim! gave the album nine out of 10, contextualizing this release in Elverum's career arc as well as the sociopolitical climate in which it was released, summing it up as \\"Elverum's indelible stamp of style, distilled into a single track that flows like waves in the ocean or hills on the mountainside\\". Clare Martin of Paste praised the introspective lyrics and delicate instrumentation, concluding, \\"an engrossing one-track album is no easy feat, but he draws us in with expertly rich, layered lyricism and immersive production\\". Quinn Moreland of Pitchfork Media gave the release 8.5 out of 10, with the site declaring it \\"Best New Music\\", with her review highlighting the power of the lyrics and their ability to evoke mystery and memory. Konstantinos Pappis of Our Culture Mag gave the album four out of five stars, with the unique experience of the long song and its ability to evoke memories. In The Daily Californian, Crew Bittner also scored it a four out of five, praising how complex the work is, including elements that are quotidian, writing that Elverum, \\"seems to appreciate is that it is not a sin to be boring or unremarkable, and he celebrates mundanity and absurdity at every opportunity\\". Writing in The Philadelphia Inquirer, Steve Kling gave the release three out of four stars, comparing it to a good memoir as \\"it‚Äôs intensely personal while glimpsing universal truths (and avoiding solipsism)\\".

Being a smart commander, he successfully combined advanced military arts with a strategy of manipulation and turning the enemies of the Teutonic Order against each other. As The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin reads, > Brother Ludwig was from a branch of a noble family, had learned the arts of > war from an early age and performed many miraculous, valiant deeds in > battle, which this book will describe later.The Chronicle of Prussia by > Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 17,361‚Äì479; III, 209‚Äì10 In 1280, Ludwig was taken prisoner by Skomantas of Sudovia during the campaign launched by Landmeister of Prussia Mangold von Sternberg against the Yotvingians in the region of Crasima in Yotvingia. While in captivity, Ludwig showed his diplomatic talent. He managed to befriend Skomantas and soon Skomantas released him. This is attested both in The Chronicle of the Prussian Land by Peter of DusburgChronicon terrae Prussiae by Peter of Dusburg, III, 209-210 and The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin: > Brother Ludwig von Liebenzell was taken prisoner during this campaign.The > Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 17,361‚Äì479; III, > 209‚Äì10 ‚Ä¶ When the enemy captured him he was entrusted to Skumantas.

Although the raid had been successful, Ludwig was captured again, that time by a Yotvingian noblemen called Cantegerda.The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 17,512‚Äì73; III, 212 The Teutonic Knights had long regarded Ludwig as missing. Meanwhile, being in his second captivity, Ludwig displayed his diplomacy skills again: he befriended Cantegerda and convinced him to convert together with all his subjects. Ludwig returned safely thereafter, bringing Cantegerda and 1,600 his people to the Order‚Äôs possessions for christening.Chronicon terrae Prussiae by Peter of Dusburg, III, 217 Nikolaus von Jeroschin states in The Chronicle of Prussia, > Master Konrad [von Tierberg the Younger] ... met Brother Ludwig von > Liebenzell coming towards him from Sudovia, surrounded by a crowd of men and > women.

On one occasion he sailed with his men to > Auk≈°taitija, which is subject to the king of Lithuania. There was a large > village there called Romene.

There was one area known as Pograuden [in Samogitia] which > he and his men secretly moved against, hiding the bulk of the army in an > ambush and sending out a small troop to rampage across the region, killing > and destroying and then moving on.

He often incorporates glitter and rhinestones into his paintings, which consist of large-scale portraits of himself, friends and acquaintances, and figures from his imagination.

He was the Minister of Interior of the Helvetic Republic from 1798 to 1803. Later he became Secretary of the Vaud Department of the Interior, followed by a position as State Chancellor of the Swiss canton.  Biography  Georges Boisot is the son of Jean Fran√ßois Louis Boisot, who was a Bishop at Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines and Louise Peter. He was married to Madelaine Perregaux.  Early life  Boisot was taught to read by his father and entered school in 1783. In 1795 he began studying theology at the Lausanne Academy, and later occupied the office of Professor of Mathematics and taught Differential calculus. Revolutionary principles Boisot was interested in the revolutionary principles that circulated in the Canton of Vaud. In 1798 he participated in events where the Vaudois drove out the Bernese governor, establishing the Lemanic Republic. Professional background He was secretary-editor of the Administrative Chamber of the new Canton of L√©man (1798-1803). In February 1800, after leaving Lausanne for Bern, he became head of office at the Ministry of Interior of the Helvetic Republic (1798-1803). This is when the French invaded Switzerland and turned it into an ally known as the Helvetic republic. On 10 March 1803, under the Act of Mediation, the Helvetic government was dissolved and on 14 April 1803, the Canon of Vaud was born. On his return to Lausanne, Boisot became secretary of the Vaud Department of the Interior. He became Chief Secretary of the Petit Conseil and in 1815, Chancellor of the State. Switzerland became a confederation once again. From June to December 1829, Boisot participated in the revision of the Vaud Constitution, whose limited scope would attract discontent among the population and bring about a revolution in December 1930 and a new Constitution in June 1831. The revolution of 1830, also known as the July Revolution, led to the overthrow of King Charles X. Boisot joined the Council of State on 7 May 1830 and was re-elected to the new government in August 1831. Boisot shared the management of four departments: Military, Finance, Interior, and Justice of the police with his eight colleagues. In 1833, he presided over the Vaudois government. Due to his Liberal conservatism beliefs, he was forced out of office during the Revolutions of 1848.  Retirement  He spent the last years of his life in a modest financial situation. He wrote a memoir in 1842, that was partially published. His memoir is in the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne, Lausanne, Cote J 5160 (6 vol.). Death He died on 19 December 1853, at the age of seventy-nine, in Lausanne, at 22 Rue Saint-Pierre, Vaud, Switzerland.

During the 19th century the conservation conditions there worsened and it was moved to the Accademia di Belle Arti for restoration, before being moved to its current home in the then-new Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna Alessandro Brogi, in Annibale Carracci, Catalogo della mostra Bologna e Roma 2006-2007, Milano, 2006, pp. 260-261... It is signed and dated \\"ANNI CARR FE MDXCIII\\".  Autograph status  Antonio Carracci, Madonna and Child Enthroned with the Infant Saint John the Baptist, Saint Mary Magdalene and Saint Martha, 1616, Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin The work was praised in the 17th century by Giovanni Pietro Bellori and Carlo Cesare Malvasia, the artist's main biographers of that century, but it came to be less-appreciated over the course of the 20th century, with the first modern scholar of Annibale Hans Tieze even spreading the opinion that much of the work was by Annibale's follower Lucio Massari. That idea was refuted by Rudolf Wittkower, but partly supported by Donald Posner, one of the major scholars on Annibale, who felt that surviving preparatory drawings were autograph, but the colouring was partly or wholly down to Massari. Posner supported this conclusion by reference to a canvas now in Berlin which is clearly connected to the Bologna work and which he attributed to Massari, seeing it as another proof of the student's debt to the master in the Bologna work Donald Posner, Annibale Carracci: A Study in the reform of Italian Painting around 1590, Londra, 1971, Vol. II, N. 72, pp. 31.. Posner's conclusion has been overthrown by preparatory drawings for the Bologna work definitely in Annibale's hand which - with the historic sources stating the work was by Carracci himself - seem to confirm its autograph status. Modern scholarship also holds the Berlin work to be by Annibale's nephew Antonio Carracci rather than Massari, thus representing Antonio drawing on his uncle's work at San Giorgio rather than Massari drawing on his master's.

Early life Pedro Pablo Caza√±as y Garc√≠a was born December 5, 1902 in Matanzas, Cuba to Francisco E. Caza√±as and Enriqueta Garc√≠a Mart√≠n. His family was of considerable wealth and he was raised on their Buena Vista estate near Varadero. Caza√±as would remain in Cuba for much of his life before emigrating to the United States in the late 1960s as a result of the Cuban Revolution. Career Caza√±as‚Äô father Francisco was a retired lawyer and Pedro Pablo would pursue the same career path. He attended the University of Havana, earning a doctorate in law, after which Caza√±as was often referred to as \\"Doctor Pedro (Pablo) Caza√±as\\" in official documents, journals, and media. Caza√±as served as a traveling judge, holding court in various locations across Cuba that required a judge on a case-by-case basis before becoming an increasingly prominent politician in the Cuban judiciary as a municipal and then regional judge. In the 1930s Caza√±as married Raquel Mar√≠a D√≠az Teresa, thereafter Raquel D√≠az Caza√±as. The marriage was significant due to the D√≠az family's importance in the San Jose de los Ramos area of Matanzas. Her father, Jos√© Lorenzo D√≠az, was an administrator in the Cuban judicial system, working in the Juzgado de Primera Instancia (Court of First Instance) of the broader Col√≥n area until his death in 1954. The D√≠az family was also regarded for replacing the small chapel in the town center with a grand church. Raquel D√≠az and Caza√±as had three children - Raquel, Marta, and Eduardo - all born in Havana and raised in the Caza√±as family's properties in Matanzas. After the coup d'√©tat of 1952, Caza√±as' stature in Cuba's judiciary rose further through the rest of the 1950s, partly due to his close ties with Fulgencio Batista. The Caza√±as family, particularly his older brother Enrique, had significant business interests in Havana that benefited from Batista's vigorously pro- business policies. Batista himself had planned to attend and serve as a witness in the wedding of Caza√±as‚Äô eldest child, Raquel, to high-profile psychiatrist and Agrupaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Universitaria leader Rene de la Huerta, a friend of the Caza√±as family. However Batista was unable to attend due to his required presence in state visit abroad, therefore a top representative was sent to the ceremony in his place. Caza√±as‚Äô support of Batista would be a recurring source of generational tension with his children. By the end of the decade and Batista's rule, Caza√±as would serve as a highly ranked Juez de Instrucci√≥n (Judge of Instruction).https://books.google.com/books?id=yH09Iq0io0UC&q;=caza%C3%B1as&dq;=caza%C3%B1as&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiVmefEqYjrAhUIVN8KHQ9zCJYQ6AEIXTAIhttps://books.google.com/books?id=EZwLsKEM1EoC&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=Caza%C3%B1as+ Later life The Caza√±as family opposed Fidel Castro and, following the Cuban Revolution, some were able to leave the island to take refuge in the United States and seek life in democracy there. The first of his children to leave Cuba was Eduardo, in 1959, who would later join the United States Armed Forces. Caza√±as' younger daughter, Marta, was deeply involved in the counter- revolution against Castro and left to the United States with her future husband Jes√∫s Permuy, a leader of the counter-revolution, via Venezuela following the failure of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. Caza√±as, his wife, their eldest daughter, his siblings and several other relatives remained in Cuba and were unable to leave for much of the 1960s. When his son Eduardo died in combat during the Vietnam War, the family sought to attend his funeral, however it was difficult for the remaining family in Cuba to participate due to diplomatic strains with the United States. Caza√±as and his wife went to Mexico as a simpler way to reach the United States, however Caza√±as contracted tuberculosis and was ultimately unable to attend the services and ceremonies.http://invi.df.gob.mx/portal/invi_vivienda.pdf The couple relocated permanently to Miami by 1968 and their eldest daughter's family joined them the following year. After emigrating to the United States, he lived out the rest of his life in retirement. He died in Miami on June 28, 1978 at the age of 75. Family=Immediate ancestry Both Pedro Pablo Caza√±as‚Äô ancestry and descendants have been a prominent force in Europe (especially Spain), the Caribbean, and the United States. In his immediate family, Caza√±as‚Äô grandfather, Francisco Jos√© Caza√±as y Peraza (born 1840)https://www.myheritage.com/names/francisco_caza%C3%B1as was directly descendanthttps://www.myheritage.com/names/micaela_d√°vila of the Peraza and Bobadilla families that were influential in the Castilian royal court, ruled the Canary Islands, and participated in the conquest of the New World, including Cuba and Hispaniola. It was this Peraza lineage of the family that traveled from Spain to Cuba and the United States in the nineteenth century. Francisco J. Caza√±as Peraza (sometimes written as Francis), would gain American citizenship, and was a landowner in New Rochelle, New York. Therefore, his son, Francisco Eduardo (Pedro Pablo's father), was born in New Rochelle, giving him dual citizenship with the United States and Cuba. Several generations of the Caza√±as family would maintain regular business travel to the United States and be educated there before ultimately migrating back to the United States permanently following the Cuban Revolution. In Cuba the Caza√±as family were significant landholders in Matanzas and owned several large estates, manor houses, and plantations, including the historic sugar plantation Dos Rosas, which was purchased in 1868 by Bartolom√© Caza√±as, great- grandfather of Pedro Pablo Caza√±as. The country estate was originally named \\"San Francisco de Paula-Riverol\\" and Bartolom√© Caza√±as renamed it that year to \\"Dos Rosas\\" (Spanish for \\"Two Roses\\") in honor of his Italian wife and their daughter, both named Rosa. Caza√±as's mother, Enriqueta Garc√≠a y Mart√≠n, was heiress of the Garc√≠a family of Spain. At the age of sixteen, Enriqueta was the subject of a poem included in the 1878 Jard√≠n Matancero (\\"Matanzas Garden\\"). The publication was a literary collection dedicated to the debutantes of the Matanzas region's most prominent families in which a flower- themed poem was dedicated to each emerging (\\"blossoming\\") socialite. As an adult she owned the vast Finca Buena Vista overlooking Varadero, its champion horses, and yacht while her husband Francisco would manage the estate's staff and grounds. The property was damaged in the Spanish-American War and became the center of the couple's high-profile claims to the Spanish Treaty Claims Commission. The couple, which traveled frequently to the United States and would occasionally reside there, first filed their claims with the commission in 1902, the year Pedro Pablo was born. It took six years to settle their claims, in which Francisco's legal background and US ties proved useful. Their claims were finally settled in 1908 when the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States awarded the couple total compensation of $13,138 ($9,738 to Enriqueta and $3,400 to Francisco), equivalent to over $360,000 in 2020, adjusted for inflation. They received the second highest awards granted by the commission, and the highest among private citizens not representing a corporation. Her brother (Pedro Pablo's uncle), F√©lix Garc√≠a y Mart√≠n, was a prominent doctor and insurrection figure during the Cuban War of Independence who became the second highest-ranking doctor in the Matanzas provincehttps://books.google.com/books?id=3Mc_AAAAYAAJ&q;=F%C3%A9lix+Garcia+Martin#v=snippet&q;=F%C3%A9lix%20Garcia%20Martin&f;=false and was later Chief Doctor of the Port of Matanzas and Head of Administration.https://books.google.com/books?id=EUwrAQAAMAAJ&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=Felix+Garc%C3%ADa+Mart%C3%ADn+Matanzas+ Extended Ancestry Pedro Pablo Caza√±as‚Äô ancestry is noted for several prominent lines. In addition to the Perazas, Bobadillas, Garc√≠a's and Mart√≠n's, he is directly descended from several other ancient Spanish and other European (French, English) noble and royal families, including the Guzm√°n, Haro, Lara, de Luna, Martel, and more distantly, the Plantagenets. He is descendant of the line of the Martel family that migrated from Carolingian France to Spain by way of Aragon and then to Seville during the Reconquista era and is descendant of the Plantagents through Eleanor of England. Progeny His son, Eduardo Enrique Caza√±as y D√≠az, emigrated to the United States in 1959 and quickly embraced his adopted homeland. He settled in Rhode Island, attending university to become an agricultural engineer and married his girlfriend in 1965. Eduardo is most known for his military service. With the escalation of the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s, he voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army to serve his adopted country and received the rank of SP-4 as an Armor Reconnaissance Specialist. He died in combat in 1967 at the age of 22, his death was covered in both Spanish and Englishhttps://www.vvmf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cazanas-Diasz-Edwardo- obit.jpg media, including the Diario Las Americas, which described him as the son of \\"Doctor Pedro Caza√±as.\\" He received the Purple Heart for his actions in battle and is included in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. Both his daughters, Raquel and Marta, would have high-profile marriages to Cuban leaders. Raquel married Rene de la Huerta, a noted psychiatrist, writer, and a leader of the Agrupaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Universitaria in Cuba, Spain, and the United States. Their children would include noted writer and spiritual leader Christian de la Huerta. Caza√±as' younger daughter, Marta Caza√±as, was married to Cuban architect, community leader, and human rights advocate Jes√∫s Permuy. The couple met in and were both prominent figures of the Anti-Castro Counter- Revolution and relocated to the United States following the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In the United States Marta became an influential fine art dealer, curator, promoter, and collector. She managed and co-founded the historic Permuy Gallery in Coral Gables, one of the first Cuban fine art galleries established in South Florida and credited with helping establish the early Miami Latin art market. Her children and grandchildren have in turn become prominent figures in art, architecture, politics, and finance. Marta's second son, Pedro Pablo Permuy, was named after Caza√±as and served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) in the Clinton Administration and later as President of the US-Spain Council, where he would host and organize events with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and King Felipe VI of Spain.http://www.spainusa.org/system/files_force/programfile/agenda_final.pdf?download=1 See also * Judicial system of Cuba * Enriqueta Garc√≠a y Mart√≠n * Fulgencio Batista * Peraza family References Category:1902 births Category:1978 deaths Category:People from Matanzas Category:Cuban emigrants to the United States Category:Exiles of the Cuban Revolution in the United States Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:Cuban judges Category:20th- century Cuban politicians Category:Cuban people of Spanish descent ","title":"Pedro Pablo Caza√±as"},{"id":"64297272","text":"17 Themes for Ockodektet is a live album by The Jeff Kaiser Ockodektet, released in 2002 on pfMENTUM ‚Äì CD010.Onefinalnote.com. 2020. 13 Themes For A Triskaidekaphobic : Jeff Kaiser Ockodektet : CD Reviews : One Final Note.

In 1967 he gained admission to the University of Western Ontario, from where he received his MD in 1973. Career Rolando Del Maestro, Montreal Neurological Hospital (2019). Sir William Osler is depicted in the background painting. After graduation, he completed five years of junior medical training and neurosurgical residency. In 1979, he received his Ph.D. in the subject of biochemistry from the University of Uppsala, Sweden, where he focused on mechanisms of free radical injury in the small blood vessels. The following year, he received a fellowship in neurosurgery from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. From 1981 to 2000, as director of the Brain Research Laboratories at the University of Western Ontario, his main work and research focussed on brain tumours, tumour invasiveness and angiogenesis.

In 2006 he authored a book titled A History of Neuro-Oncology. Neurosurgical training simulator Del Maestro has been involved in mimicking real brain surgery by creating a virtual setting, founded upon the principles of flight simulation. In 2020, this was demonstrated in a study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The study evaluated how well medical students and surgeons performed in such a setting. The idea came after observing the reduction in fatal aircraft accidents following the global use of simulation in the aviation industry. The adapted simulator, \\"NeuroVR\\", developed with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), allows neurosurgeons to practice brain surgery. He explained how his team ‚Äútook tumours out and measured their density and then put all that information into the simulator‚Äù ... and ... ‚Äútook colour and put that into the simulator, the way the blood vessels bleed‚Äù. The simulator is then able to determine whether the operator is junior or more of an expert, he stated in an interview about the research. Other roles In 1982, he co-founded the Brain Research Fund Foundation of Canada, a charity inspired by Steve Northey whose daughter died from a brain tumour. The foundation later became the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, which organizes support groups and provides research funds.

A native of Travale in Tuscany, he possessed several castles in the region, among them Elci, Giuncarico, Montalbano and Montingegnoli. In Greece, he acquired a fief in the diocese of Kitros. With Albertino of Canossa and Pietro Vento, he was part of the council of the regent of Thessalonica, Oberto of Biandrate, that received the ambassadors of the Latin emperor Henry. He participated in the Second Parliament of Ravennika, where he supported Biandrate, and was one of ten barons of Thessalonica who signed the concluding convention of 2 May 1210. In the aftermath of Henry's invasion of Thessalonica in 1209‚Äì1210, Rainerio entered imperial service. He was made administrator of Zetounion and Ravennika, territories taken from the Knights Templar by the emperor.. He appears as such in a document of October 1210 and is probably the unnamed imperial bailiff (balivus imperatoris) in a letter of Pope Innocent III dated July 1210. He was back in Italy by 1222, when he gave his castles over to Siena to finance his return to Greece. In return he was made a citizen of the Republic of Siena.

History  Originally from the Jibril Yonis section of the Makahil Samaron (Gadabursi). He was known and named \\"The great slayer of the Issas or great Issa slayer. The Issa are a tribe adjecant to the Gadabuursi and also derive themselves from Dir, more precisely the Madobe Dir section. The Gadabursi and Issa even though quite similar to each other used to fight multiple wars. Roble Afdeb was thus a warrior who pillaged and raided many Issa settlements and there are many poems written by him about his rival clan the Issa. He lived at the end of the 19th century. His name is a reflection according to scholars of the Somali af ku leeble which means shooting an arrow to the mouth. Roble Afdeb surprisingly has become a legend not for being anti-colonial or participating in a religious struggle or religious commitment, rather it's clan rivalry that has made him gain a legendary status. A famous poem composed by Roble Afdeb goes:This illustrates the political situation in Somali lands and how clan rivalries runs in the culture.  Prisoner of war  There is also a good side to Roble Afdeb which has contributed to his legendary status. Like the many wars that broke out. One day the Issa raided a camp belonging to Roble Afdeb and his clan. Roble leading his clan set out to revenge his people. Alas! Roble's men were defeated and he retreated with a broken leg only to be stuck in the middle of nowhere. Roble was trapped in enemy territory, he lost his horse and was unable to travel great distances. To his distress Roble made up his mind and infiltrated an enemy camp at night to talk to their leader with the intention of giving himself up. Either help me or kill me and earn yourself a feather (earned when killing a rival clan member) he said. Their leader understanding of Roble's situation gave him a horse and food so he could return home. Roble Afdeb intended to pay back his debt to Roble Awl. In doing so he launched a new attack and raid on the same camp after some time. This time his men and him managed to best the camp. A lot of confusion stirred through the camp and a boy tried to flee the rampage and onslaught. Roble took it upon him to save the boy ans place him on his horse. At home he asked the boy about his background only to his amazement to find out that his name is Idleh Roble Awl, the son of Roble Awl. The man whose help Roble Afdeb sought during his times of distress and who had chosen to help him. Roble Afdeb took it upon him to raise the child as if he was his own. When the boy Idleh reached the age of 20 Roble Afdeb gave him one of his own daughter in marriage. He also presented the newly wedded couple with animals in gifts and financial support so they could start their own family. The good news managed to reach Roble Awl the father of the boy he had many years ago decided to give up his search for him. Roble Awl was happy to know his son was still alive and well and that Roble Afdeb repaid his dues. This act of nobility has to this day created a sort of alliance between the descendants of Roble Afdeb and that of Idle Roble Awl. They pay and receive blood compensation as a united group.

In 1880 he received his L.D.S degree from the Royal Dental Hospital in Leicester Square. Career At Guy's hospital he was appointed as a dental surgeon in 1887. When the dentist he had been assisting became seriously ill, Newland-Pedley took up his responsibilities and also began the hospital's first dental department at his own expense. In 1888 he proposed the idea of a dental school to the hospital's board; the school opened with twelve chairs the next year in 1889. From February to June 1900, Newland-Pedley volunteered in the British Army during the Boer War, becoming the army's first appointed field dentist. He brought his own supplies and equipment, setting up in a tent to treat soldier's dental problems.https://bda.org/museum/Documents/What-the- Lindsay-Society-Does/For-web-Dental%20Historian%2062%20%282%29%20July%2017.pdf Returning from the war, he proposed to the British Army that a more permanent dental service be instituted.

It is near the UK's largest lead mine. Joseph Jenkins (2 November 1859 ‚Äì 27 April 1929) was a Calvinistic Methodist preacher, known as a progenitor of the 1904-1905 Welsh revival, a Christian revival in which, the BBC says, \\"a hundred thousand people had made a new commitment.\\" A strong personalisty, Jenkins affected many church communities as a preacher, his contemporaries saying he resembled a volcano ‚Äî \\"sometimes lifeless and sometimes in full eruption.\\"  Background and childhood  Trevecca College, the liberal arts college in Powys where Jenkins was trained, is the inspiration for other schools, including Trevecca Nazarene University. Jenkins was born to Mary and John Jenkins on 2 November 1859. John was a miner at the local Cwmystwyth lead mine, where the life expectancy for miners was just 32 years, due to the toxic effects of lead exposure. Jenkins trained to be a draper in his youth, taking an apprenticeship to John Lloyd, in Pentre, Rhondda. He became a member of Nazareth Chapel, a Welsh-speaking Calvinistic Methodist faith community, where he began to preach. He was educated at William James's school at Cardiff and the Pontypridd Academy. He was then sent to Trevecca College in Trefeca ‚Äî the same college where the miner-preacher Evan Roberts was trained.  Ministry  Following his theological training, Jenkins was ordained a Minister in the Presbyterian denomination in 1887. He went to minister in reformed churches in England and Wales, including: Caerphilly, Spellow Lane Church, Walton, New Quay, Dolgellau, Festiniog and Llandovery. In 1903, he attended what became known as the first \\"Keswick in Wales\\", a Bible teaching and prayer convention held in Llandrindod. The ministry affected him along with others who would become leaders in the Welsh Revival, such as Seth Joshua. In the months after the convention, Jenkins introduced Sunday morning \\"after-meetings\\" attracting young people to his church community in New Quay, Ceridigion. Concurrently, Jenkins reports prayer experiences in which he says he was \\"clothed with power from on high.\\" From this time, his preaching was known to strongly affect audiences: > \\"Volcanic is the only word to describe Joseph Jenkins. He can only be > explained in the light of the spiritual and eternal.\\" Jenkin's theological commitments were Calvinist, which includes a developed view of the doctrine of election. He's recorded as preaching that doctrine with great fervour while describing the crucifixion of Christ at Calvary: ‚ÄúWhat took place there? An election!\\"  1904‚Äì1905 Welsh revival  While the revival began with the preaching of Joseph Jenkins, it soon passed to a coal miner, Evan Roberts, seen preaching to a crowd in Anglesey on 4 July 1905. Large baptisms were a feature of the Welsh Revival, such as this baptism in the River Gwaun, Pembrokeshire. Dan Davies is seen conducting the service. Jenkins is remembered primarily as one of the leaders of the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh revival. Estimates vary, but it is widely reported that approximately 70,000 people came to faith in Jesus Christ in the first two months and over 100,000 during the course of the revival. In the preceding months, Jenkins was said to be constantly in prayer asking God to bring a great move of the Holy Spirit to the local area. Some Christians believe in a phenomena known as the Baptism with the Holy Spirit, whereby Christian believers undergo a secondary spiritual experience, which they claim gives them a more intimate spiritual encounter with God. It is reported that Jenkins had himself experienced this phenomenon in late 1903.https://www.churchmodel.org.uk/Back04.pdf One Sunday morning in February 1904, he held a prayer meeting for young people at his church in New Quay and asked them to share about how they viewed God. One boy said, ‚ÄúJesus is the light of world,‚Äù to which Jenkins is reputed to have replied, ‚ÄúYes, but what does He mean to you?‚Äù 20-year-old Florrie Evans rose to her feet and declared, ‚ÄúRydw i'n caru Arglwydd Iesu Grist a'i holl galon‚Äù in Welsh (‚ÄúI love the Lord Jesus Christ with all of my heart‚Äù). Contemporary witnesses claim that in that instant the Holy Spirit descended on the room bringing everyone present to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. Witnesses said the young people started weeping and declaring their love for Jesus.http://www.pisgahchapel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Flier- The1904WelshRevivalv4.pdf This prayer meeting held by Jenkins is regarded as the touch paper that lit the fuse of the Welsh revival. A journalist named W. T. Stead who was present that day wrote: ‚ÄúThe pathos and the passion of the avowal (of that young girl) acted like an electric shock upon the congregation. One after another rose and made the full surrender, and the news spread like wildfire from place to place that the Revival had broken out, and that souls were being ingathered to the Lord.‚Äù The revival quickly spread throughout the whole country with many thousands expressing repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ. The Manchester Guardian reported on the extraordinary events taking place on 31st December, 1904; \\"... converts during the revival, vouched for in every case by the minister or secretary of the churches supplying the returns, give a total of over 20,000 for Glamorganshire, part of Monmouthshire, and part of Breconshire, and this number is being added to daily.\\"  Later life and death  After his key involvement in the famous revival of 1904-1905, Jenkins remained a committed and influential Christian preacher for the remainder of his life, serving as pastor in at least six different parishes in England and Wales. He was most revered for the power and effectiveness of his preaching, but those who knew him best testified to the intensity and studiousness of his prayer life. His wife recounted how she would look in at his study at 11pm before going to bed where she found him on his knees in prayer. She would return the next morning at 6:30am and find him still on his knees in his study in the same attitude of prayer. The regard in which he was held by the Welsh Presbyterian Christian community he was a leader of throughout his career is witnessed to by the testimonial held for him at the General Assembly held in Aberdare. After many months of illness, the Assembly presented him with a cheque at the testimonial. Jenkins died on 27 April, 1929 at 69 years of age and was buried in the chapel cemetery of his home village in Cwmystwyth.

Plot summary La Grenadi√®re is the name of a farm house overlooking the Loire at Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire near Tours. A woman named Madame Willemsens comes to rent the house, and stays there with her two young sons Louis Gaston and Marie Gaston, and her elderly servant Annette. Her past life is not explained. She reveals to her older son, 13 year old Louis that she is terminally ill. The family then spend the last few months of her life trying to enjoy their life and their idyllic surroundings. Louis also dedicates himself to study, particularly mathematics, as he plans to join the navy in order to support himself and his brother. On her death bed, she asks Louis to write a letter to her husband Lord Brandon in England announcing her death. She gives Louis 10000 Francs, and tells him that she has also left money for Annette.

It contains a single species, Caipora bambuiorum. Fossils have been found only in Brazil's Toca da Boa Vista cave, alongside the larger Protopithecus. The presence of these two large arboreal monkeys in Bahia suggests that the region may have supported a dense forest during the Late Pleistocene. Taxonomy Caipora bambuiorum is known from an almost complete skeleton of a late-stage subadult individual discovered in the Toca da Boa Vista cave in 1992, by the spelaeological team Grupo Bambui de Pesquisas Espeleologicas. Its generic name is derived from caipora, a figure in Brazilian folklore, while the specific name was given in honour of the Grupo Bambui. Description Caipora was a large-bodied monkey: despite the subadult age of the type specimen, its postcranial skeleton is more robust than any living New World monkey, but not as robust as Protopithecus, and the individual is estimated to have weighed around 20.5 kilograms. Its upper limbs are very long, and the neurocranium is more rounded than is typical in New World monkeys. Like the extant genera Ateles and Brachyteles, it may have been a specialised suspensory climber and clamberer.

The fire, which started on June 8, 2020 approximately 16 miles north of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, burned a total of . The fire threatened the community of Jacob Lake, Arizona, resulting in its evacuation. Select highways were closed, including Highway 67, which resulted in closure of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Additionally, areas of the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness were inaccessible due to closures. Four buildings were destroyed, including two historic cabins. The exact cause of the fire remains under investigation, however, fire officials have confirmed it was human caused. Events=June The Mangum Fire was reported at approximately 3 PM on June 8, 2020 on the Kaibab Plateau near Mangum Camp about 1 3/4 miles north of Big Springs, Arizona in Kaibab National Forest. By the time fire crews responded, the fire had grown to . Smoke from was reported as visible from Fredonia, Arizona, a small town that serves as the gateway to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. By the next day, June 9, the fire had grown to an estimated . Four hotshot crews and airtankers were called in to fight the fire. Crews dropped fire retardant on the south side, with the intention of keeping the fire from spreading towards Big Springs. On June 10, the United States Forest Service (USFS) reported that crews were able to control the fire due to low winds and that dozers were to start creating boundaries in order to contain the fire. Fire managers hoped to contain the fire in areas that had recently burned as part of a prescribed burn. Control efforts led to the fire being at two percent containment by June 11. However, by the afternoon of June 11, high winds caused the fire to jump containment lines and the fire began moving northeast. The fire destroyed two cabins and two outbuildings at Mangum Camp. By the evening, the fire had grown to , red flag warnings were in place, and evacuations were ordered for Jacob Lake, Arizona starting June 12. By the morning of June 13, red flag winds caused the Mangum Fire to grow substantially - to over . The fire grew by ten miles to the north with embers jumping half a mile ahead of the fire, breaching control lines. Crews created defensible space around structures in Jacob Lake and burn outs to divert the fire from the community. State Route 89A was closed from Marble Canyon to Fredonia, Arizona and Highway 67 to the Grand Canyon. The fire jumped State Route 89A that day, moving northeast. McCall Smokejumpers watch the Mangum Fire on the northeast side on June 23. The northeast side remains challenging to control due to steep terrain. On June 14, the Mangum Fire jumped control lines towards Mangum Springs, Arizona, being fueled by grass, brush and pinyon-juniper. Two days later, by the morning of June 16, the fire had grown to , fueled by sage-grassland, and three percent containment and had crossed onto lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The next day, three homes were evacuated on Houserock Road due to the fire moving northeast towards the area. Winds from the fire began affecting air quality, with residents in Tuba City, Arizona and areas west of the fire being told to limit outdoor activities if they are sensitive to smoke. The USFS reported that the historic Jacob Lake Ranger Station was narrowly spared from the fire, burning \\"within feet\\" of the building. While the exact cause of the fire remains unknown, officials confirmed on June 20 that the fire was human caused. The fire began moving east on June 21, with a large smoke plume appearing, requiring further use of air support to fight the growth. Due to the closure of the Arizona portion of House Rock Valley Road, parts of Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, specifically Coyote Buttes and White Pockets became inaccessible. The fire remains active on the northeast side on the north side of Highway 89A due to hard to reach terrain. As a result, incident command added more fire crews to fight the fire. Air support continues, with tankers flying out of St. George Regional Airport. Due to evacuation orders and threats to power sources in the area, electricity was turned off at North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park and Jacob Lake. On June 25, the power was restored. Additionally, the containment percentage was re-calculated and went from 68 percent to 46 percent. On June 27, the Wire Pass Fire started on the west side of House Rock Valley Road, burning \\"extremely close,\\" to the Mangum Fire. Highway 89A and Highway 67 were reopened on the morning of June 29, 2020 and evacuation orders were lifted for Jacob Lake and White Sage. Evacuation orders were lifted for the two houses on House Rock Valley Road, however, evacuation warnings were put in place just in case the fire threat changed. July By the start of July, the fire grew in containment to 67 percent. Fire suppression repair began. As of July 7, the fire has burned and was 88 percent contained. Current evacuations and closures The community of Jacob Lake is under mandatory evacuation orders due to the Mangum Fire. And the following roads and areas are closed as of July 7, 2020: *Bureau of Land Management lands east of Fredonia, including parts of Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness *Forest Road 22 is closed between road 422 and road 429.

Impact The Mangum Fire as seen from Fredonia High School in Fredonia, Arizona on June 12, 2020 The Mangum Fire threatened community of Big Springs, Arizona and the main powerlines which provide electricity to Jacob Lake, Arizona. The fire caused the entrance to the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park and lands operated by the Bureau of Land Management, east of Fredonia, to be closed. The fire did not burn in Grand Canyon National Park and the South Rim of the park remained open to visitors. Due to the closure of House Rock Valley Road, parts of Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, including Coyote Buttes South and White Pockets were made inaccessible. Smoke was visible from the north and south rims of Grand Canyon National Park, Highway 67, U.S. Route 89A, and the Arizona communities of Jacob Lake, Fredonia, Page, and Utah town of Kanab. Air quality was impacted in the Arizona towns and cities of Tuba City, Kayenta, and Chinle. Temporary flight restrictions were put in place by June 11, along with stage two fire restrictions, which prohibits campfires, charcoal, or wood fueled fires. Investigation While the exact details are under investigation, the fire was human caused.

He is the highest ranked Super Smash Bros. Ultimate player from Europe. In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, he was ranked the 70th best player in the world of all time. In Ultimate, he was ranked 14th and 8th best in the world for the first and second halves of 2019, respectively. Glutonny has used Wario as his primary character in all three Smash Bros. titles in which he has competed; he was considered the best Wario in Europe in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the best Wario in the world in Smash for Wii U, and contends for best Wario in the world in Ultimate. Career=Super Smash Bros. Brawl Glutonny began competing in Smash at age 13, alongside his brother. His first Smash competition was Bushido Impact 8, a 105-participant Super Smash Bros. Brawl event held in Paris in February 2009. He took 2nd place, using Wario and Solid Snake. He competed in a number of small French events, with his first win coming at Bushido Nibai Impact in April 2009. Glutonny credits prominent French player Nassim \\"Leon\\" Laib for introducing him to the French competitive community. After losing to Leon in the finals of a tournament, Leon encouraged Glutonny to compete in further events and showed him the forums where registrations for French tournaments were held. Glutonny also believes that defeating Leon at Bushido Brawl Impact in 2010 was the beginning of his own rise to prominence. Glutonny went on to win that event, defeating Canadian player Elliot \\"Ally\\" Carroza-Oyarce in the grand finals. In 2012, he traveled to New Jersey in the United States to compete in SKATAR. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U Super Smash Bros. for Wii U released in Europe in November 2014, but Glutonny would not achieve notable results in the title until 2016. In February of that year, he took 2nd in the Smash for Wii U competition at Cannes Winter Clash, a French multi-esport tournament. In September he tied for 5th at a Dutch tournament, Syndicate 2016, using Wario and Captain Falcon. He took 3rd place in Smashdown World in November, where he was eliminated by Jason \\"ANTi\\" Bates in loser's side finals. The pair had fought earlier in the competition as well, in a match that Shoryukens Sam Foxall considered one of the best matches of 2016. In February 2017, Glutonny tied for 9th at a Swedish tournament, BEAST 7. In March, he traveled to Santa Ana, California to compete in 2GGC: Civil War, the most talent-heavy Smash for Wii U tournament held to date, and tied for 65th. In July he won the British tournament Albion 2, and won Respawn 5 in Germany a month later. He took 3rd in Syndicate 2017 in September. In January 2018, Glutonny won the Danish tournament Valhalla, using Wario, Cloud Strife, and Donkey Kong. He won Deflagration, held in Strasbourg, the following month. Midwest Mayhem 11 in Chicago paid for flights to their event for the winners of several European tournaments, and Glutonny secured one of the flights with his win at Valhalla. He tied for 9th at the tournament, which was held in March. In April, he signed with esports organization orKs Grand Poitiers. In May he tied for 13th at Get On My Level 2018, held in Ontario. He took 3rd at Glitch 5, in Laurel, Maryland, one of the last Smash for Wii U tournaments before Ultimate's release. In Panda Global's ranking of the 100 best Super Smash Bros. for Wii U players of all time, Glutonny was ranked 70th. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate The release of Ultimate saw an increase in the number of people entering and watching tournaments, leading to an increase in available prize money compared with Smash for Wii U. As a result, Glutonny was able to leave his job and pursue competitive Smash Bros. full-time. In the first half of 2019, Glutonny asserted himself as Europe's best player, winning every tournament he entered in his home continent except for one, Stunfest 2019, where he took 2nd. In January, Glutonny won Valhalla II, the first large Ultimate tournament held in Europe. During the tournament, he defeated elite Super Smash Bros. Melee player William \\"Leffen\\" Hjelte in a reverse sweep. ESPN remarked that \\"many members of the Smash community hailed it as the most entertaining high-level Smash Ultimate set so far.\\" Following his victory at Valhalla II, Glutonny departed orKs Grand Poitiers and signed with French esports organization Solary, which gave him the funding to travel to tournaments held outside of Europe. In February, he traveled to Oakland, California for Genesis 6, and tied for 17th. In March, he took 3rd place at Smash Ultimate Summit, an invitational tournament that he was invited to after winning a fan vote. In March he returned to California for 2GG: Prime Saga, where he tied for 9th, and in June he tied for 5th at Community Effort Orlando 2019. In early July, Glutonny won Albion 4, the first major Smash Ultimate tournament held in Europe. In the grand finals, he lost the first set 3‚Äì1 to Samuel \\"Dabuz\\" Buzby, before beating him by the same score in the bracket reset to win the event. Although he won one major and placed well in others, Glutonny attended only four of the first eleven major tournaments, and was ranked 14th in the inaugural Panda Global Rankings Ultimate, which covered events from the beginning of competitive Smash Ultimate through Albion 4. He was the highest ranked player from Europe. Glutonny continued his dominance over European competition in the second half of 2019, losing only two tournaments held on his home continent, both to Mexican player Leonardo \\"MkLeo\\" L√≥pez P√©rez. At the end of July, Glutonny took 4th place at Smash Factor 8, held in Cholula, Mexico. The following month he placed 3rd at Evo 2019 in Las Vegas, the largest tournament by number of entrants in the Smash Bros. franchise's history, then tied for 5th at SwitchFest 2019 and 9th at Mainstage. In October he took 2nd at Ultimate Fighting Arena 2019 in France, one of the two European tournaments he lost to MkLeo, then won Syndicate 2019 in the Netherlands. November saw him take 2nd at the other European tournament he lost to MkLeo, Vienna Challengers Arena 2019. He closed out the year tying for 5th at 2GG Kongo Saga. In the Panda Global Rankings for the latter half of 2019, Glutonny rose to 8th in the world. He was once again the highest ranked player from Europe. Glutonny began 2020 by winning Valhalla III, then tied for 7th at Genesis 7 at the end of the month. In February, he tied for 17th at Frostbite 2020. A week prior to the tournament, he had posted online that anti-Glutonny cheering from within the French Smash community had begun to impact his performance. He stated that while he understood that people were cheering against him because he had yet to lose to European competition, the comments had become increasing vitriolic, and that even match commentators were making harmful comments. In early March, Panda Global Rankings suspended the 2020 competitive season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several tournaments transitioned to online play, however Ultimates online service suffers from noticeable input delay and lag, and many top players had poorer than normal performances in online tournaments. In April, Glutonny tied for 9th at The Quarantine Series: Minor Tournament 1, a 5,000 participant online event. However, later that month he would fail to make the top 50 in Pound Online, and tied for 97th in the 128-player invitation The Quarantine Series: Major Tournament 1 in early May. Wario Across all three Smash Bros. titles that he's competed in, Glutonny has consistently used Wario as his main character. According to the Panda Global Rankings and to writers covering competitive Smash, he was considered the best Wario player in Europe in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the best Wario in the world in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and is a contender for the best Wario in the world in Ultimate. He gravitated towards Wario because of the character's superior mobility. In an interview with Canal+, Glutonny explained that while Wario does not have the best attack options in the game, he has a large number of viable options, and he can get anywhere on the map that he needs to be. In another interview he explained that in addition to Wario's mobility, the character is highly fluid, allowing Glutonny to create combos on the fly. Between that and the character's motorbike being a potent projectile weapon, Wario \\"has all the tools in order to counter every game style\\". In 2017, he noted in an interview that Wario was weaker in Smash for Wii U than he was in Brawl, and that as a result Glutonny had to change his playstyle and do extensive testing to find which techniques worked in the new game. Glutonny's gaming handle was inspired his use of Wario as well as by the character Gluttony from Fullmetal Alchemist. He reasoned that Gluttony eats everything, including people and inanimate objects, and since Wario also eats everything, it was a fitting name.

His reign was during the Rumfawa era of the Bagauda Dynasty and was one of the longest in the State's history. Under Kisoki's leadership, the state reached its zenith, gaining suzerainty over all of Hausaland along with other Kingdoms in the Sahel which resulted in a Kanoan Empire. Kisoki ascended the throne during a period that saw internal strife ravage the Songhai and Bornu Empires, and the eventual death of the dreaded Kanta Kotal of Kebbi. He launched a brief but successful expedition into Bornu and was able to decisively repel a reprisal attack by the Mai. In doing this, he dissolved the suzerainty that had been established decades earlier in the reign of Abdullahi Burja. He solidified his power in Kano by strategically promoting his kinsmen into powerful positions and was able to appropriate power from the Kano Council. His reign also saw the continuation of the influx of scholars from neighboring Kingdoms and the construction of multiple mosques and schools throughout Kano, further establishing the state as a learning center. Kisoki's death created a power vacuum that marked the beginning of the First Kanoan Civil War.  Early life  Kisoki was the son of Sultan Abdullahi Dan Rumfa and Lamis. He was the grandson of Muhammad Rumfa and through his grandmother Madaki Auwa, a great grandson of Askiya the Great. Kisoki was present in his grandfathers court and as a child and his precocious actions would earn Kisoki the admiration of the people who prayed that one day he would become Sultan.  Sultan  \\"Kisoki was an energetic Sarki, warlike and masterful.\\" Muhammad Kisoki became the 22nd ruler of Kano after the death of his father. Building on the success of his father in conquering Zazzau and Katsina and the economic prosperity during his grandfathers reign, Kisoki was able to conquer most neighboring states resulting in the first Kanoan Empire. According to the Kano Chronicle, Kisoki's rule encompassed all of Hausaland \\"East and West, South and North\\". Historians have noted that Kisoki had \\"the strong blood of his grandfather in his veins\\".  Kisoki's Court  Though his grandfathers reign saw the introduction of the repressive \\"Kulle\\" (Purdah) practice, Kisoki's court had a very strong female presence. Two of the most powerful figures in his court were his mother, Iya Lamis and grandmother, Madaki Auwa. Kisoki expelled Barde, a military captain, and installed his brother, Dabkare Dan Iya into the Kano Council of Nine. The title \\"Dan Iya\\" became the most revered in the state. His granduncle, Guli also became very powerful during his reign and the counselor's title \\"Na'Guli\\" was named after him.  Influx of Islamic Scholars  During his era, a number of notable islamic scholars came to Kano, bringing with them various islamic books. Shehu Tunus brought the book Eshifa with him. He urged the Sultan to build a mosque for the rumawa to which he obliged. Tubi came from Zazzau to learn from Tunus a year after he arrived and became his apprentice. Shehu Abdussalam also came from Bornu with the books Madawanna, Jam As-Saghir and Samarkandi. Three siblings, Shehu Karaski, Magumi and Kabi also came from Bornu. The Sultan became close with Karaski and asked him to become his Alkali, but Karaski suggested his brother Magumi Instead. Magumi accepted the position and built a portico at Kofan Fada. Other notable scholars who came during his reign include, Dan-Goron-Duma, Zaite, Koda, Buduru and Tamma, father of one of Kisoki's wives, Hausatu.  Ali Fulan  The former grand vizier of the Songhai Empire under Askiya the Great, Ali Fulan while fleeing civil war also came to Kano on his way to performing Hajj but died in Kano.  Feud with Bornu  \\"Kisoki, physic of Bornu and the Chiratawa.\\" During Kisoki's father, Sultan Abdullahi's reign, there was a conflict between the Sultan and the Dagachi. The Dagachi is believed to be a relative of the Mai of Bornu through Othman Kalnama who had migrated to Kano and was the first to take the title \\"Dagachi (ruler)\\". Dagachi had become very wealthy and powerful in Kano and tried to usurp the Sultan in his absence but was quashed by the influence of the Sultans mother, Madaki Auwa. The Mai of Bornu came to attack Kano soon after. Kisoki's father, took a delegation of scholars to the Mai and humbled himself before the Mai to avoid a war. Sultan Abdullahi then forced Dagachi to capitulate and stripped him of his position, bestowing the title \\"Dagachi\\" to one of his slaves. Muhammad Kisoki however waged war on Birnin Unguru (a province of Bornu) because of a feud about Gaidam. The Sultan entered the town and sat underneath a Baobab tree at the gates of the city where assembled the people of Borno and \\"reduced them to terrified submission\\". He then told his army to leave the people alone but to seize the horses and textiles. After his campaign in Unguru, Sultan Kisoki retreated to the bush.The Mai sent a message to Kisoki to inquire what the purpose of his invasion was to which the Sultan replied ; \\"I do not know, but the cause of war is the ordinance of Allah.\\". The Sultan returned to Kano after one month. A year later, the Mai came to attack Kano, but his siege was repelled and his army mortified. Kano's victory was well celebrated. The victory against Bornu was indicative of how powerful Kano had become. Kisoki is the only Kano ruler in recorded history to have humbled their eastern neighbors.  Family and Marriages  The Kano Chronicle mentions two of Kisoki's sons who became rulers of Kano; Yakufu, son of Tunus, his immediate successor whose reign was ephemeral, and Muhammad Zaki, son of Hausatu.  Death and Aftermath  Muhammad Kisoki died in 1565. His son Yakufu's ascension was challenged by Guli, and a civil war broke out between Guli's faction and that of the Galadima, Sara Katunia, who was intent on returning Yakufu to the throne. The Galadima slew Guli after forty days of fighting but Yakufu abdicated his throne in favor of a life of piety. The civil war continued with the deposition and assassination of multiple subsequent Kings until another one of Kisoki's sons, Muhammad Zaki was installed in 1582.

Through forging of powerful alliances and the creation of trade routes, Burja shifted the identity of the Kano Sultanate towards trade and commerce, what Kano and the Kanoan people are known for today. He was the first Hausa King to pay tribute to Bornu and in doing so secured an agreement that allowed him to open trade routes from Gwanja to Bornu. He was also the first King to own camels in Hausaland. This shift towards trade saw an intensification of slave raids by Kano towards the south to export to Bornu. Abdullahi Burja through his Galadima created twenty one new slave colonies, each with a thousand slaves of an equal split between male and female slaves. Slowly, trade in Kano shifted towards other commodities and by the end of the 15th Century, Kano had emerged as one of the most vibrant trading centers in the Sahel. Through trade, the Hausa language and culture was spread throughout the region.  Ascension and Reign  Abdullahi Burja's mother's name was Tekidda. He was the third successive son of King Kanajeji to be made ruler of Kano. According to the Kano Chronicle, his reign coincided with the late days of the infamous Queen Amina of Zazzau. It was said that the Sultan waged war on Dutse and later took a daughter of their leader as his wife, the first mention of Dutse in recorded history. Burja established trade relations with Bornu and created trade routes from Gwanja to Bornu. His reign was focused on taking full advantage of these routes by collecting slaves. During this time, all the young men of Kano were enjoined to military service and only old men remained in Kano. Abdullahi was noted by the Kano Chronicle for his generosity.  Exploits of the Galadima  Sultan Burja was implored to return home after his campaign in Dutse by the Galadima, Dauda, vowing to do whatever the King wishes. Galadima Dauda engaged in a slave raiding expedition in the regions south of Kano which produced a thousand slaves monthly for seven years before being asked to return home by the King. On his way back to Kano, the Galadima would build a new city every three miles with five hundred male and five hundred female slaves. When he reached Kano, he gave the Sultan three thousand slaves and informed him of his exploits. All in all, Galadima Dauda built twenty one new towns which he called \\"Ibdabu\\" and was made Lord of these towns by the Sultan.  Dagachi  In the reign of his predecessor, his brother, Dauda Bakon Damisa, a great Bornu prince which the Girgam corroborates as Othman Kalnama sought refuge in Kano and took the title Dagachi. From that point, the figure is referred to as Dagachi so it is possible that this title was passed on to descendants of Othman. It is said that the Dagachi began to amass great wealth and power during Dauda's reign and this continued in the reign of Abdullahi Burja. When Abdullahi returned from his expedition in Dutse, he found that Dagachi had established a market in Karabka and built countless houses. Dagachi would eventually revolt unsuccessfully in the time of Abdullahi Dan Rumfa with his kin in Bornu coming to his aid.  Family and Marriages  Abdullahi Burja was the first sarki to marry the daughters of the Galadima, Sarkin Rano, Sarkin Dutse, and Sarkin Shirra. He is the father of Sultan Yakubu, who was the father of Muhammad Rumfa.  Death and Succession  The death of Abdullahi Burja in 1452 saw a short period of instability that produced three Kings within eight days. His first successor, his son Dakauta, was dumb and the people theorized that becoming King would make him speak. He was turned out a day later when his speech wasn't restored. Dakauta's son then ascended the throne but abdicated 7 days later in fear of Galadima Dauda, allowing Abdullahi Burja's son Yakubu to assume the throne of Kano.

He is known for his numerous Tosafot, and halakic principles which greatly influenced Rashi.  Biography  Born into a scholarly French Jewish family. His brother was Simeon Kara and his nephew, whom he taught, was Joseph Kara. In his early years, Menahem studied in Provence, which accounts for the presence of Arabic words as well as some Proven√ßal forms of French in Rashi. Menahem wrote comments on the piyyutim which he collected into a work known as \\"Pitronim\\" (\\"solutions\\"). In this work he covered all of Nevi'im and Ketuvim, but he did not cover the Torah which was a deliberate decision on his part. Almost all of his commentaries are no longer extant as they were apparently superseded by Rashi's commentaries. The majority of Menahem's teachings were preserved by his nephew Joseph, who transmitted them to Rashi.  Biblical exegesis  His approach to Biblical exegesis can be summarized into the following five principles: * To always aim to explain the plain meaning of the text (pshat), while still drawing from rabbinic midrashim as a basis for interpretation. * To keep comments short, and concise. * To recognize the intimate connection between Hebrew and Arabic. * To use French and German words to provide context for complex Hebrew and Aramaic terms. * To find links between different passages, and to interpret halakha based on the context of certain words. These principles were immensely instrumental in shaping Rashi's own approach.

Reign  He ascended to the throne after the death of his father. Though his religion was unclear, during his early years as King, Tsamiya like his father experienced a tumultuous relationship with the pagans of Kano. It is said that the pagan practice of \\"tchibiri\\" was first practiced during his reign. The usage of longhorns were also introduced to Kano during his reign. Tsamiya was noted by the Kano Chronicles to be a fearless and courageous warrior and a noble leader. He was said to have had nine warriors who were \\"equal to a thousand\\"; Madawaki, Bajeri, Burdi-Kunkuru, Dan-kududufi-Tanko, Dan Burran Bakaki, Jarumai Garaji, Makama Gumki, Danunus Baurire, Sarkin Damargu Gabdodo and Jekafada Masab. Tsamiya formed a formidable army which struck fear into the hearts of the pagans. The pagans conceded to pay him tax to avoid war after consulting with their gods through their chief. They also offered him 200 slaves which he refused. The king then sent word to the pagans that he intended to burn their sacred tree which led to them coming out in full force with shields of elephant hide and spears to protect their gods. The pagans were however defeated and forced to flee. Tsamiya was then able to arrive at a compromise with the pagans, appointing from among them \\"Sarkin Tchibiri\\", \\"Sarkin Gazarzawa\\", and \\"Sarkin Kurmi\\". \\"Love trausnlits love, and hate transmits hate; there is nothing between us except bows and spears and swords and shields; there is no deceit and no deceiver except he who is afraid.\\" - Tsamiya addressing the pagans of Kano.

With Maganarku, he sired, Ali Yaji and Muhammad Bugaya who would later go on to become the 11th and 12th Rulers of Kano respectively. Yaji became the first Sultan of Kano and Bugaya the second.  Death  Tsamiya was toppled and killed in his palace by his half brother, Usman Zamnagawa. Zamnagawa then locked the doors of the palace for a week and how he disposed of his body remains a mystery.

He reigned from 1390 - 1410. Like his father, Kaneneji was a belligerent King whose reign was characterized by war, conquest, and religious reformation. Kanajeji engaged in two long and pivotal wars with Umbatu and Zazzau, both of which he eventually prevailed in after lengthy feuds. He took Umbatu in four attempts and took Zazzau after two battles with a great number of casualties in-between. He also renewed the sovereignty of Kano over the Kwararafa which his father had imposed. However, in a bid to conquer Zazzau, his reign also saw the return of the pagan practices his father sought to expunge. He is credited with revolutionizing Kano's army through the introduction of quilted leather armors (lifidi), steel armors, coats of mail, and iron helmets.  Lineage and Ascension  He was the son of the first Sultan of Kano Ali Yaji Dan Tsamiya and Aunaka. His fathers successor, his uncle, Muhammad Bugaya's short reign was pervaded with peace and tranquility because Yaji had finally solidified their family's grasp on Kano. His uncle sought repose and handed over official duties to the Galadima. Kanajeji succeeded Bugaya after his death in 1390.  Reign  Kanajeji marred the peace Kano had achieved during his predecessors reign. Like his father, he immediately set out to extend the reach of the Sultanate, engaging in multiple conquests all over the region. He requested that the Kwararafa paid tribute to him like they did his father so they sent him two hundred slaves. The Kwararafa continued to send him slaves while he continued to send them horses.  War with Umbatu  Kanajeji's first attempt at subduing Umbatu was a colossal failure. The casualties Kano suffered forced him to modernize his army by introducing armors, iron helmets, and coats of mail. He returned to Umbatu two more times in two successive years but failed both times. However, after failing third time, he vowed \\" I will not return Kano, if Allah wills, until I conquer the enemy.\\". The fourth attempt, he utilized the same strategy that his father used to conquer the Kwararafa years earlier; He started a siege to wait them out which lasted for two years until the people of Umbatu were starved out and forced to concede defeat because they couldn't farm. They gave the Sultan a thousand male slaves and a thousand female slaves from among their children, and then gave him another two thousand slaves. \\"No one shall again conquer Umbatu as I have conquered it, though he may gain spoil.\\"  First Battle With Zazzau  After Umbatu, Kanajeji then set his sight on the Hausa State of Zazzau. This was Kano's first recorded war with Zazzau. He camped at Turunku where their armies clashed. The men of Zazzau defeated the men of Kano after which they taunted \\"What is Kano? Kano is 'bush!'\\".  Reintroduction of Pagan Practices  Sarkin Tchibiri: \\" Re-establish the god that your father and grandfather destroyed...Whatever you wish for in this world, do as our forefathers did of old\\" Kanajeji: \\" True, but tell me what I am to do with it...Show me, and I will do even as they did.\\" Disappointed by his defeat in Zazzau, the Sultan of Kano sought advice as to how to defeat them. He was advised by the Sarkin Tchibiri to reintroduce the gods his father and grandfather had suppressed. He was then guided through a few pagan rituals by Sarkin Tchibiri while singing the \\"Song of Barbushe\\".  Scourge of Zazzau  A year after the first battle, Kanajeji set out to Zazzau once again. This time he camped at Gadaz and the army of Zazzau came to meet them. The army of Kano slayed the King of Zazzau and most of their chiefs. The men of Zazzau fled for their lives. He entered Zazzau and reigned near Shika for eight months where he gained much spoil from the people of Zazzau. \\"Son of Kano, hurler of the kere, Kanajeji, drinker of the water of Shika, preventer of washing in the Kubanni, Lord of the town, Lord of the land\\"  Death  Kananeji died in 1410. The three subsequent rulers of Kano were his sons, Umaru, Dauda, and Abdullahi Burja.

Kanta was the chief in charge of the Province of Kebbi, then under the Songhai Empire. As a General in the Songhai Army, he was suscpected to have been a pivotal figure in the alleged conquest that saw the Empire conquer five of the most powerful Hausa States (Kano, Gobir, Katsina, Zazzau and Zamfara) and more definitively Agadez. Kanta rebelled against Askia the great after a dispute over the spoils of war and declared Kebbi an independent Kingdom. He then renovated the city and fortified its defenses and was able to deftly hold off multiple reprisal attacks by the Songhai Empire and to defeat them in multiple battles. Kanta Kotal would go on to conquer some of its former tributaries including a few other Hausa states and Agadez, expelling Songhai forces in these regions. Kotal would also succeed in defeating the Bornu Empire and keeping the Moroccans from Hausa Land. An astute leader and a fearless warrior, for a time Kebbi emerged as the most powerful Hausa State and one of the most powerful Kingdoms in the Sahel during the first half of the 16th century. At its height, Kebbi wrestled successfully with some of the most powerful states in the continent. Kanta Kotal is one of the most prominent figures among a wave of great leaders that emerged in the Sahel between the 14th and 16th Centuries.  Early life  Muhammad was born to princess Tamatu of Katsina. His father, Mukata was said to be a descendant of Uthman Nann Ibn Mas'ud who was said to be leader of a group in charge of water supply at the Ka'abah. Kanta set out of Katsina and became a herder for the fula people. He immediately solidified himself as a formidable warrior. He floored every single opponent he boxed or wrestled with, earning him the epithet \\"Kotal\\", which means \\"No Challenger\\".  Military career  Towards the end of the 15th Century, Kotal joined the army of Songhai empire where he was designated a war chief in charge of Kebbi region. Kanta was said to have assisted the empire in its conquests in Hausa Land. He then joined the army of the Emperor on their successful campaign in Agadez. It is also possible that the expeditions against the Hausa States were single-handedly carried out by him at a later date.  Dispute and Revolt Against Askia  Following the expedition in Agadez, Kotal got concerned that the King did not intend to share the spoils of the conquest. When he voiced his concerns to the Dendi Fari (Governor of the Eastern front) he was rebuffed and warned that he would be considered by the prince to be a rebel if he did. Some of Kotal's men came to him with the same concerns about the booty and he explained to them what transpired between him and the Dendi Fari but assured them that if they would support him, he would lay claim to their share of the spoils to which they agreed. He returned to the Dendi-Fari but was denied again and a battle broke out between his men and the army of the empire. Kanta's soldiers were able to hold their own against the emperors army and fought them to a standstill after which he dissolved his alliance with Askiya, returned and declared himself King.  King of Kebbi  Muhammad Kanta Kotal declared Kebbi a kingdom and himself its first King. He built moats and trenches to make Kebbi as secure as possible. Some of these structures are still erect especially in the Kingdoms capital Surame. He then laid claim to former Songhai tributaries including Agadez and parts of Hausa land including Yauri.  Subsequent Wars with the Songhai Empire  Kanta ambushed Askia Muhammed on an annual tour of provinces and forced him to flee. Kebbi fully gained independence a year later after defeating Songhai forces at Tara in 1517 . The Songhai Empire made attempts to regain Kebbi but their attempts proved futile. Most notably, they attempted to subdue Kebbi at Watarmasa led by Askia Mohammad Benkan where they were handily defeated and forced to flee with Kebbi in hot pursuit, the Askia barely escaped with his life. This crushing defeat contributed to the fall of the Songhai Empire. Soon the empire was overrun by the Moroccans and were no match for their advanced muskets and cannons.  Expedition in Bornu and Other Conquests  Kanta Kotal was said to have conquered other states in the region including Nupe and Zabarma and the influence of the king reached further down south. In 1545, Kebbi defeated the Mai of Bornu's Army. Bornu came to the aid of Agadez after signing peace treaties but was forced to flee to Unguru where they lost seven battles against Kebbi.  Defeating the Moors  The Moroccans attempted to overrun the Hausa States through the west but were defeated by Kebbi.  Personal life  While Kotal Kanta had multiple concubines, it is said he had just one wife who was of unrivaled beauty.  Death  Muhammad Kanta Kotal died from a poisoned arrow after he was attacked by some guerrillas in Dugul, Katsina on his way back from the expedition in Bornu. He died in Jirwa, Katsina but was taken home and buried in Surame. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammadu, during whose rule the kingdom experienced a fast decline.due to his less adventurous nature and the rise of its neighbors including Zazzau and Kano. Kebbi would however continue to dominate Gobir, Zamfara and Agadez until the 18th century when an alliance between the States broke Kebbi's authority over them.

Background  Barbushe was the son of Buzame, who was the son of Garageje, who was one of the four sons of Dala. Dala was one of the first settlers around Dala Hill who came after the blacksmith, Kano, found iron ore and fertile land there. Dala is responsible for the refinement of the pagan religion, using his extensive knowledge of cultures and religions around the world to create a more sophisticated form of idol worship, which was heavily laced with middle eastern lore. The city of Dala and the Dala Hill are named after him.  Description  Barbushe was said to be a man of enormous stature. He was exceptionally strong and a skilled hunter who would kill elephants with his stick and carry them on his back for miles.  Chief Priest of Tsumburbura  \\"Great father of Jimuna, we have come nigh to thy dwelling in supplication, Tsumburbura...Look on Tsumburbura, ye men of Kano ! Look toward Dala...I am the heir of Dala, like it or not, follow me ye must, perforce\\" - Barbushe Barbushe was said to have attained his knowledge of pagan rites and of the pagan god Tsumburbura from his forefathers. Barbushe soon emerged as the most skilled sorcerer among the pagans as his power and knowledge of the secrets of tsumburbura was unrivaled. Other pagans including lesser priests came to look to him for guidance and he became their leader. Tsumburbura was said to live in the Jakara River (known as \\"the black river\\" due to its color). The shrine of Tsumburbura was built around a baobab tree called \\"Shamus\\". Shamus was said to be perpetually still unless trouble was brewing in the land when it would shriek and smoke would emanate from the Jakara river. The pagans would then sacrifice an animal and if the smoking and shrieking stopped, trouble was averted but if it didn't, the trouble would reach them. The Shamus was guarded by a man called \\"Mai Tsumburbura\\". Only Barbushe was allowed to enter and any other man who trespassed died. Barbushe lived on Dala Hill and never came down save for two days that coincided with Islamic Eid. When these days approached people from all over the land would gather at the feet of the hill and bring their offerings as sacrifices. These offerings included black he-goats, black fowls and black dogs. In the dark of the night, Barbushe would descend with drummers and lead the people to their god where they would sacrifice their offerings. The pagans would then dance around the shrine naked, reciting incantations until dawn and then they would eat. Barbushe would then tell the people prophecies of what's to come in the coming year.  The Lesser Chiefs  Barbushe had other chiefs including Gunzago, Gagiwa, Gubanasu, Doje, Janbere, Gamakura, Hangogo, Safatoro, Gartsangi, Bardoje, Kafantau, Nisau, Jandamisa and Jigira. The most prominent among these was Jandamisa who was the leader of the Rumawa, a clan who claim descent from the Byzantine Empire.  Barbushe's Great Prophecy and the Arrival of Bagauda  \\"A man shall come to this land with an army, and gain mastery over us, you will see him in the sacred place of Tsumburbura, if he comes not in your time, assuredly he will come in the time of your children, and will conquer all in this country, and forget you and yours and exalt himself and his people for years to come\\". Barbushe's most famous prophecy spoke of a man who would come with an army and conquer them. Barbushe warned that this man will burn their sacred three, build a mosque and his people would gain dominion over them for years. When the pagans asked him how they could avert this, Barbushe responded \\"There is no cure but resignation\\". The prophecy came to fruition as not long after that, Bagauda and his people soon arrived in Kano, though its uncertain whether it was Bagauda himself or his grandson Gijimasu who first reached the people of Barbushe, it's commonly accepted that it was Bagauda. It is said that when he reached Dala hill, only a few of the priest's acolyte's were still alive and Barbushe himself was dead. Barbushe's disciples quickly deduced that the prophecy had come true. Janbere remembering the words of his chief swore that if the people allowed these men into their land they would control their destinies until they lose their identity but the people ignored his warning, wondering where Bagauda would find the strength to conquer them. Bagauda soon after waged war on the people and killed the leader of the pagans, giving birth to the kingdom of Kano in 999 CE. The Bagauda Dynasty would rule Kano for 808 years and lasted until 1807 CE.

His date of birth is uncertain with some sources pointing to 1481 and 1484, but others centering on 1491 or 1492. √ìlafur grew up in H√≥lar, studied in Bergen, Norway, and became a priest around 1517. Shortly afterwards he was granted a post at Vesturh√≥psh√≥lar before serving in H√∫na√æing from 1527 to 1532. The Reformation After 1532, √ìlafur came to the H√≥lar Cathedral where he gained the esteem of Bishop J√≥n Arason. He was one of the three men who were tasked by J√≥n to travel to Denmark in 1542 negotiate before King Christian III whether Iceland would remain Catholic or become Lutheran. During his stay in Copenhagen, √ìlafur was swayed for the Reformation but he did not break with the Catholic leader J√≥n initially. Over the years, √ìlafur became more disenchanted with the Catholic Church and more outspoken in favor of Luther's teaching, causing J√≥n to banish him in 1549. √ìlafur fled to Copenhagen and received the approval of the king to return to Iceland in 1551 to assume the role of bishop of H√≥lar, a position he held until his death in 1569. As the first Lutheran bishop, √ìlafur focused on training priests in the new order of service and tenants of Lutheranism. To this end, he continued H√≥lar's printing activities, publishing several books including translations of several hymns into Icelandic.

Early life  Muhammad was the son of Tsamiya and Maganarku. After the betrayal and subsequent murder of his father by his uncle Usman Zamnagawa, his uncle tried to bed Maganarku but she told him she was pregnant. Zamnagawa then gave her herbs to abort the baby without her consent. She however still gave birth to a healthy child. This was how he earned the epithet \\"Bugaya\\". This would put his year of birth between 1343 and 1344.  Life as Sultan  Bugaya came to power in 1385 after the death of his brother, Yaji I. Bugaya was said to have sent the Maguzawa from Fongui Rock and compelled them to disperse across the sultanate. Bugaya's reign was filled with peace and tranquility, most likely profiting from the reputation of his late older brother. Jizya was paid regularly throughout the sultanate and he enjoyed no rebellion. This allowed him to retire to a peaceful life after transferring all his royal duties to his Galadima (Administrator).  Death  Bugaya died in 1390 after ruling for five years. His body then washed and prepared in accordance with Islamic rites by Lawal, Jigawa, Turbana and Kusuba on the orders of Liman Madatai who prayed over his body.

After which she was renamed UC-1 and used as a school boat for the Kriegsmarine before she was deemed unsuited for reserve training and was broken up in 1942.  Construction  The HNoMS B-5 was laid down in December 1925 at the Horten Navy Yard in Oslo, Norway. She was launched on 17 June 1929 and commissioned on 1 October 1929 under the command of Kommand√∏r Y. Brekke. When she was completed, the submarine was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She was assessed at submerged. The submarine was powered by two Sulzer diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced and two electric engines producing a total of for use while submerged. The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of when submerged, the Submarine could operate for at and when surfaced, she could travel at . The submarine was fitted with two torpedo tubes at the bow and two at the stern holding four torpedoes with two as reserve. The boat had a complement of 23 men.  Operation Weser√ºbung and Capture  HNoMS B-5 was part of the Norwegian naval forces at Kristiansand which consisted of her along with her sister ships in the 2nd Submarine Division HNoMS B-2 and HNoMS B-4. The 3rd Torpedo boat Division consisting of the old torpedo boats HNoMS Jo, HNoMS Grib, HNoMS Lom, HNoMS Ravn and HNoMS √òrn, along with the 2nd Torpedo boat Division consisting of the old torpedo boats HNoMS Skarv, HNoMS Teist and the modern torpedo boat HNoMS Kjell. The 10th Auxiliary Division consisting of the auxiliary patrol vessels HNoMS Kvik, HNoMS Blink and HNoMS Lyn as well as the 11th Auxiliary Division made up of the auxiliary patrol vessels HNoMS Willaim Barents, HNoMS Firern, HNoMS Lyngdal, HNoMS Hval IV, HNoMS Hval VI and HNoMS Hval VII. The Sleipner-class destroyers HNoMS Odin and HNoMS Gyller were also present in the harbor at the time. The commanding officer at Kristiansand was Kommand√∏r Severin Edward Wigers. HNoMS Odin in 1939 On the morning of 9 April 1940, German troops invaded Denmark and Norway under the code name Operation Weser√ºbung. A German invasion force named landing force number four consisting of the German light cruiser Karlsruhe (which served as a troop transport for 1,000 soldiers), an E-boat tender along with six other E-boats and four large torpedo boats including Luchs, Greif and Seeadler, which had left Bremerhaven, Germany on April 8, were tasked to capture Kristiansand. The invasion force could only attempt to enter the harbor in the morning of April 9 because there had been a heavy fog obscuring the city the previous day which would have made the passage into the fjord and therefore the harbor too dangerous.Williamson, p. 20 HNoMS Gyller in May 1953 When the invasion force led by the German light cruiser Karlsruhe finally entered the fjord at 5 am, they immediately came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns stationed at Odder√∏ya Fortress. The sound of the first attack alarmed the Sleipner-class destroyers HNoMS Odin and HNoMS Gyller both of which sprung into action with HNoMS Odin steaming out into the Toppdalsfjord to open up fire against the newly attacking Luftwaffe bombers (which were targeting the fortress and the civilian neighborhoods of the city) with her Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and two 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine guns while HNoMS Gyller joined in on the defense against the Luftwaffe attack with her single Bofors 40 mm gun and two Colt 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine guns. Both ships managed to evade the bombs dropped from the German aircraft but weren't able to shoot down any planes, only damaging a couple.Berg 1997: 19 Karlsruhe in 1931 Karlsruhe however hadn't just sat idly by either as when the barrage against her was launched from the Odder√∏ya Fortress, she turned in the fjord in order to bring her full broadside into the action. At about 07.30 am a twin-engined aircraft attacked the interned German submarine U-21 which was docked in Kristiansand harbor after having been seized by Norwegian warships for neutrality violations on 27 March 1940 after it had run aground on the Oddene shallows near Mandal. HNoMS Odin opened fire at the aircraft which was suspected to be part of the previous Luftwaffe attack. However it was quickly discovered that the aircraft was instead a RAF Lockheed Hudson reconnaissance aircraft, HNoMS Odin immediately ceased fire after it had luckily yet succeeded in hitting the aircraft.Williamson, p. 21 Meanwhile, the German invasion force had been in an artillery duel with the Odder√∏ya Fortress for nearly two hours with the Norwegians being able to repel two of their breakthrough attempts until a heavy fog covered the harbor just like the day before, forcing both sides to cease fire. During the ceasefire, the Norwegian commander received message in Norwegian code ordering him not to fire at any British or French forces in response to the previous incident with HNoMS Odin. It also stated that French destroyers were coming to the aid of the stricken Norwegian force at Kristiansand. These orders were relayed to the Norwegian forces at 10 am while HNoMS Gyller, after having received an orientation on the situation from the commander of the Odder√∏ya Fortress, steamed out to the harbor entrance and swung out her torpedo tubes in order to greet any incoming intruders with a single ticket to the bottom of the fjord. However, when the order of the Norwegian commander was received, confusion spread through the ranks of the defenders as when the fog cleared, there was uncertainty over which flags were flown by the intruding warships. The defenders at the Odder√∏ya Fortress even confused one of the signal flags for the French flag which meant that the guns from the fortress went silent, not risking firing at their allies again. The Norwegian defenders ended up letting the German force enter the harbor unopposed on their third attempt and land their troops in Kristiansand at 10.30 am. A naval signal flag which could have been mistaken as the French flag HNoMS Gyller had in the meantime returned to the harbor and was docked at Tollbodbrygga wharf in order to refill her water tanks for an upcoming battle, instead she was captured there by German forces without a fight. Kristiansand surrendered at 5 pm that same day along with all defending Norwegian forces. All vessels of the Norwegian naval force stationed in Kristiansand surrendered on 11 April 1940 at Marvika naval station including HNoMS Odin and HNoMS B-5 which had been captured by a German E-boat two days earlier without seeing action at the defense of Kristiansand.Knut M√¶sel: Kristiansand i krig F√¶drelandsvennen, Kristiansand, 1995  Kriegsmarine Career and End  After her capture, HNoMS B-5 was brought to Fisk√• and renamed UC-1 on 20 November 1940. After her renaming, HNoMS B-5 was modified to be used as a school boat (U-Abwehrschule) for the German Kriegsmarine in Gotenhafen. Her modification was completed in June 1940 and remained in service until 28 March 1942 when she was ultimately deemed unsuited for reserve training and was broken up later that same year.

Biography According to the Therigatha commentary, Dabba's mother died during his birth and he was found alive on her funeral pyre as an infant. His family lived in the kingdom of the Mallas (possibly in Kusinara). When the Buddha visited the Malla country, Dabba asked to be presented before him by his grandmother, and sought ordination. He was accepted into the order, and was said to have achieved the status of an arahant in the ordination hall. Wanting to be of service, Dabba is depicted in the Vinaya Pitaka as having volunteered for a number of duties relating to distributing goods and living quarters to the assembly of monks. As a result, he was recognized among the Buddha's disciples as being foremost in service. Conflicts between Dabba and followers of the monks Mettiya and BhummajakƒÅ resulted in episodes where Dabba was accused of misdeeds but later exonerated. ApadƒÅna stories in canonical and commentarial literature attributed these occurrences to Dabba having slandered an arahant in a previous life. The UdƒÅna describes Dabba's death.

The article, \\"Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now\\", in which he presented a model for the future of the pandemic, arguing the virus was spreading exponentially and was a more immediate threat than most realized, was read over 40 million times in the first month. His subsequent viral article, \\"The Hammer and the Dance\\", read over 20 million times, described a comprehensive strategy for how societies needed to respond to the onset of COVID-19 with the \\"hammer\\" referring to widespread lockdowns and other strict initial social distancing measures needed to contain the spread of the virus, and the \\"dance\\" describing the more nuanced, long-term effort to control localized outbreaks around the world until a vaccine is widely distributed. Pueyo continued writing articles on the COVID-19 pandemic, including ‚ÄúCoronavirus: Out of Many, One‚Äù focused on the situation in the USA, ‚ÄúShould We Follow the Herd Immunity Strategy like Sweden‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLearning How to Dance‚Äù. The articles have been described as white papers on the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the success of the article series, Pueyo was quoted by thousands of newspapers, including Thomas Friedman on the New York Times, and invited to appear on several English-language and Spanish-language television programs to discuss them, including CNN with Anderson Cooper. In addition to writing, Pueyo serves as a vice president for Course Hero, an online education platform. Previously, he held roles at L'Or√©al, Siemens, Zynga and several Silicon Valley startup companies. Pueyo published his first book, The Star Wars Rings, and gave a TEDx talk about storytelling and psychology in December 2017.

The combs of the pecten organ have 14 to 17 teeth in both sexes. The chela, femora, and patella of the pedipalps are narrower and longer in the males than in the females. The surfaces of the chelae are uneven, but without pronounced granules and keels. The telson is hairy and spherical, with a poison bladder that is longer than the stinger. Distribution and habitat Heterometrus bengalensis originates from the Indian states of West Bengal and Odisha. This species lives in dry areas, preferably on the edges of ditches, on which thicker vegetation with shrubs provides ideal shade and cover. Older distribution data, including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya and Maharashtra, may be based on confusion with other species of the genus Heterometrus Venom The venom of this species has been subject to cancer study.

It was first published on the eponymous album from 1971, which was certified gold. Calling for an armed uprising against the French, the song quickly became an anthem in Brittany and popular in all of France.  Song  The song is a rhymed seven- syllable laisse. The ermine from the title was the heraldic animal of the Duchy of Brittany, a sovereign feudal state. The lyrics are about a villager who meets \\"a band of sailors, workers and peasants\\" who are going to ambush the \\"Franks\\" and win their freedom. He joins them and sings about the plight of his wife, visiting her and children in secret during the war, and possibly dying for his homeland. The chorus mentions the fortresses of Foug√®res and Clisson, which seems to point to the feudal wars of the Bretons against the French at the border of the duchy. However, the rebels' \\"charged guns\\" indicate a more recent past; therefore, the only plausible period is believed to be the Chouannerie war of the French Revolution, popularized by La Villemarqu√© in Barzaz Breiz.For example, in the poems Ar re c'hlaz or Ar chouanted. See also: Fran√ßois Cadic, Chants de Chouans, Slatkine, 1949. The song is often found in collections dedicated to the Chouans, the War in the Vend√©e, and the Legitimists, but also in general collections of military songs.  Background  Servat wrote the song in 1970, at the age of 25, while living in Paris.¬´ La blanche hermine ¬ª, DVD Nuit Celtique 2002 (Stade de France) The day before, he had heard an Irish song about the departure of a guerilla fighter with a bullet in his pocket.St√©phane Grammont, ¬´√Ä travers chants: 20 chansons avec de la Bretagne dedans¬ª, France 3 Bretagne, 27 July 2015 That same evening, he sang it for the first time at Ti Jos, a Breton restaurant at Montparnasse, where he made a living by begging.St√©phane Guih√©neuf, Brodeuses. Dans les pas de Gilles Servat, Le T√©l√©gramme, 10 July 2015 The words and the protest energy of the song made a big impression on the Bretons, which surprised the artist himself. After the protests of May 68, Brittany had gone through an identity crisis and an economic transition. Servat wrote the warrior song to make the Bretons aware of their plight and inspire an uprising:  Bibliography in French  * Daniel Chatelain and Pierre Tafini, Qu'est ce qui fait courir les autonomistes ?, Stock, 1976 * Erwan Chartier, Gilles Servat.

About and Demographics Saraz is a rural area, located on right bank of Chenab river which includes its district headquarter Doda district. The areas on the left bank of river are geographically located in Bhaderwah area. Saraz is a large area, known for Sarazi dialect spoken here. It includes various villages such as Rajgarh, Ganika, Bhagwah, Dessa, Kashtigarh, Koti, Bhangra, Bijarani, Mahalla, Kulhand, Malwana, Jodhpur, Babor, Jatheli, Bharat and Udayanpur. The major native language of the region is Sarazi. It is widely used as a lingua franca alongside Hindi/Urdu, but as a first language it is primarily associated with the Hindus. Most Muslims are speakers of Kashmiri; there are also Muslim communities who speak Sarazi, Gojri or Watali, but many of these have been shifting to Kashmiri in recent generation, and even those who preserve their native language still acquire Kashmiri as a second language. A minority of people also know Dogri. The languages of administration and education are Urdu and English. History In the past, Doda was largely inhabited by Sarazi population before people started settling there from Kashmir and other adjoining areas. The reasons for Kashmiri population settling in Saraz during the 17th and 18th centuries is a matter on which historians disagree. However Sumantra Bose says it was repression by feudal class that drew people to the district of Doda, Ramban and Kishtwar. The northern side of Doda district borders with the erstwhile Anantnag district of the Kashmir region. People often migrated from Kashmir to Saraz area whenever there were famines in Kashmir.

The wildly popular book netted Millett approximately $30,000 in earnings. One year later, in 1971, Millett (along with future wife, photojournalist Sophie Keir) bought 10 acres of land and buildings in LaGrange, New York, a small town in Dutchess County, New York and close to Poughkeepsie. The pair began restoring the property's fields and buildings. In 1978, the Women's Art Colony was established, financed by selling Christmas trees. Women applied to work at The Farm, also paying a small fee for food, in exchange for room, board and studio space. The Farm was also a space for feminist discussion. The New York Times described The Farm as: > \\"a utopian women‚Äôs arts colony, and where bare-breasted women grew Christmas > trees that Ms. Millett would sell on the Bowery each December. In the early > days, said Linda Clarke, an old friend, neighbors would complain about the > nudity and call the police, until Ms. Millett won them over.\\" In 2012, The Farm was registered as a non-profit organization, and was renamed the Millett Center for the Arts.  Awards  In 2012, Millett won a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts to, in-part, create an archive of The Farm.  Legacy  Sisters of Jam, an artists collective based in Stockholm, Sweden, created a book based on The Farm, called A Piece of Land, The collective was invited to stay at The Farm in 2010, by Millett. The book includes photographs by Michelle Koals and Jane Winter, past residents of The Farm, as well as archival artifacts.

Besides her website and app, Miller uses social media sites like Instagram and Twitter to engage her readers. Her website is free for viewing but her complete readings require a subscription. She is a regular columnist for various magazines including InStyle and Vogue. Her website had 310 million views in 2018. A significant part of her subscribers comprises the younger millennial generation. She is especially popular in the UK with the Guardian saying, \\"[for any millennial], she is the queen of fortune telling, single- handedly responsible for fuelling their obsession with all things celestial. Somehow she has managed to turn the mystical, ancient pseudo-science of astrology into a world-wide phenomenon\\". Miller has a celebrity following which further increased her general popularity. They include Cameron Diaz, Justin Theroux, Pharrell Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Lindsay Lohan, Katy Perry, and Alexa Chung. She is renowned in the fashion industry and various people from it appreciated her work including Glenn O'Brien, Cynthia Rowley, Bevy Smith, Gloria Vanderbilt and Mickey Boardman. Despite focusing mainly on personal horoscopes, Miller has attempted predicting national events. She was wrong about Donald Trump losing the 2016 US elections and Hillary Clinton's email controversy not impeding her campaign but right about Barack Obama's 2012 re-election. Her official stance on astrology is that \\"[it] can give her insight into the circumstances of the future, but not necessarily the outcome.\\" On this, Gabrielle Bluestone from the New York Times, wrote that her forecasts are \\"kindly advice on living what she deems a 'wholesome life'\\"; adding that \\"No matter what happens, she reassures her followers each month, you‚Äôre going to be fine, and if you‚Äôre not, here are some ways to cope.\\" Bluestone further compares her appeal to that of a mental health counselor who uses astrology instead of the DSM-5. After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Miller received backlash from some of her followers for prediction earlier in January, saying 2020 would \\"be a great year, and it will be a prosperous year\\". Miller was born in the late 1950s. Miller was homeschooled and her mother taught her astrology. She graduated with an MA in business from the New York University. She initially used to work as a photography agent. She began writing horoscopes for Time Warner in the 1990s. She lives in Upper East Side, Manhattan, and has two daughters, Diana and Chrissie. Diana works in talk-show host James Corden's \\"Carpool Karaoke\\" series and Chrissie works for the company Warby Parker. Miller suffers from chronic illnesses that she had since she was fourteen.

The legal basis for it is the Energy Taxation Directive (2003/96/EG) of 27 October 2003,Official long title: 'Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003, restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity'. Published in the Official Journal of the European Union no. L 283, 51 on 31 October 2003. which proves the member states with the option of introducing a tax on turbine fuel for commercial domestic flights and flights between member states. However, as of 2018, commercial kerosene consumption is currently tax exempt under the legislation of all member states of the European Union ‚Äì with the exception of the Netherlands.  Importance of kerosene  Jet engines using kerosene fuel rapidly developed after 1950.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"kerosine\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. Wide-body aircraft and almost all helicopters fly with a turbine drive, all turbines are operated with kerosene of different specifications. The majority of modern passenger and freight air traffic as well as military flights take place in this way. Small planes, meaning almost all model planes, motor gliders, private planes with typically 1 to 5 seats, almost all aerobatic and racing machines, as well as very small helicopters, usually fly with a piston engine. Almost all piston engines have carburettors, for which they rely on carburetor fuels, which is mostly avgas (aviation gasoline). In the case of hot air balloons, the LTA (Lighter than Air) flight, that is the balloon flight, generates lift by burning propane or butane, usually without a separate drive with the wind hazards.  Benefits for commercial aviation = International agreements on kerosene tax exemption  Tank truck at Schiphol Airport. Refueling can be taxed throughout the EU. In Article 24 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 7 December 1944, on the basis of which the UN aviation organisation ICAO was founded, it has been agreed that when flying from one contracting state to another, the kerosene that is already on board aircraft may not be taxed by the state where the aircraft lands, nor by a state through whose airspace the aircraft has flown. However, there is no tax regulation in the Chicago Convention to refuel the aircraft before departure. This was intended to promote aviation, reconstruction and the global economy after the end of World War II. In addition to the Chicago Convention, there are numerous bilateral agreements, so-called 'Air Services Agreements', which make more extensive agreements, including often tax exemption when refueling an aircraft that has come from another contracting state. The Chicago Convention does not preclude a kerosene tax on domestic flights and on refueling before international flights. The EU Energy Taxation Directive also allows Member States to lift the tax exemption on domestic flights and flights between Member States who conclude a separate agreement to that effect. The Directive stipulates in Article 14 (b) that 'Member States shall exempt from taxation (...) energy products supplied for use as fuel for the purpose of air navigation other than in private pleasure-flying', but also that 'Member States may limit the scope of this exemption to supplies of jet fuel (CN code 2710 19 21)'. In paragraph ¬ß3 of the directive's preamble, it adds as commentary: 'Existing international obligations and the maintaining of the competitive position of Community companies make it advisable to continue the exemptions of energy products supplied for air navigation and sea navigation, other than for private pleasure purposes, while it should be possible for Member States to limit these exemptions.'  Criticism of the kerosene tax exemption  Environmental organisations are increasingly criticising the continuing tax exemption in view of the negative environmental impact of aviation. The German Environment Agency emphasises that a lack of kerosene taxation reduces incentives to airlines to use more fuel-efficient aircraft. For this reason, the governmental organisation classifies the missing kerosene tax as environmentally harmful subsidy, which in 2012 alone amounted to 7.083 billion euros in Germany. This sum corresponds to the tax loss due to the exemption of civil aviation from the energy tax. Umweltsch√§dliche Subventionen in Deutschland. German Environment Agency, December 2016, p. 44. Retrieved 2 July 2017. According to Greenpeace, air traffic in Switzerland is subsidised with CHF 1.7 billion annually because airlines do not pay fuel taxes. Critics of the lack of kerosene taxation point not only to global warming due to carbon dioxide emissions, but also to other aviation emissions such as nitrogen oxide, particulate pollution, water vapor and contrail formation. Since the exhaust gases are emitted at high altitudes, the effects are serious. These other pollutants increase the damage caused by aviation in the atmosphere by a factor of two to four, as the German non-profit organisation Atmosfair has calculated. The introduction of a state tax on turbine fuel is being supported by environmental protection and transport associations and European railway companies either at national or European level with reference to an improved fair competition between modes of transportation and a consistent pricing of environmental externalities in the tariffs of air traffic. Environmental organisations like the Verkehrsclub Deutschland see an air passenger tax as a step in the right direction to remove the significant distortions of competition, but the goal must still be the taxation of kerosene.Luftverkehrssteer : Ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung vcd.org, Retrieved 6 February 2020.  Efforts to introduce kerosene taxation  Under EU law, it has been possible to tax kerosene nationally and between Member States since 2005. As of August 2019, only the Netherlands (in 2005) and Norway have already followed this path in Europe; in all other European countries, commercial kerosene consumption is tax-free.Kerosinsteuer: Notwendig und machbar, VCD.org, Retrieved 25 August 2019.  EU: European citizens' initiative to end tax exemption on kerosene  A European citizens' initiative ran from 10 May 2019 to 10 May 2020 with the aim of ending the existing tax exemption on kerosene. In order to be successful, a European Citizens' Initiative must receive a total of one million statements of support, of which a minimum number in at least seven countries. By 25 August 2019, after around 27% of the term of the citizens' initiative, a total of 47,214 EU citizens (4.7% of the required minimum participation) had signed it; 33.15% of the required participation was already achieved in Belgium, 26.79% in Germany, 21.15% in Sweden, 15.63% in Austria and 12.25% in the Netherlands. However, after the deadline, the initiative had received only 74,122 supporters of the required 1 million, with no member state passing its threshold (Finland came closest at 73.98%).European citizens' initiative ‚Äì Ending the aviation fuel tax exemption in Europe Button \\"View all countries\\", 20 June 2020.

EU institutional efforts  Frans Timmermans: 'I'm personally a proponent of a kerosene tax.' The French government wanted to propose a Europe-wide flight tax at the meeting of EU transport ministers on 6 June 2019 in Luxembourg. This tax could be added to airline tickets and kerosene, or levied through changes in EU emissions trading.Frankreich will europaweite Flugsteuer vorschlagen orf.at, 6 June 2019. Retrieved 6 June 2019. However, since taxation restricted to the EU area jeopardizes the competitiveness of the airlines concerned, because airlines from third countries could then enter the market all the more with cheap tickets, the proposal was not implemented and the topic would remain \\"on the agenda\\" for global discussion. In November 2019, the Finance Ministers of Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden presented a joint statement calling on the European Commission, more specifically European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans, to introduce EU-wide taxes on aviation so as to charge the entire aviation industry more for its emissions and pollution, and put all member states on level pegging. Citing the fact that aviation causes around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, the Ministers proposed both uniform air passenger taxes as well as kerosene taxes (both excise duties and VAT).  Austria  Aviation gasoline refueled in Austria (avgas 100LL, gasoline for piston engines) is subject to mineral oil tax and VAT. The same goes for different mineral oil tax rates are also automotive fuels, such as diesel and petrol. The mineral oil tax rate (per litre) is the highest on petrol, slightly lower on diesel (although its density, carbon and therefore energy content is significantly higher) and even much lower on heating oil EL (industrial gasoil), which is similar to diesel, much less, which is why heating oil is coloured red and its use in vehicles is strictly prohibited. The vast majority of the refueled aviation fuel is kerosene (Jet A1, turbine fuel). No petroleum tax, VAT or any other energy tax is payable for refueling kerosene for international flights. After an increase of around 12% compared to the previous year, a good 1 billion litres = 1 million cubic metres of kerosene were refueled in Austria in 2018Kerosinverbrauch steigt, bleibt aber steuerbefreit sn.at, 26 March 2019, retrieved 9 April 2020. ‚Äì mostly for international flights. This corresponds to a consumption of around 120 litres of kerosene per person per year. At least 0.3 percent by mass of the sulfur that is harmful to nature and buildings may still be contained in kerosene (as of June 2011).Jet_A1 total.fr, retrieved 9 April 2020. In heating oil this is only 0.1%, in diesel only 0.001%. If the state were to collect roughly 0.60 euros of mineral oil and value-added tax per litre of kerosene, as in the case of motor vehicle fuel, that would have made a good 600 million euros in tax revenue in 2018. In Austria, as of July 2019, the introduction of a kerosene tax would have a clear majority in society, as a survey showed 73% of Austrians supported such a special tax.Drei von vier sind f√ºr Klima-Steuer auf Fl√ºge, heute.at O√ñ, 15 July 2019.

Amongst political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ), The Greens ‚Äì The Green Alternative (GR√úNE) and NEOS ‚Äì The New Austria and Liberal Forum are in favour of the introduction of a special tax on aviation fuel, the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ) is opposed to it, while the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP) is internally divided on the question.  Germany  According to the 2006 German Energy Tax Act (Energiesteuergesetz), kerosene (Jet A-1) ‚Äì and also aviation gasoline (avgas) ‚Äì for the commercial transportation of people or things by airlines is free of energy taxation.  Netherlands  Margreeth de Boer: 'A tax on kerosene is an absolute must.' Dutch Environment Minister Margreeth de Boer announced plans to introduce an excise duty on kerosene in April 1995: 'A tax on kerosene is an absolute must, flying should become much more expensive, especially within Europe,' she stated during a debate on sustainability in Amsterdam. In March 1998, Minister de Boer managed to convince all EU15 Member States that an excise on kerosene had to be introduced; however, its introduction was deemed to need to happen simultaneously around the world, a proposition heavily opposed by the United States. De Boer rejected the aviation industry's argument that airlines might try to refuel their aircraft outside the EU if an EU-wide kerosene tax was levied. In September 1998, environmental organisations Milieudefensie and Natuur & Milieu criticised the fact that, despite widespread support for it, neither a kerosene excise nor a value-added tax on tickets had yet been introduced; kerosene still only cost 0.35 Dutch guilders per litre, one of the lowest rates in Europe. The formation of a left-wing government in Germany in November 1998 made Finance Secretary Willem Vermeend optimistic about ending the kerosene tax exemption within the EU. But Natuur & Milieu was worried international treaties on aviation would preclude such taxation of kerosene, proposing to tax the emission of polluting gases instead; it calculated that levying 0.5 ECUs (1.1 guiders) per litre would make tickets about 15‚Äì20% more expensive. The Transport Ministry had calculated in 1995 that 12% VAT plus a 0.5 ECU excise would decrease the amount of flight kilometres travelled by 12%, leading especially tourists to forego flying and take the train instead. The Netherlands introduced excise duties on kerosene in 2005 for all commercial domestic flights and all domestic and international pleasure- flying, including non-commercial business flights. In anticipation to its introduction, the Second Balkenende cabinet in September 2004 proposed to levy higher excise duties on kerosene for domestic flights; this was estimated to bring in an extra 14 million euros in revenue. In November 2005, MP Boris van der Ham proposed to levy kerosene excises on flights between the Netherlands and Germany, because both countries already had similar kerosene excises for domestic flights; Environment Secretary Pieter van Geel said he would consider it. On 20 December 2007, an open letter in Trouw written by MPs and backed by a parliamentary majority called on Finance Minister Wouter Bos and Finance Secretary Jan Kees de Jager to convince other European governments to also introduce more aviation taxes such as excises on kerosene to mitigate aviation's environmental impact; by that time, the Netherlands already had a domestic kerosene excise and planned to introduce a ticket tax on passengers on 1 July 2008. In 2011, the Netherlands had an excise duty of 0.42 euro per litre kerosene for all domestic commercial flights and all domestic and international pleasure-flying, including non-commercial business flights. Pleasure-flying excises were increased to 0.43 euros per litre in 2010, 0.44 in 2013 and 0.48 in 2014, while commercial domestic excises were abolished in 2012. In March 2019, Finance Secretary Menno Snel stated that commercial domestic excises (which were levied from 2005 to 2011) were abolished in 2012 'because of complications in implementation and a low revenue yield'. He proposed to revise the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive to introduce an EU-wide uniform kerosene tax rather than 'a patchwork of bilateral regulations within the EU' (as stipulated in Article 14.2 of the Directive). Snel said that airlines from non-EU countries could be exempt from the tax as long as 'a humble threshold (de minimis) is introduced, because the number of intra-EU flights operated by third-country airlines is very limited.'

The unit was mustered into Confederate service on August 31, 1862, although many of the men recruited for the regiment had already seen action at the Battle of Lone Jack. On December 7, the regiment fought at the Battle of Prairie Grove, where the regiment helped defeat Colonel William A. Weer's brigade. Prairie Grove was a Confederate defeat, and the 11th Missouri Infantry retreated into southern Arkansas. Later, the unit began moving against the garrison of Helena, Arkansas. On July 4, 1863, the regiment penetrated the Union works at the Battle of Helena, although its brigade was soon isolated and defeated. Afterwards, the regiment transferred to Little Rock, where it built fortifications. Union troops then outflanked the city's defenses, leading the Confederates to abandon the position. In 1864, the regiment moved to Louisiana as a response to the Red River campaign. On April 9, the 11th Missouri Infantry fought at the Battle of Pleasant Hill before returning to Arkansas. On April 30, the unit was part of a Confederate attack at the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry, although the charge was repulsed despite initial success. The unit was not heavily engaged after Jenkins' Ferry, and the men of the regiment were paroled on June 8, 1865. Organization During the summer of 1862, DeWitt C. Hunter had attempted to recruit men from the Missouri State Guard to join a new regiment, which would be part of the Confederate States Army. However, Hunter was not able to recruit enough men to form a full regiment. Hunter, who had been recruiting near Van Buren, Arkansas, joined a group of recruiters who were heading into Missouri. In August, the group made a camp in the vicinity of Lone Jack, Missouri. On August 16, Hunter's force engaged a Union column commanded by Major Emory S. Foster as part of the Battle of Lone Jack. After a five-hour battle, the Union forces were defeated and forced to withdraw. Foster was severely wounded and captured. In the battle, Hunter's recruits suffered at least 13 casualties. However, Union troops began to concentrate in the area after the battle, and the Confederates retreated back to Arkansas. On August 31, Hunter mustered his recruits into an organized unit as a battalion. More recruits were assigned to the unit, which was upgraded to a regiment and assigned to Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons' brigade. The unit's company organization as of August 31 was: * Company A: Jasper County and Lawrence County. * Company B: Barry County. * Company C: Barry County. * Company D: Benton County and Hickory County. * Company E: Cedar County and Vernon County. * Company F: Lawrence County. * Company G: Cedar County and Polk County. * Company H: Buchanan County, Platte County, and Ray County. * Company I: Cass County. * Company K: Cass County, Greene County, Jasper County, and Newton County. Hunter was the regiment's first colonel, Simon P. Burns was the original lieutenant colonel, and Thomas H. Murray was the first major. Service history=1862 The Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War By that fall, Union troops were advancing further into Arkansas. In response, Confederate Major General Thomas Hindman prepared to strike the Union column. On December 7, Hunter's Missouri Regiment fought at the Battle of Prairie Grove as part of Parsons' Brigade as part of Hindman's offensive. Early in the fighting, the brigade was aligned in a supporting position on the Confederate left flank. The regiment was second-to-the-left in the brigade alignment; Caldwell's Missouri Regiment was on the brigade's far left. Towards the end of the battle, Parsons' brigade attacked Colonel William A. Weer's Union brigade. Parsons' line was longer than Weer's, and the Confederates were able to turn the flank of Weer's position, forcing the Union men back. Parsons' Brigade then made a second charge, but the alignment of Parsons' Brigade cut Hunter's and Caldwell's Regiments off, preventing them from participating in the second charge, which failed. Hunter's Regiment reported 51 casualties at Prairie Grove. The regiment then fell back to Van Buren, and later to Little Rock, Arkansas. 1863 On February 4, 1863, Colonel Hunter resigned; Burns replaced him as commander of the regiment. On May 3, the regiment was designated as the 8th Missouri Infantry Regiment by Major General Sterling Price. Towards the end of June, the regiment moved towards Helena, Arkansas, as part of a Confederate attempt to capture the Union-held town. During the Battle of Helena on July 4, Parsons' brigade attacked a Union position known as Graveyard Hill. The brigade broke through, but other elements of the Confederate attack were unable to penetrate the Union line. As a result, Union troops were able to concentrate on Parsons' Brigade. After suffering heavy casualties, the brigade retreated from the field; the regiment's total casualty count at Helena was 159 men. After Helena, the regiment fell back to Des Arc, Arkansas and then to Little Rock, where the men built fortifications. In August, Union Major General Frederick Steele threatened the city, moving around the Confederate fortifications to attack at an undefended point. Parsons' Brigade then abandoned the position on September 10 without fighting. After leaving Little Rock, the brigade moved to Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and then to Camden, Arkansas. On December 15, the regiment was renamed as the 11th Missouri Infantry Regiment. 18641865 Map of the Red River campaign In January 1864, the regiment transferred to Spring Hill, Arkansas. On March 24, a new division was formed, and Parsons was assigned to command the division. The division contained two brigades; one of which was commanded by Colonel Burns, the other was commanded by Colonel John Bullock Clark Jr.. The 11th Missouri Infantry was assigned to Burns' Brigade; Lieutenant Colonel Thomas H. Murray replaced Burns as regimental commander. In April, the regiment was sent to support Major General Richard Taylor's force, which was fighting against a Union advance up the Red River. The regiment joined Taylor on April 9 at Pleasant Hill, Louisiana. Later that day, the regiment participated in the Battle of Pleasant Hill. Parsons' division, which was on the right flank of the Confederate line, attacked the Union line. The attack was initially successful, driving in part of the Union line, but a Union counterattack defeated the Confederates, who retreated in some disarray. The 11th Missouri Infantry suffered 49 casualties at Pleasant Hill. After Pleasant Hill, Parsons' Division began moving against Camden, which was held by Steele's Union force. Steele evacuated Camden, and was pursued by the Confederates, who caught up with him on April 30 at the crossing of the Saline River. The 11th Missouri Infantry was in Burns' Brigade along with the 10th Missouri Infantry Regiment, 12th Missouri Infantry Regiment, 16th Missouri Infantry Regiment, Pindall's Missouri Sharpshooter Battalion, and Lesueur's Missouri Battery. At the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on the 30th, Parsons' division arrived at 9:00 a.m., but it took about an hour for the division to fully deploy. Burns' Brigade was aligned on Parsons' left, and Clark's Brigade held the right. When the brigade attacked, it encountered the 33rd Iowa Infantry and the 12th Kansas Infantry Regiments holding a position in some woods. After about half an hour of fighting at very close range, Burns' Brigade was able to outflank the two Union regiments and drive them back. However, Union reinforcements arrived in the form of the 40th Iowa Infantry and the 27th Wisconsin Infantry Regiments. Those two regiments, combined with the survivors of the 33rd Iowa and the 12th Kansas, counterattacked, driving Burns' Brigade from the field. Eventually, Steele's Union force was able to escape across the Saline. At Jenkins' Ferry, the 11th Missouri Infantry suffered 17 casaulties. Jenkins' Ferry was the regiment's last major action. For the rest of the war, the regiment was encamped at various locations in Arkansas and Louisiana before being paroled on June 8, 1865 at Shreveport, Louisiana. After being paroled, the survivors of the regiment were sent back to Missouri via steamboat.

It is set within Buckhorn Wilderness, on land managed by the Olympic National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Buckhorn Mountain, to the southwest. Precipitation runoff from Mount Worthington drains south into the Big Quilcene River, or north into Copper Creek which is a tributary of the Dungeness River. This mountain was first known as Copper Peak, but was renamed by Jack Christensen for the William J. Worthington family, pioneers of nearby Quilcene.Mount Worthington, Summitpost.org Copper was mined in the Tubal Cain mine at the northern base of this mountain in the early 1900s. In the same vicinity of the abandoned mine are the remains of a modified B-17 plane that crashed on January 19, 1952, when returning from a search-and-rescue mission. Climate View from Mount Constance with Mt. Worthington in upper right corner Mount Worthington is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

It was also during this time, that began to give sermons all over Poland, in which he promoted the juxtaposing of enlightenment rationalism with traditional Judaism, a belief which later defined the Peshischa movement. In 1784, he published his first work titled \\"Asara L'me'a\\" () in Warsaw, which received minimal acclaim. However, in 1786, he published his magnum opus titled \\"Eretz Tzvi\\" (), which was an extensive collection of all the sermons he had given. The work was widely received, even getting the approbation from Yechezkel Landau. During his travels throughout Poland, Tzvi Hersh made several important business and religious connections, such as Moshe Auvergir-Kogov, whose daughter, he arranged for his son to marry. Following his son's marriage, both he and his son began to develop an interest in Hassidic Judaism. In his old age, Tzvi Hersh still continued to travel to several communities across Poland. On one of these trips he met with Yisroel Hopstein and asked him to give him a blessing. Hopstein replied stating that \\"You don't need my blessings, you have a son who will rescue you from wherever you are, even from the depths of hell!\\" Tzvi Hersh later died around 1810 in Vodislav.

The term bears many similarities and has been compared to the slang term \\"cuck\\", another term popularly used as an insult for male femininity by online communities. The term is based on the presence of phytoestrogen contained within soybeans, which have led some to conclude that soy products feminize men who consume them.  History  Soy products contain a high amount of phytoestrogen. As it is structurally very similar to estradiol (the major female sex hormone), concerns have been raised that it may act as an endocrine disruptor that adversely affects health. While there is some evidence that phytoestrogens may affect male fertility, \\"further investigation is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn\\". Several review studies have indeed not found any effect of phytoestrogens on sperm quality or testosteron levels. The earliest archived use of the term \\"soyboy\\" as a pejorative on 4chan was submitted to a thread on the /tv/ (television & film) board on April 18, 2017.  Usage  The term is often used as an epithet by internet trolls. It is often targeted at perceived social justice warriors, vegans, and similar groups. At the conclusion of the 2018‚Äì2019 United States federal government shutdown, people on the internet, especially on Twitter, started calling president Donald Trump a soy boy or a cuck. The term has also been used in online debates about the fashion appeal of cargo shorts. The term has also been used by 'racist and anti-semitic groups' to criticize and emasculate liberal men in an attempt to win adherents to their ideology.  Public perception  Mic published an op- ed by writer Chris Caesar titled \\"How 'soy boy' became the alt-right's new favorite insult.\\" Also on October 27, The Daily Dot published an article titled \\"‚ÄòSoy boys‚Äô is the far-right‚Äôs newest favorite insult.\\" See also *Beta male (slang) *Cuckold  References  Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017 Category:2010s slang Category:2020s slang Category:Masculinity Category:Pejorative terms for men ","title":"Soy boy"},{"id":"64299093","text":"Blessed Cecilia Cesarini (1203-1290), also Caecilia, was a Dominican nun. Cecilia, described as \\"a high-spirited young Roman\\", was born into the Cesarini family, a well-established family of the minor nobility. The reason she entered into a religious life is unknown. As part of St. Dominic's reform of monastic life in the 13th century, when Cecilia was 17 years old, her monastery, Santa Maria in Rome, was moved to San Sisto Vecchio, under the Dominican order. She knew St. Dominic personally. She used her family's influence to assist his reforms, urged her prioress to support his cause, and according to tradition, was the first to receive the Dominican habit. Two years later, in 1223 or 1224, she and three other nuns, including Blessed Diana d'Andal√≤ and Blessed Amata, were sent to Bologna to found a new monastery, St. Agnes, where she remained until her death.Butler, Alban (1998). Butler's lives of the saints (8 ed.). Tunbridge Wells, Kent: Burns & Oates. p. 34. . OCLC 33824974. She was the monastery's first prioress, and was reported to be \\"very strict\\". In her late 90s, almost 50 years after Dominic's death, Cecilia was asked by Theodore of Apoldia to record her memories about the early days of the Dominican movement. She dictated to another nun her memories of St. Dominic, including his physical description, several of his miracles, and a spiritual depiction about his \\"deep trust and confidence in God\\". Her account was the \\"only first-hand description\\" of St. Dominic. Cecilia died in 1290. She was buried at St. Agnes with Bl. Diana and Bl. Amata; the three are always associated together. Their relics were transferred several times but always together. They were beatified in 1891. Her feast day is, depending on the source, June 8 or June 9.

Early life Lorenzo T. Durand was born in Morehouseville, New York on December 9, 1849 to parents George H. Durand and Margret McMillan. George was of English descent and Margret was of Scottish descent. In 1858, the family moved to Genesee County, Michigan, where they settled on a farm. In the 1860s, either in 1860 or 1863, the family moved to Saginaw, Michigan. Law study and career Father-in-law John Moore Durand received up to a high school education before becoming a law student in the office of J. Brousseaer for a year. For two years after this, he studied law under the firm Webber & Smith. In 1870, Durand graduated with an LL.B from the University of Michigan and was admitted to the Michigan bar that same year. Durand served as an assistant to Michigan Attorney General Dwight May for several years. In 1870, Durand parented with DeForrest Paine to form the law firm Durand & Paine, which lasted until around 1878, when Durand was elected Saginaw County prosecuting attorney. In this position, he served two terms, returning to private practice in 1882. As legal counsel for the Union Street Railway Company of Saginaw, Durand argued for the company's right to electrify their railways. This became a reality in 1889. By this time, Durand was president of the company. Durand later served as an attorney for the Central Bridge Company of Saginaw and as the president of the Saginaw County Savings Bank. At some point, Durand was a member of the Saginaw County Bar Association, and served as its president. In 1897, Durand was selected as a trustee of the Union Saginaw School District, and later was elected as president of the Saginaw Board of Education. In 1902, Durand served as the Democratic nominee in the Michigan gubernatorial election. Durand was defeated by incumbent Republican governor, Aaron T. Bliss. After Bliss' death, Durand would serve as one of the executors of Bliss' will, and the chief counsel for his estate. Also in 1902, Durand was selected as a United States senatorial candidate in a complimentary way, as the senators representing Michigan at the time were both Republican. At some point, Durand was also to be nominated for the position of Michigan Attorney General, but he did not give consent to the nomination. In 1917, Durand was an unsuccessful candidate for the position of circuit judge in Michigan's 10th Circuit. Personal life Lorenzo H. Durand was the brother of United States Representative George H. Durand. On February 15, 1872, Lorenzo married Flora Caroline Moore, daughter of John Moore. John Moore was a notable judge and lawyer in the area who, like Lorenzo, served as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in 1868. Durand was a Freemason. Lorenzo was an Episcopalian. Death Durand died in his house in Saginaw on August 7, 1917. He was interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Saginaw.

The film is an adaptation of a memoir by a then Italian prisoner of war in 1942 British East Africa who challenges his English captor in a climb of Mount Kenya. Plot During the 1942 African Campaign of the Second World War, an isolated British East African POW camp sits on a dusty plain in the shadow of Mount Kenya, said to be one of the most difficult mountains in the world to climb. The camp is staffed mainly by African subjects overseen by a few British soldiers and their commander, the stiff-lipped Major David Farrell (Ben Cross), who lost both his wife and child to the war. One of the Major's preoccupations has been attempting to ascend one of Kenya's forbidding southern approaches, but he has been frustrated, his failure a joke amongst the mostly Italian prisoners, including his nemesis Franco Distassi (Vincent Spano), a world-class climber who has attempted escape five times. Succeeding on his sixth breakout attempt, Franco steals a jeep and makes his way through the Kenyan countryside to a small village, crashing the jeep to avoid hitting another truck stuck in the road. After an initial misunderstanding with the occupants an industrialist and his daughter Patricia (Rachel Ward), Franco fixes their truck and stays for lunch. He resembles Patricia's late husband, and his intelligence and charm leave an impression on her. When the British catch up with him, Franco goes quietly. Standing before the Major, he taunts the commander for failing to conquer the mountain, further vexing him. Franco is put into solitary confinement. The demoralized commanding officer of the Italians, Enzo (Tony Lo Bianco), devises a scheme to regain his and the others' honor: a select band will escape to climb Mount Kenya with the aim of reaching the 16,300 ft Point Lenana and planting the Italian flag there before returning to the camp, a feat that will also humiliate their captors. Franco agrees with the proviso that he makes his own descent from the other side into Italian-occupied Somalia. Gear is produced by artisan prisoners, including the German Kist (Rico Vanden Hurck), who trades his compass for a place on the three-man climbing team. Point Lenana, Mount Kenya Franco is away from the camp after he agrees to repair the industrialist's antiquated sawmill, where he and Patricia share a romantic interlude in the hayloft. When the Major, who had pressed his own unsuccessful suit with her, finds out, his ensuing rage pushes the POWs to put their plan in motion immediately, and Franco, Enzo, and Kist make good their escape. Once over the wire, however, Kist betrays the Italians and flees but is quickly captured, revealing their plan to the Major, who prepares to give chase up the mountainside. Mountain sickness leaves Enzo unable to continue, so Franco proceeds alone for days, sometimes catching a glimpse of the Major across the canyons. At night they engage in shouted banter with one another, inflaming the Major's envy of Franco's mountaineering skill and jealousy over Patricia. At the summit, the Major has Franco in his sights and implores him to halt. Franco buries the flag and surrenders, returning to the camp a hero. Cast Tony Lo Bianco called the film Wop on Top ;Main ;Supporting Four askari are played by Titi Wainaina, Jacob Otieno, Konga Mbandu, Lenny Juma. Themes and inspiration Donald Shebib described The Ascent as being about Italian honor, \\"a person caught between personal good and the common good.\\" > A lot of it was inspired by that joke about Italy having the thinnest book > of war heroes. The Germans were always bailing them out and had no respect > for the Italian soldiers. The Italians were tired of being made to feel > inferior by both the British and the Germans. Tony Lo Bianco called the film > \\"Wop on Top.\\" Production=Background and development The Ascent is based on Felice Benuzzi's Italian war memoir, No Picnic on Mount Kenya, about a series of events that took place at Camp 354 near Nanyuki, Kenya. The story was adapted for television in 1953 as an episode of Robert Montgomery Presents. Njeri Karago is a native of Kenya who earned master's degrees from UCLA in film studies and human resource management before becoming a producer at RHI (later Hallmark Entertainment). The film is among the first to be produced in association with Cabin Fever Entertainment, which announced its setting up of a film production subsidiary in November 1993. A climber himself, Canadian director Donald Shebib had made a mountaineering film once before, The Climb (1986), also an adaptation of a book. Shebib acknowledged that David Wiltse's script added or changed events as presented in Benuzzi's memoir. Filming and marketing The Ascent was shot entirely on location in Kenya. Njeri Karago \\"had a place\\" near the main location. Principal photography took place over nineteen days, with ten days on Mount Kenya out of an intended twelve, getting up to \\"about 15,000 feet\\", Shebib remarking that he had to train and get into shape before he could direct the film. One of the crew, Rick Ridgeway, wrote the introduction for a recent edition of No Picnic on Mount Kenya. Ridgeway, a mountaineer \\"of international reputation\\" who climbed K2, the world's second-highest peak, was responsible for the alpine scenes. One of the crew died on the first day on the mountain: > Mount Kenya is 17,000 feet. It's easy to get up to 12,000 or 15,000 feet, > but you have to do it in three or four days, you can't just do it all in one > day. You get mountain sickness and die. The guy who died was a local, so he > should have been more climatized, but he went up too quickly. Vincent got > mountain sickness. Scenes with wild animals, such as the zebras, were filmed with the animals in their natural habitat, and with minimal contact with humans or technology. The Ascent was billed as the \\"highest altitude film ever made.\\" Release and reception The Ascent was reported in the Los Angeles Times as having a premiere date set for September 15, 1994 at the Toronto International Film Festival, but Todd McCarthy's review gives the date as \\"Sept. 13.\\" A third source gives September 9. Home media and streaming The Ascent was released on VHS, but does not appear to have had a DVD or Blu-ray release. The film is available for streaming in the US on the mountaineering and climbing films website mntnfilm.com and Apple TV. Critical response VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever gives The Ascent 2.5 stars out of 5. Todd McCarthy reviewed the film in Variety after its Toronto premiere: \\"Donald Shebib has mounted the proceedings in presentable fashion and the performances are agreeable enough, but it's the unbeatable locations that provide the greatest diversion here\\", going on to fault the national stereotype-laden script as \\"devoid of ironies or complexity\\", the sort of \\"passable but instantly forgettable wartime\\" action film that was once reasonable double-bill fodder but for which there is no room in the modern theatrical marketplace: \\"mid- range fare, spelling a video/cable/TV fate\\", with the possible exception of the Italian market where it might do well theatrically. TV Guide's review similarly finds the film \\"efficiently directed and often gorgeous to look at,\\" but with an \\"ultra-traditional narrative, easy masculine camaraderie, and uncomplicated wartime bonding,\\" like some \\"artifact of simpler, less cynical times.\\" The Ascent is a reasonable, if anachronistic, simuation of the \\"great POW epics of the past\\" like The Great Escape and The Bridge on the River Kwai but contemporary American audiences no longer have the patience for this kind of \\"muscular, relatively innocent, wartime adventure.\\" ReferencesExternal links The Ascent on IMDb Category:Films directed by Donald Shebib Category:Films set in Kenya Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:World War II films based on actual events Category:Mountaineering films ","title":"The Ascent (1994 film)"},{"id":"64299162","text":"Senator Gerard may refer to: *Sumner Gerard (1916‚Äì2005), Montana State Senate *Susan Gerard (born 1950), Arizona State Senate ","title":"Senator Gerard"},{"id":"64299164","text":"Australaugeneria is a genus of marine annelids in the family Polynoidae (scale worms).

Veliƒçkoviƒá received the 244th list position (out of 250). This was too low a position for direct election to be a realistic prospect, and indeed he was not re-elected even as the Progressive list won 131 out of 250 seats. He was nonetheless awarded a mandate on 3 March 2020 as a replacement for Vera Paunoviƒá and thereby re-entered the assembly in time to serve on its last officially scheduled day of business prior to the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election.M.R.M., \\"Veliƒçkoviƒá postao poslanik poslednjeg radnog dana parlamenta\\", Danas, 4 March 2020, accessed 16 June 2020.

Republican Bill Redmond defeated Democrat Eric Serna in a result which flipped this heavily Democratic seat to the Republican column. Redmond replaced Bill Richardson, who resigned from his seat in the House after he was appointed by Bill Clinton to be the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. New Mexico's state law required the Governor of New Mexico to call for a special election within 10 days of a vacancy in the Congressional delegation to be held 84 to 91 days after the resignation. Governor Gary Johnson set the date of the special election to May 13. Redmond's victory (by just 3,017 votes) was considered to be a huge upset in the strongly Democratic-leaning district. His win was attributed to the Green Party spoiler effect, the low turnout in the election, and the negative perception of Eric Serna as a Democratic candidate. Redmond would be ousted in the 1998 midterms by future United States Senator Tom Udall who won by a sizeable margin. Background=District and campaigns Congressman Bill Richardson held the 3rd congressional district for 8 terms and easily defended his seat in elections since the district's inception. Democratic Congressman Bill Richardson had held New Mexico's 3rd congressional district since it was created from the 1980 census. After serving 8 terms, Richardson was appointed by President Bill Clinton to be the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. The heavily Democratic-3rd district held a large Democratic voter registration advantage, and was widely seen as a safe Democratic seat. The district breakdown was 59% Democratic, 29% Republican, 2% Green, and 9% Independent, giving Democrats a wide support base. At the state level, the Green Party of New Mexico had run a strong third party campaign in the 1994 New Mexico gubernatorial election, where Lieutenant Governor Roberto Mondrag√≥n claimed 10% of the vote statewide, and were growing in strength in New Mexico at the time of the special election.  Nomination process  New Mexico's state law required the Governor of New Mexico to call for a special election within 10 days of a vacancy in the Congressional delegation. The law remarks that \\"... each qualified political party may nominate in the manner provided by the rules of that party.\\" This meant that recognized parties in New Mexico, the Republican Party of New Mexico, Democratic Party of New Mexico, and the Green Party of New Mexico could nominate candidates through their own independent procedures. Independents were required to collect 4,786 valid petition signatures in order to appear on the ballot. Pushback against the current nominating rules came from some Democrats in the New Mexico Senate, who worked to get a bill passed that would allow for a primary. Sponsors including Senators Gloria Howes, Dede Feldman, and Pauline Eisenstadt felt that a party primary would \\"open up\\" the process. The bill was initially delayed by the Senate Rules Committee because of technical issues with its language. Although it was able to pass this hurdle in committee, Governor Gary Johnson announced that he would veto the legislation, and the bill died before coming to a vote on the floor, leaving the party nomination process unchanged. Johnson cited the potential cost of the a primary ($214,000 to the state and $600,000 to the counties where the special election would be held) as his reason for supporting a veto. When the bill came up for a vote in the State Senate, its defeat was perceived as assured and Senator Ben Altamirano was even quoted as saying, \\"Is this the dead candidates bill?\\" The bill to change to a primary system for New Mexico was tabled in the Senate Finance Committee, meaning that even if it were to eventually pass, it would be too late for the May special election. Governor Gary Johnson made a veto threat against a Democratic bill which would mandate primaries for special elections. Richardson did not resign immediately, and waited until just before being confirmed as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to leave his Congressional seat, delaying the election date as Johnson was required to follow in state law. Both the Republican and Democratic parties scheduled their nominating conventions for February 22. Earl Potter, chairman of the State Democratic Party, said \\"It's ours to lose\\" and noted the registration advantage Democrats had in the 3rd, while Earl Potter, New Mexico GOP chairman, noted that if the Green Party posted a candidate, it would siphon Democratic vote share. The Santa Fe New Mexican's Editorial Board heavily criticized both the Democrats and Republicans for choosing a nominee with a process that put power in the hands of so few people.  Candidate selection process = Democratic Party nomination process  Because of the lack of a party primary for the special election, selecting a delegation was up to the Democratic Party of New Mexico's Central Committee. The group consisted of 89 members who would decide the nominee in a small convention together. Initially, there was confusion over the party's rules, where it could be interpreted that the 500 to 600 county central committee members could be the nominating body, but the Democratic Party's Judicial Committee ruled that the party's Central Committee members would nominate a candidate instead. State Corporation Commissioner Eric Serna became an early favorite in the Democratic Central Committee, as he announced that he had enough support locked in from the 89 Democratic Central Committee members who chose the nominee. Serna met with Democratic leadership to earn their support in Washington, D.C. and to campaign among the delegation there. An early victory for Serna was seen in former Lieutenant Governor Roberto Mondrag√≥n's decision not to run for the seat on the Green Party's ticket, and he endorsed Serna. A number of Democrats who considered running for the seat chastised Serna and the Democratic Party for its \\"back room politics\\" approach to the nomination, while Serna announced the names of 56 of the 83 member central committee that publicly supported him. Criticism of the nominating process came from most of the other candidates. A Democratic Party forum was held in Farmington, New Mexico. Gallup Mayor George Galanis vocally called for a primary at the forum but most other candidates focused on different issues instead. Galanis quickly dropped out from the primary, citing a need to focus instead on his own mayoral re-election effort. Galanis noted on dropping out that going through the central committee means \\"you are dealing with old politicos who are Neanderthals in politics.\\" A group of liberal Democrats, called the \\"Concerned Democrats of Northern New Mexico\\", created a 21.5 page questionnaire and announced that they were uncomfortable with the speed at which the nomination was coming forward. Senator Roman Maes, one of the candidates for the Democratic nomination, criticized the process, stating, \\"Why do you need to raise money for 89 delegates when you don't have to put up any signs or buy any television or radio ads?\\" Santa Fe County Commissioner Javier Gonzales, dropped out, while Dan Sosa Jr., a former New Mexico Supreme Court Justice, considered jumping into the race (he originally came to a forum to ask people about how to get his name on the ballot, but then joined the other candidates on stage). Senator Roman Maes announced that he was considering a general election write-in campaign due to disgust with the selection process. Maes eventually decided to drop out altogether instead. Democratic leaders scheduled their committee meeting to choose a nominee on February 22, the same day as the Republican meeting. The Democrats held their meeting at the Sagebrush Inn in Taos, New Mexico. Serna successfully won the Democratic nomination at the meeting. = Candidates = * Eric Serna, State Corporation Commissioner * Ernie Lovato, former Governor of Santo Domingo Pueblo * Dan Sosa, Jr., former New Mexico Supreme Court justice * Santa Fe Mayor Debbie Jaramillo * State Senator Roman Maes * Santa Fe County Commissioner Javier Gonzales (dropped out) * Gallup Mayor George Galanis (dropped out before convention) * Santa Fe lawyer Francesca Lobato = Results = Serna successfully won the Democratic nomination at the meeting, with 67 out of the 81 votes cast. 23 of the votes out of the total of 81 were cast by proxy, meaning that the central committee member did not attend in person. Justice Sosa, Jr. received 8, Mayor Jaramillo received 2, former Governor Lovato received 2, and Lobato received 0. At 10AM, three hours before the meeting even started, a large sign announcing Serna as the Democratic nominee appeared outside the hotel the vote was taking place in. Upon receiving the nomination, Serna called for unity between Greens and Democrats at a press conference, reminding voters of the 1994 New Mexico gubernatorial election where the Green Party played spoiler to Democratic gubernatorial ambitions.  Republican Party nomination  The Republican Party decided to hold a convention with their central committee membership deciding the nominee-- Bill Redmond, a pastor, and State Senator Joe Carraro of Albuquerque both immediately announced their interest as candidates. Another GOP candidate, Rick Lopez, the chief administrative officer for the New Mexico State Engineer Office, announced that he was seeking the GOP nomination as well in February. Thomas Clayton, a Santa Fe lawyer, also sought the GOP nomination. The Republicans held their convention in Santa Fe, New Mexico. = Candidates = * Bill Redmond, pastor * State Senator Joe Carraro * Rick Lopez, chief administrative officer for the state Engineer Office * Thomas Clayton, lawyer = Results = Bill Redmond received 70 of 134 votes cast in the GOP central committee meeting, and Redmond received the nomination. Redmond had previously been defeated by Bill Richardson in 1996. Senator Joseph Carrarro received 33 votes in second place for the nomination, and Governor Gary Johnson briefly appeared at the Republican convention and called for everyone to rally around Redmond. In a speech after receiving the GOP nomination, Redmond called for it as being the time \\"to discard the liberal agenda.\\"  Green Party nomination  1994 gubernatorial election, called unsuccessfully for the Greens to endorse Democrat Eric Serna. He would re- register as a Democrat before the election. The Green Party was initially unsure of whether it would hold a convention, waiting to see if the Democratic-controlled legislature acted on their priorities, noting that if they did not, they would nominate a candidate in mid-March. Independent Patricia Wolff, previously the Green Party nominee for state land commissioner in 1994, announced her intention to run for the seat in the upcoming special in January, but then changed her mind and subsequently decided not to run. The Green Party decided in February to hold a convention‚ÄîSanta Fean city councilman Cris Moore immediately expressed interest in the nomination. The Green Party announced plans to hold a convention on March 9 (later changed to March 16) at Northern New Mexico Community College, with Santa Fe City Councilor Cris Moore and Carol Miller of Rio Arriba County announcing runs for the nomination. At the nominating convention in March, Abraham Gutmann, who ran unsuccessfully as the Green Party candidate against Republican U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, and former Lieutenant Governor Roberto Mondrag√≥n, the former Green Party gubernatorial candidate in 1994, had a debate at the beginning of the Green Party convention over whether to put forward their own candidate (which Gutmann supported), or to endorse the Democratic nominee, Serna (which Mondrag√≥n supported). Mondrag√≥n said, \\"There's a time to put together a platform of monumental ideas, and there is a time to run for office and lose,\\" he said. Mondrag√≥n said Serna's position on \\"90 percent of the issues closely mirrors our own.\\" Political commentator and author Roger Morris spoke at the convention and criticized Serna for his alleged ethical issues during his 16 years on the Corporation Commission, which the Albuquerque Journal noted that \\"some delegates' sentiments seemed better expressed by Morris\\". The Greens criticized Serna at their convention, claiming that his nomination represented a rightward shift of the Democratic Party to support businesses. Santa Fe councilor Cris Moore said in a speech that Greens would have more support in the general because, \\"If a Green enters the race, we will have a very strong turnout, because a lot of people are very upset with how Eric Serna was selected.\\" = Results = Carol Miller was elected by the Greens at their convention‚Äîof the 63 total delegates, 55 supported Miller, despite Mondrag√≥n's urging to endorse Democrat Eric Serna.  Other nominees and independents  Daniel Pearlman initially announced his intention to run as an independent, but eventually accepted the Reform Party nomination instead. Pearlman stated that he \\"didn't follow Perot necessarily\\" but respected him for creating a third party. He received the nomination from the Reform Party because four party officials met and chose Pearlman‚Äîone other candidate was scheduled for an interview but didn't show up. The Libertarians selected Ed Nagel, a perennial candidate who had previously run against Richardson as the Libertarian candidate in 1992, 1994, and 1996.  General election = Early fighting and campaigning  New Mexico's 3rd congressional district represented most of Northern New Mexico. The district as it was during the 1997 special election is seen on this map in yellow. Before Serna had even secured the nomination, GOP Chairman John Dendahl attacked Eric Serna on ethics-related grounds and for the Democratic nomination process, which was attracting controversy. The ethics complaint dealt with allegations that Serna had pressured Corporation Commission employees to buy from his family's jewelry store and that he accepted an illegal campaign car from businessmen. Carol Miller, the Green Party candidate, challenged candidates to limit their spending to $100,000 and called on television stations to hold televised debates, while U.S. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt was slated to headline a fundraiser for Serna in Albuquerque. Serna rejected Miller's spending pledge, with a spokesman for his campaign saying, \\"This special election is so short and our district is so large, that would limit our ability to get out all the important information we have for the voters.\\" Redmond announced that he would limit his spending to $100,000 if Serna would limit his spending to the same level, and if Serna (who was State Corporation commissioner) promised not to solicit campaign funds from industries regulated by the commission. Personal attacks abounded as the campaign moved closer to the special election, with Redmond's support of the Christian Coalition and Redmond fought back, saying that his values matched those of the district. Democratic Party chairman Earl Potter called Redmond a \\"Christian Coalition fundamentalist preacher\\" and said that Redmond \\"represents the values of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell not the values of Northern New Mexico.\\" Redmond claimed that his pro-life position was in line with Catholic communities of Northern New Mexico and compared his stances to that of Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa. Nancy Ellefson, the Executive Director of NARAL New Mexico, announced her endorsement of Serna at a press conference. When asked about Miller's support of abortion rights, Ellefson said that a vote for Miller would only give Redmond a better chance of winning. Miller said she was \\"shocked\\" by Ellefson's statement and said she was a longtime advocate for stripping restrictions on abortion. A member of the Santa Fe Democratic Committee endorsed Redmond because of his pro-life stance, and the Redmond campaign highlighted his endorsement and other endorsements of anti-abortion Democrats. Serna's support of abortion rights had the Archbishop Michael Sheehan of the Santa Fe Archdiocese call Serna personally and criticize his stance. In mid-April, New Mexico Democrats ramped up attacks on Redmond, holding two press conferences within the span of a week. Democratic State Chairman Earl Potter criticized Redmond for attending GOPAC and for its links to Speaker Newt Gingrich. Redmond criticized Democratic radio ads and said that \\"Newt Gingrich is not my hero.\\" Redmond held a press conference, calling on Democrats to cease their negative attacks, and said that Democrats were desperate because the race was tightening.  Forums and more attacks  Former Green Party Presidential nominee Ralph Nader toured the district in support of Green Party nominee Carol Miller. At a forum in Taos that was aired on cable television, Miller, Serna, Redmond, and Pearlman (the Reform candidate) participated. Write-in candidate Michael Guss also participated, with 60 people attending in the audience. Serna cast himself as supporting businesses that are environmentally sound, and announced support for decent pay for teachers. Miller cast herself as the \\"hopeful\\" candidate and announced support for health care for everyone when they needed it. Pearlman announced that the only issue of the Reform Party was the Constitution and allowing people to speak directly to politicians, while Redmond felt that social ills were created by federal taxation from the federal government. The Santa Fe New Mexican's Andrew Stiny called the questions from the moderators \\"sometimes convoluted\\" and most candidates expressed similar opinions to each other on them. Attacks between Serna and Redmond continued through April. The Republicans alleged that Serna missed a candidates' forum that he should have attended, releasing a press release saying that a source told the GOP that they had seen Serna eating at a sushi bar and drinking beer, instead of attending a candidates' forum in Paradise Hills, New Mexico. Serna angrily responded that \\"I don't even like sushi and I wouldn't be drinking a beer in a bar like that. I like American beer, Corona, really,\\" he said, and noted that he was at Democratic county conventions. Radio attack ads included Republican ads against Serna, saying: \\"Washington is engulfed in money scandals and corruption. Eric Serna would fit right in\\" and an ad that said, \\"a corrupt politician with a record of demanding money and favors from the people and companies he regulates.\\" Democratic hits against Redmond included: a radio ad hitting Redmond for being a \\"radical right-wing preacher who wants to impose his extreme values and social agenda on all of us\\" and a news release criticizing Redmond for holding a fundraiser with former Vice President Dan Quayle. Miller criticized Serna for ignoring her campaign, and for buying cardboard signs which were blowing in the wind and creating garbage. The Rio Grande chapter of the Sierra Club endorsed Serna instead of Miller, saying that Serna's environmental policies were the same or better than Miller's, and accused Miller of being a vote splitter to help elect Redmond. Serna also received the endorsement of the Conservation Vote Alliance, a 5,000 member group. Taxes and personal disclosures became a major issue as well. Serna and Miller both released their full tax returns, but Redmond refused to release his. Serna's campaign manager claimed that Redmond was \\"the only candidate I've ever heard of who's considered disclosure of information to the public to be a trap that he needs to avoid.\\" At a League of Women Voters forum, all four candidates (Pearlman, Serna, Redmond, and Miller all participated while Attila Csanyi, past state Libertarian Party chair, spoke on behalf of their candidate) supported balancing the federal budget within five years, but only Richmond supported a Constitutional Amendment to codify it. Redmond attacked Serna for criticizing him for refusing to disclose his finances, calling it a \\"smokescreen\\" and saying he had followed Federal regulations. Serna said that \\"we should have nothing to hide from the people we hope to represent\\". Pearlman got laughs at the forum for admitting that he wasn't taking any fundraising money and that he threw away the FEC disclosure in the trash because he was going to raise and spend less than $5,000. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) endorsed Redmond, and criticized Serna for his support from unions. They rolled out two ads attacking Serna, which said that Serna was getting \\"thousands from union bosses\\" to support his candidacy. In Roll Call, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) admitted that it \\"wasn't doing much\\" for Redmond. To support Miller, Ralph Nader planned a 20-hour whirlwind tour of the 3rd district. Nader, at one of the campaign appearances, called both Serna and Redmond, \\"two of the most undistinguished candidates that you and I have ever seen.\\"  Home stretch  On May 1, fundraising reports came out, and Serna raised the most money of any candidate by over $300,000. Experts in the runup to the election considered the race to be much closer than anyone expected between Serna and Miller. GOP leaders began to contend that Redmond could be in place for an upset victory, while a New Mexico political scientist said, \\"I become less confident every day\\" about a Serna victory. A poll a week out from the election from the Santa Fe New Mexican found Serna with an 8-point lead over Redmond, but with 15 percent of the electorate undecided. Specifically, the poll found that Serna was at 39%, Redmond at 31%, Miller at 12%, and 15% were undecided. F. Chris Garcia, a political scientist at the University of New Mexico, noted that if turnout was low and voters considered the corruption allegations against Serna heavily, there would be a chance for an upset in the heavily Democratic 3rd district. Miller publicly accused Serna of running an \\"unfair campaign\\" and planned to file a complaint with New Mexico's Secretary of State about Serna's \\"election irregularities\\". Serna's campaign said that it was Miller's \\"last gasp\\" because she was desperately behind Serna in the polls. In the run-up to the election, an analysis of the campaigns' websites found that Serna had the highest quality and most polished site, that Miller's page had dedicated information on the Green platform, but that Redmond hosted his website on a free GeoCities page which was criticized for containing little material. Redmond promised that if he were elected to Congress, he would buy a modem for himself. Negative campaigning continued to be widespread from all sides. Due to the acrimonious nature of the election, Redmond and Miller announced their intentions to send observers to make sure election laws were being followed at polling places, while supporters of Serna announced that they were requesting the U.S. Department of Justice to monitor Republican observers. A spokesperson for Miller's campaign said they were sending observers to anywhere ballots were being counted by hand, citing \\"real concerns about voter fraud.\\" Serna received late endorsements from President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman. The GOP attacked Serna, calling him the \\"poster child for corrupt politicians.\\" Bingaman released a statement, saying that Redmond was \\"one of the very few 3rd District residents who 'strongly opposes' what Bill Richardson stands for.\\" The Republican Chairman Dendahl filed an FEC complaint against the state Democratic Party over $40,000 they had spent. Dendahl also complained that a PAC-affiliated commercial that was airing later in the week was against FEC guidelines. Both Republicans and Democrats blanketed mailboxes with applications to request an absentee ballot to try and drive up turnout from their voters, while Serna was the subject of a negative mailer from New Mexico Republicans, which had black and white headlines from newspapers about Serna's alleged conflicts of interest and stories about the national Democratic Party's campaign contribution scandals. Democrats lodged an FEC complaint regarding Redmond's missing identification requirements that they alleged he failed to file. The state's two largest newspapers, the Albuquerque Tribune and the Albuquerque Journal, both endorsed Green Party candidate Carol Miller instead of Serna in a surprise. Miller was widely considered to have run the most visible Green Party campaign since the governor's race in 1994. A Corporation Committee employee (where Serna worked) was seen taking flyers off of cars supporting Redmond in the parking lot near their office, adding to allegations of Serna misusing his government office staff. A last debate, hosted by KNME-TV, took place a day before the primary. During the debate, Redmond stated that he never wanted to get rid of the United States Department of Education, which ran counter to speeches he repeatedly gave on the campaign trail. All of the candidates agreed that the Los Alamos National Laboratory (located in the district) should stop work on developing nuclear weapons. Serna fought back hard against the allegations he faced, while Redmond said that while the allegations may not be illegal, they were unethical. On Election Day itself, polling clerks reported generally light crowds of voters in the morning. Early and absentee voting was \\"generally good\\". The clerk for Santa Fe County noted that some voters who had requested absentee ballots were still arriving at polling places, causing some confusion.  Results  Santa Fe, where Serna refused to immediately concede. In an upset, Redmond won by a margin of 3,017 votes. On Election Night, Redmond said, \\"This was a race that people said was unwinnable. We did it today.\\" Redmond's election night watch party was an \\"out of the way Holiday Inn, while a stunned Serna was at the Eldorado Hotel, a \\"swanky\\" location according to The Albuquerque Tribune. Serna initially refused to concede on election night, saying the numbers could still change enough or him to win, but he conceded the following morning. For the first time since its creation in 1982, New Mexico's 3rd district was controlled by Republicans. All of New Mexico's U.S. House seats were also controlled by Republicans. Political scientists who studied New Mexico politics were stunned by the victory of Redmond, while The Santa Fe New Mexican called the results, \\"one of the biggest upsets in New Mexico political history.\\" Serna had outspent Redmond by over two to one, and Redmond had just lost less than a year previously to Richardson by 67 percent to 30 percent. Redmond proclaimed, \\"They called it mission impossible, I call it mission accomplished.\\" Political scientist F. Chris Garcia of the University of New Mexico felt that Democrats were \\"just caught by surprise\\" at the result and the strength of Redmond, considering Redmond's previous loss. Attorney General Tom Udall said \\"this is a very sad day for the Democratic Party.\\" Ray Sena, the new Democratic Party chairman who was elected two weeks before the special, blamed the loss on the race's negative tone, low turnout, and vote- splitting because of the Green Party. The Albuquerque Tribune noted that Richardson was prohibited from campaigning in the district due to his new role as a Diplomat, stopping the popular incumbent from stumping for Serna. Thomas Mann from the Brookings Institution contended that Carol Miller and the Green Party vote share were entirely responsible for Serna's loss, while Gilbert St. Clair, a University of New Mexico political scientist, attributed that low voter turnout (35%) was the reason for the stunning defeat. Republican U.S. Senator Pete Domenici attributed Serna's loss for going negative too early. Colorado Governor Roy Romer, who became the head of the DNC, noted a month after the election that \\"people are talking about how they cost us that seat in New Mexico. I'll tell you something: they got a lot of Democrats angry.\\" Dr. David Magleby found in his book that Redmond won for three reasons: a weak Democratic candidate in Eric Serna (who was thought to have manipulated the nomination procedures for his gain), low voter turnout, and the spoiler effect of Carol Miller. Democratic activists after this election began to clamor for Democratic-Green fusion tickets to be allowed to avoid splitting the vote like this in the future. Redmond would be defeated in his bid for re-election in 1998 by future United States Senator Tom Udall, who won by a sizeable margin.

Vitale is an author and professor of sociology at Brooklyn College. He is also the coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College. His writing has appeared in the New York Times, The Nation, The Appeal, USA Today, Vice News, and other media outlets. Vitale is the author of The End of Policing (2017), which argues for the abolition of police.  Biography  Alex S. Vitale is originally from Houston, Texas. In 1989, he received his Bachelor's in Urban Anthropology from Hampshire College. From 1990-93, he served on the staff of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, where he directed civil rights policy for the organization. He also worked on health care programs and social services programs. While in San Francisco, Vitale witnessed a national backlash against homelessness. In San Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos attempted to address homelessness with aggressive ticketing. This was followed by Police Chief Frank Jordan, who became mayor with a platform to aggressively police the homeless. As Vitale later wrote, \\"Despite these aggressive efforts to restore order, the number of people without a place to live continued to increase and public order remained impaired...\\" In 1993, Vitale moved to New York City to attend CUNY Graduate Center. During this era, he was able to observe the transition from the administration of Mayor David Dinkins, which Vitale viewed as politically liberal, to the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, which Vitale viewed as neoliberal. He observed aggressive policing and scapegoating of the homeless population under the Giuliani administration. In 2001, he received his Ph.D. in Sociology from CUNY Graduate Center.  Work  In 2009, City of Disorder: How the Quality of Life Campaign Transformed New York Politics (NYU Press) was published. In the book, Vitale focuses on the drive to improve quality of life in New York City and other American cities. In particular, he argues that, in the 1990s, New York City politics focused on restoring moral order, which included the \\"zero tolerance\\" campaign of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and an overhaul of prostitution, graffiti, panhandling, and homelessness in the city. This marked a shift toward prioritizing the needs of the middle and upper classes. The book examines how such changes impacted various New York neighborhoods, the NYPD, and city politics. In 2017, The End of Policing was published. In the book, Vitale argues that the United States should radically reconsider policing, rather than simply reforming it. He argues that the rise of policing in the world was rooted in three primary forms of economic exploitation: colonialism, slavery, and the rise of industrialization in the 19th century. As such, police forces have historically enforced inequality, suppressed workers, and micro-managed black and brown lives. He wrote, \\"The problem is not police training, police diversity, or police methods. The problem is the dramatic and unprecedented expansion and intensity of policing in the last 40 years, a fundamental shift in the role of police in society. The problem is policing itself.‚Äù The End of Policing was met with mixed reception, with positive reviews praising his writing style and detail in research, and negative reviews arguing that Vitale's proposed solution is too extreme or not extreme enough. Following the George Floyd protests, Vitale's work received wider public interest. He has been interviewed on alternatives to policing, as well as the movements to defund or abolish the police, by media outlets such as NPR, the Intercept, Jacobin, the Nation, The Indypendent, Democracy Now, and The Daily Show. In one interview, he explained, \\"Part of the problem is that for decades now, communities have been told that the only resource they can have to address their community problems is more policing and more incarceration... Our job is to lay out what the alternatives would look like and give people a sense that they have the power to ask for what they really want.\\"  References  Further reading   *  External links  * Personal Website Category:Brooklyn College faculty Category:People from Houston Category:Police abolitionists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Hampshire College alumni Category:Graduate Center, CUNY alumni ","title":"Alex S.

Both sisters were appointed Dames Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours.  Background and personal life  On 14 May 1958, Jean Topp gave birth to twin sisters Lynda and Jools in Huntly, New Zealand. They have an older brother Bruce and their father is Peter. Lynda Topp grew up with her family on a dairy farm in Waikato. Topp attended Ruawaro Combined School during the 1960s and early 1970s. Lynda and Jools started singing together for other people when they were five years old, when they were nine their brother bought them a guitar from money he had saved up. After leaving school in 1976, Jools and Lynda Topp joined the New Zealand Territorial Force and were posted at the Burnham Military Camp near Christchurch for six weeks. When they were 17, they performed at the Victorian Coffee Lounge (Montreal Street, Christchurch Central City). This brought them into contact with radical lesbian feminists. They both started identifying as lesbian from the late 1970s. Much of their life has been in the public eye and their mother was interviewed by Radio New Zealand about the closure of the Women's Weekly magazine in 2020 talking about how much her children had been featured in these magazines. Lynda enjoys hunting and fly fishing, which is why she chose to live in the South Island of New Zealand. Lynda has done many things in addition to being an entertainer, including running a caf√© with her partner Donna in Methven, Canterbury. In March 2013, Lynda married her long- time partner Donna Luxton, a preschool teacher. At the time of their marriage, same-sex marriage was not legal in New Zealand, so the couple entered into a civil union as a substitute for marriage. Same-sex marriage was made legal in New Zealand just a few months after the wedding. On the birth of a new generation with Lynda being a grandparent and Jools being a grand aunt they admitted they didn't expect it when they were younger because as they said: \\"We're all gay\\", referring also to their brother. Both Lynda and Jools Topp use their celebrity status with humour to inform people of issues such as feminism, MƒÅori land rights, homosexual law reform and nuclear free and have been recognised by the LGBT community as being inspirational.  Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill  Before the third reading of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, which ultimately passed and legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand, the Topp Twins publicly endorsed the bill in a post on their website. In a statement, Lynda said: > Everybody should be able to stand up and say \\"I'm getting married\\". A Civil > Union is demeaning, this idea that you will never be good enough, that your > love is somehow less than or not as worthy. There's no romance to it. And > today, I feel more romantic and more in love than I've ever felt in my life.  Career  The Topp Twins in 1981 Lynda Topp along with her sister Jools has had a long career in entertainment in New Zealand. They sing country and folk music with harmonies often to raise people's social consciousness. As entertainers Lynda Topp leads the comedy and \\"works the audience\\", and mostly Jools plays the guitar and leads the song making. Lynda focused on yodelling. The Topp Twins' popularity arose from a regular stint busking in Auckland when they were in their early 20s. They got taken to court for causing obstruction on Queen Street because their crowd was too big. They won the case and benefited from the publicity. Soon after that they travelled and performed to university crowds around New Zealand. They are well known for their costumed comedic characters such as Ken & Ken, and Camp Leader and Camp Mother. They have been a lot on TV in character including in 2000 hosting a quiz show called Mr and Mrs, in which couples answered questions about how well they knew each other, and a 2014 to 2016 cooking show called Topp Country.

A victim of police abuse in Pinellas, McLynas is a vocal critic of incumbent sheriff Bob Gualtieri and has worked to expose police corruption, namely among the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office under Gualtieri's tenure. McLynas ran against Gualtieri, a Republican, in 2016 as an Independent and earned over 100,000 votes despite limited campaigning and media coverage. McLynas sought the Democratic Party's nomination in 2020, but lost the primary to Eliseo Santana. McLynas has pledged to run again in 2024 and continues to be involved in activism. Personal life McLynas was born in New York City and raised in Detroit, where he attended St. Mary's of Redford High School. He later moved to Pinellas County, Florida. He is divorced and was awarded custody of his daughter. McLynas has a passion for classic automobiles that has been noted in several publications. In 2017, McLynas received local attention when his custom boat car, nicknamed the \\"Boatswagon\\", was featured on Bay News 9 after the Seminole Recreation Department started a social media campaign to find its owner in an attempt to bring the car to the city's annual holiday parade, which McLynas agreed to participate in; the \\"Boatswagon\\" was inspired by the \\"boatmobiles\\" in SpongeBob SquarePants. Police abuse victim Beginning in 2009, McLynas and his estranged wife disputed over the custody of their daughter. She allegedly became violent towards James, but James did not believe it was appropriate to hit his wife in self-defense, so he called 9-1-1. When a male Pinellas deputy arrived to the home, according to James, his wife and the deputy went into their bedroom alone, and a few minutes later McLynas' wife had new scratch on her arm and accused James of domestic violence against her. After James was arrested, his wife admitted to making up the false allegation, yet she was never charged. McLynas claimed his wife later began \\"dating\\" the same Pinellas deputy who arrested him, along with two others from the Pinellas Sheriff's Office; two from the Clearwater Police Department and one from the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. McLynas claimed these officers harassed him over the next five years; in 2016, McLynas said there were over 150 false police reports, 7 fraudulent Domestic Violence Injunctions (DVI's), and 22 false Child Protective Investigation reports filed against him and four false arrests from 2009 to 2015. Campaigns for Pinellas County Sheriff Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who is often the target of criticism from McLynas 2016 In August 2013, McLynas privately informed Gualtieri that he would challenge him for sheriff in the 2016 election to \\"expose his corruption\\". On October 28, McLynas' 60 pound, 10-year-old daughter was handcuffed and arrested in an incident he believed was politically motivated. Then on October 30‚Äî the day before his custody hearing, McLynas was arrested on five felony charges in what he alleged was Gualtieri's attempt to keep him out of court and lose custody of his daughter, and thus drop his campaign for sheriff. It was later revealed that Gualtieri used a Stingray phone tracker to track McLynas down. At his final custody hearing, the judged ruled that McLynas' wife and the police colluded against James, and he was awarded 100% custody of his daughter while incarcerated‚Äî a first in Florida history. All charges against McLynas were dropped and he publicly announced his candidacy for sheriff after being released from jail on November 1. McLynas persisted through his 2016 campaign; although he finished second to Gualtieri, following the results on the night of the election, he immediately pledged to run again in 2020. =Endorsements= *Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association *Pinellas County Green Party *Gulf Coast Green Party *The Revolutionary Radio Show *Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign of Florida *Omali Yeshitela, Chairman of the African People's Socialist Party 2020 McLynas' logo is used in a reverse graffiti campaign, as seen in Clearwater, Florida in September 2020, after his primary loss On August 7, 2017, McLynas gave a speech addressing the International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement (InPDUM) in St. Petersburg, in which he exposed Gualtieri's \\"secret\\" chase policy, following the road incident deaths of black children who were pursued by Pinellas deputies who did not have their emergency lights flashing. * On March 14, 2019, McLynas formally filed to run in the 2020 election; at the time he intended on running under no party affiliation (NRA). Upon paying the qualifying fee on June 10, 2020, McLynas decided to run as a Democratic candidate. McLynas qualified by reaching enough donations to pay the $10,303.56 fee; he claimed that Gualtieri made petition signature gathering illegal, citing the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida, in an attempt to prevent him from qualifying on the ballot. McLynas faced a primary challenge from Eliseo Santana. McLynas participated in the first sheriff's forum of the 2020 election, hosted by Dream Defenders, on June 17. In this forum Gualtieri spoke alone the first hour, while McLynas and Santana shared the second hour together. McLynas has called out Gualtieri for refusing to debate him, calling him a coward. Gualtieri acknowledged that he refused to debate McLynas over a series of photo-shopped pictures and memes criticizing him. During the final weeks of the primary, McLynas and his volunteers participated in a reverse graffiti campaign, in which they power washed his campaign logo on public spaces all over the county; McLynas accused Gualtieri of violating his First Amendment rights by using county funds to remove the \\"campaign messages\\" created at the county courthouse and near the sheriff's house, among other places. In the Democratic primary on August 18, McLynas finished second to Santana. He has pledged to run again in 2024. =YouTube channel= Although McLynas launched a YouTube channel in 2016 during his first campaign, it did not receive much attention until his second campaign in 2020; while McLynas only had a little over 30 subscribers in June 2019, his audience grew to over five thousand subscribers by June 2020. In January 2020, McLynas published a video of an encounter with Pinellas deputies that earned over 42,000 views within five days. In another videotaped incident published in February 2020, McLynas encountered difficulties making a standard public records request; when the clerk refused service to him, she brought in six deputies to question him. McLynas claimed his constitutional rights were violated, that he was harassed and physically assaulted twice, and that the deputies made up numerous false allegations against him in an attempt to arrest him; McLynas believed this was another attempt by Gualtieri to interfere in the election. =Website= McLynas launched his campaign website, mclynasforsheriff.com, in May 2020. Campaign platform McLynas' campaign website consists of ten pillars detailing his platform positions. #Responsibly end the war on drugs #Reduce costs and lower taxes #Limit use of weapons violence and force #End warrantless citizen spying #Community outreach help and support #Body cams & police accountability #Training & retraining #Ending all \\"policing for profits\\" #A constitutional sheriff 24/7 365 #Justice reforms PCSO history and corruption McLynas' campaign website features an extensive background of the history of the PCSO, from its founding in 1912 to present time.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang stated in response to questions for comment on the declaration ‚ÄúTo these absurd statements, to this farce, I don‚Äôt have any interest in commenting‚Äù. In late July 2020, during the forced closing of the Chinese Consulate in Houston by the United States government, protesters critical of the People's Republic of China gathered outside of the consulate with flags of the New Federal State of China. Guo Wengui claims to have invested US$100 million in the movement. The source of funds for the movement is under investigation by the FBI. In August 2020 supporters of the organisation also protested the arrest of Steve Bannon. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group has been accused of disseminating misinformation about the pandemic, including of spreading leaflets alleging that the virus is a biological weapon developed by the Chinese government, and promoting hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment for the disease.

The vehicle was the first completely newly developed commercial vehicle from Hanomag after World War II. It belongs to the large vans and light trucks division. The Hanomag L 28 was released in 1950. It was designed as a modern long hood and had a so-called ‚Äúalligator hood‚Äù based on American models and headlights integrated into the front of the vehicle (i.e. no longer free- standing), which gave the vehicle a modern appearance at the time. A short time later, the two competition models Opel Blitz (1952) and Borgward B 1500 (1954) also had a similar appearance. The L 28 was initially designed for 1¬Ω tons of payload, over time other versions for 2, 2¬Ω and 3 tons of payload appeared, in 1956 a 1.75-tonner appeared instead of the 1¬Ω and 2-ton versions. The entire model range was driven by Hanomag diesel engines initially with 50 HP, for the larger models there were later also diesel engines with 65 and 70 HP. Popular versions were the platform truck, the closed panel van and the separate box body, and a minibus variant was also available with bodies from bodybuilders. The water-cooled inline four-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine with 2.8 l displacement of the Hanomag L 28 was equipped in 1953 with a Roots turbocharger, which was driven by a V-belt. The sound of the Hanomag D-28 engines was characterized by the particularly striking \\"diesel nailing\\" and the \\"singing\\" of the blower. In 1955 the L-28 cab received front hinged doors instead of the previously used rear hinged door and in recent years instead of the two small ones, a large curved panoramic windshield, which made the cab look much more modern. Between 1958 and 1960, the L 28 series was gradually replaced by the Hanomag Kurier, Garant and Markant front-link successor series, differently labeled according to their weight.  Design  The Hanomag L28 was firstly made as a rebadged version of the Chevrolet Advance Design, but over the years it has gained its own body that remains to be similar to the Advance Design truck, The type A-L 28 was built in the versions with 1¬Ω t and 2¬Ω t payload, as civil version A-L 28 Z and as all-wheel drive group car. Between 1953 and 1971 about 6,000 copies were made. The production peak was reached in 1963 with 1,657 vehicles. The A-L 28 received the 2.8-liter diesel engine of the 3-ton L-28 model with an output of 70 hp (51 kW) at 2800 rpm. The vehicles had a ZF four-speed gearbox (AKS-25) with countershaft and simultaneous engagement of the front wheel drive (1: 1.18 / 1: 2.138). The second and third gear were synchronized. With an empty weight of 3860 kg, the top speed was 72 km / h, the climbing ability 69%. Most recently, the vehicles were equipped with a hydraulically operated dual- circuit brake with compressed air support. One brake circuit worked on the front axle, the other behind. The vehicle was either fitted with single tires at the front and rear (versions A and A 1) or with twin tires (A 2) at the rear. On April 1, 1969, the commercial vehicle divisions of Hanomag and Henschel-Werke merged to form Hanomag-Henschel Fahrzeugwerke GmbH (HHF) within the Rheinstahl group. Daimler-Benz AG initially acquired 51% of this company and the rest of the share capital at the end of 1970. The last A-L 28 were produced under the company name Hanomag-Henschel, in 1974 the Hanomag-Henschel brand disappeared from the truck market.

Jokinen on the urban planning of two Dutch cities: in 1962 of The Hague and in 1967 of Amsterdam, both set out in a brochure.D.A. Jokinen: Geef de stad een kans, Stichting Weg, Roosendaal, 1968 The Hague The first Plan Jokinen from 1962 related to the station area of The Hague. The Bezuidenhout district in this city, adjacent to The Hague Staatsspoor station, was largely destroyed in the Second World War by Allied bombing. The reconstruction had still not started, because people were not sure what to do. David Jokinen saw an opportunity to put an end to the historical situation in which two main stations each served only part of the rail traffic. His plan included the disappearance of the Staatsspoor station, with Hollands Spoor becoming the central station. In the Bezuidenhout, space was created for a motorway to Scheveningen and a monorail for public transport. His plan sparked fierce discussions in The Hague. It was not implemented, in part because it was only presented when decision-making had finally reached an advanced stage. Den Haag Centraal railway station now stands on the site of the Staatsspoor station, while the Amsterdam-Rotterdam main line is served by Den Haag HS railway station (Hollands Spoor), 1 mile away. Part of the motorway that Jokinen had in mind was realised in the form of the Utrechtsebaan. Amsterdam The second study from 1967, partly funded by the car lobby group Stichting Weg, aimed to revitalise the city of Amsterdam by facilitating accessibility by car. Jokinen made some radical choices to this end. For example, the Singelgracht was to be filled in and replaced by a six-lane highway (comparable to the route of the current s100 inner ring road, but much wider). The impoverished working-class neighbourhoods De Pijp and Kinkerbuurt were to be completely demolished. A major highway (the so-called Zuidelijke Ontsluitingsweg, Southern Access Road) would come through De Pijp to the inner city ring, surrounded by a central business district inspired by La D√©fense in Paris, with many high office towers.https://archief10.archiefweb.eu/archives/archiefweb/20171220104006/https://www.amsterdam.nl/actueel/nieuws/amsterdam- bijna-ten/ The plan mainly focused on providing easy car access to work. Jokinen assumed that, just like in the USA, most people would choose to live in the suburbs, but public transport was also taken into account. A new central station would be built in the vicinity of the Weteringcircuit. Dutch Railways adopted this idea and until the mid-1970s argued for a major terminal station in De Pijp, dubbed Amsterdam Centrum-Zuid station, which would also connect to two branches of the North-South metro line. Jokinen also advocated a system of monorails to connect parking garages on the edge of the city centre to the old city. Jokinen's ideas were a result of other ideas from the same period. His vision to build high towers in park-like environments is very similar to Le Corbusier's ideas for Paris (Plan Voisin). His preference for the car resembles the way Robert Moses attempted to transform New York at the same time. In the view of Jokinen, the city centre would be affected somewhat, but not as badly as Plan Kaasjager, a decade earlier (in 1954), in which many city centre canals would be filled in for the benefit of car traffic.https://www.amsterdamsebinnenstad.nl/binnenstad/178/kaasjager.html Nevertheless, the plan met fierce criticism and was hardly adopted by the implementing agencies. Apart from a number of rather large viaducts on the Centrumring and the fairly large-scale reprofiling of the Wibautstraat after the metro was built, this plan ultimately had hardly any consequences for the city.

She believes passionately that there should be more women exerting their influence in the film business.  Life = Provenance and early years  Ula St√∂ckl was born in Ulm a few weeks before the (largely uncontested) incorporation of Austria into an enlarged Germany. Alfons St√∂ckl, her father, was a professional orchestral clarinettist. He was sent away to fight in the war, but survived. After the war the wages of the players in her father's orchestra were halved, and in order to support the family budget Ula's mother, born Katharina Kreis, took factory work in the textiles sector. Katharina St√∂ckl-Kreis had grown up in an orphanage, looked after by nuns who had solicitously educated her in a formidable range of house-wifely skills, and brought a steely practicality to the challenges of raising a family on her own during the war years. But as her daughter later recalled, during the first four decades of her life she had not been well prepared for factory work: her fingers were almost always bandaged. Many of Ula's most vivid childhood memories relate to her family's experiences of the wartime bombing of Ulm, clutching one of her mother's hands while her younger sister clutched the other and night after night they watched the city burn. Their home and the surrounding area were destroyed on 17 December 1944: collateral damage included three dead siblings, but both her parents had survived. She never thought to ask whether they were paying any rent for the succession of little rooms in which they were accommodated over the next few months. Subsequent memories included the flu epidemic and starvation winter in 1946. The birth of another sister in 1948 meant that she was no longer her parents' only surviving child and represented some kind of a new beginning for the family. St√∂ckl quit school in 1954 and trained for secretarial work, which would remain her principal source of paid employment till 1963. In February 1958 she embarked on languages courses in Paris and London. Between 1961 and 1963 she worked as a trilingual executive secretary. Between May and August 1963 she worked as an editorial assistant with the publishers DM-Verlag at Sandweier (at that time still just outside Baden-Baden, into which the little town has subsequently been subsumed).  Student  In 1963 St√∂ckl enrolled as a student at the \\"Institut f√ºr Filmgestaltung\\" (loosely, \\"Institute for Making Films\\"), a department of the School of Design (\\"Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung\\") which had been set up ten years earlier in Ulm, and which had built a reputation for its innovative approach to teaching. She was the first female student to be admitted to the course, which she completed in 1968. She produced her first film, \\"Antigone\\", in 1964 as part of her course, using a silent 35-mm Arri camera. Just seven minutes long, it is of neccessity episodic, relating just a few of the key moments in the Greek myth on which it is based. title= Antigone, 1964 Directed by Ula St√∂ckl url=https://letterboxd.com/film/antigone-1964/ publisher= Letterboxd Limited, Auckland NZ accessdate=18 June 2020}} Her graduation feature film, \\"Neun Leben hat die Katze\\" (1968: \\"The cat has nine lives\\"), subsequently acquired a cult status among supporters, seen by some as \\"West Germany‚Äôs first feminist film\\". These two productions identified the thems and set the direction for much of St√∂ckl's later work. It failed to go on general release when first produced due to the insolvency of the selected distributor, but subsequent critics and film scholars have nevertheless born witness to its enduring significance.  Film career  In 1968 Ula St√∂ckl set up her own production company, \\"‚ÄöUla St√∂ckl Filmproduktion\\". The next year she teamed up with Edgar Reitz to produce \\"die Geschichten vom K√ºbelkind\\" (loosely, \\"Tales of the Dumpster Kid\\"), a film of 22 episodes from the life of a girl who does not conform to the norms of civil society. The shortest episode lasts just 66 seconds: the longest 25 minutes. Reitz described it as the story of a \\"perverse polymorph, an infantile monstrous person\\", but it also gave an insight into how such a combination of characteristics might be instilled by a deeply challenging succession of childhood experiences. Originally intended for showing in experimental cinemas and, according to at least one source, in pubs, starting in 1971 sections of it began to find their way onto television, thereby garnering a larger more mainstream audience and establishing more broadly the public reputartions of its two co-producers. \\"K√ºbelkind\\" was part of a new wave of films from a younger generation of producers, often categorised as the New German Cinema genre. Through the 1970s Ula St√∂ckl worked almost exclusively on television films, and much of her professional focus continued to focus on the \\"small screen\\" through the 1980s and 1990s. Her theme was frequently that of human conflict, viewed from the - in her hands very distintive - perspecive of women or children. She took care to avoid one-sidedness and confronted her characters with almost unbearable problems, often based on dreams. In 1984 she returned to the cinema with one of her most acclaimed productions, \\"Der Schlaf der Vernunft\\" (\\"The sleep of reason\\"). The themes were familiar, but by now she was working with a level of assurance and self-confidence which meant that critics were a little less inclined to challenge the various quirkinesses in the approach taken. Another important milestone in St√∂ckl's film career was \\"Das alte Lied\\" (\\"The old song\\"), one of the first so-called \\"Spielfilme\\" (loosely, \\"narrative films\\"), and appeared in 1992. While again revisiting her theme of conflict in human relationships, it also dealt with some of the themes arising out of reunification, and thereby touched on matters which at the time were preoccupying very many Germans. \\"Das alte Lied\\" was, and seems likely to remain, the last of Ula St√∂ckl's films for cinema.  Stage  Ula St√∂ckl has only briefly involved herself with theatre. In 1974 she co-produced with Werner Fassbinder Strindberg's stage drama \\"Fr√§ulein Julie\\" at the Theater am Turm in Frankfurt. For one reason and another, the experience was not an entirely happy one.  Teaching  St√∂ckl has undertaken teaching contracts for the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin and, in North America, at the venerable Hollins University in Roanoke VA. Since 2004 she has also held a professorship at the University of Central Florida on the edge of Orlando FL where she focuses on film direction and production and, inevitably, on the place of women in film.  Film festivals  She has shown particular dedication to film festivals, through which she is also able to progress her feminist ambitions for society. For fifteen years following its foundation in 1978 she was closely engaged with the International Women's Film Festival in Cr√©teil (Paris). Since 1982 she has worked for the \\"Berlinale\\" film festival in connection with \\"competition and panorama\\", also finding a niche as a moderator and presenter of the festival's press conferences and puiblic discussions. For a couple of years between 2002 and 2004 she was also employed as a programme advisoer in the selection committee for the Venice International Film Festival.

Dupuy was a reporter with the New York Herald before his National Guard artillery unit was called up to serve in World War I. He transferred to the regular army after the war, serving in a number of public relations roles. During World War II, he served as acting director of public relations at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, under General Dwight D. Eisenhower. On D-Day ‚Äì June 6, 1944 ‚Äì Dupuy was the first to announce on radio that the invasion of Normandy was taking place. He was also present for the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender in Berlin on May 8, 1945. Dupuy retired from the Army after the war and became a prolific military historian, working with his son Trevor N. Dupuy.  Early life and World War I  Richard Ernest Dupuy was born on March 24, 1887 in New York City. He aspired to a career in the United States Army but his family's circumstances required him to go out to work at the age of 17. He spent three years in various clerical roles before finding employment as a junior reporter at the New York Herald. In 1909 Dupuy joined the New York Army National Guard and by 1917 he had become the Herald's shipping news editor and a features editor. After the United States joined World War One in 1917 Dupuy was deployed to France where he served in command of an artillery battery and as a staff officer of an artillery regiment. At the end of the war he transferred to the US Army, accepting a regular commission. Dupuy was married to the Laura Nevitt Dupuy, who was an accomplished illustrator and artist, and their son Trevor Nevitt Dupuy was born in New York City on May 3, 1919.  World War II  Richard Ernest Dupuy reads Communiqu√© Number One of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force announcing the invasion of Normandy After the World War I Dupuy served in the Philippines and in a number of public relations roles including as chief of the Army Information Service in New York City; on the general staffs of the II Corps and the First Army and with the United States Military Academy. After the outbreak of World War II he was with the War Department's Bureau of Public Relations in Washington. Dupuy joined the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in 1943 as news chief and acting director of public relations, reporting to supreme commander Dwight D. Eisenhower. He played a key part in publicizing the Allied landings on D-Day, the first day of the invasion of Normandy, when he had the role of officially announcing the operation on radio. In a broadcast at 12:32 am Pacific Time (3:32 am Eastern War Time) on June 6, 1944 he announced that \\"Under the command of General Eisenhower, Allied naval forces, supported by strong air forces, began landing Allied armies this morning on the northern coast of France\\". This announcement, known as Communiqu√© Number One, was so short that Dupuy read it out twice in a row. Dupuy remained with SHAEF for the rest of the war. He was present when the German Instrument of Surrender was signed in Berlin on May 8, 1945.  Later career  After the war Dupuy returned to the War Department's Bureau of Public Relations, serving as its acting director until his retirement, as a colonel, in 1946. Dupuy was a military historian and had written a number of books in the inter-war years during his spare time. He returned to this passion in retirement and wrote 100 articles and short stories, as well as 22 published books. Dupuy often collaborated with his son, also a military historian, who had served in the US Army as a colonel and commanded an artillery battery during the Burma campaign. Richard Ernest Dupuy also served as an associate editor of the Army- Navy-Air Force Journal for five years and was a director and staff editor of the Historical Evaluation and Research Organization from 1963. Dupuy died on April 25, 1975 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington DC.

Background  NNOMY was founded in 2004 in the aftermath of the national counter-recruitment conference \\"Stopping War Where it Begins\\" in Philadelphia. It is intended to be a decentralized and flexible structure that helps national, regional and local activists and organizations by promoting communication efforts and by stimulating collaboration between network members. NNOMY organizes actions and campaigns against militarism in order to raise awareness and to increase education on the topic. The first steering committee included these organizations: *Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors; *Committee for High School Options and Information on Careers, Education and Self-Improvement (CHOICES); *Committee Opposed to Militarism and the Draft; *Human Rights Committee, UTLA; *Madison Area Peace Coalition; * National Youth & Militarism Program/AFSC; *Not in Our Name; *Project YANO; *Resource Center for Non Violence; *Teen Peace. Other participating groups and organizations were Veterans for Peace, Fellowship of Reconciliation, Youth Activists/Youth Allies (NY City) and Los Angeles Coalition Opposed to Militarism in Our Schools. Alliance for Global Justice and War Resisters League sponsor actions of the network.  Campaigns = A National Call: Save Our Civilian Public Education  This campaign was started in opposition to conservative forces in the Pentagon and of corporate influence on the learning environments of the K-12 and public universities. As a result of the campaign, in 2009, JROTC firing ranges at 11 high schools were shut down by the efforts of students, their parents and teachers. Similar successes were achieved later in Hawaii and Maryland.  Divest ‚ÄúYour Body‚Äù from the War Machine  This project, organized in collaboration with CODEPINK, had the goal to remove invested assets from companies, which supplied and profited from militarization. The campaign wanted to provide broader opportunities to young people who look for community service alternatives to the military.  School Marksmanship Training  In collaboration with the project YANO, NNOMY promoted the removal of marksmanship programs and shooting ranges from schools. Some of the accomplishments of the campaign are: * end of placing students in JROTC involuntarily; * significant reduction of Marine Corps JROTC enrollment; * removal of shooting ranges from 11 schools in the San Diego.  Winning The Peace  This was a national leafletting campaign, directed to acquaint youth with the reality of military enlistment and alternative opportunities to the military service.  Veterans For Peace and Counter-recruiting  This project is for raising public concern about Pentagon's militarizaiton efforts on youth by providing personal experience of veterans and other activists.  Women's March on the Pentagon  The March was held on 21 October 2018 and opposed the Pentagon's influence on live of youth, especially its programs JROTC, Young Marines, DoD Starbase and DoD STEM.

The building is located between Palazzo Michiel dalle Colonne and Palazzo Smith Mangilli Valmarana. History The palazzo was owned by the ancient and noble Michiel family. The family gave three doges to the republic, two of them, Domenico Michiel (1117‚Äì1130) and Vitale II Michiel (1156‚Äì1172), were forced to abdicate. The word brus√† means \\"burned\\" in Venetian dialect, because in 1774, the palace was completely devastated by a fire due to the neglect of a maid. Only the original facade on the Grand Canal survived. Three years later, in 1777, the palazzo was rebuilt thanks to funding provided by the city. To commemorate the event, there is the Lain inscription on the facade: \\"Quos ignis consumpsit patria mementa majorum nepotibus patrios lares restituit s.e. vidus ianuarij 1777.\\" Today, Palazzo Michiel del Brus√† is owned by the Global Art Affairs Foundation, a Dutch non-profit organization involved in the contemporary art and architecture. Architecture The main fa√ßade is characterized by tripartition and symmetry, which is typical for a Venetian palace. The structure has two noble floors. Important elements of the facade are the two water portals on the ground floor and the quadriforas on the noble floors decorated by the traditional three-lobe Gothic flowers on the point of each arch. The quadriforas are flanked by pairs of single lancet windows on each side. The facade terminates with an attic mezzanine. All openings on the noble floors have projecting balconies and the typical gothic flower on the cusp of the arch. The interiors still preserve rich rooms decorated with stucco and frescos, mostly made by Jacopo Guarana.

Notable work  Larrosa is considered as one of the world's leading researcher's in Carbon‚Äìhydrogen bond activation. C - H bonds in organic compounds are particularly un-reactive due to the strong bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms and such bond activation would increase the reactivity and therefore enable the potential development of new novel organic compounds. Larrosa's research has showed how transition metal catalysis maybe used to achieve C - H bond activation, and for his efforts in the field, was awarded the Corday-Morgan Prize and was a finalist at the Blavatnik Awards (UK) in 2019. The published research also have shown the enhanced regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in these catalysis processes, which is generally difficult to be achieved in this field. Apart from research based on C - H bond activation, Larrosa has also published several research on decarboxylation and arylation reactions.

The drawing is often produced by students who are asked by their teacher to draw natural features. The drawing is typically characterized by a road stretching between vast fields of rice that leads toward two mountains on the horizon, with the sun nestled in the space between the two peaks. Other objects commonly added by students include clouds, houses, trees, grass, and people.Suwarna. 2008. Gejala-Gejala Karya Seni Lukis Anak-Anak TK dan Pembinaannya di Kecamatan Bantul. Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta, PDF The purpose of the drawing is to demonstrate the tendency of children to compose symmetrical scenes that consist of asymmetrical features, as well as a tendency to imitate their peers. History A photo of Mount Sumbing (left) and Mount Sindoro (right) taken from a plane The template for the drawing originates from Yogyakartan artist Tino Sidin, the host of the children's drawing program Gemar Menggambar, which aired on the Indonesian public broadcasting network TVRI in the 1980s. One of the drawings produced by Sidin contained the now iconic twin mountains and rice fields. Sidin's artwork proved to be so popular that Indonesian schoolchildren began to imitate the drawing, with teachers using his work as a reference for their students in the classroom. Mount Sindoro and Mount Sumbing, located in Central Java, are sometimes cited as the real-life basis for the drawing. Criticism Several critics have argued that the twin mountain drawing highlights issues in the educational system in Indonesia. Indonesian teachers and schools are perceived as monotonous, as students almost unanimously decide to draw twin mountains, and critics argue this shows that schools do not promote diversity and creativity. Many believe that more action should be taken by teachers to promote creativity among their students. The monotonous nature of schools also causes students to fear being different, forcing them to conform and draw the same imagery as their peers. The phenomenon also shows the dogmatic characteristics of Indonesian teachers, who are not open-minded to more creative choices made by students. Often, students are only allowed to follow the teacher's example, and critics argue that teachers should practice open-mindedness to allow students to produce imagery other than the twin mountains, when asked to draw natural features.

Our Sea. Our Heritage premiered at the Abu Dhabi International Boatshow 16-19 October 2019. Cowie was a Dive Supervisor on the NHNZ New Zealand underwater six part series diving in the Northland Harbours and Poor Knights episodes. He found a sea taonga whilst diving at Tawharanui which he returned to Maori elders. Mystery at Midge Bay was co-produced by Cowie and David Sims, presented by Cowie and directed by Sims. The 50 minute documentary investigates the theory that the Spanish or Portuguese might have been the first Europeans to discover New Zealand, before the Dutchman Abel Tasman in 1642. It screened at the Matakana Cinema and Kumara Box in Dargaville, December 2012. Rugby and charity work Cowie played rugby for Oxford University and debuted for the United Arab Emirates in 2017 in the Asian Championship. Cowie played international rugby union for the United Arab Emirates in 2017 playing in the Asia Rugby Division 1 championships in Malaysia. He was a hooker, prop and No.8. Cowie played in the Varsity Match in 2006 and 2007 for Oxford University v Cambridge University. Former Australian wing Joe Roff was his captain. He toured Japan and the USA with the Oxford team. Cowie also represented Oxford University at athletics and surfing. His Keble College rugby team won the Oxford Rugby Cuppers tournament in 2007 with Cowie scoring in the final. Cowie was captain of the Doha and Mahurangi Rugby Club, and played for the Harbour Hawks in Dunedin and the British Penguins in the Orkney Islands, Scotland. In 2016 with friend Mike Ballard and the Mike Ballard Foundation he led a goodwill mission to Seychelles and Madagascar that featured on World Rugby TV. The Air Seychelles Mike Ballard Foundation Conquistadors were made up of eight clubs from the Arabian Gulf. The team led rugby coaching clinics with junior players and donated rugby boots and kit. The goodwill mission featured on World Rugby TV and the Mike Ballard Foundation Committee were awarded UAE volunteers of the year.  Author  Cowie writes about the history of New Zealand ‚Äì early European exploration and the New Zealand Land Wars. He has written five books: Conquistador Puzzle Trail; Nueva Zelanda, un puzzle hist√≥rico: tras la pista de los conquistadores espa√±olesA Flame Flickers in the Darkness; Greenstone Trail; and Flames Flicker. His most notable work is Conquistador Puzzle Trail which is also available in Spanish and was added to Te Ara the online encyclopaedia of New Zealand as a source on the theory that the Spanish or Portuguese may have been the first Europeans to discover New Zealand.The New Zealand Maori were the original inhabitants - Cowie's books are about the European voyages of exploration and discovery. Cowie assesses the Spanish theories that Juan Fernandez (1576-1578) or the San Lesmes (1525-1526) of the Loaisa Expedition voyaged to New Zealand Pre Abel Tasman ‚Äì as proposed by Chilean historian Jose Torobio Medina and Robert Adrian Langdon in The Lost Caravel respectively. Cowie concludes that these Spanish voyages ‚Äòmay have‚Äô‚Äô occurred with more evidence required to prove that they conclusively did. Cowie‚Äôs original research included interviews with elderly residents of the Pouto Peninsula ‚Äì oral tradition which included stories of shipwrecks, intermarriage between wrecked sailors and local Maori, artefacts being found and reburied, and early settlers describing local Maori as having red hair and complexions similar to the Portuguese and Spanish. He concludes that the San Lesmes may have been wrecked on Baylys Brach, Northland, New Zealand and may be buried under the sand there - with more research needed to take the theory from possibility to probability. Local oral tradition and ethnographic evidence supports this theory. Part of Cowie‚Äôs research involved investigating the date of the large Pohutukawa tree at the La Coruna Police Station, endemic to New Zealand. Cowie through the generosity of the late master carver Kerry Strongman, gifted the tree a greenstone taonga representative of the links between Spain and New Zealand. Cowie concludes that ‚Äòon the balance of probabilities‚Äô the Portuguese discovered Australia and New Zealand. Winston Cowie appeared on TVNZ‚Äôs ‚ÄòBreakfast‚Äô programme talking about the Portuguese and Spanish theories on 28 October 2019. Cowie‚Äôs book sparked an international debate on the Spanish and Portuguese discovery subject with articles in El Pais, Mahurangi Matters, Otago Daily Times, the Listener and New Zealand Herald. El Pais, the Spanish national newspaper wrote ‚ÄòTheory that New Zealand was discovered by Spain gains new traction‚Äô, Mahurangi Matters wrote ‚ÄòPieces falling into place in Conquistador trail. In December 2019 and March 2020 Cowie launched a two part competition in his column in the Dive NZ and Pacific magazine entitled The Great New Zealand Historical Treasure Hunt where readers were asked to send in ideas on what additional research could be done to explore the theories further. Cowie is the author of the New Zealand Land Wars historical fiction novel ‚ÄòA Flame Flickers in the Darkness‚Äô which took him six years to write. It was later split into two Amazon Kindle ebooks Greenstone Trail and Flames Flicker. A Flame Flickers in the Darkness follows the adventures of Whero, a young Maori warrior and Jack O‚ÄôMalley, a young Irish whaler during the New Zealand Land Wars of the 1860s .The novel spans the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s with these two fictional characters interacting with the key persons of this period. It covers the First Taranaki War, Waikato War, Second Taranaki War and Te Kooti's East Coast uprising. The book received good reviews, some from the descendants of the real people Cowie wrote about during the land wars period, including from a grandchild of Titokowaru, Kuia Te Rau Oriwa Davis and Sam Priest, a descendant of Captain John Roberts. Since writing the book Cowie has published articles on the importance of New Zealand Land Wars history, also talking on the Radio. He is a supporter of the New Zealand Wars being taught in schools - his most recent article in the NZ Herald: History lessons ‚Äì what makes New Zealand great?

Life Green was born in Wellingborough to Rose Margaret (born Gibbs) and Edwin George Green. Her father was a solicitor's clerk. Her schooling was usual but she was a linguist and studied modern languages at Westfield College, University of London. One of her first teaching jobs was at William Hulme's Grammar School in Manchester where she took the classes of a teacher who was away in the war. From there she obtained her first leadership post as head of Colston's Girls' School in Bristol. She was there until 1954 when she took the job of leading Kidbrooke School, the first purpose-built comprehensive school in London. She was not an educationalist or an intellectual, she would think and then do. She relied on her own experience and common sense to decide the right path. She did keep the accent from her former school and she aimed to deliver grammar style education. She would drive to work and leave the car for the staff to park it, and then don her academic gown to lead whole school assemblies of 2,000 girls. Green was later described as \\"the last of the great 'spinster headmistresses': one of the indomitable women who took command of Britain's wartime and postwar schools, spurred on by the revolutionary changes of the 1944 Education Act\\". The curve-roofed hall of Kidbrooke School (then renamed Corelli College) in 2011 Her new school building was state of the art with parquetry floors, wooden tabletops, gyms, showers and a hall with a curved roof. The school field took land previously used as an Air Training Corps glider school; RAF Kidbrooke was its neighbour. The school uniform was symbolically in Royal Air Force colours, and the Countess Mountbatten of Burma opened the building in June 1955. The Minister for Education Florence Horsbrugh had taken an interest in its creation. She had denied the school an all-abilities (ie comprehensive) intake as a grammar school (Shooter's Hill) was allowed in the same catchment area where it could cream off some of the prospective pupils. One critic commented that the new school would be 'All equal and all stupid'. Green was appointed to the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations where she served for three years until it reported in 1968. In the 1968 New Year Honours she was made a Dame for \\"services to education\\" by Harold Wilson's government. The honour she said was for the school, she was just in the right place at the right time. Later she sat on government bodies looking at the pay of doctors, dentists and nurses. She helped oversee the British press as a governor of the BBC and as a member of the Press Council.

The castle lies within the boundaries of Howth Demesne in the old townland of Correston, close to the townlands of Quarry and Burrow. The castle was probably built on higher ground in order to guard the isthmus at Sutton which was the only route on land to access Howth Castle and the port of Howth. It has historically sometimes been called The Dane's castle.  History  It appears that the area surrounding the castle was inhabited by the Cornwalsh family of Welsh origin in medieval times with the nearby hill and their Welsh origin giving them their name. It is unknown whether the Cornwalsh family, the later White family or another party actually constructed the castle. The castle was definitively owned by the Whites of St. Catherine in the mid 16th century but passed to Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth in 1579 and may have been improved and upgraded at that time. It was later used as a grandstand and feature on the Howth Park Racecourse (1829 - 1842) by the 30th Lord of Howth. The racecourse circuit ran from near Howth Castle and circled Corr Castle by the Burrow Road. The Lord of Howth's black and white racing colours were later adopted by Howth Celtic Football Club upon establishment of the club on part of the Howth Castle grounds in 1962. 1875 Map of Howth Head showing the layout of Howth Park Racecourse with Corr Castle pinpointed inside the course boundaries The area around the castle was used as a quarry for much of the late 19th and early 20th century with the tower and out buildings along with a windmill water-pump some of the few structures left standing in the immediate area. More substantial remains of the castle can clearly be seen in photos taken by Francis Browne SJ in the 1930s which appear to show part of external castle walls or a bawn. After being partially restored in the early 2000s, the castle is now secured and sits within a private apartment complex as an architectural feature although it still can be clearly viewed from the nearby Howth Road.  Status and Features  Corr Castle as seen from the Howth Road East side of Corr Castle showing machicolations The castle is recorded on the Fingal County Council Record of Protected Structures (RPS 0551) with the description - Remains of 16th century castle of St. Lawrence family in open space at centre of apartment development. The castle is also recorded on the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP DU015-025) which notes the architectural detailing and archaeological significance of the building. Among the identifiable features include the remains of a bawn wall, turrets, garderobe chutes - which could have had various uses over time, battlements and machicolations and a chamber with a corbelled roof. Although the tower has various defensive features, it is not clear that defense was the primary purpose of the building and rather functioned as a look-out tower and more as accommodation over time. Other more decorative features which have been recorded on the castle since the 18th century include a cut stone fireplace, pointed cut stone arch windows and a number of carved features including a bold chamfer with a defaced floral finial on the North East edge of the main tower and a rude human face on a projecting stone on the East side. Archaeological testing in the area immediately surrounding the tower has recorded evidence of habitation as far back as the 13th and 14th century. Today the tower is well preserved and protected by virtue of its specific status. It now sits in a gated apartment complex with no new building permitted in the vicinity.

Description  Adults reach 29 to 34 mm in body length, of which 20‚Äì24 mm is abdomen. Males are distinguished by a flattened orange abdomen with a line of drop-shaped spots along each side and clubbed overall appearance - i.e. widest at the tip. They closely resemble males of the ruddy darter, which have more evenly flattened abdomen and noticeably darker pterostigmata. Adults fly in the late summer. They are weak fliers.  Habitat and distribution  Female It breeds in temporary water bodies, which dry out in the autumn and are re- filled in late spring when the snow melts. It can also colonize reservoirs and paddy fields where such water dynamic is maintained by humans. Furthermore, it is thought to have spread across some parts of Europe thanks to carp aquaculture which creates similar conditions. The species is distributed across temperate parts of Eurasia from Western Europe to Japan, but is absent from steppes and deserts of Central Asia. The majority of the European population inhabits Alpine slopes and lowlands of east Germany and Poland. In the rest of the distribution range, it is only present locally. The European population is in decline due to intensification of land use and abandoning traditional agriculture, unlike populations of many other dragonfly species which have rebounded in the past few decades because of reduction in water pollution. It it thus regarded vulnerable in Europe.

The arena replaced the old R√∏dovre Ice Skating Hall (R√∏dovre Sk√∏jtehal) with the nickname Kostalden (cow shed), which was in the northeastern part of R√∏dovre at R√∏dovrevej. R√∏dovre Sk√∏jte Arena is located on R√∏dovre Parkvej and is built together with the sporting arena R√∏dovrehallen via an entrance foyer. From this foyer there is access to both the spectator seats and the basement where the changing rooms are located. On the western end, the arena is connected to a secondary practice rink. The R√∏dovre Ice Skating Arena was built after a Norwegian model, in particular the ice hockey arena that were built for the Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer. This is reflected, among other things, in the roof construction, which slopes out towards R√∏dovre Parkvej, so that the seating area on the opposite side is higher and can accommodate more spectators. The arena has a total capacity of 3,600 spectators, with 2,012 seated and standing sections behind each goal, making it one of the larger ice hockey arenas in Denmark. The attendance record of 3,600 was set on 23 March 1998 in a game against the Frederikshavn White Hawks. In 2009 a practice rink was built in connection with the main arena. The practice rink is built to North American size, making it smaller than the IIHF size used in Denmark. On top of the practice rink there is an indoor tennis court. In 2020, an LED scoreboard was added over centre ice. Also in 2020, the boards will be replaced with a more flexible variety.

Commissioned in 1734 by the knight Felician de Savasse, it was sculpted by Pietro Paolo Troisi and cast by Aloisio Bouchut. In 1736 it was installed at Fort Manoel in Malta, and it was subsequently relocated a number of times. It was moved to Piazza Tesoreria in Valletta in 1858, to the entrance of The Mall gardens in Floriana in 1891, and to its present location at Pope John XXIII Square in Floriana in 1989. History The parade ground of Fort Manoel, where the statue stood from 1736 to 1858 The life-sized statue of Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena was commissioned in 1734 by Felician de Savasse, a French knight of the Order of St John who was seeking the favour of the Grand Master. The statue is attributed to Pietro Paolo Troisi, who might have been appointed as Master of the Mint by Vilhena in 1736 in recognition of his work. The statue was formerly attributed to the Italian sculptor Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, but this is now regarded as unlikely. The statue was cast in bronze by Aloisio Bouchut (also known as Louis Bouchet) at the foundry of the Order in Malta. It was installed in the parade ground (known as the Gran Piazza or Piazza d'Armi) of Fort Manoel in 1736. The cost was 2159 scudi, 5 tar√¨ and 14 grani, but Savasse only paid Bouchut 100 scudi and left the island as he had financial difficulties. Bouchut tried to acquire the money he was due in a lengthy legal battle, but both Bouchut and Savasse died before the matter was resolved. In 1775, Bouchut's widow was eventually granted 800 scudi as compensation, which were paid for by the Manoel Foundation on the orders of Grand Master Francisco Xim√©nez de Tejada. Piazza Tesoreria in Valletta, where the statue stood from 1858 to 1891 (19th century photo by Giorgio Sommer with the Vilhena statue visible) In 1840, the piazza of Fort Manoel including the Vilhena statue was the subject of the earliest known photographs of Malta. The photographer was the French artist Horace Vernet, and the photos were taken while he was quarantined at the nearby Lazzaretto. It is documented that the photographs were taken in the presence of a group of guests including Governor Henry Bouverie. Today the photos themselves seem to be lost. In 1858, the statue was relocated from the fort to Piazza Tesoreria in front of the Bibliotheca in Valletta. The relocation was carried out at the initiative of Governor John Le Marchant who wanted to place the statue in a prominent public space. Two commemorative bronze medals which are believed to have been presented by Soldani Benzi to Vilhena were discovered in the statue's base during the relocation. Entrance to the Mall gardens in Floriana, where the statue stood from 1891 to 1989 (except for a brief period during World War II) To commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, it was decided to replace Vilhena's statue at Piazza Tesoreria with a statue of the monarch. This was installed in 1891, and at this point the Grand Master's statue was moved to the entrance of The Mall Gardens in Floriana. Shortly before or during World War II, the statue was dismantled and relocated slightly outwards from the garden. In 1970 there were proposals to move the statue back to its original location at Fort Manoel, but the plans were not carried out. The statue was relocated once again in 1989 when a monument commemorating the 25th anniversary of Malta's independence was installed near the entrance of the Mall. At this point, Vilhena's statue was moved to Pope John XXIII Square, also in Floriana, where it remains today. The Malta Environment and Planning Authority scheduled the statue as a Grade 1 monument on 8 May 2012. Description The monument and its pedestal in its present location The bronze statue is regarded as a masterpiece of Baroque sculpture, and it is a life-sized depiction of Grand Master Vilhena in full regalia. He is shown standing in a majestic pose, wearing a wig and clothed with a coat, breastplate, cape and boots. The statue is placed on a marble pedestal. Legacy In 1938, the statue was depicted on a 6d Malta stamp along with Fort Manoel and the then-reigning British monarch George VI. In 1948 this stamp was reissued with a Self-Government overprint and it remained in regular use until the mid-1950s.

In Katharina Weigand (ed.): M√ºnchner Historiker zwischen Politik und Wissenschaft. 150 Jahre Historisches Seminar der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t. Munich 2010, , here . In 1911 Schnabel entered the Baden teaching profession as a teacher's candidate, but took leave of absence at the beginning of 1914 to work on a History of the Baden Estates on behalf of the . The project could not be realised due to the outbreak of the First World War: Schnabel was drafted in April 1915, served on the Western Front throughout the war and was not released from the army until February 1919. He immediately returned to the Baden school system and taught Latin, French and history at Karlsruhe schools: 1919/20 at the , Germany's first grammar school for girls, and 1920 to 1922 at the Goethe-Gymnasium Karlsruhe, a secondary school for boys.Angela Borgstedt: Bildungskonzeption und Bildungspraxis bei Franz Schnabel. In Peter Steinbach/Angela Borgstedt (ed.): Franz Schnabel. Der Historiker des freiheitlichen Verfassungsstaates. Berlin 2009, , here . Parallel to his teaching, Schnabel, encouraged by the teacher Oncken, pursued his scientific career and habilitated as early as 1920 at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with the paper Geschichte der Ministerverantwortlichkeit in Baden, supervised by Hermann W√§tjen. As early as 1922 he was appointed to the historical chair at the Technical University of Karlsruhe, which he held until his dismissal in 1936. In addition to his professorship, Schnabel served as director of the from 1924 to 1927.Friedrich Hermann Schubert: Franz Schnabel und die Geschichtswissenschaft des 20. Jahrhunderts. In Historische Zeitschrift 205 (1967), , here . Schnabel's years at the Karlsruhe chair were characterised by extraordinary productivity. Following his habilitation thesis, he continued his research on early constitutionalism in Baden and in 1927 published two concise biographies of the Baden politicians, compiled from archival material Sigismund von Reitzenstein and Ludwig von Liebenstein.Franz Schnabel: Sigismund von Reitzenstein. Der Begr√ºnder des badischen Staates. Heidelberg 1927 und Ludwig von Liebenstein. Ein Geschichtsbild aus den Anf√§ngen des s√ºddeutschen Verfassungslebens. Karlsruhe 1927. Already in 1920 Schnabel had taken over the elaboration of a source study, which was to achieve for modern history what Wilhelm Wattenbach had achieved for the Middle Ages; the work, published in 1931 and still relevant today, made the sources of the Reformation period accessible until 1550, but was not continued by Schnabelt.Franz Schnabel: Deutschlands geschichtliche Quellen und Darstellungen in der Neuzeit. 1. Teil: Das Zeitalter der Reformation, 1500‚Äì1550. Leipzig/Berlin 1931. In the same year 1931, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the death of Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein, Schnabel published a brief biography of the Prussian reformer, who was accused by Gerhard Ritter of instrumentalizing Stein for current political purposes; Schnabel and Ritter discussed this question controversially.Ritters Kritik und Schnabels Replik in Neue Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Wissenschaft und Jugendbildung 8 (1932), ; Beak's response was reprinted in Peter Steinbach/Angela Borgstedt (ed.): Franz Schnabel. Der Historiker des freiheitlichen Verfassungsstaates. Berlin 2009, . In the Weimar years, Schnabel also emerged as a textbook author: his textbook Geschichte der neuesten Zeit, first published in 1923 by B. G. Teubner Verlag, was also published as an independent work for other circles,Als Schulbuch: Geschichte der neuesten Zeit (Teubners geschichtliches Unterrichtswerk f√ºr h√∂here Lehranstalten. Grundri√ü der Geschichte f√ºr die Oberstufe, Teil III.) Leipzig/Berlin 1923; selb edited: 1789‚Äì1919. Eine Einf√ºhrung in die Geschichte der neuesten Zeit. Leipzig/Berlin 1923. had several editions and was still relevant for students after 1945.Eberhard Weis: Einleitung. In Franz Schnabel: Deutsche Geschichte im neunzehnten Jahrhundert. Vol. 1: Die Grundlagen. Munich 1987, , here . Above all, however, Schnabel's main work since the mid-1920s was the Deutsche Geschichte im neunzehnten Jahrhundert, which appeared in four volumes in 1929, 1933, 1934 and 1937. In this unfinished work, which did not go beyond the year 1840, Schnabel attempted to analyse the political history as well as the social, cultural, economic and technological history of the 19th century in their interaction and to interpret them as prerequisites for the \\"cultural crisis\\" of the 20th century. A fifth volume entitled Das Erwachen des deutschen Volkstums was completed by Schnabel as a manuscript, but could not be published because of the Nazi censorship. In contrast to most historians of his time, Schnabel had a positive attitude towards the Weimar Republic, which he expressed in public, in lectures and in his scientific work, but without becoming involved in party politics. His campaign reached a climax in October 1932, when he spoke out in the Hochland magazine against the Preu√üenschlag of the Papen government. His text Neudeutsche Reichsreform began with the dramatic words: \\"Even if the discussion should be closed and in the future will only be dictated in the German fatherland, it remains the duty of the spiritual leading class to raise its voice as long as this is possible\\".Der Text wurde wiederabgedruckt in: Franz Schnabel: Abhandlungen und Vortr√§ge 1914‚Äì1965. Edited by Heinrich Lutz. Freiburg/Basel/Vienna 1970, , quote . Despite his clear commitment to the rule of law and federalism, a phase can be discerned after his accession to power, in which Schnabel took part in efforts to build a bridge between Catholicism and National Socialism, for example by taking up the concept of the St√§ndestaates or the Reich concept.Thomas Hertfelder: Franz Schnabel. In Katharina Weigand (ed.): Munich historian between politics and science. 150th anniversary of the Ludwig- Maximilians-University's Department of History. Munich 2010, , here . This phase ended in 1935 at the latest, when Schnabel was indirectly affected by Walter Frank's actions against his teacher Hermann Oncken: In his article against Oncken, Frank casually referred to Schnabel as a \\"clerical historian\\" and insinuated regime hostility. On 15 July 1936, Schnabel was released in Karlsruhe.Thomas Hertfelder: Franz Schnabel. In Katharina Weigand (ed.): Munich historian between politics and science. 150th anniversary of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University's Department of History. Munich 2010, , here . He immediately moved to Heidelberg, where he lived as a private scholar until 1945. In these years, Schnabel published mainly articles on cultural history in the daily press, especially in the Frankfurter ZeitungThomas Hertfelder: Franz Schnabel and German Historical Studies. Historiography between historicism and cultural criticism (1910-1945). Vol. 2, G√∂ttingen 1998, (chronological listing of Schnabel's contributions in the daily and weekly press). In addition he published essaysExamples Franz Schnabel: \\"The Legitimacy of the Nation. In Hochland, 48th year (1940/41) {{pp.139150}. and numerous reviews in the magazine Hochland, until it had to be discontinued in 1941, as well as in other journals.Thomas Hertfelder: Franz Schnabel und die deutsche Geschichtswissenschaft.

Vol. 2, G√∂ttingen 1998, (Liste s√§mtlicher Beitr√§ge Schnabels in Zeitschriften und Sammelwerken) and (Liste among others s√§mtlicher Rezensionen Schnabels). In 1944, Schnabel would almost still have been called up for military service, despite his 57 years in the meantime, but was released through the intervention of the friendly ex-general .Peter Herde: Zwei gescheiterte Berufungen, in Helmut Kn√ºppel, Manfred Osten, Uwe Rosenbaum, Julius Schoeps, Peter Steinbach: Verbindungen zwischen Bildung, Wissenschaft, Kultur, Geschichte und Politik, . Verlag f√ºr Berlin-Brandenburg, Berlin 2007 In September 1945 Schnabel was appointed state director for education and culture in the district of Baden, the northern part of the newly formed state W√ºrttemberg-Baden. He owed this appointment to his acquaintance with Heinrich K√∂hler, who was the district president at that time. In October 1945 Schnabel was also reinstated as professor in Karlsruhe. However, he now aspired to a professorship at a university, preferably in Heidelberg. An opportunity arose in 1946 when Willy Andreas had to vacate his chair under pressure from the American occupying power. Schnabel pursued his appointment, against which the philosophical faculty in Heidelberg massively resisted. In the background were Schnabel's statements from 1945, in which he had reproached the University of Heidelberg in particular for having attracted the future Nazi elites even before 1933. Against the attempt of the state government to enforce its cult official Schnabel in Heidelberg, the university gave an expert opinion that was devastating for SchnabelText des Gutachtens in: Peter Steinbach/Angela Borgstedt (ed.): Franz Schnabel. Der Historiker des freiheitlichen Verfassungsstaates. Berlin 2009, . and was able to prevent the appeal. Schnabel drew the consequences from his broken relationship with the university and resigned as state director.Zum gesamten Vorgang: Thomas Hertfelder: Franz Schnabel. In Katharina Weigand (ed.): M√ºnchner Historiker zwischen Politik und Wissenschat. 150 Jahre Historisches Seminar der Ludwig- Maximilians-Universit√§t. Munich 2010, , here . Already in the summer of 1945 the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich approached Schnabel with the question whether he would accept an appointment. In Munich in early summer 1945, numerous professors had been dismissed under pressure from the American occupying forces, including Heinrich K√∂hler, who had held the chair of Middle and Modern History. Schnabel showed interest in this professorship, but did not definitely accept it. This for two reasons: on the one hand he would have preferred an appointment in Heidelberg, on the other hand he disliked the fact that it was considered to rededicate said chair to a in order to be able to appoint the Protestant Hermann Heimpel to the previous Concordat Chair of Medieval History. Schnabel did not accept the chair in Munich until February 10, 1947, after his Heidelberg ambitions had been shattered and the rededication of the chair after Heimpel's failed appointment was off the table. Schnabel was already teaching as a visiting professor in Munich in the summer of 1947 and took over the chair of Medieval and Modern History, which had held as a substitute, on 1 November 1947.Thomas Hertfelder: Franz Schnabel. In Katharina Weigand (ed.): M√ºnchner Historiker zwischen Politik und Wissenschaft. 150 Jahre Historisches Seminar der Ludwig-Maximilians- Universit√§t. Munich 2010, , here . When Schnabel had reached retirement age in 1955, he was privileged to determine the date of his retirement himself. In fact, he was only retired at his own request after the 1962 summer semester at the age of almost 75 and continued to lecture until 1964.Karl Bosl: Franz Schnabel 18.12.1887‚Äì25.2.1966. In Jahrbuch Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften 1966 (1967) , here (online). He was the only professor in Munich who represented the history of modern times and always resisted an increase in the teaching staff; thus the chair was divided only after his retirement into one for early modern history and one for modern history, to which Fritz Wagner and were appointed.Winfried Schulze: 150 Jahre deutsche Geschichtswissenschaft in M√ºnchen. In Katharina Weigand (ed.): M√ºnchner Historiker zwischen Politik und Wissenschaft. 150 Jahre Historisches Seminar der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t. Munich 2010, , here in the Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften of which he was president from 1951 to 1959. Since 1948 he was also a full member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Schnabel's years at the Munich chair differed markedly from his time in Karlsruhe. While his own research had been the focus of his work there, in Munich he concentrated entirely on his role as an academic teacher. The expert in constitutional law Ernst-Wolfgang B√∂ckenf√∂rde, who received his doctorate in history under Schnabel, passed on Schnabel's statement in this regard: \\"I am of the opinion that in today's world everyone should be able to carry out a socially necessary activity. And I believe that teaching to students is socially more necessary than writing your own books. It was clear to me when I accepted the call to Munich that I would not be coming here to continue my work on my German history.\\"Ernst-Wolfgang B√∂ckenf√∂rde: Erinnerungen an Franz Schnabel. In Franz Schnabel. Zu Leben und Werk (1887‚Äì1966). Vortr√§ge zur Feier seines 100. Geburtstages. Munich 1988, , here . Schnabel's lectures in the Gro√üe Aula or in the Auditorium maximum, always held on Monday and Tuesday afternoon for two hours each, always had 800 to 1200 listeners. They were also well attended by students of other subjects and from the M√ºnchner Stadtgesellschaft.Eberhard Weis: Vorwort.In Franz Schnabel. Zu Leben und Werk (1887‚Äì1966). Vortr√§ge zur Feier seines 100. Geburtstages. Munich 1988, . Schnabel became a magnet for the University of Munich, attracting students,As reported by Hans Maier from personal experience: Bad years, good years. A Life 1931 ff. Munich 2011, and from Ernst-Wolfgang B√∂ckenf√∂rde: Memories of Franz Schnabel. In \\"Franz Schnabel. On life and work (1887-1966). Lectures in celebration of his 100th birthday. Munich 1988, , here . comparable only with Romano Guardini. It was only in the Munich years that Schnabel was able to train his own academic students, including Franz Herre, Heinrich Lutz, Karl Otmar von Aretin, Friedrich Hermann Schubert, Eberhard Weis, Erich Angermann, Lothar Gall, Hans Schmidt, Peter Hoffmann, Peter Kr√ºger, Adelheid von Saldern and Karl-Egon L√∂nne. Schnabel's four-volume Deutsche Geschichte im neunzehnten Jahrhundert was reprinted unchanged between 1947 and 1951, appeared in 1964/65 in an eight-volume paperback edition and was last published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag in 1987. Schnabel did not work on a continuation of his main work after 1945, nor did he print the fifth volume of the work. After his death his appearance was announced,Friedrich Hermann Schubert: Franz Schnabel und die Geschichtswissenschaft des 20. Jahrhunderts. In Historische Zeitschrift 205 (1967), , here . later still asked for from time to time,Beispielsweise von Ernst-Wolfgang B√∂ckenf√∂rde: Erinnerungen an Franz Schnabel. I Franz Schnabel.

Thomas Hertfelder vertrat die Auffassung, dies sei \\"zu Schnabels Gl√ºck\\" nicht geschehen: Schnabel habe in diesem Band in einer Mischung aus Zensur und Selbstzensur liberale Positionen preisgegeben und sich von der westeurop√§ischen politischen Tradition abgewandt.Thomas Hertfelder: Franz Schnabel. In Katharina Weigand (ed.): M√ºnchner Historiker zwischen Politik und Wissenschaft. 150 Jahre Historisches Seminar der Ludwig-Maximilians- Universit√§t. Munich 2010, , here (as well as the quote). Schnabel continued his career as a textbook author after the war. Other publications of the Munich years were mostly the result of lectures that were initiated by anniversaries, such as in 1951 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Verlag HerderFranz Schnabel: Der Buchhandel und der geistige Aufstieg der abendl√§ndischen V√∂lker. Freiburg im Breisgau 1951. or 1958 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Munich Historical Commission.Franz Schabel: Die Idee und die Erscheinung. In Die Historische Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. 1858-1958. G√∂ttingen 1958, . Schnabel's great concern after the end of the Third Reich and as a reaction to it was the renewal of the humanistic educational idea, for which his 1955 academy lecture Das humanistische Bildungsgut im Wandel von Staat und Gesellschaft is characteristic.Franz Schnabel: Das humanistische Bildungsgut im Wandel von Staat und Gesellschaft. Festrede gehalten in der √∂ffentlichen Sitzung der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften in M√ºnchen am 3. Dezember 1955. Munich 1956. Schnabel took part in the debates after 1945 about the person and work of Otto von Bismarck, and in a review of the Bismarck biography of Erich Eyck he argued that the Kleindeutsche L√∂sung of the German Question had been a mistake.Lothar Gall: Introduction to Lothar Gall (ed.): Das Bismarck-Problem in der Geschichtsschreibung nach 1945. Cologne/Berlin 1971, , here ; here also Schnabel's contribution of 1949: Das Problem Bismarck, . Well-known colleagues, including Gerhard Ritter, who had already criticized Schnabel's liberal interpretation of Freiherr vom Stein in the early 1930s, argued against Schnabel's position. Schnabel's grave at the Hauptfriedhof Mannheim The grave of his parents Karl and Maria (n√©e Guillemin) as well as his sister Katharina were laid to rest. Next to Schnabel his sister Maria (1889-1971) was buried, who took care of him for decades.Wolfgang M√ºnkel: Die Friedh√∂fe in Mannheim.

Verl.-Anstalt, Mannheim 1992, .  Honours  In 1954 Schnabel was awarded honorary citizenship of the city of Mannheim, and in 1961 he received the Bavarian Order of Merit. Schnabel was an honorary doctor of engineering and political science (Aachen and Munich) and an honorary member of the British Historical Association and the American Historical Association.

His first releases were as the lead singer and guitarist for industrial metal band Raubtier in 2009, and then country-rock group Bourbon Boys. Since 2017 he has been active as a solo artist, making Nordic folk influenced power metal under the name Hulkoff. Hulkoff's solo sound has been compared to that of fellow power metal band Sabaton. In fact he featured their lead singer, Joakim Brod√©n, on his 2017 album Kven. He started his interest in music around age nine, and he can sing fluently in both his native Swedish and English. In his life outside of music, Hulkoff is a keen hunter and outdoors man.  Works and style  Hulkoff's original band was Raubtier. They released their first album, Det finns bara krig, in 2009. He released his first country-rock album with Bourbon Boys, Shotguns, Trucks & Cattle, in 2013. The album was praised for its 'fast and catchy' tunes with 'whisky-soaked vocals'. Hulkoff's first solo record Kven was released in 2017. It received more mixed reviews, with some critics praising its 'formidable force' as 'true warrior metal'. However, others noted the fairly conventional song structure and 'genre-typical melodies' in some parts. That same year, Hulkoff also contributed a country- rock song, entitled These Guns, to the soundtrack of the flight simulator video game Flying Tigers: Shadows Over China. In early 2020 he released a new solo single, Ingvar, which he revealed was from an upcoming album entitled Pansarfolk. The album will be released in two editions, one with the lyrics sung in English and the other in Swedish. Pansarfolk was released on the 25th of September and sold out of all physical copies on pre-order alone. It hit number one on the Swedish heavy metal album charts during the first week of release. Anders Johannsson, former drummer with HammerFall and now ManOWar, features on most tracks on the album. It also includes more traditional Nordic instrumentation than previous Hulkoff albums, including the Talharpa and the Nyckelharpa.

He is a member of the Meijer family, the billionaire owners of the Meijer supermarket chain. Early life and education Meijer was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He is the oldest son of Hank Meijer and the grandson of supermarket chain founder Frederik Meijer. His father's family has been recognized as one of the wealthiest in the state of Michigan by Forbes, with a net worth above $6 billion. He initially studied for one year at the United States Military Academy at West Point before transferring to Columbia University in 2008, graduating with a bachelor's degree in cultural anthropology in 2012. From 2008 to 2016, Meijer served in the United States Army Reserve and was deployed to Iraq from 2010 into 2011, serving as an intelligence advisor. In 2017, Meijer graduated from New York University with a Master's Degree in Business Administration. Career=Analyst career From 2013 to 2015, Meijer worked as a conflict analyst for International NGO Safety Organisation. He was later employed by Olympia Development of Michigan of Ilitch Holdings as an analyst from April 2018 to January 2019. During this time, Meijer also worked on veterans projects such as Project Rubicon, was on the advisory board of the With Honor super political action committee and assisted with urban renewal projects throughout Michigan. Political career Following Justin Amash's departure from the Republican Party in July 2019, Meijer announced his candidacy for Michigan's 3rd congressional district, competing in the Republican primary. Meijer voiced his support for President Donald Trump, stating he would work with the president to \\"make sure that we advance policies and an agenda that is in the best interest of West Michigan\\". Meijer has received campaign funding from several wealthy Michigan-based business families and raised more money than any other Republican candidate. The DeVos and Van Andel families, who co-founded Amway, have funded Meijer's campaign, though United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and her husband Dick DeVos abstained from fundraising efforts. Mark J. Bissell of Bissell home-care products and businessman Peter Secchia have also provided funds for Meijer's campaign. Representative Dan Crenshaw, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Representative Steve Scalise, and Senator Tom Cotton have all endorsed Meijer. Meijer defeated Lynn Afendoulis in the August 4 primary election. He will face Hillary Scholten in the general election. ArtPrize drag show dispute During the ArtPrize's Project 1 dynamic art festival, Meijer refused to host Drag Syndrome, a London-based group that hosted drag performers with Down syndrome, at the Tanglefoot art venue, a property he owned. Meijer said he had consulted various groups and that he believed that the performers were being exploited, stating to ArtPrize organizers that \\"[t]he involvement of individuals whose ability to act of their own volition is unclear raises serious ethical concerns that I cannot reconcile\\" and that the performances were to \\"further an activist message\\". The American Civil Liberties Union filed a civil rights complaint to the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, claiming that Meijer discriminated against the \\"disability of the performer and the nature of their performance due to stereotypes regarding gender expression.\\" Meijer said he would not \\"stop or apologize for doing what is right\\".

As of 17 June 2020, the trial included six proposed interventions: five repurposed drugs and convalescent plasma. Treatments The following treatments are allocated at random to hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 infection: * No additional treatments (i.e., standard hospital care) * Azithromycin (an antibiotic) * Tocilizumab (an anti-inflammatory) * Convalescent plasma (blood plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and which may contain antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus) * Intravenous Immunoglobulin (children only) * REGN-COV2 (a cocktail of anti-viral antibodies). The following treatments have previously been included in the trial: * Lopinavir-Ritonavir (an HIV medication) * Low-dose dexamethasone (a steroid, which reduces inflammation) * Hydroxychloroquine (used to treat malaria and rheumatism) The Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine arms were closed to new entrants after being shown to be ineffective Dexamethasone was closed to new adult entries after positive results. Design The RECOVERY Trial is a large-scale, randomized controlled trial. When people who have been hospitalised with COVID-19 are enrolled in the trial, they are automatically randomized to receive one (or none) of the trial treatments. The primary objective of the trial is to \\"provide reliable estimates of the effect of study treatments on all-cause mortality at 28 days after first randomisation.\\" It is an \\"open label\\" study: people receiving the treatment and the attending clinicians both know which treatment is being administered. It is a multi-arm adaptive clinical trial. New treatments can be added into the trial as it progresses, and other treatment \\"arms\\" closed to new enrolment when results have been produced. The trial protocol was developed to minimize the administrative load on hospital staff who at the time (March 2020) were facing the prospect of overwhelming numbers of COVID-19 admissions. Operations The trial is run by the Nuffield Departments of Population Health and of Medicine at the University of Oxford. The study is led by Peter Horby and Martin Landray who serve was Co-Chief Investigators of the Trial. The trial is run at 176 NHS hospitals in the UK, involving many thousands of health professionals. The trial began in March 2020 and has an estimated duration through June 2021. As of October 2020, the trial had enrolled more than 14,000 COVID-19 participants admitted to hospitals in the UK. Results=Dexamethasone Mortality over 28 days for 1007 COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation at time of randomisation: 324 patients who received dexamethasone (red) compared to 683 who received standard hospital care (black) On 22 June 2020, preliminary results were published in a preprint showing that low-dose dexamethasone treatment reduced the death rate by one third in hospitalized people needing ventilators due to severe COVID-19 infection, and by one fifth in people treated with oxygen therapy. There was no benefit (and the possibility of harm) among people who did not require oxygen. The preliminary report was subsequently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. =Impacts= Six days before the pre-print, these results had been announced in a news release. A UK Therapeutic Alert was issued the same day, and all the Chief Medical Officers in the United Kingdom exceptionally recommended an immediate change of UK-wide clinical practice, in advance of publication of any final paper. Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint. Based on the preliminary, unpublished results of the RECOVERY trial, the US National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommended dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 who are on mechanical ventilation or those who require supplemental oxygen, and recommended against dexamethasone for those not requiring supplemental oxygen. Other countries granted specific approval for the drug as part of standard medical care; such as Japan, Taiwan and South Africa. A pre-print study, which was awarded HDR UK Open Access Publication of the Month for August 2020, found that the discovery would save approximately 650,000 lives globally over the course of 6 months. =Limitations of dexamethasone result= Mortality over 28 days for 1535 COVID-19 patients not receiving oxygen at time of randomisation: 501 patients who received dexamethasone (red) compared to 1034 who received standard hospital care (black) * John Fletcher, research editor at the BMJ, notes that there are \\"limitations and causes of concern\\" in the dexamethasone results. * Around a third of patients in the trial were still in hospital at the end of the 28-day trial period, so their final outcomes are not known. * As an immunosuppressive drug, there are fears that dexamethasone could make the illness worse, and prolong the infection in patients where the immune system has not yet overreacted and caused inflammation. * The preprint authors themselves warn that \\"the results are consistent with possible harm\\" in patients who did not require oxygen at the time of enrolment. The trial observed a 22% increase in mortality in these patients (rate ratio 1.22 [95% Confidence Interval 0.93 to 1.61]; p=0.14), though this observation may still be due to chance. * Responding to the publication, the WHO emphasized that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision, stating that \\"There is no evidence this drug works for patients with mild disease or as a preventative measure, and it could cause harm.\\" =Confirmation of dexamethasone result= The results of this initial finding have now been replicated in a systematic review by the World Health Organization's Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies (REACT) Working Group. Hydroxychloroquine On 5 June 2020, the trial determined that there was no clinical benefit from use of hydroxychloroquine in people hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine saw a 25.7% 28-day mortality compared to a 23.5% 28-day mortality in those treated with standard care. The trial also showed that hydroxychloroquine was correlated with longer hospital stays and progression to invasive ventilation, but not with cardiac arrhythmia. Patients received substantial doses of hydroxychloroquine (400mg every 12h, after two loading doses of 800mg), higher than other trials.http://www.francesoir.fr/oxford-recovery-hospital-test- overdose-hard-pills-swallow Preprint published on July 15 2020 stated: \\"the 4-aminoquinoline drugs are relatively weak antivirals <...> Thus, to provide the greatest chance of providing benefit in life threatening COVID-19, the dose regimen was designed to result in rapid attainment and maintenance of plasma concentrations that were as high as safely possible.\\" The results are available on medRxiv.Horby, Peter, et al. ‚ÄúEffect of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: Preliminary Results from a Multi-Centre, Randomized, Controlled Trial.‚Äù MedRxiv, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1 Jan. 2020, =Limitations of hydroxychloroquine result= The trial did not address its use as prophylaxis or in patients with less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection managed in the community, though the RECOVERY Trial was specifically performed in the hospital context and another study by Oxford, the COPCOV trial, exists for the purpose of evaluating hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis. Nor did it trial the use of HCQ in combination with azithromycin as has been suggested by some observational studies. Lopinavir-ritonavir On 29 June 2020, chief investigators of the trial reported there was no clinical benefit from use of lopinavir-ritonavir in 1,596 people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection over 28 days of treatment. , the results have not been published.

It is believed that after the construction of the Sand Bath, the first periods were supplied with water taken from Ovdan. A very small part of Ovdan is on the ground, the main part is under the ground. 40 underground stair steps that are carved out of bedrock go straight down to the water source, which is at a distance of 15 meters from the entrance. Since the underground part of the building is in the form of an arched corridor, the possibility of collapse is non-existent due to the pressure of the weight of the soil layer on it. In the past, Balakhani used to get drinkable water from this source. Ovdan was used by the population until the occupation in April 1920. In the following periods, it was neglected.

The studio was founded in 1959 by separating from the state Kyiv studio of popular science films (Kyivnaukfilm). It operated until 2019, when was liquidated by joining the Dovzhenko Film Centre.  History  In 1959, on the basis of the Kyiv Studio of Popular Science Films (Kyivnaukfilm), an art animation workshop was established, which was soon transformed into the Creative Association of Artistic Animation, headed by Ipolyt Lazarchuk and later by Iryna Hurvych. In 1961, the first films of the studio were released ‚Äî \\"The Adventures of Pepper\\" and \\"Vesnyanka\\". At this time, many young artists and directors joined the studio. In particular ‚Äî Alla Grachova, Yevgeny Sivokon, Davyd Cherkaskyi, Efrem Pruzhansky, Volodymyr Dakhno, Volodymyr Honcharov, Mark Draitsun, Caesar Orshansky, Ivan Budz, Borys Khranevych, Yuriy Skirda, Eduard Kyrych, Mykola Churilov, Heinrich Umanskyi, Radna Sakhaltuyev, Oleksandr Lavrov, Konstantyn Chikin, Oleksandr Viken. In the 1970s, Iryna Hurvych created films that became the studio's hallmark ‚Äî \\"How Women Sold Men\\" and \\"How Men Taught Women a Good Lesson.\\" Puppet animation was developed intensively. Such directors as Leonid Zarubin, Valentyna Kostyleva, Anatolii Trifonov, Volodymyr Kyryk and such artists as Natalia Okhotymska, Yakiv Gorbachenko, Yurii Skyrda, Mykola Churylov worked in this genre. In the 1980s, the studio created popular serial projects: \\"The Adventures of Three Cossacks\\" (directed by V. Dakhno, animators ‚Äî A. Vadov, E. Kirich, G. Umansky, I. Budz), \\"The Adventures of Captain Wrungel\\", \\" Treasure Island ‚Äù, ‚Äú Doctor Aibolyt'‚Äù (directed by D. Cherkasky, animator ‚Äî R.

Independence  For 1991, Ukranimafilm appeared to be the most experienced team in the post-Soviet space after Moscow's Soyuzmultfilm. Since independence, the studio has made many films. * Krokodyl (‚ÄòThe Crocodile‚Äô, 1991) by Mykhaiol Titov * Mamochka Rozochka i Minechka (‚ÄòMummy Rosochka and Minechka‚Äô, 1993) by Natalia Chernysheva * Bobe-Maices (‚ÄòGrandmother‚Äôs Stories‚Äô, 1993, based on Jewish folklore) by Elena Kasavina * Istoriya odnoho porosia (‚ÄòStory of a Little Pig‚Äô, 1994) by Ludmila Tkachikova * Koza-Dereza (‚ÄòImpudent She-Goat‚Äô, 1995) by Irina Smirnova using an animated painting technique These films were characterized by the fact that they often appealed to national culture, folklore, literature and helped in the search for national identity. The films based on Ukrainian folktales and songs: * Kotyk i Pivnyk (‚ÄòLittle Cat and Little Cock‚Äô, 1991) by Alla Gracheva * Khodyt' Harbuz Po Horodu (‚ÄòThe Pumpkin Walks in the Vegetable Garden‚Äô, 1996) by Valentina Kostyleva * Roukavychka (‚ÄòSmall Mitten‚Äô, 1996) by Natalia Marchenkova * Yak ou Nashoho Omelechka (‚ÄòHow Are Things for Our Melechko‚Äô, 1999) by Evgeny Sivokon The films based on Ukrainian literature: * Topolia (‚ÄòThe Poplar‚Äô, 1996) by Valentina Kostyleva. The film is based on the poem Topolia by Taras Shevchenko * Viy (‚ÄòViy‚Äô, 1996) by Alla Gracheva. The film is based on a horror story Viy by the Ukrainian-born Mykola Gogol Also worth noting are the films directed by Oleg Pedan: * Svitla Osobystist' (‚ÄòLight Personality‚Äô, 2002) * Nikoho nemaye vdoma (‚ÄòThere Was Nobody at Home‚Äô, 2004) * Naimenshyi (‚ÄòThe Smallest One‚Äô, 2007) Despite good results, the studio is gradually declining. The state reduced funding, and some talented and skilled workers emigrated abroad. In the 2000s Ukranimafilm experienced almost no development. Ishov tramvai nomer dev'iat (‚ÄòThe Tram ‚Ññ9 Was Going‚Äô, clay animation, 2002) by Stepan Koval was the most notable Ukranimafilm's product of that period. The film was awarded the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, won at the Molodist International Film Festival, at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and received some other awards at different animation festivals. In 2014, the studio experienced a relative boom, when the series \\"Adventures of Kotygoroshko and his friends\\" and a full-length cartoon Babay were created at public expense. However, in the following years the studio was in decline.

Due to the fact that the microtubes walls thickness is just several nanometers, the material is ultra-lightweight with a density of around 10 mg/cm3, being among the lightest synthetic materials. It was developed by joint efforts of researchers from Technical University of Moldova, University of Kiel, University of Trento, University of New South Wales, and was first reported in a scientific journal in February 2019.Tiginyanu, I., Braniste, T., Smazna, D., Deng, M., Schutt, F., Schuchardt, A., Stevens-Kalceff, M.

Nano Energy 56, 759‚Äì769. Structure and properties Aerogalnite is a pale-yellow freestanding highly porous, mechanically flexible and stretchable inorganic nanomaterial that is both hydrophobic and hydrophilic at the same time. Dum√© I. (2019) \\"Hydrophobic or hydrophilic? Aero-gallium nitride is both\\". PhysicsWorld. https://physicsworld.com/a/hydrophobic-or-hydrophilic-aero- gallium-nitride-is-both/. Rolling a water droplet onto a bed of GaN hollow tetrapods results in the formation of a liquid marble with the entire surface covered with GaN aerotetrapods. Synthesis The synthesis process includes the epitaxial growth of ultrathin layers of GaN on a sacrificial template consisting of an interpenetrated network of ZnO microtetrapods, followed by the gradual removal of the ZnO substrate. It results in a freestanding interpenetrated network of microtubular GaN with an ultrathin layer of ZnO on the inner surface of the walls. ZnO is a suitable substrate for GaN growth due to the fact that both materials have the same crystallographic wurtzite structure, close lattice parameters, and similar thermal expansion coefficients. Potential applications Aerogalnite efficiently blocks electromagnetic field in a wide range of frequencies from X-band to THz region.

The station is primarily serving Jakarta region from the very beginning, in the early years it was airing more urban-oriented programming than TVRI main channel (TVRI Nasional). The single first program to broadcast was English-language news TVRI News for half an hour at 18:30 WIB, under the responsibility of the News section. The program later becomes English News Service (ENS), which still exists to this day on TVRI Nasional. Starting in 2007, Programa 2 changed its name TVRI Jakarta. Later the station changed its name again to TVRI Jakarta & Banten (reflecting the station coverage which includes parts of Banten province, as Banten didn't yet have its own TVRI regional station), and as of 30 March 2019, the name changed back to TVRI Jakarta. Programming In analog terrestrial, instead of acting as an opt-out local programming on TVRI Nasional (as in other TVRI regional stations), TVRI Jakarta is acting as a separate local channel from the very first broadcast. This kind of system is created so that the viewers had a choice between the TVRI national and regional channel. The system later implemented in the digital terrestrial broadcast of all TVRI regional stations, where the stations ideally has its own channel and did not need to opt-out from TVRI Nasional.

Career=U.S. recruitment Sometime in the late 2000s or the early 2010s, Mikhailov was reportedly approached and recruited by U.S. authorities while vacationing in the Mediterranean. Pavel Vrublevsky Mikhailov had known Pavel Vrublevsky, the CEO of ChronoPay, since about 2007. In 2011, and reportedly at times earlier, Mikhailov, in addition to his deputy, Dmitry Dokuchaev, and a Kaspersky Lab employee, Ruslan Stoyanov, had caused classified information about Vrublevsky to be passed along to U.S. intelligence agencies. Mikhailov and Stoyanov had reportedly intended to sell ChronoPay's database for $10 million. Shaltai Boltai In early 2016, Mikhailov's FSB unit had reportedly begun the process of recruiting Vladimir Anikeyev, the ringleader of Shaltai Boltai. By around the summer of 2016, Shaltai Boltai had reportedly been taken over by Mikhailov. In October 2016, Mikhailov had reportedly become alarmed when he learned that Anikeyev had been detained by another unit within the FSB. 2016 U.S. election Around late summer 2016, Mikhailov had reportedly come to the attention of his colleagues in the FSB after U.S. reports had linked Vladimir Fomenko, the owner of King Servers and an alleged business partner of Vrublevsky, to a cyber attack on voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois. Arrest In early December 2016, Mikhailov was arrested in Moscow, reportedly due to information that Vrublevsky had provided to Russian authorities earlier in 2010. Later reports suggested that Mikhailov's arrest had been caused by Vladimir Anikeyev. Mikhailov's arrest was first announced on January 25, 2017. U.S. indictment Mikhailov is strongly suggested to be \\"FSB Officer 3\\" in a March 2017 DOJ indictment. Conviction In February 2019, Mikhailov was sentenced to 22 years in prison for treason. The case reportedly centered around allegations that classified information from the FSB's probe into ChronoPay had been leaked to Kimberly Zenz, a senior threat analyst at Verisign.

Formed in 2009 in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, they have released five albums (including one live recording) since 2010. Their 2019 album, Shine, reached number one on the US Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart. They have opened for the Steve Miller Band, John Mayall, Keb' Mo', Jonny Lang, John Lee Hooker Jr. and Booker T. Jones. Living Blues magazine stated \\"GTBB shows what can happen when the past is distilled through young sensibilities, voices, and instruments. This is 21st century blues at its best.\\" The six piece band uses an unusual array of musical instruments, including organs, cigar box guitars, harmonicas, electric push brooms, plus brass and percussion. Career Matt Isbell, who became the Ghost Town Blues band's frontman, took piano lessons from the age of 10, but was drawn towards the guitar. He learned to play at home on a small guitar with only three viable strings, and played in an open chord style, a technique which he still uses today on his home-made cigar box guitars. Having seen Todd Snider busking on Beale Street, and getting a six- string acoustic Goya dreadnaught for his 12th birthday, Isbell attempted to learn to play every track on Snider's 1994 album, Songs for the Daily Planet. In high school Isbell formed his first band, The Blind Venetians, along with current Ghost Town lead guitarist Taylor Orr. They recorded one record at the joint age of 15, but the band broke up when the members graduated. Isbell then spent the next seven years in a rock band playing cover versions, but when his mother died suddenly from a stroke, Isbell started to reassess his future. In 2007, he became a student in the University of Memphis music business program and released a solo album, Rock Lotto, later becoming a member of the Stax Music Academy SNAP! program. With the intention of forming a new band, Isbell found another young musician in Suavo Jones, an ever-present in the line-up. They were initially joined by Jeremy Powell, a keyboardist who went on to work with Eddie Palmieri and Southern Avenue. While in their formative state, the band's name and now trademark second-line entrance to the stage, arose from their inability to draw a crowd. \\"Nobody was in the club half the time when we'd play,\\" Isbell remembered. \\"We'd say: 'It's a ghost town in here. We must be the Ghost Town Blues Band.'\\" In attempting to boost trade they decided to take their music out on to Beale Street, which led to the origination of their second-line. Their fusion approach to playing is rooted in Isbell's singer- songwriter background, whereas Suavo had a grounding in hip hop. More recent keyboardist recruit, Cedric Taylor, has Southern rock leanings and, after lengthy persuasion, Taylor Orr was employed. Bass player Matt Karner is a native of northern New Jersey, and has a jazz based upbringing. Andrew McNeill is the band's drummer. Debuting in 2009, the outfit was originally a blues rock band, playing music such as the Creedence Clearwater Revival version of Screamin' Jay Hawkins's \\"I Put A Spell On You\\". Nevertheless, their debut album, Dust The Dust (2010), only contained five covers. Released via Inside Sounds, Dust the Dust received radio airplay in both the US and Europe. The recording won the European Independent Music Label Award for 'Top Sound' in blues. The album, Dark Horse, followed in 2012. In 2012, the Ghost Town Blues band played at the Crossroads Blues & Heritage Festival in Rosedale, Mississippi. In 2014 the band, having made the finals for the second year running, came runners up to Mr. Sipp in the International Blues Challenge. Hard Road To Hoe was released in 2015, and the album track's opened with an original composition by Taylor Orr, \\"Another Lover\\". Although it was self released, the album got the band a higher profile. They were nominated for the Best Blues Band Award for the 2015 Blues Blast Music Awards, the first of multiple nominations. They performed for a whole tour as the opening act for the Steve Miller Band, plus played at a number of festivals across the US, and were booked on 12 overseas tours in 2017 and 2018. On February 27, 2018, the Ghost Town Blues Band issued a live album, Backstage Pass, which captured a concert in Memphis on July 29, 2017. It was the band's fourth album. The recording started with a cover of the Beatles' \\"Come Together\\", and provided a showcase for the twin guitars of Taylor Orr and Matt Isbell on their version of The Allman Brothers Band song, \\"Whipping Post\\". Backstage Pass climbed to No. 4 on US Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart. Their latest album, Shine, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Blues Album Chart in October 2019. They had previously headlined on the blues stage at the Montreal International Jazz Festival and performed more than a half-dozen international tours in Canada and Europe in 2019. Musical instruments Isbell is a prolific three string cigar box guitar maker, having manufactured over 450 instruments since 2010. His clientele has included Eric Schrenkman of the Spin Doctors, Cyndi Lauper, Michael Leonhart of Steely Dan and Joe Bonamassa. All guitars are fretless and are designed to play using a slide, of which Isbell makes about 200 a month, manufactured in his home garage.

She is the co-founder and CEO of the children‚Äôs book subscription startup Literati founded in Austin, Texas.  Early History  Jessica Ewing was born in Michigan. She completed her undergraduate degree at Stanford University, where she studied mathematics and artificial intelligence. While at Stanford, she worked in the White House as a research assistant for the senior economic adviser to the president.  Google  After graduating Stanford with a degree in Symbolic Systems, Ewing joined Google and became a senior product manager. During her first year at the company, she was Marissa Mayer‚Äôs deputy. She later worked under Sundar Pichai. She co-authored eight patents while with Google. Some of the patents protected inventions for: module specification for a module to be incorporated into a container document, and methods and system for sharing gadgets between users. Ewing also helped launch iGoogle, which let users customize the Google homepage. Fast Company named her one of Google‚Äôs ‚Äú12 Most Innovative Minds‚Äù. In 2009, Ewing left Google and moved to Hawaii to begin work on a novel.  Literati  Upon finishing her novel, Ewing began reaching out to literary agents and publishing houses but found the experience incohesive. The publishing process, she thought, could be better organized. To address this concern, Ewing built a platform designed to connect writers with publishers and agents. This platform was called Excerpt. Throughout the process of pitching to investors, Ewing‚Äôs platform went through several different iterations. Eventually, Ewing decided to narrow her focus to children‚Äôs books, and in 2016, she co-founded the company called Literati with Kelly Carroll. Literati is a children‚Äôs book club and subscription service that delivers a curated selection of children‚Äôs books to members each month. Ewing is the CEO.

Head coach Bill Whitton led the team for his first year. Only the first two games of Holy Cross' 10-game schedule were played, both away losses. For the team's second game, 13 players were listed as injured, including eight with hepatitis.  Cancellation  Two days after the Dartmouth game, with all team members affected -- 20 players positively ill and 55 \\"probably ill\\" -- the college canceled its remaining games. Coaches and other football staff were also stricken. Worcester city health officials later pinpointed the source of the infection to a water fountain on the football practice field. Players contracted the disease during preseason workouts. Other students on the campus were not affected, including members of the freshman football team, which did not practice with the varsity team in the preseason. Because of the season cancellation, the annual Boston College‚ÄìHoly Cross football rivalry game was not held, the first interruption since 1943. Apart from those two years, the two Jesuit New England universities would meet every year from 1919 to 1986. To replace Holy Cross on its 1969 schedule, Boston College slated Syracuse, which had been scheduled to play Holy Cross in October. BC‚ÄìSyracuse was a familiar matchup by the 1960s, and would later develop into a conference rivalry. The \\"Purple and Silver\\" did take the field one more time in 1969, as the football team from Sacramento State College in California donned Holy Cross Crusaders uniforms for their final home game, November 20, against the University of Puget Sound. Students at the college paid to fly Holy Cross' two team captains, Tom Lamb and Bill Moncevicz, to be their guests at the West Coast game. ScheduleStatistical leaders Statistical leaders for the 1969 Crusaders included: * Rushing: Steve Jutras, 74 yards on 32 attempts * Passing: Howie Burke, 200 yards, 19 completions and 1 touchdown on 40 attempts * Receiving: Eddie Jenkins, 70 yards on 8 receptions * Scoring: Dan Harper, 6 points from 1 touchdown * Total offense: Howie Burke, 193 yards (200 passing, minus-7 rushing) * All-purpose yards: Tom Lamb, 108 yards (56 rushing, 40 receiving, 12 returning) References Holy Cross Category:Holy Cross Crusaders football seasons Holy Cross Crusaders football ","title":"1969 Holy Cross Crusaders football team"},{"id":"64302937","text":"The 2021 UEFA Under-19 Futsal Championship (also known as UEFA Under-19 Futsal Euro 2021) will be the second edition of the UEFA Under-19 Futsal Championship, the biennial international youth futsal championship organised by UEFA for the men's under-19 national teams of Europe.
