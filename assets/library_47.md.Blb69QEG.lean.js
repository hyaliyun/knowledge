History A post office operated under the name Monrovia from 1878 to 1904. Jeff Gin, located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Jeff Road and Nick Davis Road, began operation in 1956. It was started by brothers Erle and Wilburn Douglass. At that time the gin was called Douglass Brothers and was one of 26 gins in Madison County. Along with the gin, Erle had a farming operation with Jack Vandiver called Douglass & Vandiver. Jack Vandiver ended up managing the gin. By 1972, Wilburn Douglass and Jack Vandiver realized they did not have enough time to farm and run a gin, so a decision was made to make the gin a co-op, and the name was changed to Jeff Gin Company.

Case reports indicate the scars deepen over time but remain relatively superficial, with the frequency of new scar appearance diminishing over time. AMVC is quite difficult to diagnose by dermatologists, for reasons including the depressed box and ice pick scars being very similar to those caused by Acne vulgaris. A confident diagnosis can be made if such scars recently appeared without present acne and without a history of acne. Otherwise, the correct diagnosis is usually not made, and even doing so provides little benefit; there is no treatment.

Kewaydin (AT-24) was launched 25 June 1919 by Ferguson Steel & Iron Co., Buffalo, New York; accepted by the Navy 31 October, and commissioned as USS Kewaydin (Fleet Tug No. 24), 4 November 1919, Lt. M. A. McDuffied in command. She was redesignated Fleet Tug (AT-24), 17 July 1920, and on 14 May 1944, she was reclassified Fleet Tug Old, (ATO-24).  Post-World War I operations  Assigned to the 5th Naval District, Kewaydin arrived Norfolk, Virginia, 19 June 1920. For more than 22 years she operated out of Norfolk from Boston, Massachusetts, to Charleston, South Carolina, towing ships and targets and performing yard, harbor, and salvage duty.  World War II North Atlantic operations  She departed New York 16 November 1942 with an Iceland-bound convoy and was damaged while steaming through heavy seas 19‚Äì27 November After repairs at St. Johns, Newfoundland, she arrived Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, 22 December. Assigned to the Naval Operating Base, she towed gasoline barges, provided harbor tug services, and assisted in salvage operations. On 13 April 1943 she assisted in freeing , grounded off Akureyri along the northern coast of Iceland.  Coastal rescue operations  Kewaydin departed Reykjav√≠k 19 April for Argentia, Newfoundland, where she arrived 28 April for duty as harbor tug and target-towing ship for Task Force 22. She served at Argentia until she sailed 2 June for Norfolk, arriving on the 7th. Resuming duty out of Norfolk, Kewaydin towed antisubmarine and surface targets in Chesapeake Bay and steamed from Maine to South Carolina on towing and salvage duty. While steaming off Cape Henry 17 and 18 November, she helped to free grounded ; and during towing operations along the New England coast 11 to 13 December, she searched for SS Suffolk, disabled in heavy seas.  Sailing the Atlantic for England  Departing Charleston, South Carolina, 25 January 1944, Kewaydin steamed in convoy via Bermuda and the Azores for England. She reached Falmouth, England on 13 March, and for more than 2 months she made towing runs along the southern coast of England from Falmouth to the River Thames.  Supporting the Normandy invasion  Reclassified as ATO-24 on 13 April, Kewaydin joined in the Normandy Invasion. Departing Selsey, England, 8 June, she towed lightship AL-28 to Utah Beach at St. Laurent, France. Between 8 June and 14 January 1945 she made 22 Channel crossings. Although harassed by unfavorable weather and German V-1 robot-bombs, she towed barges and landing craft from Lee-on-Solent, Falmouth, Plymouth, Portland, and other English ports to St. Laurent, Arromanches, Cherbourg, and Calais, France. While anchored at Dungeness, England on 29 June, she was slightly damaged by a V-1 robot-bomb that exploded close aboard after being shot down by British fighters.  End-of-war operations  Kewaydin continued operating along the English coast until she departed Plymouth, England, 16 March 1945 for the United States. Steaming via Belfast, Northern Ireland, she reached Cape Cod, Massachusetts on 12 April and arrived Norfolk 22 April. After a complete overhaul, she sailed 16 June with YR-31 in tow.

Reaching their highest point at High Raise (2,500 ft or 762 metres), they occupy a broad area to the east of Borrowdale. Perhaps unexpectedly the Central Fells are generally lower than the surrounding hills, the Lake District's general dome-like structure having a slight dip in the middle. The range extends from the boggy ridge between Derwentwater and Thirlmere in the north, to the famous rock peaks of the Langdale Pikes in the south. Partition of the Lakeland Fells The Lake District is a National Park in the north west of the country which, in addition to its lakes, contains a complex range of hills. These are locally known as fells and range from low hills to the highest ground in England. Hundreds of tops exist and many writers have attempted to draw up definitive lists. In doing so the compilers frequently divide the range into smaller areas to aid their description. The most influential of all such authors was Alfred Wainwright whose Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells series has sold in excess of 2 million copies,: The Wainwright Society - The Alfred Wainwright Centenary 2007 being in print continuously since the first volume was published in 1952. Wainwright divided the fells into seven geographical areas, each surrounded by valleys and low passes. While any such division must be arbitrary- and later writers have deviated to a greater or lesser extent from this blueprint-Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994) Richards, Mark: Lakeland Fellranger series: Collins (2002)ff: Central Fells Wainwright's sevenfold division remains the best known partitioning of the fells into 'sub ranges', each with its own characteristics. The Central Fells are one of these divisions, covered by volume 3 of Wainwright's work.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 3: Boundaries The eastern face of Helm Crag In the north is the Vale of Keswick, providing wide and total separation from Skiddaw and the Northern Fells. To the west runs the long valley of Borrowdale, flowing in this instance from Stake Pass at the head of Langstrath, all the way to Keswick. The parallel eastern boundary is created by Thirlmere and the Vale of St John, all of these valleys ultimately joining the River Derwent. At the head of Thirlmere is the pass of Dunmail Raise, crossed by the A591 road. South of Dunmail Raise the Vale of Grasmere runs down to Windermere, forming the remainder of the eastern boundary. In the west, Stake Pass descends into Great Langdale. This also descends, via the River Brathay, to Windermere. As the name suggests, the Central Fells are the only group to be entirely surrounded by other Lakeland ranges. However, topographical links only exist with two of the surrounding groups. South west across Stake Pass are Rossett Pike and the Southern Fells while Dunmail Raise connects to Seat Sandal in the Eastern Fells. The North Western and Western Fells are cut off by the long gash of Borrowdale. Topography Loughrigg Fell The Central Fells when seen in plan best resemble a boot, although one facing the other way to Italy. A broad ridge runs due south for about 10 miles, the valleys on either side being about apart. The range then narrows and turns south east, the Langdale Pikes forming the 'heel' and Loughrigg Fell the 'toe'. Beginning with Walla Crag and Bleaberry Fell in the north, the range climbs gradually to its apex at High Raise, the 'ankle' of the boot analogy. This section is often termed the 'Central Ridge' and consists of flat topped peat covered hills. Many of the worst upland bogs of the District are in this area. South of Bleaberry Fell are High Seat, High Tove (home to The Peewits, the worst bog of all) and Ullscarf, the land finally drying out here as High Raise is reached. To the west of the Central Ridge a lower spur encloses the quiet valley of Watendlath. In this sector are Great Crag and Grange Fell, lower hills exposing more rock and popular as short climbs. On the eastern side a further low ridge surrounds Shoulthwaite, topped by the impressive Raven Crag and family favourite High Rigg. High Tove above Watendlath High Raise itself is mostly grassy apart from the summit, and a broad plateau runs off south west over Thunacar Knott. Beyond are a line of low tops, rimming this tableland and appearing nothing from this direction. From the south the true majesty of the Langdale Pikes is displayed, falling direct from their rock crowns to the valley floor of Great Langdale, nearly below. Pike of Stickle stands at the western end, followed by Loft Crag, Harrison Stickle and the great cliff of Pavey Ark above Stickle Tarn. To the east of High Raise a complex system of minor ridges radiates out from the subsidiary top of Sergeant Man. Rising between the valleys of Wythburn, Easedale and Greenburn are Calf Crag, Helm Crag, Gibson Knott, Steel Fell and Tarn Crag. Along with Eagle Crag and Sergeant's Crag on the Borrowdale side these fells display steep flanks and plenty of rock on the summits. The main ridge descends south east from High Raise as the ground between the Rivers Brothay and Rathay gradually narrows to a point at Ambleside. In this section are the many tops of Blea Rigg, Silver How a fine viewpoint for Grasmere and finally Loughrigg Fell, easily accessible from White Moss car park and often combined with a walk along the terrace path above Rydal Water. Eagle Crag from Stonethwaite Access for walkers In the north, Walla Crag and Bleaberry fell are an easy walk from Keswick, while the Borrowdale road provides access as far south as Eagle Crag and the foot of Langstrath. The A591 road runs the full length of the range in the east, and in combination with the minor road around Thirlmere gives good access at many points. Grasmere village is also a useful starting place for walks around Easedale and Far Easedale. The Langdale Pikes are generally climbed from Great Langdale, beginning from either of the Dungeon Ghyll Hotels. Loughrigg is surrounded by minor roads, including Red Bank, the only one crossing the Central Fells. Near the summit is the youth hostel of High Close. In general, quieter walking can be had in the centre of the range from High Seat to Ullscarf, while many walkers will be met on Walla Crag or the Langdale Pikes.

It was subsequently released for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and SAM Coup√©. Gameplay ZX Spectrum version The player guides Zippy, an X-shaped sprite, around a maze, viewed top-down, with solid walls, hazards and collectable rewards. The view of the maze scrolls randomly right, left, up or down. The object is for the player to survive for a period of time without making contact with either an edge of the playing area, represented as a brick walls, or hazards including water and spikes, all of which lose a life. If the player survives they receive a score bonus for completing the level and they proceed to the next level, which is a continuation of the maze, with less interval between scrolling steps and a shorter level duration. The first level lasts about two minutes, and by the seventh and final level this is down to about forty seconds. Points are awarded for collecting plums and clumps of grass, some of which are invisible. Completing a level of the game triggers a voice saying \\"Yippee!\\". On the ZX Spectrum release this was remarkable due to it overcoming the Spectrum's rudimentary sound capabilities. It was a very early use of digitized speech sound effects in home computer games.

Champy publish \\"Reengineering the Corporation: a Manifesto for Business Revolution\\" (New York: HarperCollins, 1993). As usual with business theories it took some time for Reengineering, or Business Process Reengineering in full (BPR in short), to percolate to higher education; but in fact Reengineering spread (to a few) much faster than some other approaches (such as Activity Based Costing or Benchmarking) - already in the 1995-98 period a number of university e-learning experts in UK, Netherlands and Malaysia were using the language, in many cases to the dismay of their colleagues. It is a moot point whether BPR accelerated the development of e-learning or inhibited it - certainly at CEO level in some universities the ideas were for a while seductive. BPR has a sharp edge - the gentler but vaguer approach of Change Management seems to be more enduring *Scott Gray, a mathematics graduate student at Ohio State, develops The Web Workshop, a system that allows users to create Web pages online while learning. The pedagogical technique called Useractive Learning was developed to emulate the teaching techniques used in the Calculus & Mathematica courses taught at Ohio State. *Bill Davis, Jerry Uhl, Bruce Carpenter, and Lee Wayand launch MathEverywhere, Inc. to market and sell the coursework used in Calculus & Mathematica courses. 1994 * In 1994, NKI Distance Education in Norway starts its second generation, online, distance education courses.

The white papers and the workshop report are here.\\"Proceedings published following year * The European Commission release in May 1995 a 104-page report describing the 30 projects commissioned under the DELTA programme of Framework 3. Several of these are concerned with online learning using what many might today call a \\"virtual learning environment\\". (The phrase is not used as such but the phrases \\"learning environment\\", \\"interactive learning environment\\" and \\"collaborative learning environment\\" are used quite frequently.) * About the same time the JANUS project releases the JANUS Final Report describing the project over its 3-year lifetime and all the online courses it has supported during 1993-1994 across Europe. * The report Telematics for Distance Education in North America is released in public form in November 1995 after wide dissemination within European research circles. It describes the situation as it pertains to e-learning at 20 organisations including universities and most major vendors, based on a 3-week study trip in summer 1995 by Bacsich and Mason. * A short article in the LIGIS newsletter for November 1995 on FirstClass confirms that at the time of its writing FirstClass did not have a Web interface. (It also notes that its then rival CAUCUS did have a Web interface and that WEST, later TopClass from WBTSystems, had been recently developed.) * WBTSystems develops TopClass, a web-based course management system. It allowed personalization in that the instructor could tailor a different version of a course for each student. * Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC)'s Extended Learning Institute develops and delivers four math, science, and engineering courses using Lotus Notes for computer conferencing/groupware functionality.http://www.sloan-c.org/conference/proceedings/1996/pdf/96_sener.pdf * Edward Barrett at MIT received a grant to create a prototype \\"Electronic Multimedia Online Textbook in Engineering\\" (EMOTE) for use in classes taught through the new Writing Initiative. * WebTeach, a web-based asynchronous communication system using chronological threads in the \\"Confer style\\" originally developed in the mid 70s by Robert Parnes, was first used in 1995 in the Professional Development Centre at UNSW. It was written in Apple's Hypercard as a CGI script running behind WebStar by Dr. Chris Hughes and Dr. Lindsay Hewson at UNSW. The 1996 versions supported a Notice Board, a Seminar Room and a Coffee Shop for each class group, and added email notifications, a Quiz function, and a range of pre-programmed communication modes that emulated small group teaching strategies including brainstorming, questioning, case studies and commitment exercises. The modes were characterised by changes in layout, font colours, and the options available to teachers and students. The software was refined in subsequent years, with additional modes, including a formal debate mode, being added. In 2002 it was completely rewritten in Cold Fusion and refined to include many more features, including private groups, voting modes and fully functional web-based administration pages. WebTeach supports an approach to teaching and learning on the web that is more akin to an asynchronous virtual classroom than it is to an instructionally designed and packaged educational experience. Communication forms the basis of the teaching (as opposed to content provision) and the teacher in a group can switch teaching strategies (modes) easily, in order to respond to student contributions. * Many online schools appear on the educational scenes after working with Convene International. Some of them emerge as leaders of Internet Education like, Baker College and Pacific Oaks College and UCLA extension to name a few. * The Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD, formerly SITN) launches Stanford Online, which \\"was the first university internet delivery system incorporating text and graphics with video and audio, using technology developed at Stanford.\\" * \\"Constructing Educational Courseware using NCSA Mosaic and the World Wide Web\\" is presented by J.K.

Supported by Internal Outlook Enterprise Funding. Published in Ratcliffe, M. B., Parker, G. R. and Price, D. E. ‚ÄòThe Remote Advisory Service at Aberystwyth‚Äô, IEEE Conference on Frontiers in Education, Utah, USA, 6 pages, November 1996. * Sue Polyson, Robert Godwin-Jones, and Steve Saltzberg of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), at a Fall 1995 meeting of the \\"Partnership for Distributed Learning\\" (a consortium of US schools organized by University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) proposed the concept for developing a web-based course management system named \\"Web Course in a Box\\". They described the basic system features and proposed that interested schools work together to develop a working prototype of this system. The VCU group began work on the prototype with input from the consortium. Work continued through the Winter, 1995 and Spring 1996. A first beta of Web Course in a Box was presented to the group in Spring, 1996. The idea for Web Course in a Box grew out of work that Polyson had begun in 1994-1995 at VCU to develop a web- based interface for delivery of course materials to support VCU's Executive Masters in Health Administration, one of the first distance-delivered master's degree programs in the country. During this time, Godwin-Jones, also at VCU, had been working to develop web-based content for foreign language instruction. This work was described in two articles published by Syllabus Press, in the September 1995 issue of Syllabus (Volume 9, No.1) titled \\"Distributed Learning on the World Wide Web\\" and \\"Technology Across the Curriculum - Case Studies\\", both authored by Saltzberg and Polyson. * Question Mark (see QuestionMark) brings out first web based assessment management system QM Web, following on from DOS and Windows assessment systems. * Online Learning Circles move from the AT&T; Learning Network to their current home on the International Education and Resources Network (iearn) 1996 *The Project for OnLine Instructional Support is designed and developed at the University of Arizona]. This tool provides innovative dialog-based lessons to students. To support use of these lessons a method for providing online course context, course organization and course communications tools is created. * In 1996, NKI Distance Education in Norway starts its third generation online distance education courses. The courses were web-based and provided through EKKO (renamed to SESAM), NKI's self-developed Learning Management System (LMS). The experiences are described in the article NKI Fjernundervisning: Two Decades of Online Sustainability in Morten Flate Paulsen's book Online Education and Learning Management Systems. * In 1996, after hearing about the Virtual Office Hours Project developed by Prof. Craig Merlic and Matthew Walker in UCLA's Department of Biochemistry, UCLA Social Sciences reviewed it with some of the faculty and decided to try writing a custom version. The deciding factor was finding Jeff Carnahan's Upload. pl Perl CGI Script (available at Misc CGI Scripts - click on FileUploader 6.0 for free, but registration required) that did File Uploads via a web browser. With that, Matt Wright's WWWBoard, a Calendar script, later discarded, and a script written by Social Sciences Computing to edit files on the fly, there were enough tools to make something useful. Originally the plan was to have instructors fill out a web form to request a site. But due to problems getting the email to work, sites were created instantly instead. That turned out to be easier. A password was added and emailed to all the Social Sciences faculty. ClassWeb was first offered to UCLA Social Sciences Faculty in the Spring Quarter of 1997. Eight instructors set up ClassWeb sites (see Spring 1997 sites). * Early 1996, Dan Cane, a sophomore student at Cornell University begins working Cindy van Es, a senior lecturer in Agricultural, Resource and Managerial Economics (ARME) as part of an independent study project to build course web pages. In turn he develops automated scripts to provide basic interactive functionality for announcements and the beginnings of a suite of tools called The Teachers Toolbox. These ideas later become the foundation for CourseInfo. * The UCLA Periodontics Information Center was established in 1996 within the UCLA School of Dentistry with generous gifts from the Tarrson Family and Sun Microsystems. The initial thrust was to provide the most comprehensive website on Periodontics including Tutorials, Case Studies and Continuing Education Credits. * European Commission agrees to the European Council's 'Learning in the Information Society' action plan. * Webtester and ChiTester developed at Weber State University through a grant from the Utah Higher Education Technology Initiative. ChiTester early history * Sue Polyson and Robert Godwin-Jones, of Virginia Commonwealth University released the first beta version of Web course in a Box (WCB) in Spring, 1996. (See this 1997 presentation). This web-based system was designed to be an easy-to-use, template-based interface that allowed instructors to create an integrated set of web pages for presenting course material. The system featured logins for instructors and students, the ability for instructors to enroll students in their courses so that access to course materials could be controlled, the easy setup of web-based discussion forums for use by students within the class, document sharing through the upload of files to the discussion forum, schedule and announcement pages, content links, and personal home pages for both students and instructors. The WCB system was made available, free of charge, for use by any school that wished to use it. The source code was copyrighted by Virginia Commonwealth University, and Web Course in a Box was trademarked by VCU in 1997. Web Course in a Box was described in an article in \\"A Practical Guide to Teaching with the World Wide Web\\", by Polyson, Saltzberg, and Godwin-Jones, published in the September 1996 issue of Syllabus magazine, by Syllabus Press.

For paper, see: http://www.ra.ethz.ch/CDstore/www5/www156/overview.htm. The reaction to WebCT caused Goldberg to begin giving away free licenses to the software. Word spread very quickly and within 6 months approximately 100 institutions were using WebCT. * In January, Nat Kannan, Carl Tyson, and Michael Anderson form UOL Publishing (now VCampus) and release an Internet course delivery platform; the Java client accesses PLATO content on a CDC mainframe. In November, UOL releases a browser-based course authoring and delivery platform based on the Informix OO database. The UOL system supports multiple campuses (with \\"buildings\\" on each \\"campus\\" for the different academic functions) and enables multiple roles (admin/author/instructor/student) for every user on a course by course basis. UOL's virtual campus is adopted by Graybar Electric and the University of Texas TeleCampus (among others) in early 1997. * Paul McKey publishes the design specifications for an \\"Interactive on-line Tutorial Session Model\\" in his Masters Thesis \\"The Development of the On-line Educational Institute\\", SCU, Australia, July 1996, https://web.archive.org/web/20070804083810/http://www.redbean.com.au/articles/files/masters/06-Chapter6.html * Electronic, network-based assignment submission tool in use at Australian National University Department of Computer Science.

COSE has continued to gain support from the Jisc in its work on interoperability. * The JTAP programme also funded the Toomol project which produced the Colloquia P2P VLE, developed by Liber, Olivier, Britain and Beauvoir, which has had a major influence in the more recent development of the Personal Learning Environment (PLE) concept. * Pitsco, Inc. ships an updated version of its Synergistic Systems modular education curriculum which includes computer-based assessment and network-based reporting and gathering of assessment results. * World Wide Satellite Broadcasting (WSB) Inc. develops a satellite-based distance learning system using synchronized video and audio courseware provided by UCLA. Content is delivered via Philips' CleverCast content distribution system to Windows PCs running Active Desktop via the Astro MEASAT Direct To Home (DTH) network, covering Malaysia, Thailand and India. * The TELSI (Telematic Environment for Language Simulations) VLE is developed at the University of Oulu in Finland. Development was headed by Eric Rouselle and was continued into present day Discendum Optima. * Marine Corps Management and Simulation Office (MCMSO) adapts DOOM II into Marine Doom, a Virtual Learning Environment for training four-man fire teams. * KnowledgePlanet introduced the world's first Web-based Learning Management System in 1996.

By 1997, its fully online courses included registration, payment, quizzing, discussions, dropbox, and, of course, course content. The system was created and developed by in-house programmers. Now * Garry Main and Kevan Gartland, University of Abertay Dundee, UK, A system (webtest) was developed and deployed for use in testing students in the School of Molecular and Life Sciences. This was later extended to allow images to be labelled, self-testing and teaching. Also in use at the time was the Question Mark product. The work at Abertay was presented as a keynote talk at the BALANCE workshops KeyNote Presentations in 1997/8. * Initial release of the ETUDES software at Foothill College, California. * Real Education founded (later changed to eCollege.com) as an LMS/CMS Application Service Provider company.https://web.archive.org/web/19980509082136/http://realeducation.com/ * WEST (later WBTSystems) announce in early 1996 a new release of WEST (later renamed TopClass). Among the enhancements mentioned are: support of multiple- choice tests and \\"fill in the blanks\\" questions, including choosing questions randomly from a list (question bank?); support of multiple classes with multiple content and students able to take more than one class. * The article Lotus Notes in the Telematic University written for LIGIS in September 1996 confirms that several US universities are using Lotus Notes for e-learning, including via a Web interface. It goes on to observe that \\"Lotus Notes already has offered for a year or more several of the groupware and Internet features that other systems like FirstClass and Microsoft Exchange are only just now getting\\". * Another article in the same edition of LIGIS confirms that FirstClass, to the relief of many of its users, in August announced a Web interface. (http://www.pjb.co.uk/10/FirstClass.htm but see also http://www.pjb.co.uk/9/FirstClass.htm) The 304-page PDF manual for the FirstClass Intranet Client (Part Number SOF3122) is widely and freely distributed by SoftArc across many bulletin boards and web servers and remains available at several universities (e.g. at the University of Maine], a long- standing user of FirstClass. * Not to be outdone by the UK Open University, the FernUniversitat Hagen (German OU) described its web-based virtual campus in a LIGIS article in October 1996 on University of Hagen Online by Schlageter and others. The project \\"goes beyond current approaches in that it integrates all functions of a university, thus producing a complete and homogeneous system. This does not only include all kinds of learning material delivered via electronic network (most \\"online university\\" approaches focus almost exclusively on this aspect) - but for a promising approach the following is absolutely essential: user-friendly and powerful communication, especially also between users themselves for collaborative learning (peer learning) and for social interconnecting, possibilities of group-work (cscw), seminar support, new forms of exercise and practical via net, easy access to library and administration, information and tutoring systems\\". * Microsoft announces MS Exchange at Networld+Interop. An article of the era speculates on its relevance to e-learning. * An article nominates 1996 as \\"the year of virtual universities\\".

Digitalbrain was the first learning platform to be deployed using an on-demand software model and, as the name implies, the first designed around a user-centric approach. \\"A truly foresighted design\\" according to the heaviest users of the platform. The combination of the on-demand and user centric approach meant that a single, flexible learning platform could be rolled out across a host of different school and institutional user groups, each with multiple but inter-related user hierarchies, each with different software bundles and functional capabilities - easily, quickly and cheaply. At a time when users had little understanding of why they needed a learning platform, let alone what they would do with it, this approach encouraged user experimentation, at an affordable price. * Early 1997, CourseInfo is founded by Dan Cane and Stephen Gilfus, an undergraduate student and teaching assistant, and launches the Interactive Learning Network 1.5 based on scripts that Dan Cane began writing in 2006. The product is one of the first systems to be based on a relational database with internet forms and scripts that provided announcements, document uploading and quiz and survey functionality. * In 1997, Instructional Design for New Media ‚Äì an online course on how to develop online courses was created using forums, interactive exercises and the notion of collaborative learning by a community of instructors and students.

Offering courses in programming, graphics and web management. See the Archive at Archive * Cisco Systems In 1993, Cisco embarked on an initiative to design practical, cost-effective networks for schools. It quickly became apparent that designing and installing the networks was not enough, schools also needed some way to maintain the networks after they were up and running. Cisco Senior Consulting Engineer George Ward developed training for teachers and staff for maintenance of school networks. The students in particular were eager to learn and the demand was such that in 1997 it led to the creation of the Cisco Networking Academy Program, see Cisco networking academy. The Cisco Networking Academy Program, established in 1997, teaches students networking and other information technology-related skills, preparing them for jobs as well as for higher education in engineering, computer science and related fields. Since its launch, the program has grown to more than 10,000 Academies in 50 U.S. states and more than 150 countries with a curriculum taught in nine different languages. More than 400,000 students participate in Academies operating in high schools, colleges and universities, technical schools, community-based organizations, and other educational programs around the world. The Networking Academy program blends face-to-face teaching with web-based curriculum, hands- on lab exercises, and Internet-based assessment. * Fretwell Downing, based in Sheffield, England, is working on the development of a virtual learning environment, under the auspices of the \\"LE Club\\" a partnership between the company and eleven English Further Education colleges.

His most notable contribution to society was the writing down of the Manx Language. Early life He was born in Wales and educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1579 and M.A. in 1584.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Phanne-Popejoy Career In 1579 he became rector of Sessay in the North Riding of Yorkshire and in 1583 rector of Thorpe Bassett in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He was collated Archdeacon of Man in 1587 and made rector of Andreas in the Isle of Man. In 1590 he was appointed chaplain to Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby. In 1591 he was made rector of Slingsby in the North Riding of Yorkshire and in 1601 appointed archdeacon of Cleveland. In 1605 he followed George Lloyd as bishop of Sodor and Man, retaining in commendam the archdeaconry of Man and his English preferments. In 1617, Phillips presided as a judge over the witchcraft trial of Margaret Quaine and her son Robert. When the jury had reached their verdict of not- guilty, Phillips was instructed to leave the room before the witches were sentenced to death, as the Bishop's position in the church prevented him from direct involvement in the legal shedding of blood. He died in 1633 at Bishop's Court, in the parish of Ballaugh and was buried in St Germans Cathedral, Peel. Writing Manx In order to preach to the Manx peasantry, he dictated that the Book of Common Prayer, and later the Bible be translated, and a new writing system was invented. It is thought to be based on phonetic of Yorkshire English, which suggests it was written by someone else as opposed to him, as he was Welsh born.  Portrayal in media  Bishop Phillips was portrayed by Wayne Kelsall in the movie Solace in Wicca, a biographical drama about the execution of Margaret Quaine and her son Robert; the filmmaker's decision to portray Phillips as a villain was met with some criticism from Manx language enthusiasts.

The show was hosted by Dana Carvey at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles. The night's biggest winners were Van Halen and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as each group earned three moonmen that night. Particularly, Van Halen's video for \\"Right Now\\" took home the main award of the night, Video of the Year, and received seven nominations, making it the most nominated video of the night. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, meanwhile, won the award for Viewer's Choice and received a total of nine nominations for two of their videos, becoming the most nominated act of the night. Six of the Peppers' nominations were for \\"Give It Away,\\" and the remaining three went to \\"Under the Bridge.\\" The show was notable for a feud between Axl Rose and members of Nirvana as well as Courtney Love. It began backstage before the awards show, when Love jokingly offered to make Rose the godfather of Frances Bean Cobain. Rose threatened Cobain, telling him to quiet his wife, and barbs were exchanged between Love and Rose's then- girlfriend Stephanie Seymour. Bassists Krist Novoselic and Duff McKagan almost came to blows over the incident, just before Nirvana were to take the stage. The spat went public onstage immediately after Nirvana's performance of \\"Lithium\\", as drummer Dave Grohl taunted Rose. Cobain then raised the dispute in post-show interviews at the VMA. Along with Nirvana and Guns N' Roses, the night's performers included the likes of Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, En Vogue, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and Eric Clapton, among others. Also, there was a special performance by U2 via satellite, with host Dana Carvey playing the drums for them from the Pauley Pavilion. English band The Cure was slated to perform, too, but they had to cancel their appearance, citing illness and exhaustion from the band. Winners and nominations Winners are in bold text.

Washington County was established in 1843 and the first government building was finished in 1852. The current courthouse was built in 1928 with an addition and renovations to the structure in 1972. Currently the building houses courtrooms, the county sheriff's dispatch, staff offices, and the office of the district attorney. The county jail was previously attached to the courthouse. History Washington County was created as Twality District on July 5, 1843, as part of the Champoeg Meetings that created the Provisional Government of Oregon.Washington County History. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on February 18, 2008. The county became Washington County by an act of the Territorial Legislature in 1849, and in 1850 the community that would become Hillsboro was selected as the county seat. The first courthouse in the county was a log cabin near what is now Northwest 253rd Avenue, located on the land claim of Edward Constable where court sessions were held briefly.Buan, Carolyn M. This Far-Off Sunset Land: A Pictorial History of Washington County, Oregon. Donning Company Publishers, 1999. In 1850, David Hill sold and a cabin from his land claim to the county for $200. This cabin was used to house the court until 1852, when a two-story building was finished to serve as the courthouse and center of county government in Hillsboro. Built of cedar, this building was on land donated by the Kelsey family and located on the same block as the current site of the county courthouse, on the northwest corner of Main and 1st streets in downtown Hillsboro. Designed by A. B. Hallock, the building was and built by William Green.Present courthouse site selected as county seat. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. Construction began in the middle of 1852 and the county accepted the building on December 8, 1852, at a cost of $3,300. The pre-1928 Washington County courthouse, viewed from the south in 1910 In 1871, the county solicited bids to construct a new, brick courthouse. The winning bid was for $12,500 by Samuel W. Elliot with construction finishing in May 1873. The new building was placed in the middle of the courthouse square, with a picket fence and outhouse added in 1882. The following year the previous two-story courthouse was sold. The brick courthouse was remodeled in the early 1890s when it was expanded and a clock tower added to the building. The clock tower was built in 1891 for a cost of $20,000 and Delos Neer as architect.Herrschaft, Winnifred. Old Hillsboro courthouse rose amid disgruntlement. The Oregonian, February 23, 2006. Part of the cost came from adding steam heating to the courthouse. Though the courthouse had a clock tower, there was no clock and the county did not purchase the clockworks needed for a working clock. In 1897, the first telephone was added to the building. In 1912, the county contracted with Portland contractor William Foster to expand the building at a cost of $32,516.Untitled item, with dateline \\"Hillsboro, Or., May 1.\\" The Morning Oregonian, May 2, 1912, p. 14, col. 4. View of the current courthouse and grounds from the east Ornamental bronze lantern above one of the entrance doorways Beginning in 1927, the county began plans to expand the courthouse. Construction began in 1928 with L. L. Young submitting the winning bid of $126,783. The old building was demolished on April 1, 1928, in front of a crowd of citizens. With the remodel, the current Neoclassical architectural style was adopted and the main entrance was made to face 2nd Street instead of Main Street. O.R.W. Hossack designed the building and included fluted columns with Ionic capitals.McNichol, Bethanye. Our Town: Hillsboro. The Oregonian, July 27, 1995. In 1930, a two-story jail was completed on the site. The county looked to expand the county government buildings again in 1969, with construction beginning in 1970. The Administrative Annex building was finished in 1973. Currently The Washington County Courthouse is located on one city block in downtown Hillsboro with East Main Street as the southern boundary, Lincoln Street on the north, First Street on the west, and Second Street bounding on the east. This square has five large sequoia trees that were planted in 1886 with seeds from John Porter, located on the south side of the building. The three-story neo-classical style entrance with four columns faces Second Street. A new county jail built in the early 2000s west of downtown, allowed the use of the old jail by the county sheriff as a dispatch center and prisoner holding area. The current Justice Services Building is home to offices for courtroom staff, judges, accounting offices, courtrooms, and the district attorney for the county. The Hillsboro Civic Center is across Main Street from the courthouse.

In 2005 the College completed a ¬£64 million building programme, which was the biggest investment in accommodation in the history of further education in the United Kingdom. Capital City College Group On 1 August 2016, City and Islington College merged with Westminster Kingsway College to form the WKCIC Group, trading as Capital City College Group https://www.westking.ac.uk/news/new-name-westminster-kingsway-city-islington- college-group/(CCCG). On 1 November 2017, the College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London joined CCCG, making the Group the largest further education and training provider in Londonhttps://capitalccg.ac.uk/news/ and one of the largest in the UK. History The college was formed in 1993 through a merger of the City and East London College, North London College, Islington Adult Education Service and Islington Sixth Form College,City and Islington College , OFSTED report 2008, retrieved 2011-08-04 which operated over 13 sites across Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets. Alongside the development of the new buildings, the management of teaching and learning was reorganised, and the five centres emerged. Centres Twelve years ago the college was spread across 13 different sites and three boroughs, and some of the buildings dated back to the 19th century. There are now five centres in Islington, each one specialising in a particular set of subjects. The centres provide study and recreational spaces, all with the latest ICT equipment for teaching and learning. The five centres are: *Centre for Applied Sciences *Centre for Business, Arts and Technology *Centre for Health, Social and Child Care *Centre for Lifelong Learning *Sixth Form College Each centre is focused on running particular courses and qualifications and each has its own community of students, teachers and support staff. Centre for Applied Sciences Centre for Applied Sciences In Angel, Islington, the centre building was officially opened by her Majesty‚Äôs Chief Inspector for Schools, David Bell, in May 2005, the same year that Ofsted rated the college‚Äôs science provision as outstanding. Applied science courses range from Introductory Diplomas to Foundation Degrees and lead to professions that require specialist scientific knowledge such as forensics, optics, medicine, nursing and sports and fitness training. Many of the staff have industry experience and there are links with prestigious London universities as well as professional organisations such as the Metropolitan Police. In 2008, the college‚Äôs Science provision was rewarded yet again, winning the Queen‚Äôs Anniversary Prize, thus becoming the first general further education College to win the award twice. It was won for ‚ÄòCreating Pathways to Employment and Higher Education in the Sciences'. Centre for Business, Arts and Technology The new ¬£15 million building on Camden Road, designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects and built by William Verry with Sprunt Architects, was officially opened by the then Secretary of State for Education, Ruth Kelly, in January 2006. Subject areas include; ICT and Networking, Business and Management, Visual Arts, Performing Arts and Media from basic level through to Foundation Degree. Centre for Health, Social and Child Care Centre for Health, Social and Child Care The centre offers both full-time and part-time courses in child care, health and social care, counselling, and advice and guidance, all taught at the Marlborough Building. Childcare provision has been designated a Centre of Vocational Excellence. Many of the centre‚Äôs students are in employment or decide to enter employment after college but growing numbers are progressing to university. For those who want to gain a degree while working, the centre offers four foundation degrees at the Marlborough Building: Early Childhood Studies, Education (primary pathway), Health Sciences and Working with Young People and Young People Services (Learning Mentors). Beauty Therapy, Barbering and Hairdressing are also taught here and make use of the on-site salon; ‚ÄòOasis‚Äô, which was officially opened in January 2011 by celebrity hairdresser Andrew Barton. Centre for Lifelong Learning In Blackstock Road, Finsbury Park, courses are offered for adults with learning difficulties and disabilities together with courses in beauty and complementary therapies. The centre, designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects, specialises in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses. Although most of the students are adults, a special ESOL programme for young people is also available. Courses range from beginner to advanced level and include Maths and IT. Beauty Therapy, Barbering and Hairdressing are also taught and make use of the on-site salon. Sixth Form College Sixth Form College The Sixth Form College has a high standard of A-level results. As well as academic courses, students are involved in extra- curricular activities with an enrichment programme, as well as opportunities for trips abroad and the chance to work with professional organisations like the Almeida Theatre, or participation in the Duke of Edinburgh award. Students are able to choose from over 30 A-level courses for 16- to 18-year-olds in the following subject areas: English, Media, Humanities, Business Studies, ICT, Languages, Maths, Performing Arts, Sciences, Visual Arts and Design.

He was born in Nevada and grew up in Salt Lake City. His maternal grandfather, Colonel John Reese, was the founder of Nevada at Genoa, and also a Mormon. His mother was also a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, (although disaffected later in life), and Isaac was known for his good relationships with the church. His dream was to see Utah become a state. He became the an important lobbyist for this cause in Washington DC. His efforts helped Utah finally achieve statehood.Edward Leo Lyman, here \\"Isaac Trumbo and the Politics of Utah Statehood\\", Utah Historical Quarterly, vol. 41, no. 2, pp. 128-149 (Spring 1973). After the statehood question was resolved, in 1895 Trumbo and his wife moved to Salt Lake City and took up residence in the Gardo House, a large mansion originally built by Brigham Young for one of his wives, and later the official residence of the president of the church.Sandra Dawn Brimhall and Mark D. Curtis, \\"The Gardo House: A History of the Mansion and Its Occupants\\", Utah History to Go (accessed January 14, 2011). He became active in the Utah Republican Party and became identified as an advocate for the Free Silver doctrine. Trumbo believed that he would be offered one of Utah's two seats in the United States Senate as a reward for his statehood efforts. However, this did not occur, in part because Utah's non-Mormons were concerned that Trumbo was too closely aligned with Mormon interests. The Trumbos returned to San Francisco, although they maintained a close relationship with church president Wilford Woodruff, who died in 1898 at Trumbo's home. Trumbo lost his home on Sutter Street in 1911 after failing to pay the mortgage. He died in November 1912, after he was assaulted in street.

Statistics for Iraqi refugees in Lebanon vary, but typically put the number at around 50,000, although the latest statistics from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees put the current number of Iraqi refugees at just under 30,000, and yet some say the number may be as high as 100,000. History Iraqis have been present in Lebanon for decades, with many young Iraqi workers choosing to emigrate there to the Paris of the Middle East to further their careers. However, the first real influx of a large number of Iraqis to Lebanon started in earnest in the 1990s, with Iraqis fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime as well as the hardships of international sanctions. Most of the Iraqis during this period were Shia, fleeing Saddam's regime, or Christians, seeking exile in an Arab country with a significant local Christian population. Human Rights Watch puts the pre-2003 number of Iraqis in Lebanon at about 10,000. Recent migration After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the first wave of Iraqi refugees fleeing the war began. By the middle of 2005, the number of Iraqis in Lebanon had doubled from the pre-Iraq War figure to 20,000. This number more than doubled with the second wave of Iraqi refugees fleeing the country after the February 2006 bombing of al-Askari Mosque in Samarra. By 2007 the numbers of Iraqis in Lebanon increases to between 26,000 and 100,000, but usually set at 50,000 by international agencies. Reliable and irrefutable statistics are difficult to come by with the majority of refugees in legal limbo. Variations in statistics as well as many of the issues that Iraqi refugees in Lebanon face are also linked to the ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô nature of urban refugees. Of the 8,090 Iraqi refugees actively registered with the UNHCR in Lebanon, over half have arrived since 2009. Of the same group of refugees, most are either Christians (42.0%) or Shia Muslims (39.2%) with a minority of Sunni Muslims (15.6%) and other sects or religions, including Mandeans and Yezidis (less than 1%, each). Most Iraqis in Lebanon are from Baghdad, having entered the country via Syria.  Legal Status  Lebanon is not a signatory of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, nor the 1967 Protocol, leaving the 1962 law regarding the entry and stay of foreigners as the legal status determinant. 71 per cent of Iraqis surveyed in 2007 by the Danish Refugee Council had illegal status, and 95 per cent of respondents reached Lebanon by being smuggled across the Syrian-Lebanese border.  Employment  Finding work for illegal Iraqi migrants is difficult, and most are employed in the unofficial sector.  Education and health care  Since Iraqis rely on children as a source of income, impacting the enrollment levels for boys and girls. Other factors, including cost, lack of documentation as well as language difficulties from dialectal differences impact education for this population in general. Attendance rates in school amongst youths of the ages six to seventeen, range at around 58%, in which female enrollment is much higher at 63.7 percent, in comparison with 54.3 percent being males.  Repatriation and resettlement  Many Iraqis chose to take refuge in Lebanon because of the notion that it was easier to get registered for resettlement in a third country with the UNHCR in Beirut. While the Lebanese government has not granted legal status to most Iraqi refugees, keeping them subject to detention and incarceration, it has granted short periods of amnesty for Iraqis who have overstayed their visas in the past.  Palestinian Iraqis  Another issue facing Iraqis are those of Palestinian origin who have entered Lebanon illegally and have not registered with the PLO representative office in Lebanon, thus losing access to the UNRWA education and health services.  Lebanese-Iraqi relations  In November 2007, the Iraqi government gave Lebanon $2 million to ‚Äòsoothe the burden‚Äô of Iraqi refugees for Lebanon. Demographics Amongst the adult population, 44 percent are single while 52 percent are married, in which a higher proportion of adult women are married whereas the men are single. Religious and ethnic affiliation A survey recently released information that Muslim Shia are by far the majority of Iraqis in Lebanon at 51 percent, followed by Assyrian Chaldean Catholics which stand at 19 percent, while Sunni Muslims only amount to 12 percent of the population.

Origins The group was founded by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 1999 under the name Jama'at al- Tawhid wal-Jihad (Arabic: ÿ¨ŸÖÿßÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿàÿ≠ŸäÿØ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸáÿßÿØ, \\"Group of Monotheism and Jihad\\"). The group is believed to have started bomb attacks in Iraq as of August 2003, five months after the coalition invasion and occupation of Iraq, targeting UN representatives, Iraqi Shiite institutions, the Jordanian embassy, provisional Iraqi government institutions. After it pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network in October 2004, its official name became Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn.Middle East and North Africa Overview , Country Reports on Terrorism, U.S. State Department, 28 April 2006  Leadership  On 7 June 2006, the leader of AQI, al-Zarqawi, and his spiritual adviser Sheik Abd-Al-Rahman, were both killed by a U.S. airstrike with two 500 lb (230 kg) bombs on a safe house near Baqubah. The group's leadership was then assumed by the Egyptian militant Abu Ayyub al- Masri, also known as Abu Hamza al-Muhajir.  Purpose  In a letter to al- Zarqawi in July 2005, Al-Qaeda's Ayman al-Zawahiri outlined a four-stage plan beginning with taking control of Iraq. Step 1: expulsion of US forces from Iraq. Step 2: establishing in Iraq an Islamic authority‚Äîa caliphate. Step 3: \\"the jihad wave\\" should be extended to \\"the secular countries neighbouring Iraq\\". Step 4: \\"the clash with Israel\\".  Violent activities  US Navy Seabees during the Second Battle of Fallujah (November 2004)  2004  At the end of October 2004, Al-Qaeda in Iraq kidnapped Japanese citizen Shosei Koda. In an online video, AQI gave Japan 48 hours to withdraw its troops from Iraq, otherwise Koda's fate would be \\"the same as that of his predecessors, [Nicholas] Berg and [Kenneth] Bigley and other infidels\\". While Japan refused to comply with this demand, Koda was beheaded, and his dismembered body found on 30 October. AQI claimed responsibility for the car bomb attacks on 19 December 2004 in the Shiite holy cities Najaf and nearby Karbala, killing 60 people.  2005  According to internal documents seized in 2008, AQI began in 2005 systematically killing Iraqi tribesmen and nationalist insurgents wherever they began to rally against it. Attacks in 2005 claimed by AQI include: * 30 January: AQI launched attacks on voters during the Iraqi legislative election in January. In 100 armed attacks, 44 people were killed, although some attacks may have been carried out by other groups. Abu Musab al- Zarqawi said: \\"We have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy (‚Ä¶)\\". * 28 February: in the southern city of Hillah, a car bomb struck a crowd of police and Iraqi National Guard recruits, killing 125 people. * 2 April: the group launched a combined suicide and conventional attack on Abu Ghraib prison in April. * 7 May: in Baghdad, two explosives- laden cars were used against an American security company convoy. 22 people are killed, including two Americans. * 6 July: AQI claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and execution of Egypt's ambassador to Iraq, Ihab el-Sherif. In a message posted on the Internet, Zarqawi said: \\"The Islamic court of the al- Qaeda Organization in the Land of Two Rivers has decided to refer the ambassador of the state of Egypt, an ally of the Jews and the Christians, to the mujahideens so that they can execute him.\\" * 15‚Äì17 July: a three-day series of suicide attacks, including the Musayyib marketplace bombing, left 150 people dead and 260 wounded. AQI claimed that the bombings were part of a campaign to take control of Baghdad. * 19 August: In the Jordanian city of Aqaba, a rocket attack kills a Jordanian soldier. * 14 September: Al-Qaida in Iraq claimed responsibility for a single-day series of more than a dozen bombings in Baghdad, which killed about 160 people, most of whom were unemployed Shia workers. Al-Zarqawi declared \\"all-out war\\" on Shiites, Iraqi troops and the Iraqi government in a statement. * Friday 16 September: a suicide bomb attack outside a Shiite mosque 200 km north of Baghdad killed 13 worshippers. * 24 October: AQI made coordinated suicide attacks outside the Sheraton Ishtar and Palestine Hotel in Baghdad in October. * 9 November: in the Jordanian capital Amman, three bomb attacks against hotels killed 60 people. * 18 November: AQI claimed responsibility for a series of Shia mosque bombings in the city of Khanaqin, which killed at least 74 people.  2006  * The 5 January bombings on Shi'ite civilians in Karbala and Ramadi, near a religious shrine and a police recruiting centre, were blamed by some residents on al Qaeda in Iraq.Insurgents Kill 140 as Iraq Clashes Escalate.

The Al-Askari Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shia Islam, after the first attack by Al- Qaeda in Iraq in 2006 * The 22 February 2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing was blamed by a U.S. intelligence officer in March 2007 and by 'Iraqi officials' in May 2007, on AQI. * On 3 June 2006, AQI abducted and killed four Russian diplomats in Iraq. * 16 June 2006, a U.S. checkpoint near Baghdad was attacked, one U.S. soldier killed and two abducted. Those abducted, Thomas Lowell Tucker and Kristian Menchaca, were found on 19 June, having been tortured and killed. The next day, Mujahedeen Shura Council of Iraq (MSC)‚Äîan organization including Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn‚Äîclaimed to have \\"slaughtered\\" the two Americans. Three weeks later, MSC issued a video showing the mutilated corpses of Tucker and Menchada, purportedly as revenge for the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl, in March 2006, by U.S. soldiers of the same brigade. Autumn 2006, AQI took over Baqubah, the capital of Diyala Governorate, and before March 2007, AQI or its umbrella organization 'Islamic State of Iraq' (ISI) claimed Baqubah as its capital. * The US suggested that 'al Qaeda' was involved in the wave of chlorine bombings in Iraq, October 2006‚ÄìJune 2007, which affected hundreds of people, albeit with few fatalities. :Further violent activities in Iraq after 13 October 2006 blamed on 'al Qaeda (in Iraq)' are listed in article Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).  War: Sunnis against Shias  September 2005, after a U.S.-Iraqi offensive on the town of Tal Afar, al-Zarqawi declared \\"all-out war\\" on Shia Muslims in Iraq.  Conflicts between Al Qaeda in Iraq and other Sunni Iraqi groups  In September‚ÄìOctober 2005, there were signs of a split between homegrown Iraqi Sunni Arab insurgents who wanted Sunni influence in national politics restored, and therefore supported a \\"no\\" vote in the 15 October 2005 referendum on a constitution, and al-Zarqawi's Al Qaeda in Iraq, which strove for a theocratic state and threatened to kill those who engaged in the national political process with Shiites and Kurds, including those who would take part in that referendum. From mid-2006, AQI began to be pushed out of their strongholds in rural Anbar Province, from Fallujah to Qaim, by tribal leaders in open war. That campaign was assisted by the Iraqi government paying cash gifts and alleged salaries to tribal sheikhs of up to $5,000 a month. In September 2006, 30 tribes in Anbar Province formed an alliance called the \\"Anbar Awakening\\" to fight AQI.  January 2006: Tanzim (AQI) creates Mujahideen Shura Council  Shosei Koda before his beheading AQI's efforts to recruit Iraqi Sunni nationalist and secular groups were undermined by its violent tactics against civilians and by its fundamentalist doctrine. In January 2006 it created an umbrella organization called the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC), in an attempt to unify Sunni insurgents in Iraq.  Strength of AQI in 2004‚Äì2006  American military field leaders, in particular, Lt. General Michael Flynn, in late spring 2004, were 'strategically surprised' at the capabilities, scale of operations, and quality of leadership of the subject.

MacDill Air Force Base, Florida : The JSOU Press. JSOU report, 16-6. Retrieved 7 January 2020. Western media suggested that foreign fighters continued to flock to AQI.Het Nieuwsblad edition Oostende-Westhoek (Belgian newspaper), 26 March 2016. A secret U.S. Marine Corps intelligence report of August 2006 wrote that Iraq's Sunni minority had been increasingly abandoned by their religious and political leaders who had fled or been assassinated, was \\"embroiled in a daily fight for survival\\", feared \\"pogroms\\" by the Shiite majority, and was increasingly dependent on Al- Qaeda in Iraq as its only hope against growing Syrian dominance across Baghdad. In western Iraq, AQI was entrenched, autonomous and financially independent, and therefore the death of AQI leader Al-Zarqawi in June 2006 had little impact on the structure or capabilities of AQI. Illicit oil trading provided them with millions of dollars, and their popularity was rising in western Iraq.\\"Anbar Picture Grows Clearer, and Bleaker\\". Washington Post, 28 November 2006. Retrieved 15 January 2015. In Anbar, most government institutions had disintegrated by August 2006, and AQI was the dominant power, the U.S. Marine Corps intelligence report said. In 2006, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research estimated that Al-Qaeda in Iraq's core membership was \\"more than 1,000\\".  October 2006: Tanzim (AQI) creates Islamic State of Iraq  On 13 October 2006, the MSC declared the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), comprising Iraq's six mostly Sunni Arab governorates: Baghdad, Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Salah al-Din, Ninawa, and \\"other parts of the governorate of Babel\\", with Abu Omar al-Baghdadi being announced as the self-proclaimed state's Emir. A Mujahideen Shura Council leader said: \\"God willing we will set the law of Sharia here and we will fight the Americans\\"; the Council urged on Sunni Muslim tribal leaders to join their separate Islamic state \\"to protect our religion and our people, to prevent strife and so that the blood and sacrifices of your martyrs are not lost\\". Following the announcement, scores of gunmen took part in military parades in Ramadi and other Anbar towns to celebrate. In reality, the group did not control territory in Iraq. In November, a statement was issued by Abu Ayyub al-Masri, leader of Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC), announcing the disbanding of the MSC, in favor of the ISI. After this statement, there were a few more claims of responsibility issued under the name of the Mujahideen Shura Council, but these eventually ceased and were totally replaced by claims from the Islamic State of Iraq. In April 2007, Abu Ayyub al-Masri was given the title of 'Minister of War' within the ISI's ten-member cabinet. Car bombings were a common form of attack in Iraq during the Coalition occupation According to a report by US intelligence agencies in May 2007, the ISI planned to seize power in the central and western areas of the country and turn it into a Sunni Islamic state. By June 2007, the uncompromising brand of extreme fundamentalist Islam of AQI and the ISI had alienated more nationalist Iraqi strands of insurgency.  U.S. fighting Tanzim (Al-Qaeda in Iraq)  In November 2004, al-Zarqawi's network was the main target of the US Operation Phantom Fury in Fallujah, but its leadership managed to escape the American siege and subsequent storming of the city. On 7 June 2006, al-Zarqawi and his spiritual adviser Sheik Abd-Al-Rahman, were both killed by a U.S. airstrike with two 500 lb (230 kg) bombs on a safe house near Baqubah. The group's leadership was then assumed by Abu Ayyub al-Masri, also known as Abu Hamza al- Muhajir.  Criticisms from al-Zawahiri  U.S. intelligence in October 2005 published an intercepted letter purportedly from Ayman al-Zawahiri questioning AQI's tactic of indiscriminately attacking Shias in Iraq. In a video that appeared in December 2007, al-Zawahiri defended AQI, but distanced himself from the crimes against civilians committed by \\"hypocrites and traitors\\" that he said existed among its ranks.  Operations outside Iraq and other activities  On 3 December 2004, AQI attempted unsuccessfully to blow up an Iraqi‚ÄìJordanian border crossing. In 2006 a Jordanian court sentenced al- Zarqawi and two of his associates to death in absentia for their involvement in the plot. AQI claimed to have carried out three attacks outside Iraq in 2005. In the most deadly, suicide bombs killed 60 people in Amman, Jordan on 9 November 2005. They claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks which narrowly missed the American naval ships USS Kearsarge and USS Ashland in Jordan, and also targeted the city of Eilat in Israel, and for the firing of several rockets into Israel from Lebanon in December 2005. The affiliated groups were linked to regional attacks outside Iraq which were consistent with their stated plan, one example being the 2005 Sharm al-Sheikh bombings in Egypt, which killed 88 people, many of them foreign tourists. The Lebanese- Palestinian militant group Fatah al-Islam, which was defeated by Lebanese government forces during the 2007 Lebanon conflict, was linked to AQI and led by al-Zarqawi's former companion who had fought alongside him in Iraq. The group may have been linked to the little-known group called \\"Tawhid and Jihad in Syria\\", and may have influenced the Palestinian militant group in Gaza called Jahafil Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad fi Filastin.New Gaza Organization Vows Loyalty to Al-Qaeda, MEMRI 10-11-2008  See also  * Islamic terrorism * List of bombings during the Iraq War References Category:2004 establishments in Iraq Category:Factions in the Iraq War Category:Jihadist groups in Iraq Category:Organizations designated as terrorist in Asia Category:History of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Iraq Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Malaysia Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Saudi Arabia Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the United States ","title":"Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn"},{"id":"12786582","text":"USS Houston (AK-1) was a cargo ship that was acquired by the U.S. Navy for service in World War I. During World War II, she served as a commercial cargo ship under charter to the United States Lines by the War Shipping Administration. Acquiring a scuttled German freighter The first Navy ship to be named Houston, AK-1 was the former German freighter SS Liebenfels, built by Bremer Vulcan, Vegesack, Germany, in 1903. Operated by the Hansa Line, she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, in August 1914, and remained there until 1 February 1917, when her German crew scuttled her. Finding her sunk and abandoned, U.S. authorities set about to raise the ship and took her to Charleston Navy Yard for refitting on 20 March 1917. She was commissioned as Houston (AK-1) on 3 July 1917, Lt. Comdr. W. H. Lee, USNRF commanding. World War I North Atlantic operations Assigned to the transport service, Houston departed Charleston 11 July 1917, loaded coal and oil at Hampton Roads, and joined a convoy sailing from New York on 7 August 1917. She arrived at Brest on 25 August and subsequently made four voyages to and from New York transporting radio equipment, trucks, airplanes, and general supplies. Returning to New York on 18 November 1918, the ship was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, and made four more voyages between the East and West coasts of the United States, departing on the first of these 15 December 1918 from New York. Until her return to New York 14 April 1921 Houston carried coal, ordnance, lumber, and general supplies between the coasts in support of the Navy's two-ocean operations. Post-war assignment to the Pacific Houston was next assigned to trans-Pacific duty.

Her grandfather, Eliodoro Rodr√≠guez, was a prominent landowner in Rubio. Her father was also a coffee planter and a veteran of Colombia's Thousand Days War, in which he volunteered to fight on the side of the Liberal forces and acted as lieutenant to General Uribe. As a child, she was aware of her older cousin Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez engaging in long political discussions with her father on topics as varied as the legacy of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the French Revolution and the dictatorship of Juan Vicente G√≥mez in Venezuela. At the age of four, her mother died of cancer and Blanca's rearing was left in the hands of her older sister, Ana Isabel. Four years later, her father would also die. The family was financially ruined by the worldwide economic depression of the 1930s and all of the family haciendas had to be sold. She was educated by nuns at the Our Lady of the Rosary Convent School, where she graduated in 1944. Marriage and exile Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez began courting his cousin Blanca in 1944. He was then working and living in Caracas and would travel to Rubio as he could to visit her. They were wed on 8 June 1948. For the first months, they lived in the provincial city of San Crist√≥bal, T√°chira, but, moved to the Venezuelan capital to share a rented house with Julia P√©rez, Blanca's mother- in-law. A few months later, in November 1948, the military launched a coup against the democratically elected government of President R√≥mulo Gallegos and installed a dictatorship. Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez became the target of harassment and persecution as a member of the Acci√≥n Democr√°tica party. Blanca had to endure frequent security police searches of their home as well as tend to her young children while her husband was often on the run or in prison. In 1952, she followed him into exile in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. The couple had six children, five daughters, Sonia, Thais, Martha, Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles and Mar√≠a Carolina, and a son, Carlos Manuel. When the dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez was overthrown in 1958, Blanca and Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez returned to Venezuela with the children. Her husband's ascendant political career resulted in Blanca's increasingly prominent role as a politician's wife, one who would be actively involved in supporting his career, campaigning and developing her own charitable activities. First Lady With Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez's election to the Presidency in December 1973, Blanca Rodr√≠guez assumed the role of First Lady. In Venezuela, this involved acting as the head of the Children's Foundation, a charitable organisation that organised summer camps and festivals for disadvantaged children. Blanca was eager to develop a program that would have a greater impact on the lives of the poor and would provide year-round assistance. One of the most important aspects of her legacy as First Lady was the development of a network of daycare centres (hogares de cuidado diario) for low income communities across the country. These centres were created to enable working, and often single, mothers to earn a wage without leaving their children in the hands of unsuitable caretakers. The emphasis of the daycare centre program was on grass-roots involvement. Community mothers were consulted in the selection and vetting of caretakers and the Foundation provided financial support to the \\"mother-carers\\", as the women in charge of the centres were identified. In addition, Blanca Rodr√≠guez accompanied her husband on his frequent trips abroad to meet world leaders, including memorable visits to Mexico, Egypt, Russia and Iran. She also hosted the visits of the King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sof√≠a, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and wife U.S. First LadyRosalynn Carter to Caracas as well as Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his wife Margaret Trudeau. Margaret Trudeau used the occasion to sing a song that she had written to honor Rodr√≠guez. https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/04/archives/mrs-trudeau-replies-on-radio-to- critics-of-tour.html After the presidency After Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez left the presidency in 1979, Blanca Rodr√≠guez devoted her energies to supporting a charitable foundation, Bandesir, focused on providing wheelchairs and crutches to the disabled poor. She became Bandesir's chairwoman and pursued an active schedule of visits around the country to attend the frequent ceremonies the foundation organized to hand over wheelchairs to people who could not afford them. She also fundraised for Bandesir and extended its remit so that it could also provide cheap or free medical attention to the needy who came to its headquarters. She was also a patron of the Leper Hospice in La Guaira. Second term as First Lady Blanca Rodr√≠guez again became First Lady upon her husband's second election to the Presidency in 1988. She resumed her position at the Children's Foundation. Under her leadership, the foundation supported the government's initiative to roll out the daycare centre programme all over the country as part of its welfare provision. During the military coup organized by Hugo Ch√°vez on 4 February 1992, Blanca, her daughters and granddaughters were in residence at the Presidential palace of La Casona whilst it was besieged by rebel forces. While her husband managed to escape and quell the coup attempt, Blanca remained at La Casona during the particularly heavy attack. She later made sure to assist in the tending of wounded soldiers, regardless of their allegiance, and was crucial in keeping morale up during the few hours when it seemed the residence was going to be taken. Later life After leaving office, Blanca Rodr√≠guez retired to her home in the outskirts of Caracas, a house she designed to resemble one of her father's haciendas. She continued to devote time to charitable work, mainly in relation to the Bandesir foundation. Whilst Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez had been self- exiled since 1998, Blanca Rodr√≠guez remained in the country. In 2004, government security forces raided Blanca Rodr√≠guez's house with the excuse of finding weapons and documents related to an anti-Ch√°vez conspiracy, a charge that was clearly seen as baseless given that she had not seen or spoken to her estranged husband since he left the country. In keeping with her deep Catholic faith, attempts by P√©rez to divorce her were rebuffed by her lawyers and the couple was still legally married at the time of Perez's death in late 2010.

His accomplice Dennis Whitty met the same fate at HMP Winchester on the same morning. There have been riots at HMP Bristol in 1986 and 1991. Major internal damage was caused to prison wings on both occasions. The prison aroused controversy in 1996 when it was revealed that prisoners were sometimes transported to and from Bristol by a stretched limousine. Officials claimed the limo was only used when commercial taxis were not big enough to handle multiple prisoner transfers with prison officers as security.HighBeam Soon after Bristol was upgraded to a Category A prison (part of the high security estate) holding the most dangerous prisoners. A report from the Board of Visitors in 2000 criticised Bristol Prison for keeping some remand inmates on a punishment regime in segregation. Bristol faced more criticism in 2002 when it emerged that a shortage of staff nurses had resulted in the prison paying out thousands of pounds for agency nursing staff. A year later, Bristol was downgraded back to a Category B local prison, after repeated overcrowding and safety concerns from nearby residents. Bristol Prison came in for more criticism in 2005 after a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons cited inconsistent management, poor safety, and negative race relations at the jail. A year later officers at the prison reported rising levels of violence due to widespread use of heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis among inmates. An Independent Monitoring Boardhttp://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate- reports/imb/annual-reports-2011/bristol-2010-2011.pdf report published in 2011 stated that HMP Bristol had an annual budget of ¬£14.2 million. This report identified issues with prisoners clothing and equipment as well as the provision of hygiene facilities. It also highlighted improvements on the previous year with respect to resettlement services and visits. The overall judgement of this report was \\"significant and continued improvement.\\" Archives Records of Horfield Prison are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 41405) (online catalogue). Other records are held at the National Archives. The prison today Bristol Prison currently holds adult males and YOI prisoners (18 to 21 years old) on remand to the local courts as well as convicted prisoners, including prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment and indeterminate sentences for public protection. It also acts as a Category B facility for the southwest of England. The establishment was heavily criticised following an unannounced inspection in May 2013, in which it was reported that staff \\"racially abused\\" inmates, and on one occasion denied food to a serving prisoner. The same inspection also discovered that over half the population ‚Äì a significant number of whom were unconvicted ‚Äì spent 23 hours a day locked in a cell. Drugs are smuggled into Bristol Prison leading to prisoners behaving unpredictably and being sometimes violent. Numbers of prison officers have also fallen since 2010. Violence is a problem with staff and prisoners being injured. Prison officers are reluctant to assert their authority and feel unsupported when violence happens due to low staffing numbers. Recruiting prison officers is difficult.HMP Bristol: Substance abuse blamed for 'protracted rage' BBC The prison provides courses in inter-personal skills and enhanced thinking as well as employment training. Some prisoners are employed in the prison workshops, kitchen, gymnasium or as cleaners on the wings. In addition there is a 24-hour listeners scheme operating at Bristol for prisoners who may be at risk from suicide or self-harm. Healthcare at the prison consists of an Inpatient care unit with 24-hour nursing cover. There are also nurses posted to each wing during the core day to carry out treatments and triage prisoners with minor illness and injuries. There is a dedicated Integrated Drug Treatment Service (IDTS) at HMP Bristol which has achieved national recognition in the treatment, care and management of offenders with Drug and Alcohol misuse issues. This service is located on a dedicated wing with a multidisciplinary team that consists of Prison officers, Nurses and CARATs workers for drug counselling services. At all times during core day there is at least one GP on duty at the prison. In June 2019 inspectors visited the prison, giving it the lowest gradings for safety and purposeful activity. Subsequently lack of care for vulnerable prisoners was highlighted by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, and an \\"urgent notification\\" was issued to the prison by the Justice Secretary David Gauke.

The network protector automatically disconnect its associated distribution transformer from the secondary network when the power starts flowing in reverse direction. Network protectors are used on both spot networks and grid networks. The secondary grid system improves continuity of service for customers, since multiple sources are available to supply the load; a fault with any one supply is automatically isolated by the network protector and does not interrupt service from the other sources. Secondary grids are often used in downtown areas of cities where there are many customers in a small area. Operation Typically the network protector is set to close when the voltage difference and phase angle are such that the transformer will supply power to the secondary grid, and is set to open when the secondary grid would back-feed through the transformer and supply power to the primary circuit. Network protectors typically have three settings, \\"automatic\\", \\"open\\", and \\"close\\". The top side is fed from multiple protectors and is always energized unless all units on a spot network are in the open position. Grid units will always be energized on the top side from the many other units tied into the grid. A spot network is 2 or more transformers dedicated to a single customer. The grid feeds multiple customers. A network protector has a circuit breaker set of contacts and a controlling protection relay. The components are enclosed in a protective housing; some network protectors are installed on transformers below grade and must be in water-resistant enclosures. The mechanism contains electrical and mechanical parts to switch open and close the secondary contacts. The controlling relay monitors voltage and current in the transformer, and opens or closes the contact mechanism through electrical signals. The relay uses a power/time curve so that small, short term reverse power flow (such as from elevator hoists) are ignored. Spot units will be 277/480 and the grid units will be 120/208. Application The network protector does not protect the (secondary) network cable from overload. The network protector is installed to protect the stability and reliability of the secondary grid by preventing power flow away from the customers and into the primary feeders. If there is a fault on the primary feeder, the substation circuit-breaker is meant to open, disconnecting the primary feeder from one side. The problem is that this primary cable is also connected to a network transformer, which is interconnected to other network transformers on its secondary side. The secondary network will energize the primary feeder through the network transformer. This can be very dangerous, because a fault will continue to be 'fed' from the secondary network side of transformer. Even without a fault, if the electric utility wants to perform maintenance on that primary cable, they must have a way to fully disconnect that primary cable, without worrying about the cable being energized by the secondary network through the network transformer. Thus, the network protector is designed to open its contacts if the relay senses backwards flowing current. However, if there is a fault on the secondary grid, the network protector is not designed to open its contacts up. The secondary fault will continue to be fed from the primary side of the system. In some cases, networks are designed with cable limiters (like fuses) to melt and disconnect the secondary fault under the right conditions. In other cases, the utility lets cable 'burn clear', in which case the fault is allowed to remain fed until the cables fuse, then the fault is isolated. Analysis of the system is required to ensure that the system can, indeed, supply enough current to fuse the cables, wherever the fault is. This method tends to work well at 120 volts, but it is less reliable at higher voltages. The danger in depending on the cable to 'burn clear' is that some conditions will not cause the cable to burn in this manner and instead, the entire section of cable can be damaged from excessive, long-term overloading, causing fires and damage to the secondary network. Typically, network protectors are contained inside a submersible enclosure which is bolted to the throat of the network transformer and placed in underground vaults. IEEE standard C57.12.44 covers network protectors.

Down, by Emilia, second daughter of the Rev Hugh Montgomery of Grey Abbey. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and at the age of fifteen became a cadet at the Royal Military Academy Woolwich. Biography Reilly was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 18 December 1845, promoted first lieutenant on 3 April 1846 and second captain on 17 February 1854. In that year he was appointed aide-de-camp to General Fox-Strangways, who commanded the artillery in the Crimea; but, on his way out from England, he learned that Strangways had been killed in the battle of Inkerman. He went on to the Crimea, and volunteered for service as a battery officer. He was employed in the trenches through the winter, and in February 1855 he was made adjutant (and subsequently brigade-major) of the siege train. He was present at the several bombardments, and was three times mentioned in despatches. He received a brevet majority on 2 November 1855, the L√©gion d'honneur of France, and the fifth class of the Medjidie, and was created a companion of the Order of the Bath. After the fall of Sebastopol he was deputy-adjutant quartermaster-generalat the headquarters of the army till it left the Crimea in June 1856. From December 1856 to April 1859 Reilly was aide-de-camp to Sir Richard Dacres, commanding the Royal Artillery in Ireland, and, under Dacres's direction, he compiled the official account of the artillery operations of the siege of Sebastopol. During the war of 1866 between Prussia and Austria he was sent out as British commissioner with the Prussian army, but could not join it till 19 July, when the fighting was over. He wrote a memorandum on the Prussian army, or rather on its system of supply and transport, as tested in the field, and on its artillery material. While generally favourable, he blamed the hospital arrangements, and he pronounced the breech-loading guns inferior to muzzle-loading guns, and, for some purposes, even to smooth-bores. Reilly became regimental lieutenant-colonel in 1868, and next year was the guest of Lord Mayo in India, whence he wrote some descriptive letters to The Times newspaper. He spoke French fluently, and at the end of October 1870, while the siege of Paris was going on, he was sent out as extra military attach√© to the British embassy at Tours. He at once joined the headquarters of the French army of the Loire, and became the channel for distributing British contributions in aid of the wounded. He was present at the Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande, and the subsequent battles in front of Orl√©ans. The hurried evacuation of Orl√©ans by the French in the night of 4 December took place without his knowledge. He was arrested there next morning by the Prussians, and sent to England by way of Saarbr√ºcken and Belgium. He wished to rejoin the British embassy, then at Bordeaux, but the British government decided that he should not. In recognition of his services the French government raised him to the grade of officer of the Legion of Honour on 20 March 1872, and commander on 4 November 1878. From April 1871 to January 1876 he was employed in the War Office as assistant director of artillery. During this time he made several visits abroad to report on artillery questions: to Berlin in 1872 to France and to the Vienna exhibition in 1873. He also accompanied the Duke of Edinburgh to Russia in 1874. In his reports he still adhered to his preference for muzzle-loading guns, and did not think Great Britain had much to borrow from foreign artillery. He became brevet-colonel on 22 August 1873, and regimental colonel on 25 September 1877. In January 1879 he was appointed to command the royal artillery at Aldershot, but in the following month he was sent out to South Africa, in a similar capacity, to take part in the Zulu War, which was then entering on its second stage. While he was inspecting one of his batteries his horse fell with him, and broke his wrist; and this prevented his being present at Ulundi. After his return, in 1883, he became director of artillery at the war office, with the temporary rank of brigadier-general. He resigned this post at the end of 1884 on account of ill-health. On 1 May 1885 lie was appointed inspector-general of artillery, with the rank of major-general. On 28 July 1886 he died on board the steamer Mistletoe while engaged in the inspection of the artillery at Guernsey. He was buried with military honours at Cheriton, near Sandgate. A tablet and window in memory of him were put up in St. George's garrison church at Woolwich by his brother-officers. Reilly's knowledge of all matters pertaining to his arm of the service was most comprehensive, and as a practical artilleryman he had no rival. The energy that underlay his normal composure was conspicuously shown in the last months of his life, when he vindicated the ordnance department from the charges formulated by Colonel Hope in the columns of the Times. 'I deny the charges you make; I defy you to prove them; I assert that they are false!' was the last emphatic declaration of Reilly, written from Guernsey. A commission on warlike stores was appointed, under the chairmanship of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen to investigate the allegations; its report supported the charge of weak administration, but refuted that of corruption. Works Reilly published, besides pamphlets on the artillery or military organisation of France and Prussia: #An Account of the Artillery Operations before Sebastopol 4to, 1859 (written by desire of the Secretary of State for War). # Military Forces of the Kingdom pamphlet, 1867. # Supply of Ammunition to an Army in the Field, pamphlet, 1873. #War Material at the Vienna Exhibition, ' pamphlet, 1873.

In 1981, he survived for 76 days adrift on the Atlantic Ocean in a liferaft. Callahan recounted his ordeal in the best-selling book Adrift: 76 Days Lost At Sea (1986), which was on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 36 weeks. Biography Callahan holds a university degree in philosophy. A naval architect by training, Callahan has designed and built boats, taught design, lived aboard, raced, and cruised boats of all kinds. Since the 1980s, he has also written widely for the yachting press worldwide, has been a contributing editor to Sail and Sailor magazines, senior editor of Cruising World, has authored Adrift and Capsized, the story of four men who drifted for four months on an overturned, half-flooded boat. He has also lectured widely and contributed to a number of other books on design, seamanship, and survival. He holds three U.S. patents: a drogue-like boat stability and directional-control device (Patent No. 6684808); a Folding Rigid-Inflatable Boat (FRIB) (Patent No. 6367404); and a Folding Rigid-bottom Boat (FRB) (Patent No. 6739278). The initial model FRIB, called \\"The Clam\\" was developed on the basis of his survival experience. The Clam is a multifunction self-rescue dinghy, designed for use as a proactive lifeboat (as well as a yacht tender) that allows the sailor to sail to safety.\\"Sinking survivor designs life raft\\", CNN, April 22, 2002. Callahan asserts that \\"It certainly would be nice to have a completely different kind of raft now, what the French call a \\"Dynamic\\" raft, meaning the thing sails. The last time I lost my boat, had I been able to beam reach, I could have shortened my drift from 1,800 miles to 450; had I been able to sail even dead downwind but increase speed to a moderate 2.5 knots, I would have been afloat 25 days rather than 76; had I been able to do both I would have sailed to safety in a mere 6 or 7 days.\\" Adrift: 76 Days Lost at Sea Callahan departed Newport, Rhode Island, United States, in 1981 on the Napoleon Solo, a 6.5-meter (21.3-foot) sloop he designed and built himself, single-handedly sailed the boat to Bermuda, and continued the voyage to England with friend Chris Latchem. He had left Cornwall that fall, bound for Antigua as part of the Mini Transat 6.50 single-handed sailing race from Penzance, England, but dropped out of the race in La Coru√±a, Spain. Bad weather had sunk several boats in the fleet and damaged many others including Napoleon Solo. Callahan made repairs and continued voyaging down the coast of Spain and Portugal, out to Madeira and the Canaries. He departed El Hierro in the Canary Islands on January 29, 1982, still headed for Antigua. In a growing gale, seven days out, his vessel was badly holed by an unknown object during a night storm, and became swamped, although it did not sink outright due to watertight compartments Callahan had designed into the boat. In his book, Callahan writes that he suspects the damage occurred from a collision with a whale. Unable to stay aboard Napoleon Solo as it filled with water and was overwhelmed by breaking seas, Callahan escaped into a six-person Avon inflatable life raft, measuring about six feet across. He stood off in the raft, but managed to get back aboard several times to dive below and retrieve a piece of cushion, a sleeping bag, and an emergency kit containing, among other things, some food, navigation charts, a short spear gun, flares, torch, solar stills for producing drinking water and a copy of Sea Survival, a survival manual written by Dougal Robertson, a fellow ocean survivor. Before dawn, a big breaking sea parted the life raft from Napoleon Solo and Callahan drifted away.\\"Cleveland sailor inspired survival at sea, its lessons\\" , The Plain Dealer, August 14, 2005. The raft drifted westward with the South Equatorial Current and the trade winds. After exhausting the meager food supplies he had salvaged from the sinking sloop, Callahan survived by catching food. He mainly ate mahi- mahi, as well as triggerfish, which he speared, along with flying fish, barnacles, and birds that he captured. The sea life was all part of an ecosystem that evolved and followed him for across the ocean. He collected drinking water from two solar stills and various jury-rigged devices for collecting rainwater, which together produced on average just over a pint of water per day. Callahan's use of an EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) and many flares did not trigger a rescue. EPIRBs were not monitored by satellites at the time, and he was in too empty a part of the ocean to be heard by aircraft. Ships did not spot his flares. While adrift, he spotted nine ships, most in the two sea lanes he crossed, but from the beginning, Callahan knew that he could not rely upon rescue but instead must, for an undetermined time, rely upon himself and maintaining a shipboard routine for survival. He routinely exercised, navigated, prioritized problems, made repairs, fished, improved systems, and built food and water stocks for emergencies. On the eve of April 20, 1982, he spotted lights on the island of Marie Galante, south east of Guadeloupe. The next day, on Callahan's 76th day afloat in the raft, fishermen picked him up just offshore, drawn to him by birds hovering over the raft, which were attracted by the ecosystem that had developed around it. During the ordeal, he faced sharks, raft punctures, equipment deterioration, physical deterioration, and mental stress. Having lost a third of his weight and being covered with scores of saltwater sores, he was taken to a local hospital for an afternoon, but left that evening and spent the following weeks recovering on the island and while hitchhiking on boats up through the West Indies. During his journey, Callahan experienced a few positive elements aside from suffering, describing the night sky at one point as \\"A view of heaven from a seat in hell.\\" He still enjoys sailing and the sea, which he calls the world's greatest wilderness. Since his survival drift, he's made dozens of additional offshore passages and ocean crossings, most of them with no more than two other crew. This incident is featured on the I Shouldn't Be Alive episode \\"76 Days Adrift\\". Callahan's story also featured on an episode of British Survival expert Ray Mears Television series Extreme Survival. Life of Pi In the making of the 2012 movie Life of Pi, director Ang Lee asked Callahan to be a consultant on living aboard a life raft. Ang Lee told Callahan, \\"I want to make the ocean a real character in this movie\\". Callahan made lures and other tools seen in the movie.\\"Behind The Scenes With The Original Pi\\", BoatUS, December 2012.

When their Po-2 was shot down by a German fighter after completing a bombing mission she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 23 February 1945.  Early life  Belik was born in Ohrimovka () on 12 June 1921 to a Ukrainian family and was the oldest of six children; her father was a master electrician. For most of her childhood she lived in Kerch, Crimea where she graduated from secondary school in 1939 before she enrolled at the Karl Liebknecht Pedagogical Institute in Moscow, where she studied mathematics. Military career Before entering the military in October 1941, Belik participated in the construction of defenses such as anti-tank ditches. After joining the women's aviation unit founded by Marina Raskova she began navigation training at Engels Military Aviation school. Before the war, the navigation courses lasted three years, but due to the state of the war at the time, it only lasted six months. In May 1942 she was deployed to the front with the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, which was to the later redesignated the 46th Guards Regiment in 1943. She worked closely with Tatyana Makarova who served as pilot of the Po-2 they flew while she navigated. In December 1942, the regiment was expanded and Belik was promoted to navigator of the second squadron, which Makarova became commander of. However, after Josef Kociok shot down four planes from the squadron on the night of 31 July-1 August, Makarova requested demotion back to flight commander, and Belik chose to request demotion too in order to stay with her friend. She flew in difficult sorties over Ukraine, the Kuban area of the North Caucasus, the Crimea, Belorussia, and Poland. On 1 August 1944, she and Makarova flew the first bombing mission over East Prussia, becoming the first aircrew of the regiment to fight over German soil. On the night of 25 August 1944 on her 813th sortie, the plane Belik and Makarova were flying was attacked by a German fighter over Ostro≈Çƒôka, Poland, killing both of them after it caught fire and crashed. In her 813 sorties she had dropped 106 tons of explosives over enemy controlled territory, caused 156 major explosions and 143 fires, destroyed two searchlights, two ammunition depots, three enemy crossings, three ground-based anti-aircraft guns, and over two platoons of enemy infantry personnel. For her combat operations she was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union and posthumously awarded the title on 23 February 1945, the same day as her pilot Makarova.

It was first released on the NEC PC-6001 in June 1983, and has since been ported to other personal computers, the Nintendo Famicom, and mobile phone services. In the game, the player must resolve a murder mystery by searching for clues, exploring different areas, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles. The game features first-person graphics, nonlinear gameplay, an open world, conversations with non-player characters, branching dialogue choices, suspect interrogations, nonlinear storytelling, and plot twists. The Famicom version also features a command menu system, point-and-click interface, and 3D dungeon maze. Upon its release, The Portopia Serial Murder Case was well received in Japan. It became an influential title and helped define the visual novel genre. Gameplay The crime scene in the original version of the game on the PC-6001. The Portopia Serial Murder Case follows a first-person perspective and narrative. The various events are described with still pictures and text messages. The player interacts with the game using a verb- noun parser which requires typing precise commands with the keyboard. Finding the exact words to type is considered part of the riddles that must be solved. While sound effects are present, the game lacks music and a save function. (Translation) It features a conversation system with branching dialogue choices, where the story develops through entering commands and receiving answers to them from the player's sidekick or non-player characters. (Reprinted at ) The game features nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple different ways to achieve objectives. Reprinted from This includes travelling between different areas in an open world and making choices that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternative endings depending on who the player identifies as the culprit. However, only one of the characters is the true culprit, while the others are red herrings; if the player closes the case with the wrong culprit, then the player will face criticism from the police chief and need to re-open the case. The game includes a phone that could be used to manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features an inventory system requiring the examination and collection of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game. With no keyboard, the Famicom version replaces the verb-noun parser with a menu list of fourteen set commands selectable with the gamepad. This is similar to the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game Okhotsk ni Kiyu: Hokkaido Rensa Satsujin Jiken, which was released in 1984, (Translation ) in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games. Setting and characters Although the story of the game is fictional, it is set in real Japanese cities; mainly Kobe, in addition to a few sequences in Kyoto and Sumoto. The president of a successful bank company, , is found dead by his secretary inside a locked room in his mansion. Signs seem to indicate that Kouzou stabbed himself; however, the police sends a detective to investigate further. The detective in charge of the case is an unnamed, unseen and silent protagonist who essentially embodies the player, and is simply referred to as . He works with an assistant named , nicknamed , who is the one who actually speaks and executes most of the player's commands. Other characters include, among others, , daughter of a man named ; , Kouzou's nephew and heir; and , a stripper. Development and release Artwork for the second mobile version of the game. Yasu is in the center, wearing a black suit and white shirt. The game was conceived by Yuji Horii around 1981, when he was 27 years old, shortly after he bought his first computer and learned to program with it by modifying other games. During this time, he read a PC magazine article about a computer game genre in the United States, text adventures. Horii noticed the lack of such games in the Japanese market and decided to create an adventure game of his own. Horii also cited the manga authors Tetsuya Chiba, Mitsuru Adachi and Katsuhiro Otomo as influences. The game was developed using the BASIC programming language. Horii wanted to expand on the adventure game genre with his own ideas. One such concept was to create \\"a program in which the story would develop through entering a command and by receiving an answer to it.\\" His idea was for \\"a game that progresses through conversations between a human and a computer.\\" He \\"started to get more ambitious,\\" and thought he \\"could make the computer converse\\" if enough data is entered, attempting to create an artificial intelligence language algorithm. However, he realized this was not possible on computers at the time, so he created \\"dialogue for the computer beforehand\\" where the player \\"could type in some words, and the computer would reply back with some reaction.\\" Another concept was that, in contrast to other \\"very linear\\" stories in adventure games at the time, his idea was for branching, non-linear storytelling, where \\"the main scenario should only take up about 20% of the game‚Äôs content, and the remaining 80% should be in response to the various actions of the player.\\" However, due to PC memory limitations, he was only able to create several short branching scenarios, which he still found more interesting than one long linear scenario. He also conceived of a graphical format, with a picture on-screen representing what's happening and a command menu system to select an action, which later became the standard format for Japanese adventure games. Following its 1983 release, the game was ported to various Japanese personal computers. A Famicom port was then released in 1985 and was the first adventure game to be released on that platform. The Famicom version was also the first collaboration between Yuuji Horii and Koichi Nakamura of Chunsoft, before Dragon Quest. The Famicom version was programmed by Nakamura, who was 19 years old at the time. This version of Portopia changed the interface, adopting the command menu system that Horii created for the 1984 adventure game Okhotsk ni Kiyu: Hokkaido Rensa Satsujin Jiken. Due to frustration with text-based entry, admitting he was never able to get very far in adventure games because of it, Horii created a command menu system for Hokkaido, which was later used in the Famicom version of Portopia. Horii also noted that, for the Famicom versions of both Portopia and Hokkaido, he wanted to make them appealing to a more mature audience, beyond the Famicom's typical younger audience. He was also playing Wizardry at the time, inspiring him to include a 3D dungeon maze in the Famicom version of Portopia. The game was never released in the Western world, largely due to its mature content, involving themes such as murder, suicide, fraud, bankruptcy, interrogation beatings, drug dealings, and a strip club. The lack of a Western release prompted ROM hacking group DvD Translations to develop an unofficial translation of the Famicom version. The first mobile phone version of the game was branded as a part of a trilogy along with mobile versions of Hokkaido Rensa Satsujin Okhotsk ni Kiyu and Karuizawa Y≈´kai Annai. It was released in 2003 on EZweb and Yahoo! Keitai services. It features a list of set commands similar to the Famicom version but also improved graphics, no free-moving cursor, and a save function. The games of the trilogy, which was retitled , were re-released in 2005 and 2006 on the same services. The second Portopia version possesses the same content as the first mobile one, in addition to updated graphics, background music, a bonus function obtained after completing the game, and a hint option which nullifies the ending bonus if it is used too frequently. Reception and legacy The Famicom version of the game sold 700,000 copies. The game was well received in Japan for allowing multiple ways to achieve objectives, its well-told storyline, and its surprising twist ending. The Japanese press described it as \\"a game without game over\\" because \\"there was technically no way to lose.\\" According to Square Enix, it was \\"the first real detective adventure\\" game. The game, along with Super Mario Bros., inspired Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series, to enter the video game industry. He praised Portopia for its mystery, drama, humor, 3D dungeons, for providing a proper background and explanation behind the murderer's motives, and expanding the potential of video games. Kojima considers it one of the three most influential games he's played, with its influence evident in his games, including the Metal Gear series and Snatcher. The PC-6001 version of Portopia Serial Murder Case is included as a hidden secret in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.MGS 5 fans are starting to unravel the secret game Kojima hid in its code , GamesRadar Portopia was also one of the first video games ever played by Nintendo's Eiji Aonuma, who went on to become the director of The Legend of Zelda series starting with Ocarina of Time.Latest Zelda‚Äôs making process & ‚ÄúOcarina of Time‚Äù proposal disclosed (Nintendo Eiji Aonuma x SQEX Jin Fujisawa) (interview) , DenfaminicoGamer, 9 June 2017 Portopias influence is also evident in Horii's own later work, including the seminal role-playing game Dragon Quest, which used storytelling techniques and the menu interface from Portopia. John Szczepaniak of Retro Gamer considers it \\"one of the most influential games\\" as it was responsible for defining the visual novel genre, comparing it to the role of Super Mario Bros., Tetris and Street Fighter in defining their own respective genres (platform game, puzzle game, and fighting game, respectively). In 2003, The Portopia Serial Murder Case ranked 19th in a poll to determine the thirty best Famicom games; the poll was conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography as part of its \\"Level X\\" exhibition. The English-language webzine Retrogaming Times Monthly compared the game to the later-released Shadowgate where the player must examine and collect objects and find their true purpose later on, and recommended Portopia to fans of \\"slower paced games that require [players] to think through puzzles\\". John Szczepaniak praised its pacing and quality of writing, and considers the gameplay and plot to be sophisticated for its time. He noted that it contains elements found in a number of later titles, including D√©j√† Vu, Snatcher, 428: Shibuya Scramble, and Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. 1UP also noted that Portopia is similar to ICOM Simulations' D√©j√† Vu released several years later. Nintendo's successful Famicom Detective Club series of adventure games were also inspired by Portopia. USgamer compared it to the later Police Quest adventure games and CSI television series, as well as classic Sherlock Holmes novels. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Portopias features, such as point-and-click, murder mystery plot, open world, suspect interrogations, nonlinear gameplay, dialogue choices, and alternate endings, are \\"standard for 2015, but way ahead of its time in 1983\\", comparing it to L.A. Noire. Peter Tieryas gave Portopia a positive retrospective review, stating that, while its \\"influence is undeniable, it's the tragic back story, the strange vicissitudes the characters face, the uncanny freedom to investigate, and the haunting uncovering of the killer that makes it so special.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Famicom version official page * Second mobile version official websites: EZweb, i-mode, Keitai * * Category:1983 video games Category:1985 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Chunsoft games Category:Detective video games Category:Enix games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Mobile games Category:MSX games Category:FM-7 games Category:Sharp X1 games Category:NEC PC-6001 games Category:NEC PC-8001 games Category:NEC PC-8801 games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Open world video games Category:Square Enix games Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Visual novels Category:Single- player video games ","title":"The Portopia Serial Murder Case"},{"id":"12786691","text":"Map of the Wild Fields in the 17th century Delineatio Generalis Camporum Desertorum vulgo Ukraina (General sketch of deserted fields commonly Ukraina) The Wild Fields (, , , , or , also translated as \\"the Wilderness\\") is a historical term used in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian documents of the 16th to 18th centuriesCamporum Desertorum vulgo Ukraina by Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan, Cum Privilegio S.R.M.

Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine wrote about the unseen natural riches of the steppes and the Dnieper basin. The territory was ruled by the Golden Horde until the Battle of Blue Waters (1362), which allowed Algirdas to claim it for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. As a result of the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399, his successor Vytautas lost the territory to Temur Qutlugh, the khan of the Golden Horde. In 1441 the western section of the Wild Fields, Yedisan, came to be dominated by the Crimean Khanate, a political entity controlled by the expanding Ottoman Empire from the 16th century onward. The Wild Fields were also dominated by the Zaporizhian Cossacks, as reflected in works of the Polish theologian and Catholic bishop of Kyiv J√≥zef Wereszczy≈Ñski. Cossacks explored the fields under condition of permanent fight against population of the Tatar's uluses, Nogai Horde, Crimean Khanate. The Wild Fields were traversed by the Muravsky Trail and Izyumsky Trail, important warpaths used by the Crimean Tatars to invade and pillage the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The Crimean-Nogai Raids, a long period of raids and fighting between Crimean Tatars, Nogai Horde, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, brought considerable devastation and depopulation to this area before the rise of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, who periodically sailed down the Dnieper in dugouts from their base at Khortytsia and raided the coast of the Black Sea. The Turks built several fortress towns to defend the littoral, including Kara Kerman (Ochakiv) and Khadjibey (Odessa). By the 17th century, the east part of the Wild Fields had been settled by runaway peasants and serfs who made up the core of the Cossackdom. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising the north part of this area was settled by the Cossacks from the Dnieper basin and came to be known as Sloboda Ukraine. After a series of Russo-Turkish wars waged by Catherine the Great, the area formerly controlled by the Ottomans and the Crimeans was incorporated into the Russian Empire. In the 20th century, the region was divided among Ukraine, Moldova, and Russia.

In them, he identifies his musical The Threepenny Opera (1928) as an example of \\"epic form\\". \\"[B]y Aristotle's definition,\\" Brecht writes, \\"the difference between the dramatic and epic forms was attributed to their different methods of construction.\\"From an essay by Brecht probably written in 1936; Brecht (1964, 70). Method of construction here refers to the relation the play establishes between its parts and its whole: Brecht also defines the contrast between the traditional, Aristotelian 'dramatic' and his own 'epic' as corresponding to idealist and materialist philosophical positions: It is this materialist perspective on the world, and specifically on the human being, that renders the epic form particularly appropriate and useful to the dramatist, Brecht argues. Contemporary science (the term includes what English calls \\"human sciences\\"; especially, for Brecht, historical materialism) reveals that the human being is determined by and determining of its circumstances (\\"social\\" and \\"physical\\"). The epic form enables the drama to stage humanity in a way that incorporates this scientific understanding; the dramatist becomes able to show the human (the level of interpersonal relationships) in interaction with the larger forces and dynamics at work in society (the supra-personal, historical scale):This gloss draws on Szondi (1965). Epic Theatre also rejects the principle of natura non facit saltus (nature does not make jumps) which is a methodological assumption of Swedish naturalist Carl Linn√¶us used in his categorization of plants and animals.

At the time, it was also a challenge to the military government. It was an idealistic but effective political cell which fought against the authoritarian way the club's management controlled its players, a microcosm of the way the country was governed by the military.

In its simplest form, fixing the not/but element involves the actor preceding each thought that is expressed by their character in the dialogue or each action performed by their character in the scene with its dialectical opposite. Rather than portraying a thought or action as \\"naturally\\" arising from the given circumstances of the scene or \\"inevitably\\" following from them, this technique underlines the aspect of decision in the thought or action. \\"He didn't say 'come in' but 'keep moving'\\", Brecht offers by way of example; \\"He was not pleased but amazed\\": > They include an expectation which is justified by experience but, in the > event, disappointed. One might have thought that ... but one oughtn't to > have thought it. There was not just one possibility but two; both are > introduced, then the second one is defamiliarized, then the first as > well.Brecht (1964, 144); trans. of Verfremdung amended slightly. This technique is a rehearsal exercise; the verbalizing of the alternative (the \\"not\\" of the \\"not/but\\") is not necessarily preserved in performance. Its main function is to inscribe traces of the alternatives that were available to the character at each 'nodal point' in their journey within the finished portrait in performance. The effect gives the impression of a \\"sketching\\" in the actor's performance, in the sense that with an artist's sketch traces of alternative lines and movements are preserved, overlapping the main defining line rather than being erased. It is this quality that leads Fredric Jameson to contrast Brechtian theatre favourably with what he calls the \\"well-made production\\", insofar as its preservation of the actor's process in the final product acts as a form of demystification and de-fetishization, and exploits a potential strength of the medium of theatre: > The well-made production is one from which the traces of its rehearsals have > been removed (just as from the successfully reified commodity the traces of > production itself have been made to disappear): Brecht opens up this > surface, and allows us to see back down into the alternative gestures and > postures of the actors trying out their roles: so it is that aesthetic > experimentation generally‚Äîwhich has so often been understood as generating > the new and the hitherto unexperienced, the radical innovation‚Äîmight just as > well be grasped as the \\"experimental\\" attempt to ward off reification > (something the other arts, from novels and films to poetry, painting, and > musical performance, even aleatory performance, are structurally and > materially less qualified to do).Jameson (1998, 11‚Äì12). In coining the term > \\"well-made production\\", Jameson recalls the \\"well-made play\\" formula of > nineteenth-century dramaturgy. The result of the technique of fixing the not/but is to shape and clarify the character's behaviour in a particular, interpretative direction (a historical materialist one).

First found in Brecht's notes to the Threepenny Opera, a subsequently edited and updated version was published. This text can be found in English translation as \\"The Literarization of Theatre\\" from 1931, in Brecht on Theatre, where the key passage on complex seeing reads: ‚ÄúSome exercise in complex seeing is needed‚Äîthough it is perhaps more important to be able to think above the stream than to think in the stream.\\"(44) Here Brecht describes a desired form of spectator activity, in which the 'stream' of the play's action does not entirely capture the audience's attention, which is instead divided within and without. This is part of Brecht's many attempts to open a new critical possibilities for theatre, which in this case emphasizes a type of expert-detachment on the part of the spectator. Continuing the quotation from above: \\"Moreover the use of screens imposes and facilitates a new style of acting. This style of acting is the epic style. As he reads the projections on the screen the spectator adopts an attitude of smoking-and-watching. Such an attitude on his part at once compels a better and clearer performance as it is hopeless to 'carry away' any man who is smoking and accordingly pretty well occupied with himself. By these means one would soon have a theatre full of experts, just as one has sporting arenas full of experts. [...] Unfortunately it is to be feared that titles and permissions to smoke are not of themselves enough to lead the audience to a more fruitful use of the theatre.\\"(44) A major source for the concept of complex seeing in English is Raymond Williams' writings on the subject, which include his 1961 \\"The Achievement of Brecht\\", published in Critical Quarterly, as well as the relevant chapters of his 1966 Modern Tragedy and 1968 Drama From Ibsen to Brecht. Here Williams develops the idea of complex seeing away from Brecht's discussion of the audience and instead towards the plays. Williams' complex seeing departs from Brecht's metaphor of 'above' and 'within' a flow of action towards a type of double vision which presents contradictions in social life without attempting to resolve them.

He helped to develop the philosophy of law known as legal realism, and wrote one of the most celebrated legal treatises of the Twentieth century, Corbin on Contracts. Early life Corbin was born in Cripple Creek, Colorado, on October 17, 1874. He graduated from the University of Kansas in 1894 and briefly taught high school in Augusta, Kansas and Lawrence, Kansas. He earned his law degree from Yale Law School in 1899, graduating magna cum laude. Following graduation from Yale, he practiced law in Cripple Creek, Colorado. Corbin returned to Yale Law School in 1903 to serve as an instructor in contract law. Career at Yale Corbin became a full professor at Yale Law School in 1909, a position he would hold until his retirement from teaching in 1943. During his time at Yale, he was strongly influential in turning the law school into the center of legal scholarship it is known for today. He convinced the administration to hire more full-time professors and enact more selective admission criteria, and helped to implement and popularize the casebook method of legal study created by Christopher Columbus Langdell at Harvard Law School. He was a founder of the American Law Institute and the first reporter of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. Scholarship and writings Corbin wrote extensively in the field of contract law. His most famous work was the treatise Corbin on Contracts: A Comprehensive Treatise on the Working Rules of Contracts Law, the original version of which was eight volumes long and appeared in 1950 (though it has since been expanded).Entry on Corbin from Thompson-Gale legal encyclopedia, courtesy of Jrank This treatise is still used today in American law schools and cited in law journals and judicial opinions. Corbin subscribed to the philosophy of legal realism, the idea that law was the product of human efforts and society. He believed that in resolving contract disputes, judges should examine not just the \\"four corners\\" of the legal document itself, but the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the course of dealing and course of performance between the parties, as well as the customs of the trade and business community. Corbin felt that the main purpose of a contract was to protect the reasonable expectations of each party. Corbin's views are frequently contrasted with those of Harvard contracts scholar Samuel Williston, who was more of a formalist in his thinking. Williston served as the reporter for the First Restatement of Contracts, but Corbin's contributions were more evident in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which he worked on until his retirement from legal study at age 90, due to failing eyesight. Corbin died at age 92, in 1967. Corbin's scholarship heavily influenced the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code, particularly the work of Karl Llewellyn, who had previously studied under Corbin.

The village was named after the former abbey that existed between the 13th and 16th centuries.  History  The name Abbey Hulton is derived from 'hilltown' (Anglo-Saxon hyll + t≈´n; Middle English hil, hull + toun; 13th & 14th century Hulton) with the addition of 'abbey' from the Cistercian abbey founded here in 1223. It is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086-87 as Heltone, in Pirehill Hundred, when it was held by Robert of Stafford. Henry de Aldithley (or Audley) endowed the Cistercian Abbey of St. Mary at Hulton, near the site of Heleigh Castle in 1223, donating a large amount of land, some of which was an inheritance from his mother and some of which was purchased. The endowment consisted of the villages of Julton and Rushton to the south of Burslem with \\"Manesmore\\", a wood at Sneyd, all Henry's land at Bucknall and Anormancot, a meadow called \\"bukkeley\\", and in the northeast of the county the village of Mixon and the \\"vills and tenements\\" of Bradnop, Middle Cliff, Apesford, \\"Ruhegh\\", and \\"Mulnesley\\" with a pasture at Morridge and a wood at \\"Witherward.\\" The grant also included a yearly pension of 10 marks from Audley church. Later in 1232 Henry made a new grant of the vills of Mixon and Bradnop (probably additional land in these manors) with the services of all the inhabitants within 5 years of the death of Ranulph, Earl of Chester. This grant was given in exchange for the saying of mass by 13 monks \\"all the days of the world\\" for the souls of Ranulph (Henry's overlord, the Earl of Chester who died in 1232), Henry, Henry's predecessors and successors, and all the faithful departed. All the remainder of his life Henry de Aldithley was considered a patron of the monks at Hulton. Hulton Abbey received other gifts from the Aldithley family and other local lords over the next centuries. Compared to the other great Abbeys of England, Hulton was small and poor. The monks engaged in agriculture, raised sheep and operated a tannery (making leather). It was taken apart (disbanded) in 1538 and its lands sold.

Dark City: The Film Noir, film listed as film noir #485 on page 196, 1984. Jefferson, N.C. & London: McFarland Publishing. . directed by Jean Renoir and starring Joan Bennett, Robert Ryan and Charles Bickford. It was released by RKO Radio Pictures. The film is a love triangle drama about Scott, a conflicted U.S. Coast Guard officer (Ryan), and his pursuit of Peggy, a married woman (Bennett). Peggy is married to Tod, a blind artist (Bickford). Plot Scott (Robert Ryan), a mounted Coast Guard officer, suffers from recurring nightmares involving a maritime tragedy. He sees himself immersed in an eerie landscape surrounded by a shipwreck and walking over skeletons at the bottom of the sea while a ghostly blond woman beckons him from afar. He thinks he is going mad. But at the same time, he decides to propose to Eve (Nan Leslie), a young woman working at Geddes, a local shipyard catering to the Coast Guard. She accepts. Eve has a strong resemblance to the ghostly blond of his nightmares. While riding by the seaside on his horse, Scott meets Peggy (Joan Bennett), a brunette, the mysterious wife of Tod (Charles Bickford), a blind painter. At first, though, he rides by her as she stands near a shipwreck protruding from the sand; she seems like an eerie echo from his nightmares. After a conversation, they discover that they share similar metaphysical anxieties. A bond develops between the two but the situation gets more tangled when Tod tries to befriend Scott. Tod's attitude toward Scott, apart from his friendship, is also ambivalent. The retired painter tries to test Peggy and Scott to gauge how far they could go in their relationship. Outwardly Tod seems confident; he even tells Peggy that he knows she could never leave him and that he finds Scott, a much younger man, virile but banal. However behind this facade lies a deeply wounded man who cannot come to terms with the fact that because of his blindness, he cannot paint any longer. In one exchange with Scott he tells him that dead painters' works always appreciate in value. Indeed, he expects the value of his paintings to increase, considering he is now 'dead' as a painter. Initially Scott is suspicious of Tod's motives; he also suspects that Tod is not blind. Scott is also increasingly interested in Peggy, who returns his attentions. During an outing that Scott sets up to test the painter, he moves Tod near the edge of a cliff, but then inadvertently lets him fall, thinking that he will be forced to see and therefore avoid the fall at the last minute. After this mishap, Tod eventually recovers. He at first thinks that Scott would now become his friend since the fall would remove any doubts about his true blindness. But soon after Tod exhibits abusive behavior toward Peggy when he realizes that she has hidden his masterpiece, his portrait of her. Seeing this, Scott tries to protect her. As Scott grows more attracted to Peggy, he becomes ambivalent toward his earlier relationship with Eve Geddes. Eve in turn, sensing Scott's infatuation with Peggy, becomes distant and asks Scott to delay their marriage plans. The narrative reaches one climax when Scott attempts to drown both Tod and himself during a boat outing with him that started as a fishing trip. By trying to pierce the bottom of the boat, it's apparent that Scott has put himself in danger as well, since he would be swimming helpless in the stormy seas had he been successful at this attempt. This scene illustrates the degree of his desperation, if not madness. This attempt by Scott to drown Tod reveals the depth of his emotional attachment to Peggy. Scott's plan fails, however, because Peggy, who seemingly went along with his plan, has a change of heart and alerts the authorities. Both Tod and Scott are eventually rescued by the Coast Guard. Eve, part of the rescue team, echoes the metaphysical connection to the blonde of his undersea nightmare who beckoned Scott in his dreams. In the film's finale, Tod burns all his paintings along with the house he and Peggy lived in. Peggy frantically tries to stop Tod and save the paintings: they are worth a fortune. She fails, as Scott forces her out of the collapsing house. After they have moved safely away, Scott asks Tod why he did it. Tod says the paintings were a symbol of the obsession he had with his previous, sighted life. Now that Tod's obsession with his past has been purged, he is free to go on with his life. He asks Peggy to take him to New York, where they have happy memories of their earlier life together. Afterwards she may \\"do as she pleases\\". Peggy embraces Tod. Observing this, Scott leaves them.

He noted the circular winds around a calm centre recorded by ships caught in storms and coined the name cyclone in 1848. Scientific pursuits Henry Piddington was the third of eight (excluding a ninth child who died at infancy) children born to an innkeeper at Lewes, James John Piddington (1757‚Äì1837) and his wife, Elizabeth Ann (1762‚Äì1835). The family moved to Uckfield in 1802‚Äì03 where the Henry would have encountered travelling sailors at the inn where his father worked. Little is known of his early sailing life but he rose to command a ship and by 1824 he was living in Bengal and settled in Calcutta around 1831 and took an interest in scientific pursuits. He worked in sugar refining and was a foreign secretary of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India till 1837. In 1833 he wrote Examination and analysis of some specimens of iron ore from Burdwan and On the fertilising principles of the inundations of the Hugli in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He was then appointed curator of the newly established Museum of Economic Geology in Calcutta in 1844 and over the next decade he continued to publish many scientific papers on geology, botany, mineralogy, and meteorology in India. In 1832, he compiled a list of the plants of economic importance and from 1835 he wrote on a variety of topics including descriptions of fish, reviews of fossil finds in South America and on geology. He sometimes reviewed and translated content published in other journals. Law of Storms A storm card to guide sailors In 1833 a cyclone hit Calcutta and Piddington took little interest in it but in 1838 he stumbled on the \\"Law of Storms\\" by (then) Lt.-Colonel William Reid and this led him to return to his sailing experience and take an interest in ship logs. He was assisted by Captain Christopher Biden, the Master Attendant at Madras. Piddington also corresponded with R. W. Redfield who worked on storms around North America. His interest led the government to send all records of storms to Piddington from September 1839. Title page of the \\"Horn Book\\" (1848 edition) which included a translucent \\"storm card\\" in a sleeve within the book The result of Piddington's studies based on the logs of several ships, notably the Brig Charles Heddle which was trapped in a storm off Mauritius was his observation of the spiral wind tracks and he wrote a series of papers (24 memoirs in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal) on the topic. He noticed that the storms had a calm centre and that the winds around them ran anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. This was followed by a book, The Horn-Book for the Law of Storms for the Indian and China Seas the first edition of which was published in 1844. He produced a second edition in 1848 and he introduced the word \\"cyclone\\" derived from Greek Œ∫œçŒ∫ŒªŒøœÇ (kyklos, meaning \\"circle\\" or \\"ring\\") based on the helical nature of the winds. The idea of the horn book was that a translucent sheet (made of horn) with the diagram of the cyclone could be placed on a map so that the wind directions could be readily compared by any sailor to identify a cyclone so that a tacking course to avoid it could be followed. A review in Nautical Magazine (1848) however claimed that it reminded the author of a children's \\"horn book\\" to teach alphabets. The book ran into many editions and Piddington was even made a president of the marine court of enquiry at Calcutta in 1851. In 1853 he advised the Governor General that Port Canning was best not built on the southeastern side of Calcutta as it was vulnerable to storms. The Port was however built there and after Piddington's death, it was devastated in 1867 by a storm and abandoned a few years later. Other positions Piddington held other positions as a secretary to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society; Her Majesty's Coroner of Calcutta (from 1844); and President of Marine Courts of Enquiry. Personal life Piddington married Jeanne Julie Josephine Gaultier de Lavalette (died 4 September 1875) and they had three sons of whom Alfred (1831-c. 1880) and Edmund (1832-1869) worked in the court at Calcutta while an older son was born in 1820 but died young in 1830.

It is based on the book Post Mortem: The Story of Katyn by Andrzej Mularczyk. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for the 80th Academy Awards. Background German officers present their findings regarding Katyn to captured Allied officers in 1943. The Katyn massacre, also known as the zbrodnia katy≈Ñska ('Katy≈Ñ crime'), was a mass execution of Polish POW officers and citizens ordered by the Soviet authorities in 1940. The most widely accepted estimate of the number of dead is about 22,000. The victims were murdered in the Katyn forest, Kalinin (Tver) and Kharkiv prisons, and elsewhere. About 8,000 were officers taken prisoner during the Soviet 1939 invasion of Poland, the rest being Poles arrested for allegedly being \\"intelligence agents, gendarmes, spies, saboteurs, landowners, factory owners, lawyers, priests, and officials.\\" During the German occupation of Poland, the Germans used the massacre for propaganda purposes against the Soviets. However, after the war, when Poland fell under Soviet influence, the truth about the event was suppressed by the Soviet authorities, who maintained an official line throughout the Eastern Bloc that the massacre was committed by the Germans. With the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, the first non- communist Polish government immediately acknowledged that the crime was committed by the Soviets. In 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged Soviet responsibility for the Katyn massacre for the first time. In 1991, Boris Yeltsin made public the documents which had authorised the massacre. There are now some cemeteries of Polish officers in the vicinity of the massacres, but many facts of the event remain undisclosed to this day and many graves of the Polish POWs east of the Bug River are either still unmarked or in a state of disrepair. Plot A German-made prison bus used by the NKVD for transport of prisoners; the bus was reconstructed for the purpose of the film. The events of Katyn are relayed through the eyes of the women, the mothers, wives, and daughters of the victims executed on Stalin's orders by the NKVD in 1940. Andrzej (Artur Zmijewski) is a young Polish captain in the 8th Uhlan Regiment of Duke Jozef Poniatowski, who keeps a detailed diary. In September 1939, he is taken prisoner by the Soviet Army, which separates the officers from the enlisted men, who are allowed to return home, while the officers are held. His wife Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) and daughter Weronika, nicknamed \\"Nika\\" (Wiktoria GƒÖsiewska), find him shortly before he is deported to the USSR. Presented with an opportunity to escape, he refuses on the basis of his oath of loyalty to the Polish military. Helped by a sympathetic Soviet officer, Anna manages to return to the family's home in Cracow with her daughter. There, the Germans carry out Sonderaktion Krakau, shutting down Jagiellonian University and deporting professors to concentration camps. Andrzej's father is one of the professors deported; later, his wife gets a message that he died in a camp in 1941. In a prisoner of war camp, Andrzej is detained for a while and continues to keep a diary. He carefully records the names of all his fellow officers who are removed from the camp, and the dates on which they are taken. During the winter, Andrzej is clearly suffering in the low temperature, and his colleague Jerzy (Andrzej Chyra) lends him an extra sweater. As it happens, the sweater has Jerzy's name written on it. Finally, Andrzej's is taken from the camp, while Jerzy is left behind. In 1943, the population of Cracow is informed by the occupying power about the Katyn massacre. Capitalizing on the Soviet crime, the Nazi propaganda publishes lists with the names of the victims exhumed in mass graves behind the advancing German troops. Andrzej's name is not on the list, giving his wife and daughter hope. After the war, Jerzy, who has survived, has enlisted in the People's Army of Poland (LWP), which is under the complete control of the pro-Soviet Polish United Worker's Party. He feels personal loyalty to his friends, loves his country, and has sympathy for those who have suffered. He visits Anna and her daughter to tell them that Andrzej is dead. Apparently, when the list of the names of the victims was compiled, Andrzej was misidentified as Jerzy on the basis of the name in the sweater that Jerzy had lent to Andrzej; it was Andrzej who was killed, not Jerzy. Despondent that he is now forced to acknowledge a lie and to serve those who killed his comrades in Katyn, Jerzy commits suicide. Evidence of Soviet responsibility for the Katyn massacre is carefully concealed by the authorities. However, a few daring people working with the effects of the victims eventually deliver Andrzej's diary to his widow Anna. The diary clearly shows the date in 1940 when he must have been killed from the absence of entries on subsequent days. The date of the massacre is crucial for assigning responsibility: if it happened in 1940, the USSR controlled the territory, while by mid-1941 the Germans took control over it. The film ends with a re-enactment of parts of the massacre, as several of the principal characters are executed along with other soldiers. The film includes excerpts from German newsreels presenting the Katyn massacre as a Soviet crime, and excerpts from Soviet newsreels presenting the massacre as a German crime. Production Filming began on October 3, 2006, and ended on January 9, 2007. The film premiered on September 17, 2007, the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.

After flooding hit the area in 2007 the Environment Agency and Wakefield Metropolitan District Council commenced with flood defence work around Oakenshaw Beck and the land off Montague Street and Doncaster Road.  Transport  Agbrigg is served by Sandal & Agbrigg station which is on the Wakefield Line and the station is between Wakefield Westgate and Fitzwilliam. This station was originally named Sandal and closed to passengers on 4 November 1957, but reopened by the West Yorkshire Metro on 30 November 1987 with its current name.  Amenities  The majority of the suburb is made up of terraced houses however there are newer houses built on former fields and farmland. The Agbrigg and Belle Vue Community Centre can be found on Montague Street which was built upon former terrace housing and a library (called 'Sandal Library') is situated off Sparable Lane opposite a former pub which is now a Tesco Express store. Agbrigg had one pub - The Duke of York (now closed) situated at the junction of Belle Vue Road and Agbrigg Road next to a convenience store, formerly a co-op, now a McColl's. There are a number of independent retailers within the area - many situated on Agbrigg Road. Agbrigg Park is situated opposite the former Duke of York pub and contains a small play area for children and football goalposts - there is a footpath which links Church View with the footpath from Montague Street.  Education  The main primary school for the suburb is Sandal Magna Community Academy (formerly Sandal Magna Primary School) which is located on Belle Vue Road - the original Victorian buildings were demolished and a brand new school was built in 2010 and has won a number of awards for its architecture - including the RIBA Northern Networks Awards Sustainability Award in 2010 and RIBA Northern Networks Awards Building of the Year Award in 2011.Sarah Wigglesworth Architects (2010) Sandal Magna Primary School Accessed 20 March 2014.

Bain (27 March 1896 ‚Äì 22 January 1985) was an American architect and a founder of the architecture firm, Naramore, Bain, Brady and Johanson, the predecessor to today's NBBJ. Bain was born in New Westminster, British Columbia. His family moved to Seattle while he was still young. Bain expressed an interest in architecture, and his father, a contractor, helped him get a job with Seattle architect Walter R. B. Willcox, from whom he learned the rudiments of drafting and developed beginning skills in architecture. Bain served in France during World War I, and after the war enrolled in the architecture program at the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1921. After several years in various apprentice positions, Bain opened his own architecture firm in 1924. He quickly developed a reputation for high-quality residential design. In 1928, he took Penn classmate Lionel Pries into partnership forming Bain & Pries. The firm prospered until 1931, then dissolved under the impact of the Depression. Bain's independent practice gradually recovered and by the late 1930s his firm was receiving a variety of commissions and the designs gradually became more modern. In 1940, Bain joined a joint-venture with J. Lister Holmes, William Aitken, George W. Stoddard, and John T. Jacobson to design Yesler Terrace, Seattle's first public housing project. Each of the joint-venture partners continued to maintain their own independent practices as well. In 1941, Bain and Pries re-established their partnership for a period of about nine months. During World War II Bain served as camouflage director for the state of Washington. He also joined other architects in joint-venture firms to design housing for war workers as well as other war-related projects. The joint venture formed in 1943, with Floyd Naramore, Clifton Brady, and Perry Johanson was particularly successful, and became the basis for the post-war firm Naramore, Bain, Brady and Johanson (occasionally called \\"the combine\\"), predecessor to today's NBBJ. Bain remained interested in residential architecture and from 1947 to 1970 he was also a partner in Bain, Overturf and Turner (later Bain and Overturf), a firm that specialized in residential design. Bain served as president of the Washington State Chapter American Institute of Architects (predecessor to today's AIA Seattle) from 1941 to 1943. Bain was elected a Fellow of the AIA in 1947. His son, William J. Bain, Jr., is also a successful architect, NBBJ partner and Fellow in the AIA.

His adventures were summoned in the Trezenzonii de Solistitionis Insula Magna, a medieval manuscript written in Latin in the 12th century. After Galicia was once again plundered by one of the multiple raids with which the Muslims devastated the region in the 8th century, Trezenzonio went to the Tower of Hercules in A Coru√±a. There he took a look at the sea, where with the help of the first lights of the daning he could see the Great Isle of Solstice (Magna Insula Solistitialis), which was consecrated to Saint Thecla (Santa Tecla). He decided to sail to that place and after having landed in that island he saw an immense prairie where a great basilica stood up, decorated with jewels and gems. In that island, the weather was delicious and there was plenty of food. Pain, hunger, fear and misfortunes were absent. Trezenzonio remained there for seven years after which an angel appeared to him and commanded him to return to Galicia. Because he resisted the divine orders, he was punished with lepra and had to witness powerless how the proofs of the existence of the Great Isle of Solstice that he had collected on his ship rotted. Trezenzonio repented of his actions. After landing in Galicia, he walked to the city of Tui, where he met the local bishop, Adelfio.  Bibliography  *M.C.

It originated in Iran during the 15th century. Unlike hookah tobacco (also called \\"shisha\\" or \\"mu'assel\\"), dokha is not cured with molasses. Users smoke the tobacco blend in small quantities using a pipe called a midwakh. Because the midwakh pipe is used almost exclusively for smoking dokha, the terms are often used interchangeably. Dokha has a higher concentration of nicotine compared to other forms of tobacco, and can cause brief periods of euphoria, relaxation or lightheadedness in some users. As using the midwakh also reportedly leaves less lingering smells, and requires less tobacco to be used at a time, it can be used discreetly, which has made it popular among student populations and young adults. The product is popular in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Jordan, and other Middle Eastern countries. It has reportedly spread to Europe and other regions via immigration, tourism and trade. Scientific research on the health effects of dokha use is lacking, but officials have concerns over the use of the product as a touted cigarette alternative, and preliminary studies have quantified dokha's high nicotine and tar concentration, as well as toxins present in its smoke. Notable concern in the UAE over the spreading popularity of dokha among teenagers and young adults has led to multiple tobacco control efforts to curb its use.  History  Dokha tobacco and its derivatives have been cultivated and used in Middle Eastern countries for approximately 500 years. It originated in Iran during the 15th century, as use spread among sailors in the Caspian Sea, which led to its eventual spread throughout all of the Middle East during the following centuries. Traditionally, dokha consists of dried and ground tobacco leaves, blended with herbs, spices, dried flowers and fruits. Depending on local traditions, bark and leaves of native plants were also used.  Preparation  Modern dokha maintains many of the characteristics of its traditional forms, consisting of tobacco and spices without any preservatives, pesticides, herbicides or additives that are commonly used in mass-produced tobacco products. Due to the lesser degree of processing, Dokha tobacco appears essentially unaltered, retaining the natural green color of the plant. Unlike most tobaccos, dokha is not fire cured and cut, but dried in the arid desert region where it is harvested. It is finely ground to preserve the strength, freshness and flavor of the tobacco. The tobacco is then blended with other spices and herbs to create the final product. In many countries where dokha is used, there are a number of available tobacco strengths (typically described in Arabic as \\"hot\\", \\"warm\\" or \\"cold\\"), which indicate the harshness of a particular blend.  Usage = Smoking  A stone and gold-encrusted medwakh pipe, and a chanta, used for storing the dokha tobaccoDokha is almost exclusively smoked out of an elongated pipe called a midwakh (alternatively spelled 'medwakh'). The traditional midwakh has no filter, but more recent variations contain a removable, stem-mounted filter. A small container called a chanta is sometimes used to store and dispense the tobacco. Approximately 0.5-1 grams of dokha tobacco is smoked at a time, and is usually consumed in about two inhalations. One study estimates that the typical daily user of dokha consumes approximately 6 grams, or 12 smoking sessions. A preliminary study found dokha has significantly more nicotine than other tobacco products such as shisha tobacco or cigarettes. Nicotine produces various pharmacologic and psycho- dynamic effects in the brain within seconds, which generally last for 30 seconds to several minutes, depending on the user's nicotine tolerance. These include euphoria, increased alertness and a sense of relaxation and dokha is known for a strong production of these effects, which allows it to quickly satisfy nicotine cravings. Users sometimes describe the sensation as 'dizziness', which is where dokha's name (meaning 'dizziness' or 'vertigo' in Arabic) is presumed to be derived. Dokha does not traditionally contain other psychoactive substances, such as cannabis or hashish, but in some cultures where dokha is uncommon, it has been reportedly mistaken for marijuana.  Prevalence  While dokha is not a relatively new alternative tobacco product, its use has had a noted increase in the Middle East, particularly in the UAE, and especially among males aged 20‚Äì39, during the 2000s and 2010s. Experts speculate this may be due to tobacco control efforts' exclusive focus on cigarette use, coupled with the fact that dokha and midwakh usage in these countries has become the second-most popular form of tobacco, after cigarettes. Culminating in legislative efforts in 2009 and 2018, there has also been particular concern in the UAE that teenagers may be getting easier access to dokha tobacco when they are unable to obtain cigarettes, and that dokha has quickly become popular among young adults. Dokha's reported lack of lingering smells (compared to other forms of smoked tobacco) and the relatively smaller amount of material smoked in a given session, make it a convenient form of discreetly and quickly satisfying nicotine cravings, which has made dokha popular among underage smokers. One study assessing the prevalence of dokha smoking among secondary school students in the UAE found that 39% had ever smoked tobacco products, 36% had ever smoked dokha specifically, and 25% of them were now current users of dokha, which is very high compared to other forms of smoking. Dokha use has seen some emergence in the Western world, and some health officials speculate this may be due to immigration, globalized commerce, and internet sales, but such a trend has not been definitively studied or proven. Retail companies specifically catering to dokha smokers can now be found in the United Kingdom, and more tobacco shops in the UK are stocking dokha and midwakh accessories to fill a gap in the market, which some company representatives claim is driven by increased immigration from Middle Eastern countries. There have been some reports that dokha may be spreading in popularity in India due to one successful startup company offering the product.  Sale and regulation  Dokha is regulated by most countries in the same manner as they would other tobacco products.  United Arab Emirates  The UAE passed \\"Federal Law No. 15 regarding Tobacco Control\\" in December 2009, making the legal age to purchase tobacco (including dokha) 18 years old. The law also made smoking in cars (with children under 12 present), houses of worship, educational campuses and health/fitness centers, illegal. This law was expanded in 2012 by adopting GSO standards that require tobacco packaging warning messages. In October 2015, the Dubai Municipality issued warnings to 40 dokha shops to obtain certificates of conformity from the UAE Authority for Standardization and Meteorology. The shops were required to discontinue the practices of allowing customers to sample dokha in the shop and cleaning their midwakh pipes for them in order to obtain these certificates. Despite these efforts, there were still concerns from local leaders and health officials over shopkeepers illegally selling dokha and midwakh pipes to underage customers, and teenage use of tobacco continued to rise. An excise tax was introduced on October 1, 2017 on tobacco products in an effort to discourage their consumption. There was confusion among dokha users and retailers as to whether all dokha products, or only specific dokha brands, were subject to the excise tax. A poll the following year showed that one in four smokers said that the new tax changed their habit. In May 2018, new regulations were approved by the UAE's National Tobacco Control Programme by the Ministry of Health and Prevention. Intended to be in place by the end of the year, the regulations set purchase restrictions specifically on dokha products. They also ban the practice of bottling and refilling larger quantities at home or in shops, which has been the local custom, and require dokha product packaging to include pictorial warnings (the same way other types of tobacco products were required to have per the 2012 law).  Health effects  Personal accounts from users and marketing materials from dokha retailers claim that the relatively smaller amount of material smoked in a midwakh, and/or the lack of some additives in dokha, make it a less risky form of tobacco. Health professionals consider this a myth, that dokha is likely just as or more dangerous than other forms of smoking, and that more research is needed to investigate the adverse effects, as there is little comparative study between dokha and other tobacco products.  Acute effects  , few studies have been performed on the acute effects specific to dokha use, but one uncontrolled study among male UAE medical university students assessed the following: * Increased systolic blood pressure * Decreased diastolic blood pressure * Increased heart rate and respiration Nicotine and tar levels compared to other tobacco products, per a 2018 University of Sharjah study  Chronic effects  As dokha consists of tobacco and other plant material, health officials suspect the effects from prolonged use are similar or identical to that of other tobacco products, but there have been no clinical studies to identify the long-term risks specific to it. Anecdotal evidence from chronic users suggests that long-term use may cause them to feel out of breath after strenuous activity, and they report difficulty quitting. One study speculated that oral lesions are a possible chronic side effect of irritation from the midwakh pipe. Some of the health risks of chronic tobacco smoking in general, that have been identified, are: * Chronic chest infections *Obstructive pulmonary disease * Increased risk of larynx, respiratory\\"Lung Cancer and Smoking \\" (PDF). Fact Sheet. http://www.LegacyForHealth.org. 2010-11-23. Retrieved 2012-05-06. or other organ cancers *Nicotine dependence and tolerance, increased risks of nicotine poisoning  Chemical composition  A February 2018 study called for further research into the harmful effects of dokha smoke after it found that three different types of dokha tested from the Middle East and North Africa region contained toxic metals comprising \\"22 irritants, 3 known carcinogens, 5 central nervous system depressants, in addition to several other compounds with miscellaneous effects\\". In September 2018, a University of Sharjah study compared the nicotine and tar levels in dokha to other tobacco products, which found dokha had significantly higher levels of both. Nicotine in dokha was measured at 23.83‚Äì52.8 mg/g compared to 0.8‚Äì20.52 mg/g in shisha, and 0.5‚Äì19.5 mg/g in cigarettes. Tar in dokha was measured at 21.6‚Äì45.02 mg/g compared to 1.68‚Äì11.87 mg/g in shisha and 5‚Äì27 mg/g in cigarettes. In May 2019, a second study at the University of Sharjah attempted to quantify trace metals in dokha and shisha products, using EDXRF. Traces of aluminum, calcium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, potassium, strontium and zinc were detected in both product types. Across the 13 dokha dokha products tested, the highest mean concentrations were of calcium, potassium and magnesium (8235.77 ¬± 144.51, 4467.50 ¬± 168.06, and 2096.20 ¬± 130.69 Œºg/g, respectively).

This was a ten-year program to acquire medical countermeasures to biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents for civilian use. A key element of the Act was to allow stockpiling and distribution of vaccines which had not been tested for safety or efficacy in humans, due to ethical concerns. Efficacy of such agents cannot be directly tested in humans without also exposing humans to the chemical, biological, or radioactive threat being treated, so testing follows the FDA Animal Rule for pivotal animal efficacy. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States government has allocated nearly $50 billion to address the threat of biological weapons. U.S. funding for bioweapons-related activities focuses primarily on research for and acquisition of medicines for defense. Funding also goes toward stockpiling protective equipment, increased surveillance and detection of biological agents, and improving state and hospital preparedness. The increase in this type of funding is mainly for Project BioShield. Significant funding also goes to Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of HHS. Funding for activities aimed at prevention has more than doubled 2007 and is distributed to 11 federal agencies. Efforts toward cooperative international action are part of the project.  Provisions  * Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) conduct and support research and development activities for countermeasures in biological emergencies and provide that biocontaminant laboratories and specialized research facilities will be available to the Secretary to respond to public health emergencies affecting national security. * Allows the Secretary to expedite purchasing related to research and development needs by simplifying limits on procurement. * Allows the Secretary to respond to pressing research and development needs, including expediting peer review, contracting with experts, and appointing employees to positions at the National Institutes of Health. * Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the Director of the NIH to act through the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to provide grants for the modernization and construction of research facilities. Increases the Federal share of such NIAID-funded projects. * Provides funding for the National Vaccine Program for FY 2004 and 2005. * Adds the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to the working group on the prevention, preparedness, and response to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. * Amends the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary to coordinate with Homeland Security to maintain the Strategic National Stockpile and deploy the Stockpile to respond to an emergency. * Allows security countermeasures to be procured using the special reserve fund (an appropriations account set up by to this Act). A \\"security countermeasure\\" is a countermeasure that is either authorized for emergency use or that the Secretary determines is a priority, is necessary, and is an approved drug or a drug reasonably likely to be approved within eight years. * Provides that in order for a countermeasure to be procured using the special reserve fund: (1) HHS must identify a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent as a threat to the U.S. population that may affect national security; (2) HHS must determine that a countermeasure is necessary to protect public health; (3) HHS must assess the availability and appropriateness of the countermeasure to address the threat; (4) DHS and HHS must jointly submit a proposal to the president to issue a call for the development of countermeasures that are not available or cleared only for alternative purposes; (5) DHS and HHS must make a commitment to recommend that the special reserve fund be available for the procurement of a countermeasure; (6) the President must approve the proposal; (7) DHS and HHS must make specified information known to those who may respond to a call for the countermeasure including the specifications of the needed countermeasure; (8) HHS must determine which countermeasures can be procured using the special reserve fund; (9) the HHS and DHS and the Director of the Office of Management Budget must submit a recommendation to the President that the special reserve fund be used to procure the countermeasure; and (10) the President must approve the recommendation. HHS and DHS must notify designated congressional committees promptly that a material threat has been identified and countermeasures are necessary to protect the public health and that the President has approved a recommendation for countermeasure procurement using the special reserve fund. Authorizes appropriations for the special reserve fund to procure security countermeasures approved by the President, for the hiring of personnel to carry out terror threat assessments, and for the development of secure intelligence-sharing facilities. Transfers the functions, personnel, assets, unexpended balances, and liabilities of the Stockpile from the Secretary of Homeland Security to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. * Amends the Homeland Security Act to change the responsibilities of the Secretary of Homeland Security as they relate to the Stockpile. *Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the Secretary to authorize the use of a drug, device, or biological product intended for emergency use, specifically allowing the use of unapproved products, or the unapproved use of approved products, upon a determination by DHS that there is or is a significant potential for a domestic emergency, or upon a determination by DHS of a public health emergency that affects or may affect national security and that involves a specified agent or a specified disease that may be attributable to such agent. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act to continue provisions governing the emergency use of products with respect to members of the Armed Forces. The Secretary can authorize the use of unapproved products in an emergency only upon a determination by the Secretary of Defense of a military emergency involving a heightened risk to U.S. forces of an attack. * Requires the Comptroller General to: (1) review the Secretary's use of the authorities granted under this Act; (2) assess the adequacy of the internal controls instituted by the Secretary; (3) identify any procurements that would have been significantly delayed or not made without the authorities provided to the Secretary; (4) determine to what extent authorized activities under this Act have enhanced the development of biomedical countermeasures; (5) assess the availability of countermeasures to address threats; (6) assess the extent to which programs and activities will reduce a gap between the threat and the availability of countermeasures to an acceptable level of risk; and (7) assess the threats to national security posed by technology that will enable the development of antibiotic-resistant, mutated, or bioengineered strains of biological agents and recommend strategies for addressing such threats, and make recommendations on possible improvements. * Directs the Secretary, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the activities of their respective Departments coordinate, complement, and do not unnecessarily duplicate programs designed to protect the homeland from biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents. Directs such Secretaries to each appoint an official to coordinate such programs for their respective Departments. Act accomplishments Progress has been made in the establishment of both national requirements and acquisition strategies, as well as the procurement of pre- and postexposure countermeasures to meet the threat from anthrax, botulinum toxins, smallpox, and radiological and nuclear threats. United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken a number of additional steps to accomplish the goal of effectively and efficiently implementing the Project BioShield Act. HHS has reorganized the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) (formerly the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness) and established a dedicated strategic planning function that more efficiently integrates biodefense requirements and streamlines the interagency governance process. Under the reorganized structure, on behalf of the secretary of HHS, the ASPR leads the federal public health and medical response to acts of terrorism or nature and other public health and medical emergencies. In 2006, HHS announced, in the Federal Register Notice of 6 July 2006, the establishment of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). Acquired vaccines In September 2012, BioPrepWatch reported that the BARDA annual report shows that the number of supplies of countermeasures for combating terrorist attacks is growing.Kellen Alexander \\"U.S. grows its biodefense stockpile\\" , BioPrepWatch, 18 Sep 2012 According to the report, BARDA has acquired: *107,000 doses of an antitoxin for Clostridium botulinum (a decrease from the full 200,000 doses ordered in 2006). *57,102 doses of the monoclonal antibody Raxibacumab, which treats anthrax, from Human Genome Sciences in 2011. This included 20,000 doses under a 2005 contact and 37,102 doses of the 45,000 ordered in a 2009 contract option. At the end of 2010, there was a total supply of 36,102 doses of Raxibacumab. * 10,000 doses of anthrax immune globulin from Cangene, which also treats anthrax. By 2010, the supply was down to 7,327 doses, with spending on Raxibacumab and AIG coming to $478 million. * 28.75 million doses of the anthrax vaccine BioThrax from Emergent BioSolutions. * Botulism treatments, as well, including 107,560 doses of Botulinum Antitoxin Therapeutic from Cangene. It ordered 200,000 doses. At the end of 2010, the supply was at 97,000 doses. Related legislation Section 401 of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 307; 113th Congress) reauthorized the BioShield Project. More specifically, it reauthorizes the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF), originally established in 2004. Recent news To June 2013, eight medical countermeasures (MCM) against anthrax, smallpox, botulinum toxin and radiological threats have been procured. Eighty other candidate MCMs are undergoing advanced development. However, unless Congress acts, the authorities and funds contained in the Project BioShield Act will expire at the end of year 2013. The legislative experiment of BioShield is now subject to evaluation and reconsideration in the House and the Senate, which have both passed versions of reauthorization legislation. In March 2013, funding was extended through 2018 via the Pandemic Act. In February 2018, the Bipartisan Policy Center released a report called \\"Budgeting for Medical Countermeasures: An Ongoing Need for Preparedness.\\" Based on the report, former U.S. Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) said that the change in the way that the Project BioShield Act of 2004 is funded (it changed from a ten-year appropriations cycle to year-by-year funding) creates a climate of uncertainty for private firms looking to invest in medical countermeasures (MCM) against chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) agents. No commercial market exists for MCMs, so the firms that research and develop MCMs have to depend on a reliable stream of government money. According to Homeland Preparedness News, \\"Daschle and [former U.S. Sen. Judd] Gregg offered budgeting strategies that they believe could lend stability to the MCM arena, some of which would call for changes to statutory processes and congressional procedures that have been implemented since the Project BioShield Act's 2004 enactment.\\" Published literature A 2005 review reported that the project had an advanced appropriation for countermeasures‚Äîranging from vaccines to biodosimetry to surveillance‚Äîrelated to biological weapons and other WMD. Provisions have been made as well to ensure safer and more effective vaccinations for such threats such as smallpox. Another issue lies within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA requires clinical studies of human safety and efficacy. The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association notes that this kind of testing for biological weapons is ethically unacceptable to conduct on humans. \\"The need for expedited development of critical countermeasures must be balanced against the need to ensure that these essential interventions are safe as well as effective.\\" A 2007 review stated that the project is needed because when the only market is the government, there is a high risk of failure and a low expectation of profit. This discourages other manufacturers from investing research, development and funds in the bioterrorism products to be sold, because the expected profits do not justify the opportunity costs. Pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers can perceive the federal government as an uncertain and low-profit market. The project was developed in an attempt to provide a financial incentive to manufacturers to develop the products needed for defense against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. A perspective piece published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 noted that the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to use an unapproved drug in case of an emergency, but also noted that this could only issued only after the secretary of health and human services has declared a public health emergency. \\"In the case of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, such a declaration was made on April 26, 2009. An EUA for a medical product has a term of 1 year, but it can be renewed, depending on the circumstances of the emergency. It is important that product development continue to focus on the goal of approval (there are ongoing clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of intravenous peramivir in treating influenza), because the EUA is only a temporary means for making a product available during an emergency.\\" A book published in 2010 written by Frank Gottron, \\"Project BioShield: Purposes and Authorities\\", stated that the project allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to purchase unapproved and unlicensed vaccinations. The HHS will determine that \\"...sufficient and satisfactory clinical experience or research data...support(s) a reasonable conclusion that the product will qualify for approval or licensing...within eight years.\\" The HHS will write contracts on these unapproved products, help lowering the purchasing cost of the drugs. Challenges and criticism Some provisions of Project BioShield are controversial. Some critics suggest that biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies will require even more incentives than contained in these proposals from the Government. The project's funding would be subject to annual review through the appropriations process. Furthermore, the law would require the HHS Secretary to prepare annual reports detailing actions taken under this Act including identification of each person or entity that received, or was considered and rejected for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts under this Act. The approval and licensing processes are designed to preclude the marketing of ineffective and dangerous treatments. Only about 1 of 5 drugs that begin the approval process actually become approved treatments. Because it is not possible to predict the outcome of the approval process, critics of this provision suggest that the government will end up purchasing countermeasures that will eventually fail to be approved. Obstacles to pharmaceutical and vaccine development include inadequate funding for research, insufficient protections against corporate liability, and constraints related to safety considerations. Typically, the drug-development process in the United States is largely initiated by the National Institutes of Health, which supports basic research through funding scientists. Although the development of a new medication usually takes several years between the time that research begins to the time that the medication is marketed, developing medical interventions against potential biological weapons is especially intense in terms of time, labor, and finances. There is also no guarantee that the drug companies will purchase the vaccinations. PhRMA Michael Friedman, MD, chief medical officer for biomedical preparedness at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in Washington, DC voiced additional financial concerns of the pharmaceutical industry in 2005. He explains that manufacturers of biological defense products could still be \\"exposed to devastating product-liability suits,\\" adding, \\"The decision to divert resources from the research and development of medicines for serious illnesses like heart disease can be financially risky, especially when a countermeasure may never be purchased or used.\\" Friedman argues there needs to be more sponsored research and collaborative programs that engage government, academia, and industry, as well as additional incentives for private companies.

This information is presented in more detail in Part I of the PMBus specification: * 400 kHz bus speeds are allowed (vs. the 100 kHz limit of SMBus) * In PMBus, blocks may include up to 255 bytes (vs. the 32 byte limit of SMbus). * As in SMBus 2.0, only seven bit addressing is used. * Some commands use the SMBus 2.0 block process calls. * Either the SMBALERT# mechanism or the SMBus 2.0 host notify protocol may be used to notify the host about faults. * PMBus devices are required to support a Group Protocol, where devices defer acting on commands until they receive a terminating STOP. Since commands can be issued to many different devices before that STOP, this lets the PMBus master synchronize their actions. * An \\"extended command\\" protocol is defined, using a second command byte to add 256 more codes each for both standard and manufacturer- specific commands.  PMBus commands  The PMBus command space can be seen as exposing a variety of readable, and often writable, device attributes such as measured voltage and current levels, temperatures, fan speeds, and more. Different devices will expose different attributes. Some devices may expose such attributes in multiple \\"pages\\", as for example one page managing each power supply rail (maybe 3.3V, 5V, 12V, ‚àí12V, and a programmable supply supporting 1.0-1.8V). The device may set warning and fault limits, where crossing a limit will alert the host and possibly trigger fault recovery. Different devices will offer different capabilities. The ability to query a PMBus 1.1 device about its capabilities may be particularly useful when building tools, especially in conjunction with the ability to store user data in the devices (e.g. in EEPROM). Without such a query capability, only error- prone external configuration data is available. Part II of the PMBus specification covers every standard PMBus command. It also describes the models for managing output power and current, managing faults, converting values to and from the formats understood by a given device, and accessing manufacturer-provided information such as inventory data (model and serial number, etc.) and device ratings.  Implementations  As of summer 2007, PMBus is relatively new so not many products yet advertise support for it. Given the richness of the specification, firmware based implementations running in microcontrollers are probably easiest to provide, although several of the current products do not involve microcontrollers. One firmware-based example is the Texas Instruments UCD9112. Another uses about 2Kbytes of code on an Atmel AVR 8-bit microcontroller on the NGW100 board controller. In fall 2009 more products are available. The NXP PIP8000 and Maxim MAX16064 are two recently announced chips, which have vendor-supplied graphical user interfaces (nonportable: MS-Windows only). As PMBus systems are deployed, tools to manage those systems should become significant. Some of them may just be used during manufacturing, to set up system-specific parameters used with reconfigurable power subsystems. Others will be useful for runtime optimization, for example with server farms.  Patenting issues  In January 2008, Power-One was awarded a win in a patent infringement suit between them and Artesyn Technologies for the latter's PMBus enabled converters. Power-One claims that PMBus applications need a license from them. Potential PMBus users should investigate the issue for themselves. See external links.

Lee represented the seat of Indooroopilly since he was first elected as a Labor Party member in 2001. Lee had a background in environmental activism and joined the Queensland Greens in 2008 citing the Bligh Government's inaction on climate change and environment protection. Since leaving Parliament in 2009 Lee has lived in Tasmania and Melbourne, run his communications and lobbying business and traveled extensively in Myanmar (Burma). Lee grew up in Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan, Ireland and his family migrated to Brisbane, Australia when he was a teenager. He was educated at St Patrick's College, Cavan, St Columban's College, Caboolture, and the University of Queensland, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Lee has a Master of International Relations from Monash University, writing a thesis titled A Politician, Not an Icon. Aung San Suu Kyi's silence on Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya. Lee has a PhD from Deakin University. His PhD thesis was titled \\"Myanmar's Rohingya Genocide: Rohingya Perspectives of History and Identity\\" and addressed the identity, history, and politics of the Rohingya. Environment activism Lee has been involved with environment causes since his youth and is best known for his involvement with The Wilderness Society who welcomed his decision to join the Greens. During his time in Parliament Lee campaigned to end broadscale land clearing in Queensland a practice often involving dragging a heavy chain strung between two bull dozers to remove every tree, contributing to Queensland having the sixth highest rate of land clearing in the world. A ban on most clearing in Queensland came into force in January 2007. Following the success of the tree clearing campaign Lee shifted focus with a campaign to protect Queensland's remaining wild rivers, the environment issue for which he has been most closely associated. Sponsoring Parliamentary ePetitions and working with peak environment groups again including The Wilderness Society, the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland and the Queensland Conservation Council to promote grassroots campaigns and lobbying of MPs and bureaucrats. Queensland's Wild Rivers Act was passed in 2005 with the first \\"wild river declarations\\" in 2007 with protection for Gulf of Carpentaria river systems Settlement Creek, Morning Inlet, and the Gregory and Staaten Rivers, and the waterways of Fraser and Hinchinbrook Islands. Since then the Queensland Government protected river systems on Cape York Peninsula ‚Äì the Archer, Stewart and Lockhart River Basins and the Wenlock River. Lee is opposed to nuclear power and campaigned against nuclear power and uranium mining in Queensland. As a Green MP Lee introduced two private member's Bills to Parliament aiming to permanently ban uranium mining and uranium exploration. Both bills received their first reading in parliament but lapsed once the 2009 Queensland election was announced and the parliament dissolved. Parliamentary career In 2001, Lee obtained preselection for the seat of Indooroopilly and surprised many by defeating former Queensland Liberal Leader Denver Beanland in the state elections that year. The surprise result was mainly due to two factors: the huge margin that re-elected the Beattie Labor Government and the strong grass-roots campaign employed by Lee. In 2004, Lee was re-elected to his seat and during this term he campaigned against the Labor government's asset sales including the privitisation of parts of Queensland's electricity industry. https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2006-04-26/energy-firms-sale-to-boost-future- fund/1739656 In 2006, he won a third parliamentary term when he defeated the Liberal Party's Peter Turner. Once again, Green preferences were crucial to Lee securing his seat. During this term, Lee was made a Parliamentary Secretary.https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/members/former/bio?id=4116577412 In 2008 Lee announced that he had resigned from the ALP and was going to contest Indooroopilly as the endorsed candidate for the Green Party. Lee became the Green Party's first Queensland MP and used his shift to the Greens to become one of the state's first MPs to publicly back same-sex marriage. As Green Party parliamentary leader, Lee campaigned at the election for a moratorium on shale oil mining in the Great Barrier Reef, support for renewable energy, the construction of light rail in Brisbane instead of new road construction, and free public transport for young people and pensioners.https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/green- alternative-to-old-parties-20090309-geaw1c.html Lee achieved a vote share of 25.93 per cent, a record vote for a Green Party candidate, but failed to retain his seat, losing to a Liberal National Party candidate at the 21 March 2009 poll. Parliamentary Secretary Following the 2006 election Premier Peter Beattie appointed Lee Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communities, Disability Services, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Seniors and Youth. Lee's main focus was on youth policy arguing for a greater role for young people in government decision making and in favour of improved public transport services at night and on weekends. With Beattie's retirement in 2007, Premier Bligh appointed Lee Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Main Roads and Local Government. In this role Lee advocated for greatly increased spending on bikeways and public transport, proposing a dramatic expansion of Brisbane's CityCat ferry fleet and a new rail line to Brisbane's western suburbs. Funding for these projects he argued should come at the expense of new highway construction. In 2008 Bligh moved Lee to the newly created role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney- General and Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Premier in Western Queensland where he was to focus on consumer protection and organising the state's No Interest Loans Scheme for low income earners. In this role Lee was critical of broad reach of the State's anti-public nuisance laws which he said contributed to the controversial and violent arrest of a homeless pensioner. Myanmar (Burma) Lee has traveled extensively in Asia and has a particular interest in the politics of Myanmar. He was one of the few westerners to experience Myanmar's 2010 elections and met Aung San Suu Kyi shortly after her release from house arrest. He is currently researching the situation involving the Muslim Rohingya people in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine and tweeted the cover of his Masters of International Relations thesis 'A Politician, Not an Icon. Aung San Suu Kyi's silence on Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya'.

He often used the verismo style to describes the hopeless poverty in his native Calabria. His first success was Gente in Aspromonte (Revolt in Aspromonte), which examined the exploitation of rural peasants by greedy landowners in Calabria, and is considered by many critics to be his masterpiece. Biography He was born in San Luca, a small village in the southernmost region of Calabria. His father Antonio was a primary school teacher and founded an evening school for farmers and illiterate shepherds. Alvaro was educated at Jesuit boarding schools in Rome and Umbria. He graduated with a degree in literature in 1919 at the University of Milan and began working as a journalist and literary critic for two daily newspapers, Il Resto di Carlino of Bologna and the Corriere della Sera of Milan. He served as an officer in the Italian army during World War I. After being wounded in both arms, he spend a long time in military hospitals. After the war he worked as a correspondent in Paris (France) for the anti-Fascist paper Il Mondo of Giovanni Amendola. In 1925, he supported the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals written by the philosopher Benedetto Croce. In 1926 he published his first novel L'uomo nel labirinto (Man in the Labyrinth), which explored the growth of Fascism in Italy in the 1920s. A staunch democrat with strong anti-Fascist views, Alvaro's politics made him the target of surveillance of Mussolini's Fascist regime. He was forced to leave Italy and during the 1930s he traveled widely in western Europe, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union. Journeys he later recounted in his travel essays. L'uomo √® forte (1938; Man Is Strong), written after a trip in the Soviet Union, is a defense of the individual against the oppression of totalitarianism. After World War II Alvaro returned to Italy. He again worked for prominent daily newspapers as special correspondent, theater and film critic, and editor. He was elected secretary of the Italian Association of Writers in 1947, a post he held until his death in Rome in 1956. He is buried in Vallerano. Literary career Initially, Alvaro's literary efforts did not enjoy great success. Critics praised his first novel L'uomo nel labirinto (Man in the Labyrinth) for its portrayal of alienation of individuals and society as a whole. His subsequent works, L'amata alla finestra, Gente in Aspromonte, La signora dell'isola, and Vent'anni established him as an important writer. A jury that included the noted Italian novelist Luigi Pirandello awarded him a prize of 50,000 lire given by the newspaper La Stampa in 1931 for Gente in Aspromonte. In 1951 he won the Strega Prize (Premio Strega) ‚Äì Italy's most prestigious literary award ‚Äì for his novel Quasi una vita. Alvaro is noted for his realistic, epic depictions of the Italian poor. His later work portrayed the contrasts between a yearning for the simple, pastoral way of life, and the aspiration to achieve material success that attracts people to the city. He was one of the first authors to mention the 'Ndrangheta ‚Äì the mafia-style criminal association in his native Calabria ‚Äì in several short stories and in an article published in the Corriere della Sera in 1955.The pentiti's contribution to conceptualization of the mafia phenomenon, by Letizia Paoli, in The New European Criminology (Vincenzo Ruggiero, Nigel South, Ian R.

The unit was created in 1914 and was attached to the Canadian Expeditionary Force. The CAC had a maximum strength of three personnel and one aircraft which was delivered but never used. By May 1915, the unit had ceased to exist. The Burgess-Dunne was Canada's first military aircraft, although it never saw military service. History The idea of a Canadian Aviation Corps was conceived by Colonel Sam Hughes, Canada's Minister of Militia and Defence.Roberts (1959), p. 7. Hughes had asked British authorities how Canada could help the war effort in the field of military aviation. Britain suggested that Canada could help by supplying military aviators.Milberry (1984), p. 13. Hughes appointed Ernest Lloyd Janney as provisional commander and authorized him to spend up to $5000 on an aircraft. A Burgess-Dunne floatplane was purchased in the United States, shipped to Vermont and then flown to Valcartier, Quebec where it was taken apart, crated, and shipped to England. Janney and the two other CAC members, Lieutenant W. F. Sharpe, a pilot, and Staff Sergeant H. A. Farr, a mechanic, accompanied the aircraft. The aircraft was left abandoned and damaged on Salisbury Plain, having never flown any combat operations. By May 1915, the CAC had dissolved. A second attempt in creating an air force began with the creation of the Canadian Air Force in 1918.

Early life  Yon was born in Settimo Vittone, (Piedmont, Italy), and studied at the conservatories of both Milan and Turin, also attending the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome; among his teachers in Milan was Polibio Fumagalli. He served for a time as an organist at the Vatican and at the Royal Church in Rome.  Relocation to America  Pietro Yon with Charles M. Courboin In the spring of 1907, Father John B. Young, pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Manhattan, was in Rome on Vatican business and additionally to seek out a replacement for his organist Gaston Dethier, who was leaving to pursue a concert career. Upon hearing Yon play, Father Young was sufficiently impressed to offer him a three-year contract. Thus Yon at age 21 came to the United States, where from 1907 until 1926 he was the organist of St. Francis Xavier Church. He joined his brother S. Constantino Yon, who had preceded him and held a similar position at St. Vincent Ferrer Church. Yon at the organ, 1919 In 1914, Pietro and Constantino Yon opened the Yon Music Studios in Carnegie Hall, a conservatory for aspiring liturgical musicians utilizing a small number of instructors whose work he respected. Pietro would head the organ department while Constantino was in charge of the vocalists. In 1919, when Yon was married to Francesca Pesagno, the organist for the occasion was one of Yon's newest friends, the Belgian-American virtuoso Charles M. Courboin who had been chosen to rededicate the Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia, now enlarged to 17,000 pipes and still the largest operational organ in the world. In 1920, Yon would share the stage at Wanamaker's with Courboin, Leopold Stokowski, and the Philadelphia Orchestra in one of the gala organ recitals performed at the store through the 1920s. Yon became an American citizen in 1921. On January 1, 1922 Yon was appointed 'Titular Organist' of the Vatican, a singular and unprecedented honor. The appointment put pressure on New York church authorities to promote Yon to a more-prestigious position.  St. Patrick Cathedral  The grand gallery organ at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York In 1926, he became the assistant organist of St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. Shortly after his arrival, church authorities began to discuss the possibility of replacing their existing Jardine and Odell organs, which were installed when the Cathedral was built. The Cathedral's 1929 Jubilee year was near and funding had become available for improvements. By 1927, it was announced that the Kilgen firm of St. Louis, Missouri had been selected to build the chancel, gallery and echo (triforium) organs, with Courboin as tonal designer. The resulting instrument was then and remains now the magnum opus of the Kilgen firm and one of the finest organs in the world. Also in 1927 Yon was approached by Carnegie Hall to assist in the replacement of its outmoded Hillgreen, Lane organ with a 4-manual, 59-rank instrument, also by Kilgen with Courboin as tonal director. And a 3-manual Kilgen instrument was to be built for the Yon Music Studios. Work proceeded rapidly on the Cathedral chancel organ, and by January 1928 the instrument had been installed (still without the elaborate organ case). Associate organist Yon presided over the dedication recital on January 30, 1928. The organ console was relocated to the sanctuary for the performance, which was a major social and musical event attended by 5,000 ticketholders. On May 1, 1928, Yon was promoted to music director replacing James C. Ungerer, who had been at the Cathedral for 36 years. In 1933, when the position of Associate Organist at the Cathedral became vacant, Yon chose as a replacement Edward J. Rivetti, one of his own students. Though Rivetti never actually became principal organist he served as assistant under both Yon and successor Courboin until 1970. In the spring of 1938, both Pietro and Constantino Yon were appointed as Knights of St. Sylvester by Cardinal Patrick Hayes, who would die within a month of the appointment. Pietro also toured the country giving recitals.  Composer  Yon was also a composer, most famous for his Humoresque \\"L'organo primitivo\\"- Toccatina for Flute, for organ, and his Christmas piece Ges√π bambino. He also wrote many works for organ, piano, and orchestra, including a Concerto Gregoriano for organ and orchestra (inspired by his experiences with the Wanamaker Organ) (with a companion version for organ and piano), Speranza (Hope) ‚Äì Solo for Diapason, Concert Study #1 and #2, American Rhapsody and a concerto for oboe.  Teacher  Yon's pupils included Cole Porter, Georges-√âmile Tanguay, Powell Weaver (Kansas City), Edgar Bowman (Pittsburgh), Robert Elmore (Philadelphia), Mary Downey (New York), Henry Seibert (New York), Eugene Phillips (Grand Rapids), Tracy Y. Cannon (Salt Lake City, organist at the Mormon Tabernacle), Helen Knox Ferguson (Dallas), Helen Townsend (Buffalo), Franklin Coates (N.Y.City), Dorothy Mulroney (organist at the Municipal Auditorium Springfield, Mass.), Wilbur Chenowetch (Professor of organ and organist of the Plymouth Church, Lincoln, Neb.), Alan Bucher (Peekskill N.Y.), Edward Rivetti, assistant organist at St. Patrick's Cathedral, N.Y., Radie Britain (Dallas) and Yon's godson Norman Dello Joio.  Illness and death  On April 9, 1943, Yon suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed his entire right side. As a result, he was unable to fulfill his obligations at St. Patrick's Cathedral and was temporarily replaced by long-time assistant Edward Rivetti. At first, Yon was sent to Columbia Hospital. Eventually, it was decided to move him to a friend's house in Long Island, where it was thought that he would recover better. In the meantime, the Cathedral held his position open and refused application from organists who wanted to replace him. In time, it became obvious that Yon would take a long time to recover if at all. Courboin was available as a substitute \\"for the duration of the illness of Pietro Yon\\". He was heavily engaged in a recital and teaching career, in addition to consultation on many new organs and performing radio broadcasts on WOR. On October 2, 1943, Courboin was appointed interim organist while Yon was ill. Yon died in Huntington, New York on November 22, 1943, the feast of St Cecilia. His funeral, which took place on the 25th, was attended by 1,300 including Toscanini. Courboin conducted the choir in Yon's own Mass of Requiem.

It is managed by the Zagreb Astronomical Society; its main purpose is educational. Equipment and location The main telescope under the dome is a 175/1400 mm TMB APO refracting telescope installed in September 2007. The old Zeiss 130/1950 mm telescope has been mounted in parallel and will, after the acquisition of the needed equipment, be used to photograph the Sun in the HŒ± line. The third telescope, a Coronado PST HŒ± 40/400 mm, is installed next to the main telescope and is used for visual observation of the Sun in the HŒ± line. There are also several smaller portable telescopes (Celestron 200/2000mm, Konus refractor 80/900mm etc.) and binoculars. The photo lab makes black and white photographs. The Observatory stands in the city center, a couple of streets away from the main city square. It is located in a tower called Popov Toranj (Priest's Tower), erected during the Tatar scare in the 13th century and formerly owned by the Archbishop of Zagreb. It comprises the last floor of the building complex in 22 Opatiƒçka Street, with the telescope dome on a terrace. The Observatory premises include a lecture room for an audience of 50, a room for astrophotography, 5 offices, a library and a small common space. History The Observatory was founded by the Croatian Society for Natural Sciences. The premises in Popov Toranj were provided by the city government, which gave the funds for the reconstruction and the installation of an astronomic dome and a telescope. The grand opening took place on December 5, 1903. The first manager of the Observatory was Oton Kuƒçera, a major promoter of science in Croatia. The international renown of the first observatory in the region was enhanced by August Kopff, an astronomer from Heidelberg. When he discovered the planetoid No. 589 in 1906, he named it \\"Croatia\\" in the honor of the new observatory. Despite Kuƒçera's hopes, the Observatory was not used for scientific work for the lack of researchers. It has always been used primarily for popular science, which flourished in the mid-20th century, when the Esperanto editions of the Observatory spread its name around the world. The observatory was closed during World War II. The Observatory and the Croatian Astronomic Society made their greatest cultural contribution to Zagreb when they procured the planetarium in 1963. It was donated to the Technical Museum, where it is still used. The original 1903 telescope was replaced by a Zeiss-made refractor in 1966. In the mid-1980s, the Observatory building complex was thoroughly renovated. In 1992, a new dome was installed, the equipment and activities were modernized. Today, the Observatory is a gathering point of the lovers of astronomy and natural sciences. It traditionally holds lectures, stargazing sessions, astronomic education and other activities for the citizens. Its scientific work regarding the physics of the Sun is done together with the Hvar Observatory.

The unit was independent from the Canadian Expeditionary Force and the Royal Air Force (RAF). In addition to the two squadrons, a CAF Directorate of Air Services was formed, which was a branch of the General Staff of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada. The CAF's first commander, Lt. Col. W. A. Bishop began setting up the squadrons in August 1918. The two squadrons never fought during the war, which ended on 11 November 1918. The squadrons were administered by No. 1 Wing CAF, which was formed in March 1919. Both squadrons were stationed in the United Kingdom at Upper Heyford and later, Shoreham-By-Sea, Sussex. All aircraft, equipment and training facilities were provided by Britain. Recruiting, pay and clothing, however, was a Canadian responsibility. The British government cut funding for the squadrons in June 1919. The Canadian government decided that a permanent peacetime air force was not needed and so both squadrons ceased operations: No. 1 Squadron on January 28, 1920, and No. 2 Squadron on February 5, 1920. Aircraft and associated equipment were sent back to Canada. The Directorate of Air Services was dissolved on 5 August 1920. This Canadian Air Force was Canada's second attempt at creating a relatively independent air force, the first being the creation of the Canadian Aviation Corps in 1914. Another Canadian Air Force would be established in 1920 as part of the Air Board in Canada and would exist until the Royal Canadian Air Force was established in 1924.

Life and work Landscape with sheep herder and dog Willis was born in Bristol and worked initially with his father, G. H. Willis, also a landscape painter. In 1842, after little financial success in his native city, and on the advice of his father, he traveled to New York, USA, to take up a job in a merchant's office. Owing to ill-health, he eventually had to relinquish the post and return to England, where he initially practiced as a portrait painter in Bristol. In 1843 Willis settled in London where he gained a considerable reputation as a painter of landscapes and animals. From 1844 to 1862, he exhibited frequently at the galleries of the Royal Academy, British Institution (in Pall Mall) and Society of British Artists (in Suffolk street). He also showed his work outside London at places like the Liverpool Academy of Arts etc. From 1851-57 he was a member of the \\"Free Exhibitions\\" society. In 1862 he was elected an associate of the \\"Old\\" Watercolour Society (RWS), becoming a full member in 1863; He was a frequent contributor to the society's exhibitions. Willis painted rural landscapes all over England, Wales and Scotland, in both oils and watercolour, and often featuring groups of farm animals such as cattle or sheep. He sometimes worked in collaboration with other artist such as F W Hulme. Four of his pictures were engraved for the \\"Art Union (AUL) Annual\\" of 1847. In 1849, he published \\"Studies of cattle and rustic figures\\" (London: George Rowney and Co.).

Known as a medicine man and prophet, he is sometimes called the Winnebago Prophet. Wabokieshiek was born as Poweshiek to a Sauk father and a Ho-Chunk mother in the vicinity of Prophetstown, Illinois, which is named after him. Like his father, he was considered a Sac chief, and was also very influential among the Ho-Chunk, and he was known for his promotion of a traditional way of life among the local tribes. However, his influence waned after he promised/prophesied to Sauk/Fox chief Black Hawk that the British and other tribes (such as the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi) would aid him against the United States in what became the Black Hawk War, a prediction that proved false. At the end of the war, on August 27, 1832, Wabokieshiek was taken prisoner along with the remnant of Black Hawk's band. The prisoners were sent to Washington D.C. (meeting with Andrew Jackson) and then to Fort Monroe, Virginia in April, 1833. On June 5, 1833, they were sent back West to be released; Wabokieshiek and his son were released at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. After this time, he lived quietly until he died circa 1841. Wabokieshiek is sometimes confused with Red Cloud, a Lakota chief, and Mahaska, an Ioway also called White Cloud.

With the building of Royal Naval Aircraft Workshops, Almondbank grew significantly during and after the Second World War.  RNAS Almondbank  The establishment of Royal Naval Aircraft Workshops commenced in 1940.Royal Naval Aircraft Workshops The station, a stone frigate, was employed as a RNAS Aircraft Repair Yard Stone Frigate and Stores Depot.Stores The workshops had their own small railway branch line which was linked to the now-closed Almondbank railway station.  StandardAero Facility  The Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) site at Almondbank was a major employer in the community for many years providing essential support to the British Armed Forces. The Decision by the UK government in early 2008 to take the site (and its counterpart at Fleetlands, Gosport) out of direct MOD control by doing a conditional sell-off to Canadian firm Vector Aerospace was a controversial one and there were concerns about the future of the site. In 2011, Vector Aerospace was taken over by Eurocopter (now Airbus) who operated the Almondbank site for seven years. In 2018, StandardAero Aviation Holdings, Inc. and Airbus SE announced that they have finalized the acquisition by StandardAero of Vector Aerospace Holding SAS from Airbus.  School, church and community  The village of Almondbank is often seen as including the attached hamlets of Pitcairngreen and Lochty, and the wider area is sometimes called Almondvalley. There is one school serving the area, Pitcairn Primary, which opened in 1939 and replaced older schools. The school is located in the northernmost housing development of the village, sometimes referred to as Bridgeton, even although there is no signage in recognition of this and the area remains part of Almondbank itself (as opposed to Pitcairngreen and Lochty). Next to the school lies the only shop in the village and directly opposite this is the church, which is known as Almondbank/Tibbermore (St Serf's). Another area of the village is known as College Mill, which borders the River Almond, the river that gives the village its name and a housing development constructed in the 1990s at the southern end of the village was known for many years as \\"Bett Homes\\", named after the site developers. This area encompasses Admiralty Wood and MacKenzie Drive, the majority of houses in the latter being 'affordable homes'. Around the same time these houses were being built, a much smaller development in the Lochty area was built by the local construction firm, GS Brown.

They are the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies ‚Äì the European Cup Winners' Cup against Real Madrid on 11 May 1983 and the European Super Cup against the European Cup holders Hamburger SV in December 1983. Aberdeen also have the distinction of never having been relegated: other than two seasons during World War I when they dropped out of competitive football for logistical reasons and were subsequently re-admitted, they have spent every year since 1905 as members of the top division, a record bettered only by Celtic (following the removal of Rangers from the Scottish Premier League in 2012). Origins of the club The current Aberdeen FC was born out of the merger of three city clubs; Aberdeen, Victoria United and Orion. A public meeting on 20 March 1903 was attended by more than 1,600 citizens, and on that date the amalgamation issue was discussed and given the go-ahead. On 14 April that same year the merger was made official and Aberdeen Football Club was born. The merger allowed Aberdeen (wearing an all-white kit) to seriously entertain thoughts of joining the Scottish Football League, but had to settle with spending its inaugural season in the Northern League having narrowly failed to gain admission to the First Division. Early years (1903‚Äì1917) The new club played its first match on 15 August 1903, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Stenhousemuir - the goalscorer was William McAulay. That first season produced a win in the Aberdeenshire Cup, but only a third-place finish in the Northern League. Undaunted, the club applied for membership of the Scottish League for the following season, and were duly elected, although to the Second Division, rather than the First which the directors had aspired to. With the arrival of League football in 1904‚Äì05, Aberdeen changed kit colours to black and gold, resulting in the new nickname of the Wasps. The club at this time was managed by Jimmy Philip, and he steered the club to a Scottish Qualifying Cup win on 26 November 1904, a 2‚Äì0 victory over Renton at Dens Park. At the end of that first season, despite having finished seventh out of 12 teams, Aberdeen were elected to the new, expanded First Division, and have been in the top tier of Scottish football ever since, a record shared with only Celtic. Once in the First Division, however, the club's progress was steady rather than spectacular ‚Äì a Scottish Cup semi-final appearance in 1908 and another in 1911 being the highlights of the pre-war period. In that season of 1910‚Äì11, Aberdeen recorded their first victories over the Old Firm, and led the league for a time, but the silverware ended up in Glasgow as was becoming customary. Wartime affected the club as much as any other, and in spite of spending cuts and other economies, by 1917 the situation was untenable and, along with Dundee and Raith Rovers, Aberdeen dropped out of competitive football for two seasons. Between the wars (1919‚Äì1939) Senior football returned to the north-east of Scotland on 16 August 1919, The Dons (as they had been known since 1913) resuming with a fixture against Albion Rovers. Philip was still in charge, and continued to oversee a team capable of isolated good results, but never quite able to sustain a challenge long enough to win a trophy. In 1923, Aberdeen were drawn against Peterhead in the Scottish Cup, and posted their record score ‚Äì a 13‚Äì0 victory. The game took place in torrential rain, and it is recorded that the Aberdeen goalkeeper, Harry Blackwell, played in a waterproof coat, and spent at least part of the game sheltered under a spectator's umbrella. One of the Wembley Wizards, Scottish international Alex Jackson, played for Aberdeen from 1924 to 1925. Philip retired in 1924, and was replaced as manager by Paddy Travers. Travers's Aberdeen sides were no more successful than his predecessors', but he did preside over the team's first Scottish Cup final in 1937, as well as two close-season tours to South Africa, the second of which, soon after the Cup final defeat, ended in tragedy when outside-right Jackie Benyon died of peritonitis. In November 1931, Travers unexpectedly dropped a number of first team regulars, none of whom played for the club again. It wasn't until the publication of the club's official history in the 1970s that it became clear that there had been a suspicion of a betting scandal; no action was taken against any player at the time. Donald Colman and the 'dug-out' Travers' trainer (first team coach in modern parlance) was a former player and fans' favourite, Donald Colman. Colman was regarded as a brilliant and innovative thinker about football, and one of his inventions remains a standard part of many football grounds to this day. Colman believed in studying players' feet as they played, and conceived the 'dug-out', a covered area set slightly below the level of the playing surface to better aid his observations. Everton visited Pittodrie soon after its introduction, and exported the idea to the English leagues, from where it spread throughout the football-playing world. Travers left to become manager of Clyde in 1939, and was replaced by Dave Halliday. Halliday went to his ex club Queen of the South to sign inside forward George Hamilton. This would be as shrewd a signing as Halliday would ever make.1937‚Äì1955 Dave Halliday  Aberdeen  Football  Managers  Managers Detail However Halliday had barely begun his work when the Second World War halted competitive football in the United Kingdom. Wartime (1939‚Äì1945) The Second World War effectively shut down senior football, but Aberdeen continued to put on games featuring any players who might be in the forces and stationed nearby. Players such as Stan Mortensen and Ted Ditchburn played for Aberdeen sides in the North-Eastern League and the North-Eastern League Cup although for the last season (1945‚Äì46) the Southern League and Southern League Cup were effectively national competitions and Aberdeen competed in those. Unlike in the previous hiatus, the club were kept running, albeit on a highly improvised basis. Post-war glory (1946‚Äì1970) Halliday inspired Aberdeen (now playing in red shirts) to their first senior silverware in 1946, winning the Scottish League Cup (although this was a reduced wartime version of the competition known officially as the Southern League Cup), and taking his team back to Hampden the following season in the same competition, although they were defeated on this occasion. Aberdeen also reached the Scottish Cup final in that same season, 1946‚Äì47, and this time the Cup was won, Hibernian being the defeated finalists.Dave Halliday and George Hamilton profiles on \\"Queens Legends\\" on the official Queen of the South FC website From these early successes, Halliday built a team capable of challenging for the highest honours in the Scottish game, and reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in 1953 and 1954, although both were lost. Halliday's team were not to be denied, however, and the following season, 1954‚Äì55, Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title. Their reward, however, was not to be a place in the first European Cup competition ‚Äì Scotland's place was awarded to Hibs. Halliday and Hamilton both left at the end of that championship-winning season. Halliday replaced by Davie Shaw. Aberdeen won another League Cup under his guidance, beating St Mirren in 1955‚Äì56, and reached another Scottish Cup final in 1959, but Shaw's reign was ultimately a disappointing one, and he stepped aside for another former favourite player, Tommy Pearson in 1959. Pearson's time in charge coincided with a high turnover of players, and yielded no trophies. He retired in 1965, making way for Eddie Turnbull, who led Aberdeen to two Cup finals against Celtic, losing in 1967, but gaining revenge in 1970. Washington Whips During the summer of 1967, Aberdeen played a season in North America as part of a fledgling league called the United Soccer Association. This league imported twelve entire clubs from Europe and South America to play in American and Canadian cities, with each club bearing a local name. Aberdeen, playing as the \\"Washington Whips\\", won the Eastern Division title, but then lost the championship match to the Western Division winners \\"Los Angeles Wolves\\" (Wolverhampton Wanderers of England). (This FIFA-sanctioned league merged the following season with the non-sanctioned National Professional Soccer League, which had also begun in 1967, to form the North American Soccer League.) Consistent, yet unsuccessful (1970‚Äì1979) The Aberdeen side of the 1970s was one which regularly challenged for honours, but with the exception of the League Cup in 1976, under Ally MacLeod, was not particularly successful. During this decade, Aberdeen had 5 managers, Eddie Turnbull, Jimmy Bonthrone, Ally MacLeod, Billy McNeill and Alex Ferguson. They reached 2 more national cup finals ‚Äì the Scottish Cup in 1978 under Billy McNeill and the League Cup in the following season under the new manager, the relatively unknown Alex Ferguson. Europe and the penalty shootout Aberdeen first played in Europe in the 1967‚Äì68 Cup Winner's Cup, having qualified as runners-up to Celtic in the Scottish Cup final the previous season. Their first tie was a 14‚Äì1 aggregate victory over KR Reykjavik, although they lost the second round tie with Standard Li√®ge 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. As Scottish Cup holders in 1970‚Äì71, Aberdeen once again qualified for the same competition, but this time were eliminated in the first round following a 4‚Äì4 aggregate tie with Honv√©d. This tie, level after extra time and also level on away goals, was decided by the first ever penalty shootout in UEFA competition history, Honved winning the shootout 5‚Äì4 in their own stadium. Aberdeen were regular participants in UEFA competition in the 1970s, but did not proceed beyond the second round in any competition until the Ferguson years. The glory years (1980‚Äì1986) Ferguson became manager in 1978, following the departure of McNeill to Celtic, and set about building a team which would win more in the next eight years than in the entire history of the club to that date. Players such as Jim Leighton, Willie Miller, Alex McLeish and Gordon Strachan developed under Ferguson's guidance to be the backbone of a team with a winning mentality. Aberdeen's second League title was won in 1979‚Äì80, and this initial success was built on, with Scottish Cup wins in three successive seasons from 1982 to 1984, two more league titles in 1983‚Äì84 and 1984‚Äì85, alongside becoming only the third Scottish side to win a European trophy, with the European Cup Winners' Cup victory over Real Madrid on 11 May 1983. The club even released a song, European Song to coincide with the appearance in the Final. This was followed up with the capture of the European Super Cup in December of that year, when Hamburger SV were beaten over two legs. Aberdeen remain the only Scottish club to have won two European trophies. The following season, Aberdeen were beaten semi-finalists in the Cup Winners' Cup, denied the opportunity to defend their trophy by FC Porto. The success of the Ferguson era may be underlined by the fact that the 1985‚Äì86 season was considered by many supporters to be a failure, with only the Scottish Cup and the League Cup won. The Ferguson hangover (1986 ‚Äì 1999) The departure of Ferguson for Manchester United in November 1986 left the Dons board with the arduous task of replacing the irreplaceable, and they opted for little-known coach Ian Porterfield, who had achieved success in England with Sheffield United, but was untested at the top level. Porterfield's reign was not successful and ended with his resignation in May 1988. Alex Smith and Jocky Scott formed a co-managership of the club to replace Porterfield, and achieved a League Cup and Scottish Cup double in 1989‚Äì90. In the 1990‚Äì91 season, a run of twelve victories in thirteen games left Aberdeen sitting top of the table on goal difference ahead of Rangers, going into the final match of the season at Ibrox. A change of tactics (which eventually led to Jocky Scott leaving the club) and a Mark Hateley double gave the Championship to Rangers, and allowed them to continue on the Championship run that saw them eventually lift nine consecutive titles. Alex Smith was not successful as manager in his own right, and was eventually sacked in 1992. Former captain Willie Miller took over and presided over two seasons where Rangers were run close, but chose at the end of the 1993‚Äì94 season to break up his team and bring in new players, a move which did not work; Miller was sacked before the end of the season, and the club had to rely on a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier League status. Miller was replaced by Roy Aitken, but his initial success in avoiding relegation did not last, and despite a League Cup win against Dundee in 1995‚Äì96, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but success remained elusive, and with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt for the first time in its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, to bring business acumen to the running of the club. 21st century (2000 ‚Äì date) The Danish-born Ebbe Skovdahl became Aberdeen's first non- Scottish manager in 1999, and his time in charge coincided with some of the heaviest defeats in the club's history, together with the first time the club had ever finished bottom of the league ‚Äì the ensuing relegation play-off with Falkirk being avoided as Falkirk did not have a ground which met Premier League standards. Skovdahl did, however, lead the club to two cup finals in 2000 and a fourth-place finish in 2002, but left the club partway through the 2002‚Äì03 season when he felt he had taken it as far as he could. Big things were expected from his replacement, Steve Paterson, who was regarded as a promising up-and-coming manager, and he led the club to a decent seventh-place finish that season. However, Paterson's first (and only) full season in charge, 2003‚Äì04, proved an absolute disaster as the club were threatened with relegation, only managing to escape due to Partick Thistle being even worse, and Paterson was sacked after a five-game losing streak at the end of the season. Jimmy Calderwood took over as manager in 2004, having been identified as the right man for the job by the newly appointed Director of Football, former player and manager Willie Miller. Aberdeen under Calderwood posted more consistent results than in previous seasons; fourth in season 2004‚Äì05 and 6th in season 2005‚Äì06, but the club still did not challenge for major honours in the way they did in the second half of the 20th century. In season 2006‚Äì07, despite being knocked out of both cups in the earlier rounds, the club finished in third place in the SPL and qualified for the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Cup with a comfortable 2‚Äì0 victory over Rangers at Pittodrie on the last day of the season. In September 2007, Aberdeen created club history by defeating Dnipro on the away goals rule in the UEFA Cup, the first time the club had won on away goals in 40 years of European football. In the group stage, despite failing to win their first three matches, the combination of other results meant Aberdeen could progress with a home win over Danish champions FC K√∏benhavn ‚Äì they achieved this in style, winning 4‚Äì0 (biggest margin of victory since the 80s, before one of Pittodrie's biggest crowds since the 80s) to set up a February 2008 meeting with German giants (and 1983 throwbacks) Bayern Munich. In May 2009, having secured a 4th-place finish in the Scottish Premier League and a return to European competition, Jimmy Calderwood left his position as manager of Aberdeen by 'mutual consent'. Calderwood was replaced by former player Mark McGhee. McGhee's time at Aberdeen was not successful. A few weeks after a club record 0‚Äì9 defeat to Celtic, McGhee was sacked in December 2010 and replaced by Craig Brown. Brown was replaced in May 2013 by current manager Derek McInnes and a more successful period ensued, with McInnes' win ratio (55%) second only to Alex Ferguson (58%). Aberdeen won the 2014 Scottish League Cup Final 4‚Äì2 on penalties, after a goalless draw, a success that saw them lift their first trophy in 19 years. McInnes led Aberdeen to European qualification for the first time since 2009, achieved through a third-place finish in the league campaign. The club has continued to perform well, and ended the season in second place‚Äîtheir best league position since 1993‚Äì94‚Äîin 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.  Honours =League Aberdeen have the distinction of never having been relegated from any division; their only season in a league below the highest in Scotland was their first, 1904‚Äì05, at the end of which they were elected, rather than promoted, to the First Division. In 1910‚Äì11, Aberdeen finished second behind Rangers in the league, having beaten both halves of the Old Firm during the season, but they did not repeat the feat until 1935‚Äì36, and it was more than 50 years after the club had come into existence that the first league title was won, in 1954‚Äì55. The following season, Aberdeen finished second behind Rangers, but it was not until the 1970s that they were regularly challenging for the league title. Between 1970 and 1994, Aberdeen finished second on ten occasions, and won the league three times; each of those wins under the managership of Alex Ferguson. In 1983‚Äì84, they also won the Scottish Cup (see below), making them the only team outside Glasgow to have won the Scottish Double. Cups Aberdeen's first senior trophy was the Southern League Cup, a precursor to the Scottish League Cup in 1946‚Äì47. The Southern League Cup was a restricted, wartime competition, and did not feature all senior Scottish teams at the time, but the official club history records it as the first major honour in the club's history. The following season, Aberdeen reached the final of the League Cup, and won their first Scottish Cup. They had appeared in a Scottish Cup final in 1936‚Äì37; a match which attracted 146,433 spectators, the record attendance for a club match in Europe. Aberdeen reached cup finals four times in the 1950s, their only silverware coming when they defeated St Mirren in the 1955‚Äì56 League Cup final. Following a final defeat to Celtic in 1966‚Äì67, the Scottish Cup was again won in 1969‚Äì70. An extra time League Cup victory over Celtic in 1976‚Äì77 and defeats in the Scottish Cup final of 1977‚Äì78 and the League Cup final of the following season presaged the 1980s, when Aberdeen won a total of four Scottish Cups ‚Äì including three in a row between 1982 and 1984 ‚Äì and two League Cups, the second of which, in 1989, was the third successive final between Aberdeen and Rangers ‚Äì Aberdeen having lost the first two. This period included the club's first 'double' win in 1983‚Äì84, and a double cup win in 1985‚Äì86. Aberdeen won the 1989‚Äì90 Scottish Cup final against Celtic on penalties‚Äîthe first time the competition had been decided in this way. There has been one League Cup win since‚Äîagainst Dundee in 1995‚Äì96, and two further appearances in each of the major finals. Aberdeen have won the Aberdeenshire Cup more times than any other team, although the 39 victories recorded on the club's official website include several won by precursor clubs prior to the official founding in 1903. In addition, the club rarely enters a full‚Äìstrength team in this competition. The Drybrough Cup was won by Aberdeen twice, in 1971 and 1980; the first and last time the competition was run. Aberdeen also won the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1904, the only time the club entered. Europe Aberdeen have been regular European competitors since their first appearance in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967. They qualified for the European Cup three times, reaching the quarter‚Äìfinal in 1985‚Äì86; have made 17 appearances in the UEFA Cup, UEFA Europa League and its precursor, the Fairs Cup, twice reaching the third round; and appeared eight times in the Cup Winners Cup, winning the competition in 1982‚Äì83 and reaching the semi‚Äìfinal the following season. In 1970‚Äì71, Aberdeen became the first team to be eliminated from European competition on penalties, losing a first round Cup Winners' Cup tie against Honv√©d. In addition, the club won their only European Super Cup final in 1983; the only Scottish club to have won this competition. Aberdeen were voted 'European Team of the Year' by France Football and Adidas in recognition of their achievements in 1983. As of 2012, Aberdeen were ranked 143rd in the UEFA Team Rankings; However by 2019 they had slipped to 192nd, due to several largely unsuccessful European campaigns in the intervening years.

(MISI), forecast 37 million jobs and $4.29 billion in annual revenue by 2030 from renewable energy and energy efficiency, in the U.S. The renewable energy industry grew three times faster than the U.S. economy, with the solar thermal, photovoltaic, biodiesel, and ethanol sectors leading the way. To download the report summary, click: Jobs_Report_PDF Key conclusions from this report include: ‚Ä¢ Renewable energy and energy efficiency currently provide more than 9 million jobs and $1,045 billion in revenue in the U.S. ‚Ä¢ 95% of the jobs are in private industry. ‚Ä¢ As many as 37 million jobs can be generated by the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries in the U.S. by 2030 ‚Äì more than 17% of all anticipated U.S. employment. ‚Ä¢ Hottest sectors by revenue growth include solar thermal, solar photovoltaics, biofuels, and fuel cells. ‚Ä¢ Hot job areas include electricians, mechanical engineers, welders, metal workers, construction managers, accountants, analysts, environmental scientists, and chemists. The vast majority of jobs created by the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries are in the same types of roles seen in other industries (accountants, factory workers, IT professionals, etc.). ASES 2007 Report on Renewable Energy A 2007 report by the American Solar Energy Society (ASES), examined three scenarios of renewable energy policy development: *a \\"business as usual\\" scenario, with no major policy changes; *a moderate scenario that includes incremental policy advances; and *an advanced scenario of aggressive growth in renewable energy and energy efficiency. In the \\"business as usual\\" scenario, jobs created by renewable energy would increase 190 percent by 2030, while jobs created by energy efficiency would increase by 85 percent. In the moderate scenario, the jobs created by renewable energy would increase nearly sevenfold, while jobs created by energy efficiency would more than double. And in the advanced scenario, the jobs created by renewable energy increase 17-fold, while jobs created by energy efficiency quadruple. In the advanced scenario, renewable energy revenues increase to nearly $600 billion, while energy efficiency revenues increase to almost $4 trillion. The ASES report stated that in 2006, 8 million people were employed in renewable energy and energy efficiency industries in the U.S., and $933 billion in sales were generated, $100 billion in profits, and $150 billion in increased federal, state, and local government tax revenues. The report noted difficulty in defining the energy efficiency industry, but found 196,000 people directly employed by the renewable energy industry, as well as 452,000 indirect jobs created, and revenues of $39.2 billion in 2006. Chapters ASES has several regional and state chapters throughout the country, comprising more than 13,000 members. As of September 2012, there are six student chapters of ASES, at the University of Florida (https://web.archive.org/web/20091008112813/http://www.ufases.org/), The Pennsylvania State University (http://clubs.psu.edu/up/ases/), Appalachian State University (http://asuses.appstate.edu/), Austin Community College in Texas, North Carolina State University and Ohio State University (http://seo.org.ohio-state.edu).

As a genre, they began in the mid-to-late Middle Ages, although antecedents such as The Maxims of Ptahhotep (c. 2350 BC) are among the earliest surviving works. Conduct books remained popular through the 18th century, although they gradually declined with the advent of the novel. Overview In the introduction to her bibliography of American conduct books published before 1900, Sarah E. Newton defines the conduct book as > a text that is intended for an inexperienced young adult or other youthful > reader, that defines an ethical, Christian-based code of behavior, and that > normally includes gender role definitions. Thus \\"conduct book\\" embraces > those texts whose primary aim is to describe and define a basically > Protestant scheme of life, morals, and behavior, in order to encourage ideal > conduct in white, generally middle-class children, young men, or young > women. Conduct books do not deal exclusively with questions of etiquette, but rather with the conduct of one's life in a broader, ethical sense. Conduct books are typically addressed to a specific audience but also to society more broadly, and address themes including moral education and gender roles. Their tone may be both admonitory and hortatory, instructing readers both on how to behave and how not to behave. The critic Nancy Armstrong argues that conduct books \\"represented a specific configuration of sexual features as those of the only appropriate woman for men at all levels of society to want as a wife\\", while also providing \\"people from diverse social groups with a basis for imagining economic interests in common.\\" Armstrong argues that conduct books addressed readers who belonged neither to the aristocracy nor to the working class, thereby paradoxically targeting a middle class audience that did not take shape until a later period‚Äî\\"a middle class that was not actually there.\\" United States From the colonial period British and European conduct books were reprinted by American publishers and became popular; until the late 18th and early 19th centuries such imported volumes were the primary source of Americans' behavioral and moral guidance. American conduct books were addressed predominantly to middle-class readers and addressed middle-class concerns. Newton argues that these texts \\"reflected questions about gentility, right-doing, and manners, but more importantly questions about social identity and roles and how to live good and successful lives.\\" A typical mid-19th- century conduct book for young women would deal with topics including women's responsibilities, domesticity and love of the home, religion, education, courtship and marriage, women's duties to their husbands and children, and \\"female qualities\\" such as cheerfulness, humility and submission; while a conduct book or young men of the same period would address themes including ambition, self-reliance, self-improvement, honesty, punctuality, choice of friends and marriage. In her study of American conduct books published between 1830 and 1860, Jane E. Rose argues that conduct books in this period \\"glorify Republican Motherhood and domesticity\\" by characterising the home as the appropriate sphere for women, as a tool for \\"fostering religion, uprightness, and virtue\\", and as \\"women's empire\\" through which women serve the nation by raising future leaders. Topics covered by conduct books in this period \\"might include domestic, religious, and wifely duties; advice on health and fashion; rules for dating, mental improvement, and education; the art of conversation and avoiding 'evil-speaking' and gossiping; and advice on fostering harmonious marital relationships.\\" Rose argues that these books, which were aimed predominantly at middle-class white women, placed \\"certain limitations and restrictions upon women's autonomy, literacy, and educational and vocational opportunities.\\" Popular 18th-century conduct books included Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield's Letters to His Son (1774), John Gregory's A Father's Legacy to His Daughters (1774), Hester Chapone's Letters on the Improvement of the Mind (1773), William Kenrick's The Whole Duty of Woman (1753), and the compendium The Lady's Pocket Library (1792), published by Mathew Carey, which included selections by Hannah More, Sarah, Lady Pennington, Anne-Th√©r√®se de Marguenat de Courcelles and Jonathan Swift. In the 19th century, popular conduct books included Henry Ward Beecher's Lectures to Young Men (1844), William Alcott's The Young Man's Guide (1834), The Young Wife, The Young Woman's Guide to Excellence, The Boy's Guide to Usefulness, and Familiar Letters to Young Men on Various Subjects, Lydia Sigourney's Moral Pieces in Prose and Verse (1815), How to Be Happy (1833) and Letters to Young Ladies (1833), Harvey Newcomb's A Practical Directory for Young Christian Females, The Young Lady's Guide to the Harmonious Development of Christian Character, How to Be a Man, Anecdotes for Girls, How to Be a Lady and Anecdotes for Boys, and Timothy Shay Arthur's Advice to Young Ladies on Their Duties and Conduct in Life (1848) and its companion volume Advice to Young Men on Their Duties and Conduct in Life (1848). Significance Newton argues that conduct books > have promoted political ends; they have aesthetically influenced female > characterization and plot development in early American as well as English > novels; and they have certainly helped perpetuate traditional American views > about female place and roles that emerged, in Barbara Welter's phrase, as > the \\"Cult of True Womanhood.\\" Armstrong argues that because conduct books appeared to have no political bias, the rules codified in them \\"took on the power of natural law\\"; and that as a result \\"they presented‚Äîin actuality, still present‚Äîreaders with ideology in its most powerful form.\\" Elsewhere Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse argue that \\"Of the means which European culture has developed to create and regulate desire, conduct books for women and certain other form of writing now known as literature offer us the clearest examples\\", and go on to argue that \\"the production of specific forms of desire has created and maintained specific forms of political authority\\".

The bacterium involved is Fusobacterium necrophorum,https://www.thehorse.com/articles/27319/the-lowdown- on-thrush and occurs naturally in the animal's environment ‚Äî especially in wet, muddy, or unsanitary conditions, such as an unclean stall ‚Äî and grows best with low oxygen. Horses with deep clefts, or narrow or contracted heels are more at risk of developing thrush. Symptoms The most obvious sign of thrush is usually the odor that occurs when picking out the feet. Additionally, the infected areas of the hoof will be black in color (even on a dark-horned hoof), and will easily break or crumble when scraped with a hoof pick. When picking the hooves around thrush areas, the differences between healthy and infected areas can be seen when white/gray tissue (healthy frog) is surrounding a dark, smelly (infected) area. Most horses do not become lame if infected with thrush. However, if left untreated, the bacteria may migrate deeper into the sensitive parts of the hoof, which will result in lameness. Then, the horse may also react when its feet are picked out, and blood may be seen. Treatment and prevention Treatment for horses with thrush includes twice-daily picking of the feet, taking special care to clean out the two collateral grooves and the central sulcus. The feet may then be scrubbed clean using a detergent and/or disinfectant and warm water, before the frog is coated with a commercial thrush-treatment product, or with iodine solution, which may be soaked into cotton balls and packed into the clefts. Several home remedies are used, such as a hoof packing of a combination of sugar and betadine, powdered aspirin, borax, or diluted bleach. It is best, however, to speak with the horse's veterinarian, to be sure these home remedies are effective and, more importantly, safe for use on horses. Horses with thrush, or those at risk for contracting it, are best kept in a dry, clean environment. Daily cleaning of the hooves also contributes to the prevention of thrush. In general, thrush is relatively easy to treat, although it can easily return and it can take up to a year for a fully healthy frog to regrow after a severe infection.

Henry (1797 - March 5, 1834) was a militia officer from the U.S. state of Illinois who rose to the rank of general during the Black Hawk War. Henry was born in Pennsylvania in 1797, and moved to Edwardsville, Illinois in 1822. In 1825, while living in Edwardsville, he was indicted with two other men for the murder of an acquaintance, though he never went to trial. One defendant was tried but found not guilty, and following the trial Henry moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he was elected sheriff. When the Winnebago War broke out in 1827 Henry acted as adjutant for four companies of volunteers. Henry's military service continued in the prelude of the Black Hawk War of 1832. He was put in command of a regiment in 1831 in response to Black Hawk's incursion into Illinois in 1831. Though Black Hawk left without bloodshed, he would come back in April 1832 and ignite the Black Hawk War. Henry played a major role in the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, leading elements of four mounted Illinois militia regiments in combat against Black Hawk's warriors. After the war, sick with \\"disease of the lungs,\\" Henry sought respite in New Orleans where he died on March 5, 1834. Early life James D. Henry was born in Pennsylvania in 1797. By the time he reached adulthood, Henry was barely able to read or write, having spent much of his time working in trades. In 1822 he arrived in Edwardsville, Illinois, and began working as a mechanic by day, while attending night school. On January 29, 1825, while at the Benjamin Stephenson House for a party, Daniel D. Smith was stabbed to death. Apparently, an argument occurred and Smith was later found in the dining room with a stab wound, as the group was picking him up he uttered \\"Winchester,\\" and died.Belschner, Julie. \\"'No one was ever there' So what is behind the footsteps and other strange noises at the Stephenson House in Edwardsville? ,\\" Edwardsville Journal (Edwardsville, Illinois), 23 October 2003.

It is located at Oxford Lake Park off State Route 21 in the city of Oxford, about 4 miles (6 kilometers) south of Anniston. Built circa 1850, the 63-foot (19-meter) bridge is a rare construction of Multiple King-post truss with Town Lattice over a single span. The Tallahatchee Covered Bridge, which was also located in Calhoun County, had a similar resemblance. Its WGCB number is 01-08-01. As Coldwater Creek Covered Bridge, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1973. It is currently the oldest existing covered bridge in Alabama. The bridge is maintained by the City of Oxford. History The Coldwater Covered Bridge was built by a former slave around 1850 (although some sources say it was built as early as 1839), originally located over Coldwater Creek on what is now Airport Road along the border of Calhoun and Talladega counties near the community of Coldwater (Coordinates (33.585914, -85.913)). This is about 8 miles (13 kilometers) west of its current location. Nearby was Coldwater Mill, also known as Hughes Mill, a local saw and lumber mill owned by Peter N. Hughes and Humphrey Hughes. The bridge partially burned in the early morning hours of August 11, 1920 but was able to be repaired and remain open to motor vehicle traffic. A concrete and steel bridge eventually replaced the aging Coldwater Covered Bridge in 1974, which was soon left to temporarily survive the elements. In 1990, the bridge was fully restored and moved to Oxford Lake Park. The tin roof which was originally on the covered bridge has been replaced with a shingled roof. It is now one of many visited tourist attractions within the Anniston area. See also *List of Alabama covered bridges References * Dale J. Travis Covered Bridges. Coldwater CB: Credits.

A pioneer in the development of interactive sound sculpture, Phillips' installations explore the possibilities of electronic sound in relation to living forms. Her work has been exhibited at a wide range of major museums, alternative spaces, festivals and other venues, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Spoleto Festival USA, the Walker Art Center, Ars Electronica, Jacob's Pillow, The Kitchen, and Creative Time. Phillips' collaborations include pieces with Nam June Paik and the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, and her work has been presented by the Cleveland Orchestra, IBM, and the World Financial Center. She is often associated with, and exhibited alongside other early American sound artists Pauline Oliveros, John Cage and Max Neuhaus. Early life and education Liz Phillips was born in New Jersey in 1951. Phillips has said that childhood experiences in nature, particularly along the Hudson River near where she grew up, were formative of her interest in sound, water, and space. At one point she was ‚Äútorn between making art and studying nature.‚Äù Early exposure to art in the museums of New York convinced her to pursue the former, although her intense interest in the latter has remained a consistent thread in Phillips‚Äô work throughout her career.Girrl Sound  http://girrlfeaturedartistslizphillips.blogspot.com/accessdate=15 April 2014 She began attending Bennington College in 1969, where she studied with Cora Cohen, Pat Adams, Philips Wofford, instrument-maker Gunnar Schoenbeck, Joel Chadabe, and Thomas Standish. She received an interdisciplinary B.A in the fields of music and art in 1973. Work As early as 1969, Phillips was already developing an approach that she has continued to expand over decades of work and dozens of major pieces. Her idea, she wrote in 1971, was ‚Äúto create a new kind of environmental space where the structure of the space was defined by human interaction.‚Äù At the time, Phillips was known for sound environments that were structured around the communal act of eating. Phillips would ‚Äúwire‚Äù the dinner table, and process the resulting signals using a combination of tuned oscillators, resulting in an electronic soundscape that responded to the sound patterns generated by the participants‚Äô dinner. ‚ÄúTo build sound structures I use electromagnetic fields where people actually become electronic components in the circuit,‚Äù she wrote at the time in the pages of Radical Software, an early video art journal that was a critical platform for the discussion of emergent media and cybernetic art in the early 1970s. ‚ÄúTherefore, the collective presence and movement of the people in the field feeds back audio responses‚Ä¶. The tones are in response to the total actions and relationships of the participants. The people themselves, are also potential sound structures realized only through contact with other people. With the new feedback, audio and kinestethic patterns evolve.\\" Phillips' inclusion in the pages of Radical Software signals her affinity with and closeness to the early video art scene. In 1970, Phillips created a work called Sound Structures, which was an installation that made use of a radio frequency capacitance field generated from a piece of metal placed under a rug. Resulting sounds were picked up on AM radios set around the room, initiated and changed by the entrance and movements of participants through the field, their bodies acting as conductors, grounding the field and generating sound. As the participants moved toward the center of the field, the frequency of the sound heard coming from the radios went higher and resulted in heterodynes. Crucial to the artist's design of this complex environment were the important sonic possibilities unlocked by spontaneous group formation and play among the participants. In 1971, Phillips presented Electronic Banquet at the Eighth Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York, held at the 69th Infantry Regiment Armory on November 19. The festival also featured work by Woody and Steina Vasulka, Yoko Ono, the Videofreex, Douglas Davis and the public debuts of early video synthesizers developed by Shuya Abe and Nam June Paik, as well as one designed by video artist Eric Siegel. Phillips later went on to collaborate with Nam June Paik and dancer Robert Kovich from the Merce Cunningham Dance Company on a commissioned piece. In 1972, Phillips participated in the Ninth Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York, held aboard the Alexander Hamilton, a riverboat at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. In 1974, in collaboration with artist Yoshi Wada, Phillips created a responsive sound installation using RF fields entitled Sum Time at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York. Finely tuned speakers created standing waves between themselves that were only activated when people moved through the space. The complex feedback system set up for this piece also involved the use of storage and delay. According to sound artist Charlie Morrow, writing in the pages of the SoHo Weekly News in 1974, ‚Äúthe quality of her selection of storage times is fascinating, and reflects an intuitive grasp of processes as basic as the long waves of energy within the earth‚Äôs crust.‚Äù In 1977, Phillips produced City Flow in the pedestrian mall at the City University Graduate Center in New York. The piece incorporated the sounds of passersby as well as the traffic on nearby Forty-second Street. The piece attracted attention and was featured in The New Yorker‚Äôs regular ‚ÄúTalk of the Town‚Äù column. At the New Music America festival, held in Minneapolis in 1980, Phillips created Windspun, the first of several ambitious wind-activated sound pieces. Windspun made use of an array of multiple anemometers, each one causing sounds to strengthen and fade. Their multiple locations and complex electronics interacted with the movements of participants in the installation space, resulting in tones that ranged from dense drones to sounds like breathing, depending on the direction and speed of the wind. Slow winds resulted in single tone sounds; stronger winds generated large envelopes of sounds, shaping, combining and fading dense clusters of notes in a process that the artist conceived of as akin to the formation and movement of sand dunes. The second installation of Windspun, in collaboration with Creative Time in New York, was at an alternative energy site operated by the Bronx Frontier Development Corporation on the East River in 1981. This installation made use of a wind turbine on the site. Later wind-activated pieces include Zephyr (1984) and Whitney Windspun, a sound piece included in the 1985 Whitney Biennial. A 1981 installation at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, entitled Sun Spots, was another complex example of what the artist calls a ‚Äúresponsive space,‚Äù involving finely tuned RF fields, an archway of coiled copper tubing and a bronze screen hanging from the ceiling of the space. According to a review by composer David Ahlstrom, the capacitance fields generated by the artist allowed audience members to modulate the sound field by moving around the space, activating ‚Äútinkly sounds like Chinese wind chimes, percussive little points of sound, cascades of sound that spill like water, and bundles of pointed sound like a million tiny Christmas tree lights flickering on and off.‚Äù A second iteration of Sun Spots was installed at the Neuberger Museum of Art at SUNY Purchase in 1982. Phillips installed the interactive sound sculpture Graphite Ground at the Whitney Museum in the spring of 1988. Video documentation of the installation shows visitors interacting with sculptural objects and generating sounds. In 1999 Phillips exhibited Echo Evolution at The Kitchen in New York. As in her other work, audience participation is critical to the success of the piece, which used multiple electronic sensors to track participants‚Äô movements in the space, placing them into an interactive relationship with an audio soundtrack, as well as neon visual elements Phillips co-designed with Ken Greenberg. Echo Evolution was shown again, in 2002, at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York. According to the catalog published with the exhibition ‚ÄúThe audience moves along the shore of this space, listening, tuning, sensing, viewing its own abstracted presence within it. This ghosting of the body remains scaled to human proportions yet transcends it as well by extending the boundaries of each body into the exhibition space.‚Äù In 2010, Phillips ‚Äúre-presented‚Äù Beyond/In, a piece first installed in 1974 along the theater walkway at Artpark in Lewiston, New York. The original installation relied on prerecorded sounds of wind and water from the Niagara Gorge. For her reconception of the piece in the lobby at the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, Phillips used updated technology to create an interactive sonic environment, in which participants‚Äô movements through the installation trigger modulations in sounds from the Niagara river at various points. Phillips maintains an active practice. In 2012 she introduced a work titled Biyuu, shown for the first time at a performance at Roulette, in New York City. The piece, created in collaboration with Butoh dancer Mariko Endo, combines Endo‚Äôs finely tuned physical movements with Phillips‚Äô live sound and image processing to generate a responsive sound environment that includes video projected onto a weather balloon as well as the movements of the dancer. The video for the piece made use of footage shot on location with Endo in the Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary in Rye, New York. Phillips received the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 1987. Other major awards include grants and commissions from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, and the Jewish Museum (Manhattan).

Many historic homes and structures are located within the Clarksville Historic District. While Clarksville is geographically part of the Old West Austin Historic District, it is distinct from the two historic neighborhoods of Old Enfield which lies immediately to the north on the eastern side of Texas State Highway Loop 1 (commonly referred to as Mopac) and Tarrytown which is situated to the west and northwest on the western side of Mopac. Founded by freedman Charles Clark in 1871, Clarksville is the oldest surviving freedman's town ‚Äí the original post-Civil War settlements founded by former African-American slaves ‚Äí west of the Mississippi River. The historic district was inducted into the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 in recognition of its unique and valuable history. History The area was originally part of a tract of land belonging to Texas Governor Elisha Pease, and in 1871 was sold to Charles Clark, a freedman who would start the community that now bears his name. Clark built a house on what is now West Tenth Street and subdivided the remainder of the land to other freedmen. Just a mile west of Austin, Clarksville soon became a de facto part of the city, especially when the International-Great Northern Railroad laid tracks nearby in the 1870s. The Sweet Home Baptist Church, a cornerstone of the community to this day, was founded prior to 1882, and a school existed as early as the 1890s. At least six communities of emancipated slaves existed around Austin including Wheatville (founded by celebrated Austin black leader Reverend Jacob Fontaine), Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville. However, early in the twentieth century developers began to realize the land value of Clarksville, which lay near growing downtown Austin. Austin city policy aimed to concentrate the local black population in the east, and pressured black communities in west Austin, such as Clarksville and Wheatville to move. In 1918 the Austin school board closed the Clarksville school. Clarksville residents were later forced to use city services in east Austin or none at all. The 1928 master plan of the city of Austin embraced Jim Crow and recommended \\"that all the facilities and conveniences be provided the Negroes in this district, as an incentive to draw the Negro population to this area.\\" Most Clarksville residents endured the lack of services, however, and refused to move. In 1968 Clarksville residents unsuccessfully protested a state and local plan to build a highway along the Missouri Pacific Railroad, which extended along the western boundary of Clarksville. The completed Mopac Expressway sliced through the community, forcing 33 families to leave. Despite pressure to move to segregated east Austin, Clarksville retained its African- American identity throughout the 20th century. Residents of Clarksville began requesting Austin city funds for the improvement and preservation in 1964, but dirt streets crossed the area until 1975, and a creek carrying sewage periodically flooded homes. However, in 1975 the Texas Historical Commission designated a two-block-wide strip of Clarksville as a historic district, and the city paved the streets with asphalt. In 1976 the Austin City Council approved the use of $100,000 from a federal housing and community-development grant to pave streets permanently, improve drainage, and expand the neighborhood playground. Another $100,000 was designated for housing rehabilitation. The same year Clarksville residents and supporters defeated a plan to build a thoroughfare through the community connecting Interstate 35 and the MoPac Expressway. Later in the 1970s, as rising land values drove lower-income residents out of the area, the Clarksville Community Development Corporation was established to provide low-income options to preserve the community's character. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Clarksville today Many European immigrants settled in Clarksville throughout the early 1900s, building a community still felt today. Anthony Colanetta settled in Clarksville and opened Anthony's Laundry & Cleaners at the corner of West 12th Street and West Lynn in 1950. Colanetta also built a drugstore that he leased to his friend Hylton Nau. Today both stores are still operating, and the soda fountain in Nau Enfield Drugstore is a rare find. Indeed, it was during the mid-1970s that Sledd's Nursery, with their high quality plants and organic philosophy, and Jeffrey's high class, eclectic cuisine open their doors, only to have remained Clarksville staples ever since.

Formation and history In June 1942, Royal Navy Commander F. N. Cook, the former commander of the Combined Operations Centre ‚Äì ‚Äì who was on loan to the RAN to help establish an Australian combined operations school, identified Port Stephens as the ideal location to establish a RAN training base for amphibious landings. On 9 August, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the establishment of the Joint Overseas Operational Training School (JOOTS) at Port Stephens. While the base was under construction, was assigned to the area as an accommodation ship, with serving as a tender. The stone frigate HMAS Assault was commissioned on 1 September 1942; Assault was initially operated from Westralia, but moved ashore on 10 December 1942. The base's main purpose was to train boat crews for landing craft, beach commandos to prepare beaches and co-ordinate landings on the shore, and signals sections to facilitate communications between ships and land-based forces. Training at Assault was initially hampered by the lack of LCVP and LCM craft available, with the base forced to use folding boats towed by launches and lighters to simulate landing craft, and , a requisitioned pleasure boat, as an assault transport. By March 1943, enough landing craft had been manufactured in Australia and delivered from the United States to allow for full-scale landing exercises. For administrative purposes, landing and shore personnel trained at Assault were considered to be attached to the base, not the ships that they were embarked in. The Naval Training Center at Assault was used to train landing craft crews, beach parties and signal teams. Between September 1942 and October 1943 the following Naval personnel were trained at HMAS Assault: *100 officers *100 coxswains *120 beach commanders *453 boat crews *250 stokers *40 signalmen The JOOTS section of Assault was closed on 1 October 1943, with all joint amphibious warfare training consolidated at the Army facility at , Queensland. The RAN continued training its own boat and beach crews at Assault until August 1944, when the base was decommissioned and reduced to a caretaker establishment. In April 1945, the base was given to the Royal Navy, who used it as a Commando Depot for the Royal Marines units attached to the British Pacific Fleet. Assaults sickbay was used as migrant accommodation from 1949 to 1953. It was opened as a small hospital in 1956, then closed in 1981. On 10 August 1981 the buildings were handed over to the Port Stephens Society of the Arts and are now used as the Port Stephens Community Arts Centre.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built in 1900. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 April 2017.  History  Norman Park State School (SS) opened on its present site in 1900 due to population growth in and near the Brisbane suburb of Norman Park. The school is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. In 2017 Norman Park SS retains its core complex of five buildings: Blocks A and C (urban brick school building, 1900); Block D (open- air annexe, 1915); and Blocks B and E (Depression-era brick additions, 1934). The school grounds also retain brick and concrete retaining walls, stairs and fences (1930s, 1950s); a playing field and mature trees. The school has been in continuous operation since its establishment. The suburb of Norman Park lies adjacent to the Brisbane River and east of Norman Creek, which was first bridged in the late 1850s. Part of the traditional lands of the Jagera and Turrbal peoples, the area was settled for farming from the 1850s, and in the 1870s it was a popular picnic spot. In 1886 the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society Limited purchased the land on which Norman Park SS was later built, and subdivided it as part the Norman Park Estate. Although estate subdivisions were sold off from March 1887, the suburb remained sparsely populated until the interwar period, when stormwater drainage of low-lying flood prone areas was commenced. By 1935 about 35% of land blocks were occupied.Project Services, \\"Norman Park State School\\", in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008'Norman Creek Bridge', Moreton Bay Courier, 14 April 1858, p.2'Random sketches by a traveller through the district of East Moreton', Moreton Bay Courier, 16 February 1859, p.3DNRM Certificate of Title 10178022, 1871'Opening of the Great Northern (NSW) Railway to Tenterfield', Brisbane Courier, 20 October 1886, p.4'Clearing Norman Park', Telegraph, 25 October 1886, p.4'Brisbane exchange', Telegraph, 23 March 1887, p.4'The Norman Park Estate', Telegraph, 25 April 1887, p.4DNRM Survey Plan RP12509, 1887'Norman Park', Brisbane Courier, 16 May 1931, p.19'Norman Park', http://queenslandplaces.com.au/norman-park (accessed 2 November 2016). The streets of the estate were named after the directors of the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society Limited. Part of the Norman Park Estate was located east of the 1889 Cleveland railway line, south of Agnew Street. Development of the Norman Park Estate was assisted by improvements in transport. The Cleveland railway line, opened in 1889, passed through the suburb; while the Belmont tramway, opened in 1912, branched off the Cleveland line north of the Norman Park railway station. In 1903 a replacement bridge over Norman Creek allowed a new tramline to run along Wynnum Road (then called New Cleveland Road) to a terminus east of Norman Creek.

Although development of Norman Park was slow initially, there was sufficient population in the area by the late 1890s to lead to pressure for a school. At that time the nearest state schools were at Kangaroo Point State School and Bulimba State School, a considerable distance away.Queensland State Archives, Series 12607 School Files (Correspondence) for State Schools, Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1897-1929). The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of new communities and integral to their success. Schools became a community focus, with the school community contributing to maintenance and development; a symbol of progress; and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. A Norman Park school building committee was formed at a public meeting on 11 June 1897, and an application for a state school was made on 2 September 1897. The site proposed for the new school was on \\"a dry ridge\\" between Hipwood and Agnew streets. On 9 December 1898, the Secretary for Public Instruction approved establishment of the school, so long as the site could be purchased at a reasonable price. The initial school reserve (R.872) consisted of 22 subdivisions, totalling and . The land was purchased by the Secretary for Public Instruction in early 1899 for a discounted price (¬£660 instead of ¬£940), which the estate owners accepted due to the likely improvement in value of the surrounding land that a new school would bring.QSA Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1897-1929). Meetings of the Building Committee were apparently held in a blacksmith's forge, as no local hall existed ('Norman Park School. Opened on Saturday. Speeches on Education', Telegraph, 9 July 1900, p.3)Subs 132-148, 151-155 (DNRM Certificate of Title 10178022 1871)DNRM Survey Plan N25612, December 1899Letter from WH Parker, Manager Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society Ltd, to F ff Swanwick (Secretary of Building Committee), 17 December 1898, in QSA Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1897-1929). Instead of a standard timber school, Norman Park's school building committee requested a brick school, on the same terms as East Brisbane State School; which involved a one-sixth contribution by the community to the building cost. In April 1899 the Works Department presented estimates for the school in either brick or timber, and the building committee again chose brick. Tenders were called, and in November 1899 the tender of Charles Miller, for ¬£2023 and 14s was accepted, with the school, a teacher's residence, fencing and gates to be completed in five months.Letter from F ff Swanwick to Under Secretary, 5 January 1899, in QSA Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1897-1929)'Norman Park State School', Telegraph, 20 May 1899, p.8'State schools. Tenders for buildings accepted', Telegraph, 23 November 1899, p.2. The urban brick school building constructed at Norman Park was individually designed by the Department of Public Works. Brick school buildings were far less frequently built than timber ones, being only provided in prosperous urban or suburban areas with stable or rapidly-increasing populations. All brick school buildings were individually designed with variations in style, size, and form, but generally retained similar classroom sizes, layouts and window arrangements to timber schools to facilitate natural light and ventilation. However, compared to contemporary standard education buildings, these buildings had a grander character and greater landmark attributes.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.18, 99QSA, Item ID 13693, Deputy Govt Architect, \\"Preliminary Estimate of Modified Plan - New State School Ascot\\", 9 May 1919. As shown on an April 1899 plan, the urban brick school building comprised two blocks (Blocks A and C in 2017) linked at right angles, with a third, unbuilt block intended to complete a U-shaped arrangement in future. Each block contained a single large classroom, , with wide verandahs on each side. A hat/cloak room and teachers room, both measuring by , projected towards Agnew Street off the southeast block's verandah, with entrance stairs on either side. The open understory had space for play areas, tanks and lavatories. The completed school could accommodate 305 pupils, with 120 in each classroom; 50 on the L-shaped verandah, and 15 in the teachers room.Plan, \\"Norman Park Proposed State School\\", 27 April 1899, in QSA Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1897-1929). The space under the school was initially 9ft 6 inches (2.9m) high ('Norman Park School. Opened on Saturday. Speeches on Education', Telegraph, 9 July 1900, p.3). Externally, the red, face brick walls were relieved by light brick banding and dark brick arches and lintels. Verandahs and landings were of timber and protected by lattice screens. Windows were generally pivot-hung sash windows, with those to the teachers room and hat room sheltered by hoods with decorative timber struts. The gabled and hipped roofs were sheeted with corrugated iron and had ventilation fleches. According to the Public Works Annual Report of 1901 the school was constructed on similar lines to New Farm and East Brisbane state schools.Project Services, \\"Norman Park State School\\", in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II ReportAnnual Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year 1900-1901, Queensland Government Printer, 1901, p.4'Norman Park State School', Telegraph, 11 March 1899, p.2. A school residence was located in the centre of the school grounds, facing Hipwood Street, backing onto two unpurchased subdivisions facing Agnew Street. This meant that the school grounds were effectively cut in half. Boys and girls toilets were located alongside the northwest boundary of the school, behind the classrooms.'Norman Park State School, site plan', 27 April 1899, in QSA Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1920-45)'Norman Park State School, site plan' (undated) in QSA Item 1014080, \\"Norman Park State School, erection of a state school and teachers residence\\", (1899). The completed school was opened on 7 July 1900 by the Secretary for Public Instruction, James Drake. It was reported that the school was \\"grandly situated on the summit of a hill, and though its immediate surroundings are in the bush, it commands a populous and growing neighbourhood\\". The total cost was ¬£2723 16s, with local residents to pay ¬£493 1s 11d. The initial enrolment of 52 students grew to 174 by September 1900.'New State School. Norman Park. Appointment of Teachers', Telegraph, 26 June 1900, p.2'New State Schools. New Farm and Norman Park', Telegraph, 7 July 1900, p.2'Two new state schools. Opening of the Norman Park State School.

The Annual Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year 1900-1901, p.4, puts the cost as ¬£2064 (this figure probably does not include the ¬£660 paid for the land). In May 1908 a tree planting day was held at the school to celebrate Arbor Day, during which John Douglas Story (Under Secretary for Public Instruction) expressed his pleasure that an attempt was being made to beautify the \\"naturally magnificent\\" school site. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools, and Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline and developed aesthetic tastes.'School Tree Planting, Norman Park', The Telegraph, 18 May 1908, p.5Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.4, 48-9. In 1914 the school finally obtained the two subdivisions in the middle of the school reserve. Enrolments had reached 330, with settlement in the district growing rapidly.DNRM Certificate of Title 10842024, 1892 (Subs 149, 150 were transferred from Daniel McKeering to the Secretary for Public Instruction in October 1914. McKeering was a policeman stationed on the South Australian Border, who refused to sell his subdivisions earlier ('Norman Park School. Opened on Saturday. Speeches on Education', Telegraph, 9 July 1900, p.3))Report of District Inspector to Under Secretary of the Department of Public Instruction, 29 April 1914 (regarding district growth), in QSA Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1897-1929). To accommodate a class for infants, an open-air annexe (Block D in 2017) was added to the school in 1915, connected to the northeast verandah of Block A. Open-air annexes were introduced as a standard design in 1914 in response to contemporary medical theories related to the need for high levels of natural ventilation and light for health.Although experimentation with \\"open-air\\" buildings started as early as the 1890s. The open-air annexe type was developed in metropolitan areas and built as an addition to existing school complexes to relieve overcrowded classrooms. It comprised a timber building with one solid wall (the western verandah wall) and three open sides enclosed only by adjustable canvas blinds. Ideally, they were highset, to increase ventilation and provide shelter underneath. By the 1920s open-air annexes had proved to be inadequate as the open sides provided limited weather protection and climate control, and the canvas blinds deteriorated quickly. As a final refinement of the design, canvas blinds were replaced by sliding sash windows in new and existing open- air schools and annexes throughout Queensland. Use of the open-air annexe type was discontinued from 1923.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 24-26, 41, 45. The open-air annexe at Norman Park was constructed by FJ Corbett for a contract price of ¬£739. It was a standard design with three open sides, and it was positioned at the northeast corner of the urban brick school building where there was sufficient space for the length of the building and the northwest-facing verandah could accommodate a semi-detached teachers room. The single classroom measured , with seating for 70 students, and had a coved ceiling sheeted with pressed metal. The verandah was wide, with a semi-enclosed hat room at the northern end. The teachers room measured , with stairs on either side. The building stood on brick piers, with a concreted play space underneath.Constructing a two storey Open-air Annexe at the southeast corner of Block A, completing the intended symmetrical U-shaped plan, was an option considered and ultimately rejected in favour of a more standard Open-air Annexe type in the less restricted location at the northeast corner of Block A. \\"926 - Norman Park\\" (undated)'Open air annex, Norman Park State School' (written report, undated)'Proposed addition of Open-air School' (7 January 1915), and \\"Norman Park State School, proposed open air annex\\" (Alternative Plan C, 7 January 1915), all in QSA Item 15696 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1897-1929). Block D was opened on Saturday 16 October 1915 by the Minister for Public Instruction, Herbert Hardacre. As with other open-air annexes, the blinds were replaced with sliding sash windows and boarding , due to complaints from teachers and parents about children being exposed to bad weather and unable to see their work when the blinds were closed.An Open-Air School.

A basketball court had been built at the corner of Hipwood and School streets by June 1923. By 1925 there was an average of nearly 600 children attending the school, as the extension of tram lines through Norman Park had \\"caused a large number of people to build in the vicinity of the school\\".'Report of a deputation which waited upon the Minister on the 6th June 1923, from the school Committee at Norman Park''Plan of proposed improvements to Norman Park State School grounds' (undated)16 July 1925 letter to Minister for Education from School Committee, all in QSA Item 15697 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1900-1945). Major ground improvements and extra accommodation were provided at Norman Park SS during the 1930s, due to the pressure of overcrowding (630 enrolled in 1932) and an increase in government spending.Classes were being taught under the school and on the verandahs. (Letter from John Thomson to the Department of Public Instruction, 26 October 1932, in QSA Item 15697 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1900-1945)). The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of public building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work program administered by the Department of Public Works. This included painting and repairs to school buildings and grounds improvement works.'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p.5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p.5Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1930, p.15. Extensive funding was given for improvements, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, involving terracing and retaining walls.Burmester et al , Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study p.58. In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power and embarked on a large public building program that included new buildings or additions at schools.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p.8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p.7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp.6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p.2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p.2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p.9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p.2. Depression-era work at Norman Park SS included the construction of new toilets in 1932, located beneath Block C (girls and female teachers), Block A (infant girls and boys and male teachers) and Block D (boys). The toilets were enclosed externally by infill walls and high-level louvre windows, and timber partitions internally. A tall, concrete septic tank was constructed in the western corner of the grounds and was operational by 1 January 1933. However, the tank was decommissioned after sewerage lines were connected to the school .DPW plan 50-18-4-1, \\"Norman Park State School Brisbane, new lavatory blocks, WC installation & septic tank\\", June 1932DPW Plan 50-18-4-2, \\"Norman Park State School Brisbane, new lavatory blocks, WC installation & septic tank\\", June 1932DPW plan 38-20-11, \\"Norman Park State School Brisbane, connection to sewerage\\" February 1937. An angled wall, for a store, was added north of the existing infant girls toilet partitions in 1933 (DPW Plan 50A-18-4-2, \\"Norman Park State School Brisbane, additions and alterations\\", July 1933). Two new brick blocks (Blocks B and E in 2017), sympathetic in design to the 1900 urban brick school building, were also added to the school and opened on 28 July 1934.'New wings opened. Norman Park State School', Sunday Mail, 29 July 1934, p.18. Block B was connected to the southeast end of Block A and featured decorative details to match Block C. It contained two classrooms on the first floor and one double classroom on the ground floor. The first floor had verandahs on the northwest and southeast sides, and a stairwell at the northeast corner led down to a ground floor verandah on the southeast side. Block E, which was highset with understorey play space, was connected to the northwest corner of Block A. It had three classrooms separated by folding partitions, and a southeast-facing verandah with a semi-enclosed hat room at the north end. Both blocks had hipped roofs of corrugated iron; Block B had a roof fleche and Block E had a dormer window over its central classroom.DPW Plan 50A-18-4-2, \\"Norman Park State School Brisbane, additions and alterations\\", July 1933DPW Plan 50A-18-4-3, \\"Norman Park State School Brisbane, additions and alterations\\", July 1933DPW Plan 50A-18-4-4, 'Norman Park State School Brisbane, additions and alterations', July 1933. Further classrooms were created by dividing the original classrooms in Blocks A and C with new central passageways linking the verandahs. Windows were also modified to comply with the new ideal of providing natural lighting for students on their left hand side. Windows to the verandahs of Blocks A and C were bricked up and additional windows inserted in the end elevations of both blocks. The school now consisted of five connected blocks - four brick and one timber - containing 11 classrooms.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report. Works to the upper school grounds during the Depression-era improved circulation and stabilised the steep site. Brick retaining walls and concrete steps were built to the north and south of Block B -4. The school residence was removed at this time.The walls and steps near Block B are on 1933 and 1935 plans (DPW Plan 50A-18-4-1, \\"Norman Park State School Brisbane, additions and alterations\\", August 1933DPW Plan 50E-18-4, Norman Park State School, block plan showing levels, June 1935). Removal of residence: Swanwick, 1900 Norman Park State School 2000, p.50. Ground levelling at Norman Park State School occurred under the Relief Scheme (Inspector of Works to Undersecretary for Works, 11 February 1933, in QSA Item 15697 \\"Norman Park No.926 State School\\" (1900-1945)). In late-1935 a high retaining wall was built along Agnew Street, with a T-shaped set of entrance stairs aligned with the front of Block A. In addition, a high retaining wall between the upper (northwest) and lower (southeast) sections of the school grounds was added at this time, with stairs at the Agnew Street and Hipwood Street ends. Low, stepped concrete walls were also added along Agnew Street, southeast of the high retaining wall, and along Hipwood Street. All 1935 retaining walls were of cast in-situ concrete and topped with chain wire fences. Between the Agnew Street retaining wall and the school buildings, a sloping bank was added, topped with a surface drain and a two-rail steel fence and ascended by centrally placed stairs.Queensland State Archives, Series 1162, Item 583777 \\"Norman Park State School, retaining walls\\", (August 1935). Official approval to build the walls and steps was given in September 1935, with a cost of ¬£1250 ('News in brief. From near and far', Courier Mail, 13 September 1935, p.15). Most non-military building work in Queensland ceased during World War II (WWII), but air raid shelters (slit trenches) were dug at Norman Park SS in 1942 on the lower playground. At this time there was also a tennis court on the lower playground, on the Agnew Street frontage adjacent to the retaining wall.DNRM Aerial photograph, MAP3174-23001, 4 August 1942. Previously the tennis court had been in the southeast corner of the lower playground (DPW Plan 50E-18-4, Norman Park State School, block plan showing levels, June 1935). The lower grounds remained roughly landscaped, with eroded banks and collapsing timber fences, until at least 1949-50. At this time it was proposed to grade the slopes to the streets and fence the playground. A battered (sloped) wall of stones set in concrete was constructed below the southeast and northeast elevations of Block D; and by 1957 the concrete wall along Hipwood Street had been extended to the northwest, past a vehicle entrance, to incorporate a pedestrian entrance and steps.Plan, \\"Norman Park State School, proposed ground improvements Block Plan\\", July 1949, and 1950 photos of old fences and eroded slopes, in QSA Item 392206, \\"Norman Park State School Works\\" (1926-1969)DPW Plan 14-20-5, \\"Norman Park State School, proposed ground improvements block plan\\", January 1950DPW Plan 926-600, \\"Norman Park SS, additional 2 classrms\\", November 1957. Although the proposals to grade the slopes and fence the lower playground were made in 1949-50, work seems to have continued into the late 1960s (A letter from the Parents and Citizen's Association, 28 March 1968, notes that, as extension, levelling and grading of the school playground was now complete, the oval could be fenced (QSA Item 392206 \\"Norman Park State School Works\\" (1926-1969)). Changes to the school buildings in the 1950s improved natural lighting and increased classroom numbers and storage space. The former cloakroom and head teachers room on the southwest side of Block A became staffrooms in 1953, at which time casement windows were inserted below the original pivot windows to improve natural lighting. A storeroom was enclosed at the south end of the first floor southeast verandah of Block B that year. In 1954 the northwest verandah of Block C was enclosed with sliding sash windows to create a library; the ground floor classroom of Block B was partitioned to form two rooms; and Block D's classroom was partitioned with folding doors. A two-level addition, with a classroom at each level, was made to the northeast end of Block D in ; and two highset classrooms (Block F in 2017) were added to the west of Block E in .DPW Plan 926-484, \\"Norman Park State Sch, imprvts to lighting etc\\", July 1953DPW Plan 926-511, \\"Norman Park State Sch.

The library was previously in one half of the ground floor classroom of Block B (Letter from Head Teacher, William Grant, to DPI, 30 March 1954, in QSA Item 392206, \\"Norman Park State School Works\\" (1926-1969))DPW Plan 926-600, \\"Norman Park SS, additional 2 classrms\\", November 1957DPW Plan 926-612, \\"Norman Park SS, additional 2 classrooms\\", May 1958. Additions and changes to the school were also made from the 1960s to the 1980s. A swimming pool was built in the northwest corner of the school and officially opened 31 October 1964. A retaining wall was built nearby in . By May 1969 enrolments had dropped to 315 pupils due to the transfer of Grade 8 to high school (1964), and the opening of Seven Hills State School in 1960.Swanwick, 1900 Norman Park State School 2000 (Notes of 1963 and 1964)Letter, 29 April 1969, regarding order to construct retaining wall, and letter, 23 May 1969, regarding pupil numbers, both from Under Secretary to Director General of Education, in QSA Series 53, Item 392206 \\"Norman Park State School Works\\" (1926-1969). By 1975 further verandah enclosures had taken place at the south end of Block C's southeast verandah and the south end of Block B's northwest verandah. In 1977 the southwest classroom of Block C was modified to accommodate a speech therapy resources room. In 1979 the toilets under Block D were extended to the northeast, resulting in the 1930s toilets beneath blocks A and C being converted into store rooms. In 1980 Block B's first floor southeast verandah was enclosed, and by 1989 an external walkway existed along the northwest side of Block A.DPW Plan A1RS2447, \\"Norman Park State School, light and power installation\\", November 1975; Changes after 1990 included the painting of a mural on the Agnew Street retaining wall in 1997, and a major refurbishment of Block D's interior in 1998, including the enclosure of the verandah and new large openings in the classroom walls.Swanwick, 1900 Norman Park State School 2000, p.133 (mural)DPW Plan 20926-16648-A2, \\"Norman Park State school, redevelopment of Block D\\", April 1998. A new building (Block G in 2017) was added to the lower playground in 2004-5, on the site of the tennis courts, and the hall northeast of Block G was constructed between 2009 and 2011.DPW Plan 20926-35572-CD-A01-01, \\"Norman Park State School, Block G site plan/demolition plan', April 2004Google Earth images 2003-2011. The school celebrated its centenary in 2000, with the publication of a school history, and the creation of a Centenary Garden. In 2017, the school retains its early complex of five classroom blocks and its Depression-era retaining walls, fences and steps, set within landscaped grounds with mature shade trees. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community where generations of students have been taught.  Description  Site map, 2017 Norman Park State School occupies a site in the Brisbane suburb of Norman Park, approximately east of the CBD. Located within a suburban residential area, the school is bounded by Agnew Street to the southwest, School Street to the southeast, Hipwood Street to the northeast and residential properties to the northwest. At the core of the school is the original complex of four brick classroom blocks and one timber classroom block, constructed between 1900 and 1934. The core occupies a high point in the terrain with extensive views to the west and south. The school grounds step down via a series of retaining walls towards the bounding streets, and a playing field occupies the southeast end of the site (the lower playground). The main entrance to the grounds is via a formal pedestrian stairway on Agnew Street, with secondary entrances around the school perimeter and vehicular access provided from Hipwood Street. The school grounds are well established and contain a number of significant mature trees and landscaping features such as Depression-era retaining walls, a playing field and a school bell. The five significant classroom blocks are positioned close together and linked at their corners by verandahs and walkways. These blocks are: *Block A (central block), urban brick school building (1900) *Block C (southwest block), urban brick school building (1900) *Block D (northeast block), open-air annexe (1915) *Block B (southeast block), Depression-era brick addition (1934) *Block E (northwest block), Depression-era brick addition (1934) Blocks B and E, constructed in the 1930s, were designed to complement the school's original urban brick school building, of which only blocks A and C were completed in 1900. Block D is a former open-air annexe with semi-detached teachers room, and the only timber building of the five. All blocks are two storeys, with hipped roofs clad in corrugated metal sheeting. With the exception of Block B, which has two levels of classrooms, all blocks have open play space on the ground floor.  Block A: urban brick school building (1900)  Southwest sides of blocks A (left) and B (right), 2016 Block A comprises two classrooms, a northeast verandah, and two offices (formerly a hat room and teachers room), separated from the classrooms by verandah passageway. Access to the first floor is by two sets of timber stairs, located on either side of the offices. The walls are constructed from orange-red brick with buff brick banding and dark glazed bricks to arched lintels over original door and window openings and throughout the understorey. Some external walls, including the main facade, are strengthened by buttresses with bevelled tops of buff brick. The verandahs and floor and roof framing are constructed from timber. Windows have either stone or concrete sills, and windows inserted or modified from the 1930s onwards have horizontal concrete lintels. The main (southwest) facade is characterised by the double gable front of the two offices, which feature circular vents at the gable apexes. An early rainwater head survives at the gable valley, and the attached downpipe is positioned to match early photographs. Two large banks of windows on the first floor are sheltered by skillion window hoods with timber battened cheeks. Both the gable eaves and underside of window hoods are lined with V-jointed (VJ) tongue and groove (T&G;) boards. The building has a combination of original and later timber- framed joinery. The windows to the first floor of the main facade comprise two rows of four original windows - the outer ones fixed and the central ones horizontally centre pivoting. A third row along the bottom (inserted in 1953) are casements and taller in proportion. A similar arrangement of sashes exists in a smaller window in the southeast wall. Windows in the side walls of the classrooms comprise two fanlights (top), three horizontally centre-pivoting windows (centre) and three casements (bottom), most with original hardware. Sashes are a combination of original fabric and later additions. Former windows in the southwest and northeast walls of the classrooms have been enclosed with brickwork, but retain their arched brick lintels and stone sills. Doors to the classrooms retain their two horizontally-pivoting fanlights. The understorey has brick arches beneath structural walls and square brick piers supporting the timber classroom floors and northeast verandah. The corners of all piers and arch are rounded. The ground is laid with bitumen. Beneath the offices are two store rooms, accessed by s battened doors. These rooms retain traces of their former use as toilets, such as the concrete floor slab, timber partitions in the northwest room, and highset louvred windows in the external walls. The northeast verandah has a raked ceiling lined with VJ, T&G; boards; square timber verandah posts; and a spandrel lined with vertical boards at the northwest end. While the timber access stairs are largely modern replacements, they both retain an original timber archway with vertical batten screen above at the upper landing. The passageway running between the classrooms and offices has face brick walls and a flat ceiling lined with VJ, T&G; boards. The classrooms have coved ceilings lined with VJ, T&G; boards and evidence of two centrally-located circular vents (now enclosed). The masonry walls are rendered, with lines scored into the render to resemble wide skirtings. Sections of two single-skin timber partitions divide the two rooms, and contain early joinery: two three-light double-hung windows with two-light fanlights; and a two light fanlight over the door to the northwest classroom. Both rooms have timber picture rails, and the partitions have lambs tongue-profile skirtings. The offices have plaster- lined walls and flat ceilings lined with VJ, T&G; boards. Non-significant elements of Block A include: walkways along the northwest and southeast sides of the building; infill roofs over the access stairs and walkways; bag racks to the northeast verandah; air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, lights and other services; modern floor linings of carpet and linoleum; modern doors and replacement fanlights; and modern partitions and cabinetry.  Block C: urban brick school building (1900)  Northeast side of Block C, 2016 Block C has the same construction method and aesthetic treatment as Block A. It comprises two former classrooms with verandahs on the southeast and northwest sides. Access is via the southeast verandah, which links to the northwest end of Block A, and a set of external stairs to the northeast corner. The northeast and southwest elevations are of face brick, with buttress supports and large windows to the classrooms on the first floor. The eaves are unlined, and the exposed rafters are notched at the ends. Like Block A, the large windows are a combination of timber-framed casements, vertically centre-pivoting and top hung fanlight sashes, dating from different periods and most with original hardware. Former windows in the southeast and northwest walls have been enclosed with brickwork, but retain their arched brick lintels and stone sills. Doors in the southeast and northwest walls retain their two horizontally-pivoting fanlights and low waisted double doors, one of which has original hardware. The understorey has a bitumen ground surface and the same arrangement of brick arches and piers as beneath Block A. The southwest end is partially enclosed for staff toilets (western corner, beneath the verandah) and a store room (beneath the classroom). The store room retains traces of its former use as toilets, including the concrete floor slab, timber enclosing partitions, and highset louvred windows in walls inserted between the external arches. The store room is accessed by a timber batten gate and a pair of relocated, early panelled timber doors. The staff toilets are accessed by a braced and ledged timber board door. The layout of the toilets matches 1930s plans, however the fitout has been modernised. Both verandahs have square timber verandah posts and raked ceilings lined with VJ, T&G; boards. The southeast verandah retains sections of three-rail balustrade with dowel balusters. The southern end of this verandah is enclosed. The northwest verandah is enclosed with weatherboards and timber-framed, four-light sliding sash windows. The enclosing walls are lined on the interior with VJ, T&G; boards. The former classrooms (used as staff and resource rooms in 2016) have coved ceilings lined with VJ, T&G; boards and the northeast room retains a circular ceiling vent with fretwork panel. The masonry walls are rendered, with lines scored into the render to resemble wide skirtings. Sections of two single-skin timber partitions divide the two rooms, and contain an early doorway with a two-light fanlight. The northeast room has timber picture rails and lambs tongue-profile skirting to the partition. The southwest room has undergone alterations, including relining of the timber partition, the installation of a suspended ceiling, and the creation of a doorway in the northwest masonry wall. The uppermost level of windows is concealed by the suspended ceiling. Non-significant elements of Block C include: the suspended ceiling and modern wall linings to the staff room (former southwest classroom); air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, lights and other services; modern floor linings of carpet and linoleum; and modern doors, partitions and cabinetry.  Block D: open-air annexe (1915)  Block D Teachers Room, 2016 Block D is timber-framed, clad in timber weatherboards and stands on square brick piers. It comprises two large classrooms with an enclosed verandah along the northwest side, and a semi-detached teachers room with a hipped roof. Access is via the verandah, which links to the northeast corner of Block A, and two sets of timber stairs on the northwest side. A two-storey classroom extension to the northeast end of the block (constructed 1957) is not of heritage significance. The block's original use as an open-air annexe is evident in the external cladding, with the vertical timber posts of the wall structure visible between weatherboard panels. Windows in the southwest wall are 1920s timber-framed, six-light sliding sash windows with long, four-light fanlights above. Windows in the southeast wall have been replaced with s timber-framed awning windows. The teachers room has sets of paired, three- light casement windows, with those on the northwest side sheltered by a timber-framed skillion hood with angled brackets and battened sides. Eaves along the southeast and southwest classroom walls and to the teachers room are unlined. The southwest side of the understorey is enclosed for girls, boys and staff toilets. Walls within the understory are timber partitions of vertical VJ boards with lattice screens above. Wall and toilet partitions at the southwest end date from the 1930s, while those at the northeast end are 1979 additions in a similar style. Exterior infill walls between piers are of concrete block with high-level louvre windows. The play space has been modified, with modern carpet lining the floor and roller doors installed between the perimeter piers so the space can be enclosed. The verandah is fully enclosed with weatherboard cladding and modern glazing, apart from a small landing at the top of the southwest staircase, where a small section of three-rail balustrade with dowel balusters survives. It retains its raked ceiling with VJ, T&G; board linings. The wall between the verandah and classrooms has been largely demolished and/or reconstructed to create large openings. The classrooms retain vertical VJ, T&G; board linings to the perimeter walls and sections of the former verandah wall. The central partition contains wide, folding timber doors (s). The original ceiling is concealed behind a modern suspended ceiling. The teachers room has a pressed metal ceiling with square ceiling vent, and walls lined with vertical VJ, T&G; boards. The location of the original door is evident in the lining of the southeast wall. Non-significant elements of Block D include: a modern verandah addition to the north side of the teachers room; sun-shading screens to the southeast side; modern partitions, roller doors and floor coverings to the understorey; suspended ceilings to the classrooms; air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, lights and other services; modern floor linings of carpet and linoleum; and modern doors, glazing, partitions and cabinetry.  Block B: Depression-era brick addition (1934)  Block B was designed to match Block C in its size, layout, materials and aesthetic treatment. It comprises two classrooms on the first floor, with verandahs (now enclosed) on the northwest and southeast sides, and a large classroom on the ground floor with a ground floor verandah on the southeast side. The ground floor level is lower than the understory level of the other blocks, with brick retaining walls and stairs at the northern and southern ends of the block separating the southeast corner of the upper playground from the understorey level. Access to the first floor is via the northwest verandah, which links to the southeast end of Block A, and a stairwell in the northeast corner of the southeast verandahs. The building is constructed from glazed, dark red bricks, with orange brick banding and details to the southwest and northeast elevations. The verandahs are timber framed and clad in timber weatherboards. Like Block C, the end walls have shallow buttresses and the unlined eaves feature exposed rafters with notched ends. Windows in masonry walls have concrete sills and doors have horizontal concrete lintels. Windows to the enclosing verandah walls are either timber- framed, three-light casements or modern aluminium sliding windows. Windows to the first floor classrooms are timber-framed and of similar proportions to Block C, with a combination of timber-framed casements, vertically centre- pivoting and top hung fanlight sashes, with original hardware. Ground floor classroom windows are three-light casements with square fanlights above, sheltered by timber-framed, skillion hoods with angled brackets. A walkway beneath the northwest verandah links with the adjoining understorey areas and has a concrete floor and square brick piers with rounded edges supporting the verandah floor above. The ground floor verandah is partially enclosed with brick walls at each end, to create a hat room (now storage area) at the southwest end and enclose the timber-framed staircase at the northeast end. Timber posts with stop-chamfered edges support a weatherboard-clad panel spanning between the two walls. The verandah has a concrete floor, face brick walls, and a flat ceiling lined with VJ, T&G; boards. Coat hooks attached to horizontal timber rails remain attached to walls throughout the space. Doors to the classroom are modern replacements; however, the southern doorway is an original opening with fanlight. The staircase has a timber batten balustrade and timber newel posts with angular-shaped tops. The ground floor classroom has plaster-lined walls with timber picture rails. The ceiling is spanned by two bulkheads and is lined with flat sheeting with cover strips arranged in a square pattern. Both first floor verandahs have raked ceilings lined with VJ, T&G; boards, and face brick walls to the classrooms. The southeast verandah has an original store room at the northern end, accessed by a timber board door, and a 1950s storeroom in an original hat room enclosure at the southern end, accessed by a high-waisted panelled timber door. Doorways in the centre of each verandah wall retain their timber-framed fanlights, and the southeast door retains its double timber doors with original hardware. Large openings have been created in the northwest classroom walls, supported by steel beam lintels. Dividing the classrooms are two timber-framed, single-skin partitions clad in vertical VJ, T&G; boards. Large openings have been created in both partitions, however they retain original door and window openings with fanlights above, and one panelled timber door survives in the southwest classroom. Remaining classroom walls are rendered, with timber picture rails. Ceilings are lined with flat sheeting with covered strips arranged in a square pattern, and retain lattice ceiling vent panels in the centre. Non-significant elements of Block B include: metal gates to the ground floor verandah; air- conditioning units, ceiling fans, lights and other services; modern floor linings of carpet and linoleum; and modern doors, glazing, partitions and cabinetry.  Block E: Depression-era brick addition (1934)  Southeast side of Block E, 2016 Block E comprises two large classrooms on the first floor (formerly three), a southeast-facing verandah (now enclosed), and an open understory with later classroom enclosure at the southwest end. Access is via the verandah, which links to the northwest corner of Block A, a set of timber stairs at the northeast end of the verandah, and via Block F, which adjoins Block E on the northwest side. Constructed from the same dark red glazed bricks as Block B, Block E is plainer in style, without buttresses or brick banding details. The verandah is timber-framed and supported on square concrete piers. Windows in masonry walls have concrete sills, and doorways and later inserted windows and doors have horizontal concrete lintels. The northern end of the verandah is partially-enclosed with brick on both levels. A southeast-facing dormer window with three window bays is located over the centre of the building. Classrooms windows in the northeast and southwest walls are three-light casements with two-light fanlights above, sheltered by timber-framed, skillion hoods with angled brackets. Non-significant windows inserted in the northwest wall in include high-level louvres and large, double-hung sashes with rectangular fanlights. The understorey has a concrete floor, rendered ceiling, wide brick piers or solid walls below the classroom walls, and square concrete piers down the centre. Brick piers, buttresses and openings have rounded corners, and sections of early timber seating survive along the northwest wall. The southwest end of the space has been enclosed with modern brick infill, partitions and glazing to create a music room; and a store room has been created beneath the northeast end of the verandah. The verandah has a raked ceiling lined with VJ, T&G; boards and face brick walls. A former hat room at the northeast end has been enclosed to form a store room. Three original doorways retain their fanlights, however a bank of windows has been removed to create a large opening. The classrooms have rendered walls with timber picture rails and lambs tongue-profile skirtings, and ceilings lined with flat sheeting with cover strips arranged in a square pattern. Lattice ceiling vent panels have been removed and infilled. Bulkheads indicate the location of former folding partitions between classrooms. Non-significant elements of Block E include: modern partitions, infill walls and metal gates to the understorey; bag racks and aluminium windows enclosing the verandah; air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, lights and other services; modern floor linings of carpet and linoleum; and modern doors, glazing, partitions and cabinetry.  Other buildings  A classroom block (Block F) and a swimming pool lie to the northwest of the core complex, and a large, multi-level classroom building (Block G) and a Hall and amenities block lie to the southeast, adjacent to the playing field. None of these buildings or their connecting walkways are of heritage significance.  Retaining walls and stairs  A series of retaining walls and stairs separate the various levels of the school grounds. Along the Agnew Street boundary are cast in-situ concrete walls incorporating T-shaped formal entrance stairs near the centre and a staircase with Art Deco-style concrete archway near the southeast end, leading down to the playing field. The walls are topped by chainwire fencing and adjacent concrete spoon drains provide drainage. At the northwest end, the wall adjoins a rectangular concrete structure, formerly used as a septic tank. Running perpendicular to the base of the playing field stairs is a high, cast in-situ concrete wall that spans the width of the school grounds, separating the upper and lower playground levels. Concrete spoon drains run along the top and base of the wall, which is topped by chainwire fencing. At the northern end the wall meets a second set of concrete stairs and a stepped concrete retaining wall along the Hipwood Street boundary. Around the core complex are walls and stairs constructed at different periods. Running parallel to Agnew Street in front of blocks C and A is a low wall and spoon drain at the top of a sloping bank, constructed . Concrete stairs ascend this bank in line with the Agnew Street entrance stairs and the centre of Block A's main facade. Perpendicular to the bank at the southeast end is an earlier brick retaining wall and stairs adjoining the southwest end of Block B. Matching brick retaining walls extend in an L-shape from the northeast end of Block B, ending in set of stairs. From these stairs, a stone-lined sloping bank wraps around two sides of Block D and continues along the northeast side of Block E. Concrete stairs ascend this stone bank between Blocks D and E. All other retaining walls and garden beds throughout the grounds are not of heritage significance. Looking southeast across playing field, 2016  Grounds  The school grounds contain mature trees, including a large fig (possibly a weeping fig, ficus benjamina) and two camphor laurels (cinnamomum camphora) planted along the Agnew Street boundary behind the retaining wall; and a large fig and camphor laurel at the southern corner of the playing field. The playing field is a large raised and levelled platform edged by embankments and trees on the southwest, southeast and northeast sides. An old school bell is mounted on a metal pole located in a garden bed between blocks C and E. Also in this area is a memorial plaque commemorating the centenary of Norman Park State School, unveiled on 10 June 2000.  Views  Due to its high position, extensive views of suburbs to the south and west and towards the Brisbane CBD are obtained from the school grounds along Agnew Street; and to the north and northeast from the grounds along Hipwood Street. The Agnew Street entrance, flanked by mature trees which frame views towards Block A, makes an important contribution to the streetscape.  Heritage listing  Norman Park State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 April 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Norman Park State School (established in 1900) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities and mature trees. The urban brick school building (1900) represents the culmination of years of experimentation with natural light, classroom size and elevation by the Department of Public Works (DPW), and also demonstrates the growing preference in the early 20th century for constructing brick school buildings at metropolitan schools in developing suburbs. The changes to the window arrangements in , which allowed natural left hand lighting of newly formed classrooms, were a result of changing educational philosophies at that time. The open-air annexe (1915) demonstrates the medical and educational theories of the period, which valued fresh air and natural light; and is important in demonstrating the development pattern of incorporating open-air classrooms into existing school complexes. The enclosure of the annexe in the 1920s demonstrates the final adaptions to the open-air classroom type to improve its functionality. The Depression-era additions (1934) and the brick and concrete retaining walls and steps (1935) are the result of the Queensland Government's building and relief work programmes during the 1930s that stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The large, suburban site with mature trees and a playing field demonstrates educational policies which promoted the importance of play and a beautiful environment in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Norman Park State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school. These include: generous, landscaped sites with mature shade trees and assembly and play areas; and teaching buildings of standard and individual designs by the Department of Public Works that incorporate understorey play areas, verandahs, and classrooms with high levels of natural light and ventilation. The school is an excellent, intact example of a suburban school complex, comprising a range of building types dating from 1900 to 1934 and incorporating later alterations. The urban brick school building (1900, Blocks A and C) is an excellent, intact example of an individually-designed urban brick school building. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of these buildings through its highset form; linear layout, with classrooms and teachers rooms accessed by verandahs; undercrofts or understoreys used as open play spaces; and loadbearing, masonry construction, supported by face brick piers and arches. It also demonstrates the use, by urban brick school buildings, of stylistic features characteristic of their era, which determined their roof forms, decorative treatment and joinery. Typically, urban brick school buildings are located in suburban areas that were growing at the time of their construction. The open-air annexe (1915, Block D) retains its highset, timber-framed structure; sections of 1920s infill glazing; classroom width; northwest verandah (now enclosed); and intact, semi-detached teachers room. The Depression-era additions (1934, Blocks B and E) are individually-designed masonry classroom blocks designed to complement the aesthetic of the urban brick school building and complete the school's symmetrical layout. They demonstrate the principal characteristics of Depression-era brick school buildings through their two-storey form; high-quality design and materials; face brick exterior; and linear layout of classrooms, accessed by verandahs. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The early 20th century core of Norman Park State School has aesthetic significance for its beautiful attributes as a well-composed complex of buildings unified by their consistent form, scale and materials. The symmetrical layout of these buildings remains intact and demonstrates a continuation of site planning ideals initiated by the siting of the original urban brick school building in a prominent, central position at the top of the sloping grounds. The individually-designed brick school buildings have considerable architectural value for their high-quality materials and decorative features. The core's setting is beautified by mature trees and formal landscaping elements such as retaining walls and stairs. The school is significant for its contribution to the Agnew Street streetscape. Standing on an elevated site, with the main fa√ßade framed by mature trees and accessed via a sequence of formal entrance stairs, the school is an attractive and prominent feature of the area. Extensive views of the surrounding suburbs and of the Brisbane CBD are obtained from the school grounds. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically have significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Norman Park State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It was established in 1900 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Norman Park children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of its suburban district and is a prominent community focal point.

The word also refers to the transversely mounted motor of such a car. A similar type of slot car that has the motor shaft mounted at an angle to the driven axle is the anglewinder. In general, the sidewinder and anglewinder are less common arrangements than the inline motor, in which the shaft is perpendicular to the driven axle and drives it with bevel gears or a pinion and crown gear. Historically, they are also less common than the pancake motor, in which the shaft is vertical, and power is carried to the axle by a chain of gears to a pinion and crown arrangement. Because they require more space between the drive wheels, the sidewinder and anglewinder arrangements are more common in 1:32, and especially 1:24, than in the smaller scales. The sidewinder and to an extent the anglewinder configurations are often seen as superior for slot racing cars. This is because when accelerating, the reverse torque of the motor transfers weight to the front of the vehicle, and therefore the guide that keeps it on the track. This allows the slot racer to accelerate through corners. There is also a further advantage as, if dynamic braking is used, the reverse torque of the motor then transfers weight to the rear wheels, which invariably are the dominant grip wheels on a slot car. Conversely the reverse torque effect on inline motor configurations transfers weight from side to side and destabilises the car.

Life and career Burrell was born in Norwich, where her father, a schoolteacher by profession, served as an assistant organist at the cathedral, and attended Norwich High School for Girls before studying music at Cambridge University. She began her career as a viola player, but soon became well known for her compositions and became a full-time composer. One of her first compositions was for the 1980 St Endellion Music Festival. She used to attend as a viola player, but festival organizer Richard Hickox told her she \\"ought to write something for the festival. The result, Missa Sancte Endeliente, was a large-scale mass using Cornish and Latin texts. Her first major orchestral piece was titled Landscape (1988). It describes the wild, windswept countryside. It was one of the winners of the \\"Encore\\" awards organised by the Royal Philharmonic Society and BBC Radio 3. Another notable orchestral work was Das Meer, das so gro√ü und weit ist, da wimmelt's ohne Zahl, gro√üe und kleine Tiere (\\"The Sea is so big and wide and swarming with numerous little animals\\"). It describes the sounds and the atmosphere of the sea. Burrell has written other orchestral works including concertos for viola, flute and clarinet, an opera The Albatross (1997), many choral works and chamber music. She likes modern architecture and her music sometimes shows this in the way it is shaped. She has also written music for young people, such as Lights and Shadows (1989) which includes a children's choir, a recorder group and much percussion. She teaches at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and became the Artistic Director of Spitalfields Festival in London in 2006, taking over from Jonathan Dove. In 2006, she was awarded a fellowship from the Arts and Humanities Research Council at the Royal Academy of Music, to compose a major series of ensemble organ works over five years. She lives in Harwich, Essex.

His origins are not clear, but he was holding a canonry in the diocese of Glasgow by 20 January 1312. He was a commissary of Bishop William de Lamberton in a case between Dunfermline Abbey and one of the abbey's vicars in early 1312. He was part of William de Lamberton's close group of associates, his familia. In 1328, he was involved playing an administrative role in drawing up a treating at Holyrood Abbey between King Robert I of Scotland and the English crown. By this point in time he was holding the title \\"Master\\", and hence an academic qualification. In the following year he became Dean of Dunkeld Cathedral. The latter position was still held in early 1341, but was probably resigned soon after as Bell moved to become a canon of St Andrews. He was elected to succeed James Bane as Bishop of St Andrews perhaps sometime soon after the death of Bane on 22 September 1332, though Walter Bower claimed he was elected earlier, on 19 August. Bell travelled to the Papal court based at Avignon to receive Papal confirmation, but in doing this his efforts were blocked by opposition and counter-nominations from representatives of the English crown. He does not appear to have obtained Papal confirmation, and in February 1342 resigned the rights acquired by election to facilitate the Pope's preferred candidate William de Landallis. He returned to Scotland with the new bishop, re-entered St Andrews Cathedral Priory as an Augustinian canon, and died on 7 February 1343. Bell was apparently blind at death only a decade later, and it is not known if this had anything to do with the Papacy's decision. References * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J.

It was written in 1940 and first performed in 1948. The story describes the aristocratic land-owner Puntila's relationship to his servant, Matti, as well as his daughter, Eva, who he wants to marry off to an Attach√©. Eva herself loves Matti and so Puntila has to decide whether to marry his daughter to his driver or to an Attach√©, while he also deals with a drinking problem. In his essay \\"Notes on the Folk Play\\" (written in 1940), Brecht warns that \\"naturalistic acting is not enough in this case\\" and recommends an approach to staging that draws on the Commedia dell'Arte.Willett and Manheim (1994, 392). The central relationship between Mr Puntila and Matti‚Äîin which Puntila is warm, friendly and loving when drunk, but cold, cynical and penny-pinching when sober‚Äîechoes the relationship between the Tramp and the Millionaire in Charlie Chaplin's City Lights (1931). The duality of Mr. Puntila is an example of Brecht's use of the literary device, the split character. The play is also an inspiration for some of the main characters in Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola.Bharadwaj's interview in The Big Indian Picture http://thebigindianpicture.com/2014/03/vishal-bhardwaj-tbip- tete-a-tete.

Wuolijoki's work had the dramatic structure of a well-made play, which, Brecht concluded, hampered her achievement as a writer.Willett and Manheim (1994, xvii). Its protagonist, Puntila (who is described as a \\"Finnish Bacchus\\"), was based on a cousin of Wuolijoki's former husband called Roope Juntula. Juntula had become engaged with three village women and had also driven his Buick recklessly in the middle of the night to procure alcohol‚Äîboth episodes that would be dramatised in Brecht's story. Wuolijoki suggested a collaboration with Brecht on an entry for a competition run by the Finnish Dramatists' League for a \\"people's play,\\" whose deadline was to fall in October. The title page of Brecht's play describes it as \\"a people's play\\" that is \\"after stories and a draft play by Hella Wuolijoki.\\"Willett and Manheim (1994, 215). Brecht began work on his non- Aristotelian version of the story on 2 September and finished a first draft three weeks later. Along with the structural transformation from dramatic to epic, Brecht described his main tasks in re-working Wuolijoki's original as: \\"to bring out the underlying farce, dismantle the psychological discussions so as to make place for tales from Finnish popular life or statements of opinion, find a theatrical form for the master/man contradiction, and give the theme back its poetic and comic aspects.\\"Quoted by Willett and Manheim (1994, xvii). Willett and Manheim outline the changes of Wuolijoki's play that Brecht effected in his re-working in their editorial notes (1994, 399-426). Brecht gave his story a downbeat ending, in which Matti resigns himself to the impossibility of authentic human relationships across the divide of social class, excepting the intoxicated illusions that alcohol provides. He transformed the treatment of alcoholism from a national problem for the Finnish, as it was dramatised in The Sawdust Princess, to its epic presentation as a farcical aspect of the class war.Willett and Manheim (1994, xvii). Marx and Engels, in a famous passage from The Communist Manifesto (1848), describe the disenchantment that the progress of the subsumption of society under capitalist social relations effects in terms of a move from ideological intoxication to enlightened sobriety: \\"All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\\" Wuolijoki translated Brecht's play into Finnish for the competition but it did not win a prize.Willett and Manheim (1994, xviii). The two authors agreed that Wuolijoki could develop the Finnish version for production throughout Scandinavia (for which she renamed the protagonist \\"Johannes Iso- Heikkil√§\\"), while Brecht could negotiate performances anywhere else, where the royalties would be split equally between them. Production history A theatrical production of the play became a priority for Brecht on his return from exile in 1947; he helped to direct its premiere at the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich, where it opened on 5 June 1948, with scenic design by Teo Otto.Willett and Manheim (1994, xix, 389). Leonard Steckel played Puntila and Gustav Knuth played Matti.Willett and Manheim (1994, 389). Brecht chose Puntila for the opening production of the first season of the Berliner Ensemble, the world- renowned theatre company that he founded in 1949 in East Germany with his wife, Helene Weigel.Willett and Manheim (1994, xix). Brecht co-directed this production with Erich Engel; Puntila was played initially by Leonard Steckel (as with the Zurich production), then by the comedian Curt Bois.Willett and Manheim (1994, xix, 394). The composer Paul Dessau wrote a musical setting for the songs for this production, while Casper Neher designed the sets.Willett and Manheim (1994, xx, 394). Brecht introduced the linking \\"Puntila Song\\" and decided to discourage the audience's empathy towards Puntila by means of defamiliarising masks for him and all the bourgeois characters.Willett and Manheim (1994, xix-xx). This production was seen by Wuolijoki. Mrs Puntila and Her Man Matti Mrs Puntila and Her Man Matti is an adaptation of Mr Puntila and His Man Matti, which premiered at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh. The play was adapted by Denise Mina, directed by Murat Daltaban and starred Elaine C. Smith as Mrs Puntila and Steven McNicoll as Matti.

The Eastshore and Suburban Railway (E&SR;) was a formerly independent unit of the historic San Francisco Bay Area Key System which ran streetcar trains in Richmond, California, San Pablo, and El Cerrito. There were several lines with terminals at Point Richmond, North Richmond, the county line with Alameda County (a transfer point), what is now San Pablo, and Grand Canyon/East Richmond/Alvarado Park. Service to Oakland required a transfer to Oakland Traction Company trains at the County Line station and service to San Francisco required an additional transfer in Oakland. The systems were later consolidated into the Key System. Service began to be replaced by buses beginning on August 1, 1932, with the conversion of the East Richmond/23rd Street line to buses. Lines were converted to buses one at a time with the last remaining line being in September 1933. Fares were originally 5 cents and were raised to 7 cents over time at the time of the last runs.  Timeline = 1900s  1900 = August 13: The contract to build a street railway is granted for the Eastshore and Suburban Railway by the Contra Costa County supervisors way. However, the planned route requires crossing Santa Fe Railroad track so legal complications arise. = 1902 = January 10: William S. Rheem, the President of the Standard Oil refinery (commonly known today as Chevron), organizes the Richmond Belt Line Railroad to provide service to the refinery. = 1904 = May 2: Rheem purchases the street railway franchise; he organizes it into the East Shore & Suburban Railway. July 7: The East Shore & Suburban Railway commences operations, running from the Standard Oil refinery in Point Richmond to the Southern Pacific depot at 18th & Macdonald. Just about the entire town turns out for the opening ceremonies. The fare is five cents. = 1905 = January: Two new lines are placed in service. The first, runs north from 6th & Macdonald to near the Santa Fe tracks in North Richmond (this line ran north on 6th Street to Barrett, east on Barrett for two blocks, and then north on 8th Street to about Lincoln Avenue). On Ohio Street, the second runs west from 3rd & Ohio (Maple Hall) to where the new line joined the main line on Ashland Avenue (now Garrard Blvd). People came from miles around on Saturday nights to Maple Hall, where all enjoyed dining, dancing, and drinking. Extra cars had to be borrowed from other lines to get the crowds home at closing time. October: A major new extension opens. It runs east on Macdonald Avenue from the SP Depot at 18th Street to San Pablo Avenue, then south on San Pablo Avenue to the Contra Costa/Alameda County Line. At the county line, passengers can transfer to a car for Oakland. The streetcar tracks cross the SP at 18th Street in Richmond, but since there is a city ordinance that forbids loaded streetcars from crossing the SP tracks, passengers must walk across the SP tracks from one streetcar to another. November: The land for the car barn at 19th & Macdonald is purchased. December: Two new extensions are placed into service: i) The Ohio Street line is extended east to 14th Street and then south on 14th Street to Potrero Avenue; and ii) the 6th Street line is extended south of Macdonald to join the Ohio Street line. = 1906 = January: Planning starts for a subway on Macdonald Avenue under the SP so that the East Shore & Suburban can avoid crossing the SP tracks. February: A new line to San Pablo is placed into service. It runs north from Macdonald on 23rd Street and then turns east on Market Avenue, running five blocks to Church Lane. Ingersoll-County Line station is built on San Pablo Avenue at the Contra Costa/Alameda county line. It bridges Cerrito Creek and is covered so that passengers can easily transfer between the Oakland cars and the Richmond cars in any weather. The station is named in honor of Mr. Ingersoll, a very popular conductor on the line. February 17: The East Shore & Suburban purchases a site in Stege where the line intends to build ‚ÄúEastshore Park‚Äù. Construction of the park, a dance pavilion, and a roller skating rink commences in March, as does construction of a new line to get passengers there. The line splits off the San Pablo Avenue main line at Potrero Avenue (this point will later be named ‚ÄúStege Junction‚Äù) and continues west on Potrero Avenue to about 49th Street. April 1: Service to the Eastshore Park station begins. April 6: The famous 1906 San Francisco earthquake hits. The East Shore & Suburban is soon carrying hundreds to a 15-acre refugee camp that had been quickly put together in San Pablo by Standard Oil. ‚ÄúCamp Rockefeller‚Äù was near the end of the San Pablo line, on Market Street between Church Lane and 23rd Street. = 1907 = September 1: The contract is signed to build the subway on Macdonald Avenue under the SP. October: The west end of the line is extended another half-mile into the Standard Oil refinery as far as the asphalt plant. Late 1907: John Nicholl announces the formation of the ‚ÄúRichmond Railway and Navigation Company‚Äù. He intends to run a competing street railway and also provide ferry service to San Francisco. Col. Rheem promptly takes care of this problem by buying the new company.

It is the primary tree in the genus Boswellia from which frankincense, a resinous dried sap, is harvested. It is native to the Arabian Peninsula (Oman, Yemen), and northeastern Africa (Somalia). Description This species of Boswellia is a small deciduous tree, which reaches a height of , with one or more trunks. Its bark has the texture of paper and can be removed easily. It has compound leaves and an odd number of leaflets, which grow opposite to one another along its branches. Its tiny flowers, a yellowish white, are gathered in axillary clusters composed of five petals, ten stamens and a cup with five teeth. The fruit is a capsule about long. The new leaves are covered with a fine down. Individual trees growing on steep slopes tend to develop some buttressing that extends from the roots up into the base of the stem. This forms a sort of cushion that adheres to the rock and ensures a certain stability. Occurrence and habitat B. sacra tolerates the most critical situations and often grows on rocky slopes and ravines, up to an elevation of , mostly in calcareous soil. Boswellia sacra is abundant in Oman in arid woodland, on the steep, precariously eroding slopes in the mountains of Dhofar, but it is most prevalent in northern Somalia. In Somalia, frankincense is harvested in the Sanaag and Bari regions: mountains lying at the northwest of Erigavo; El Afweyn District; Cal Madow mountain range, a westerly escarpment that runs parallel to the coast; Cal Miskeed, a middle segment of the frankincense-growing escarpment; Karkaar mountains or eastern escarpment, which lies at the eastern fringe of the frankinscence escarpment. In Dhofar, Oman, frankincense species grow North of Salalah and were traded in the ancient coastal city of Sumhuram, now Khor Rori. Resin The trees start producing resin when they are about 8 to 10 years old. The resin is extracted by making a small, shallow incision on the trunk or branches of the tree or by removing a portion of the crust of it. The resin is drained as a milky substance that coagulates in contact with air and is collected by hand. Growing conditions vary significantly, affecting both tree development and resin produced. Trees in the narrow fog-laden zone where the desert meets Dhofar mountain range, a region known as the Nejd, grow extremely slowly and produce very high quality resin in large, white clumps. Omanis and other Gulf State Arabs consider this to be superior to all other resins produced in North and Northeast Africa, India, and Asia, and it is priced accordingly. Threats Recent arguing about the frankincense tree populations growth of prevalence rate. There are many initiatives taken from owners of the lands, and organizations like the international banks have invested in harvesting new trees and making protection tools for the regions where the trees are mostly growing. It has helped in the increase of the production of the resin.

During his education at the Lothar Meyer High-School he learned about the medium film. He first studied architecture and urbanism at the Technical University Braunschweig (1978), but changed to the University of Osnabr√ºck, which offered at that time in Germany a unique course of studies in communication and aesthetics. There he studied art history with Franz Joachim Verspohl, Walter Grasskamp, Lothar Knapp and Jutta Held as well as media studies with Joachim Paech, Werner Faulstich, Walter F√§hnders, Peter von Rueden, Ingo Petzke and Wolfgang Becker,. Here he was conferred his Magister Artium degree in 1985. He also studied German Language and Literature at the Technical University Berlin and Art History at the University of Zurich.  Work  In 1980 he founded, with others under the guidance of Ingo Petzke, the Experimental Film Workshop Osnabr√ºck, an annual festival for experimental film art, which in 1988 became the European Media Art Festival (EMAF). Daxl was till 1992 considerably involved in the shaping of this worldwide important forum for media art. From 1987 he has participated in Goethe-Institut cultural exchange programmes, visiting more than 50 countries in Europe, America, Asia and Australia. Together with Evgenija Dimitrieva and Keiko Sei, in 1990 to 1991 he edited the tenth and last edition of the international video art magazine INFERMENTAL in Skopje and Osnabr√ºck.

Daxl and F√ºlepp have worked together since 1990 under the name \\"mediainmotion\\" and \\"daf√º¬Æ\\" within film, video art, visual music, CD-ROM, DVD, digital art, graphics, photo, installation and Mixed Media. Through their teaching and involvement with the electroacoustic music department of the Akademie der K√ºnste in Berlin (1995-2002) they have worked with contemporary composers such as Georg Katzer, Wolfgang Rihm, Milko Kelemen, Mona Mur, Jorge Reyes (musician), Steve Roach (musician), Amnon Wolman, Dror Feiler, Masami Akita (Merzbow), Zbigniew Karkowski, Elliott Sharp, Igor Kuljeriƒá, Ivo Josipoviƒá and Ensemble Modern. Heiko Daxl and Ingeborg F√ºlepp are renowned video and media artists who are at home in Berlin and in Zagreb and who are recognized in both cities. Since 1991 they work together as an artistic couple. The numerous works they have created bear witness to their joy of experimenting, always moving on the borderline to the unknown. Employing new technologies, they investigate different, so far unknown optic and acoustic phenomena. The observer's senses, his hearing, his sight and his touch, are always consciously engaged, irritating his perception. Daxl and F√ºlepp show new ways in the artistic exploration of the technical possibilities of creating sounds and abstract images which force the observer to an integrated reception. They seek to make the recipient think about the reality which is imparted to him in an artificial and technical way.

It is also known as the Yigaar (or Yegaar) tree and by the common name for all frankincense, Luban. The epithet is named after William Edward Frere, Member of Council at Bombay. Other than its aromatic uses, the locals also use it for medicinal purposes; they make it into a paste called \\"malmal\\" and apply it on the joints to treat inflammation and arthritis. It is reported to be cultivated in Yemen, but this could be based on an 1870 record by Dr. G. Birdwood citing that B. frereana was seen in Sir Robert Playfair's garden in Aden (Yemen). Playfair had brought B. frereana from Somalia and cultivated it in his garden in Aden. Although rumored to also grow in Oman, scientific and botanical evidence does not confirm that B. frereana either grows or is cultivated there.Miller, A.G. and M. Morris. 1988. Plants of Dhofar.

B. frereana resin, however, is very rarely found in Omani markets in the larger cities as a less expensive and more palatable chewing resin compared to the native Omani frankincense, B. sacra, which is known more for its medicinal and aromatic properties. In the West B. frereana is called \\"Coptic Frankincense\\" as this is the type and grade used by the Coptic Church of Egypt. 80% of B. frereana production is sold to Saudi Arabia where it is traditionally brought home by Muslim pilgrims.

Alaska plaice are right-eye flounders which live on the sandy bottoms of the continental shelf, up to 600 metres deep. Their geographic range is from the Gulf of Alaska in the east, to the Chukchi Sea in the north, to the Sea of Japan in the west. Alaska plaice feed mostly on polychaetes, but also eat amphipods and echiurans. Most commercial fisheries do not target Alaska plaice, and bycatch by commercial trawlers targeting other groundfish is the sole source of significant harvest of this species. Large schools of Alaska plaice are commonly associated with schools of Yellowfin sole, and bycatch rates can reach relatively high levels. The 2005 total allowable catch in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) was reached before the end of May of that year. Alaska plaice can live for up to 30 years, and grow to 60 centimetres (24 inches) long, but most that get caught are only seven or eight years old, and about 30 cm (12 in).

It was directed by Richard Fleischer and stars Tony Curtis as Albert DeSalvo, the strangler, and Henry Fonda as John S. Bottomly, the chief detective who came to fame for obtaining DeSalvo's confession. Curtis was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance. The cast also featured George Kennedy, Murray Hamilton and Sally Kellerman. Plot After three murders of elderly women, the victims being strangled and penetrated with foreign objects, the Boston police conclude that they have a serial killer to catch. As the murders stretch over several police jurisdictions, Massachusetts Attorney General Edward W. Brooke (William Marshall) appoints John S. Bottomly (Henry Fonda) as head of a \\"Strangler Bureau\\" to coordinate the investigation. Several suspects are interrogated and released. As the body count grows, Bottomly, in desperation, calls in a psychic, Peter Hurkos (George Voskovec), who pinpoints Eugene T. O'Rourke (William Hickey), a man who seems to fit the profile. The (severely masochistic) man is taken in for psychiatric observation for ten days but nothing implicated him to the murders. Another murder is committed while O'Rourke is under observation, clearing him of suspicion. While the 1963 funeral of John F. Kennedy is on television, Albert DeSalvo (Tony Curtis) leaves his wife and children, under the pretext of work. He gains entry into the apartment of a woman, Dianne Cluny (Sally Kellerman), by posing as a plumber sent by the building supervisor. He attacks her, tying her to her bed with rags ripped from her dress. DeSalvo is taken aback by the sight of himself in a mirror as he tries to subdue Dianne and she struggles free and bites his hand; DeSalvo flees. He tries to enter the apartment of another woman, only to find that her husband is home. DeSalvo is apprehended by a passing police patrol. Found incompetent to stand trial for attempted breaking and entering, he is committed to a hospital for psychiatric observation. By chance, Bottomly and Detective Phil DiNatale (George Kennedy) pass by DeSalvo in an elevator, where they had been visiting Dianne, who survived the earlier attack. Observing the wound on DeSalvo's hand (Dianne, who survived his attack, could remember biting him but not his appearance), the pair make him a suspect for the Boston Strangler murders. Conventional interrogation is ineffective because the treating physician thinks that DeSalvo suffers from a split personality: he has two identities that are unaware of each other. His \\"normal\\" personality fabricates memories in place of the memories of murder committed by the \\"strangler\\" personality. The treating physician thinks that DeSalvo could be made to confront the facts but that the shock risks putting him in a catatonic state. Bottomly expresses the opinion that catatonia would be the second-best thing to a conviction. Under the condition, imposed by DeSalvo's defense counsel, that none of what comes to light is admissible evidence in court, Bottomly is allowed a final round of interviews with DeSalvo. After several sessions, Bottomly manages to reveal DeSalvo's hidden personality to himself. Reeling from the shock, DeSalvo slips into a catatonic state.

The Marsican brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos, formerly Ursus arctos marsicanus), also known as the \\"Apennine brown bear\\", and in Italian, is a critically endangered population of the Eurasian brown bear, with a range restricted to the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise, and the surrounding region in Italy. The Marsican brown bear differs slightly from other brown bears in its appearance and hibernation techniques. With their existence dwindling, the Italian government has recently begun to stress their conservation. The park has become a sanctuary dedicated to animals such as the Marsican brown bear, with hopes of rekindling the large, yet isolative bears‚Äô once-thriving existence. In recent years, more conservation groups have tried to help this bear. Debate exists as to whether it should be considered a subspecies or a taxon of its own.  Characteristics/biology  The Marsican brown bear lives its life in isolation and their numbers are dwindling, with 50 bears remaining in the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise. They have characteristics that differ from other brown bear subspecies. The Marsican brown bear, otherwise known as the Apennine brown bear, has a relatively calm temperament, with no aggression shown towards humans. In terms of size, the male Marsican brown bear is larger than most of the other brown bear subspecies, with a weight of around , while the female is significantly smaller, at around . These bears are known to be omnivorous in nature, mainly eating berries, while occasionally eating small animals such as chickens and other livestock. All of these traits the bear shows can likely be attributed to its existence in isolation. Baby Marsican brown bears tend to grow up fairly quickly. In a standing position, the Marsican brown bear can reach heights of up to two metres. Their large size, as well as noticeably different forepaws to their rear are characteristics that help distinguish their presence. The footprints, hair residue, colour of faeces, and claw marks the bears leave are special to their species. These large mammals have been spotted rolling rocks over in search of insects as well as reaching high into branches looking for berries, honey, etc. Their great sense of smell makes up for their mediocre eyesight when it comes to searching for food. A characteristic of the Marsican brown bear is that their winter hibernation is not made up of a single consecutive slumber. The bear wakes at times, which makes their official resurgence less lethargic. Through the years, the Marsican brown bear became the symbol of the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise and lent its name to pan dell‚Äôorso (bear bread) and other traditional regional foods. Thanks to its presence, ecotourism improved in the whole Abruzzi region, though conflicts with shepherds and honey farmers are still reported. In prehistoric times, hundreds of bears used to live in these mountains.  Behavior  The Marsican brown bear's behaviour is relatively typical of any brown bear. These bears are mainly nocturnal, except when with their cubs or mating, where they seem to be very independent and self-contained. Mating season for these bears is usually between May and July, landing birthing of the cubs in early winter. Around February every year females give birth anywhere from one to three cubs, weighing less than 500 grams at birth, but heavily relying on the size of their mother. Marsican brown bear cubs grow up very quickly because of their mother's fat-induced milk they feed on, allowing them to roam on their own and be independent after only a few months of existence. On average, Marsican Brown Bear cubs stay with their mothers for a little over a year. As they grow older, females become fertile and sexually mature at around age three, allowing reproduction early in the mother's life. These bears mature very quickly and develop a very good sense of hearing and smell, which helps them find food and roam their environment. In contrast, the eyesight of the Marsican brown bear is rather ordinary, or average. As they start to grow, they turn to eating more of a plant-based diet including grass, fruit, berries, etc. Because they are omnivores, it is a common pattern seen with this specific subspecies of brown bears.  Diet  The Marsican brown bear's favorite food is known to be the buckthorn berry, which they feast on in the late summer time in the mountains of the Abruzzo park, where the remainder of the subspecies live. Other components of their diet include meat, eating carcasses as well as hunting for certain wild animals, which is why they are not considered a harmful predator to those around them. On the other hand, some domestic animals, including sheep, chickens, turkeys and a few others may fall victim to the bear and its sharp claws. Aside from its eating habits, the Marsican brown bear also learns to begin to look for a dry and safe place to spend its winter.  Environment  The few remaining Marsican brown bears are in the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise, where high peaks merge into woodland, with much water and land, with scattered villages. Although wooded environments are usually preferred, it is not uncommon for bears to reach high altitude grasslands or cultivated areas on valley floors. They are usually either seen camping out in one primary area for a while, or being very mobile and on the move looking for food sources. There are roughly only 50 of these bears left mainly due to loss of habitat. They are often killed accidentally by being poisoned, poached, or hit by motor vehicles. Bears often travel in Abruzzo to the high-altitude meadows in the summer, and then down to the warmer areas of valley when the temperatures start to cool. As the temperature decreases, the bears learn awareness to start looking for a dormitory, and planning out their winter. In their dens they relax and slow down, requiring less food and adjust to the colder temperatures. Bears will isolate in their dens most of winter, but are not in full hibernation, unlike most animals. Bears keep a reasonable level of consciousness and awareness to their external changes throughout the winter, and might even take a stroll on a sunny day. This period of time is where all of the fat build-up throughout the year becomes critical, as they need enough fat to burn to stay alive. They do not fully sustain themselves during this period, and use the extra fat burning off for energy reserve as well as a thermal resource. Overall, these bears are very good at living as an individual, and do not face many other threats in their environment except for poachers. Being omnivores, these bears can adapt themselves to diverse habitats, and thrive as long as they are not disturbed often, and have a developed source of food nearby.  Range  The National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio, and Molise with a wide range of environments like rivers, forests, and mountains The Marsican brown bear has a small, isolated population. It is found is the central Apennine Mountains in Italy where there are a range of settings like lakes, woods, and settlements of citizens. They are usually found in the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise. This park consists of valleys and a section of the Apennine Mountains in Italy. This enclosed, though lush, area is a likely factor for why the endangered subspecies is not leaving. This part of the country consists of mainly beechwood, which the bear is particularly fond of, though grasslands and meadows can be found at higher altitudes as well. This bear may also be found in these nearby locations: Sibillni National Park, Gran Sasso-Laga National Park, Sirente-Velino Regional Park, and Simbruini Regional Park. The population range of the Marsican brown bear has been significantly reduced over the past hundreds of years. Since they emerged in an isolated area, it does have a smaller population compared to other brown bears, but it has been on the brink of extinction for decades now. In the 1980s, there were about 100 of them, but currently there is an estimate of about 43 bears on average still living in this area. Only about 10-12 of the Marsican brown bears living in this area are females that are able to reproduce. In Italy, their state of critical endangerment has been stressed greatly by government officials, for their extinction is still a possibility. According to Giuseppe Ross, \\"the number of bears have fallen below the threshold of survival.\\" The Marsican brown bear is completely isolated from its nearest neighbours, a population of Eurasian brown bears in the Italian Alps. It could expand its range though, as there is suitable habitat throughout the Apennines.  Conservation  The Marsican brown bear, as a subspecies of the brown bear, has been included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. People have started to acknowledge and support the need for conservation of these bears. Ecotourism has improved the urgency for conservation of these areas. Italy officially protected the Marsican brown bear in 1923 by founding the Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise. which has had a major impact in conserving the bears. They ensure that habitats will stay intact or preserve more, supplying more food to the bears, and implement policies that will reduce bear-human conflicts. Another effort made by Italians is the Piano d'Azione Nazionale per la Tutela dell'Orso Bruno Marsicano (PATOM) which was formed to help protect the bears. During 2001, the Italian Ministry of the Environment for Protection of the Territory and the Sea created the action plan for the Conservation of the Marsican brown bear. It made the collection of basic health data of the Marsican brown bear a very important priority. It studied common diseases around the area. It has a specific attention to infectious diseases that could affect the bears and local wildlife. Up until 2014, Italy and the European Union teamed up to conserve the bears in the Apennine Mountains. It was called the Life Arctos Project. It was partially funded by the European Union at a cost of $7.3 million. They planted trees closer to the hills, away from civilians to prevent bear-human interactions. They put up electric fences around farms and vegetable gardens to push the Marsican brown bears away from humans. Pushing them higher in the mountains helps prevent human-bear interaction and resupply the food supply that is slowly being lost. Hunting has been a problem in conserving the bears, whether it was legal or illegal. However, poaching has decreased in numbers, so the population may be increasing. One measure in their conservation is controlling how the land will be used in the future. There are discussions about whether diseases from the cattle will spread and kill off the Marsican brown bears. In addition, it is suggested that there be more plans to preserve their habitats and food. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature the brown bear as a whole is classified as ‚ÄúLeast Concern‚Äù, which is to say that it does not require urgent conservation actions.

Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic. Ed. and trans. John Willett. London: Methuen, 1964. . pp. 179‚Äì205. It was written while in Switzerland in 1948 and published in 1949.Willett, John. 1964. \\"Note\\". In Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic by Bertolt Brecht. London: Methuen, 1964. . p.205. In a diary note from the time he refers to it as a \\"short condensation of the 'Messingkauf'\\"; when it was re-published in 1953 he identified it as a \\"description of a theatre of the scientific age\\"; later still he augmented it with some appendices and linked it to his notes for a \\"dialectical theatre\\". Against Poetics Returning in the history of theater to the Poetics of Aristotle and taking as an example ancient tragedies and comedies, he rejects the idea of catharsis: \\"What liberation is this, given that at the end of all these plays, which worked happily only because of the spirit of their time (providence - the moral order), we live a dream-like execution that punishes exaltation as much as debaucheries?\\" Brecht here makes reference to the tragedies of Sophocles, and to the comedies and dramas of Shakespeare. He takes Oedipus as an example and mentions that there is still an interest in producing/performing it because such taboos still exist. He attacks the core of the Poetics, that is, the finality of the tragedy. The critique that he made of the Poetics would become the center of his own poetics and of \\"Epic Theater\\". Politics He also points out that beyond purging souls, it would be a mistake for theater to try to reproduce the reality of its spectators exactly on stage. He did not believe this identification between the viewer and the dramatic character was acceptable to the needs of the modern stage. Instead, there should be a different kind of relationship between the protagonists and the spectators. This relationship, or rather, this phenomenon, he called Verfremdungseffekt (in English, distancing or the alienation effect). This concept of alienation lies at the \\"boundary of aesthetics and politics\\". It consists in \\"having an object, a character, a process perceived, and at the same time, rendering it unexpected, strange.\\" The goal is to \\"push the viewer to establish some distance in his relation to reality\\", to wake him or her up to reality. The effect would allow the viewer to become conscious of his or her own existence or intrinsic reality within the context of the themes of the production. Verfremdungseffekt thus politicizes consciousness and overcomes the alienation of the individual. Brecht says the great progressive themes of our time: to know that the evils of humanity are in the hands of mankind itself, that is to say that the world can be managed, that Art can and should intervene in History; that it should accomplish the same tasks as the sciences, with which it shares so much. Theater should resolutely come to the aid of the unfurling of the historical process; that stage-techniques themselves are socially engaged; and that in the end there is no eternal \\"essence\\" of art, but rather that \\"each society should invent the art that disposes it best to its own redemption\\". Observation: imitation and reflection The actor should examine the world around him. With all his being he must pay attention to gestures, and imitate the world through a process of reflection. He must amplify what he observes, because the original is too subtle, \\"it speaks too softly\\". The construction of one character happens simultaneously with all the others. The actor must take possession of his character and critically calculate its various manifestations. Learning a character is not only a critical process, but one that must evolve with the development of the other characters. The fictive object is a character that has evolved in a society, a given situation, and owes its construction to relationships with other characters. The \\"possession\\" of the actor by the character, and beauty for its own sake, are some of the aspects of traditional acting to which Bertolt Brecht was opposed. Not X, but Y It is important for the actor to understand \\"not too quickly\\". He must reflect and interrogate himself about the possibilities; he should surprise himself. Brecht suggested this should be done in terms of an actor evaluating their choices first in terms of what they were not doing, and then in terms of what they were doing. Every choice has an opposite that the actor needs be aware of. In the scientific age, an actor should be able to play an emotion sociologically, by the interaction of the ensemble of characters.

A total of 223 flights were cancelled due to the storm, stranding over 36,000 people. Impact=Japan Flood damage from Typhoon Fitow along the Tama River flood plain Bamboo covering a bridge following flooding from Typhoon Fitow The water level of the Tama River exceeded dangerous level because of the heavy rain by Typhoon Fitow. Rainfall rates peaked at 66 mm/h (2.5 in/h) in Miyagi Prefecture and the highest accumulation was 694 mm (27.3 in) in Tokyo. Twenty-nine people were rescued from sandbanks on the Tama River on September 7 after the storm impacted Japan with powerful winds and heavy rain. At least 80,000 people were left without power as high winds from Fitow knocked down power lines. A 76-year-old man was killed when a tree limb fell on him. Several homes were reportedly destroyed by the typhoon. Three people were killed and 87 others were injured by Fitow throughout Japan. Heavy rains triggered 527 landslides throughout the country. Fourteen structures were destroyed, 62 were damaged, and another 1,941 were affected. A total of 17,037 hectares of farmland was damaged or destroyed by Fitow. About 1,113 km of roads, 1 km of railway, 14 ports, seven bridges, and six dykes were damaged. A total of 229,916 families were left without power at the height of the storm of which 4,010 also lost water supply. Nineteen ships sank during the storm. Agricultural losses amounted to $137 million (2007 USD). Total damages from the typhoon were estimated at $1 billion (2007 USD). Russia Fitow brought high winds, heavy rains, and large swells to parts of eastern Russia after transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. At least four villages, with a total population of 2,000, were affected by floods triggered by the remnants of the typhoon. In a 24‚Äëhour span, some areas recorded rainfalls equivalent to a monthly rainfall total, causing numerous rivers to overflow their banks. Power was knocked out to several communities and a few roads and bridges were washed out by floods. Officials evacuated most of the residents in the flooded areas as a precaution.

The Company was acknowledged as being reflective of the cultural melting pot of the Darebin area, and was originally a program within the Darebin Council . The diversity of participants in Platform's programs and Platform's commitment to including marginalised young people (recent migrants, young people with disabilities and at risk youth) and youth governance model set Platform aside from other youth theatre companies creating a similar calibre of work. Platform operated programs that dealt with multiple facets of the performing arts. These programs varied from group learning models to one-on-one mentorships, and were facilitated by some of the most esteemed professional artists in the Australian theatre industry. Since Platform's first production in 1998, the company created a niche for itself within the youth and theatre sectors of Victoria. The company was well respected for the manner in which it combined an inclusive cultural development process with the creation of highly regarded art. Platform had the very strong belief that theatre is an inordinately powerful in tool for skill building and self-expression/determination. The public performance outcomes of all Platform's programs gave young people a voice.

It was first published in 1950 as part of The Dying Earth, a collection of loosely linked tales. It has been reissued in numerous anthologies since 1965, including The Spell of Seven, edited by L. Sprague de Camp. (ISFDB). Retrieved 2012-06-12. Plot summary A depiction of Mazirian. Mazirian the Magician paces his enchanted garden, wrestling with the problem of how to invest the humanoid creatures he has created in vats with intelligence. The secret is held by the sorcerer Turjan, who has kept the secret to himself despite imprisonment, reduction in size, and torment by a small, vicious dragon. Mazirian is interrupted by a distantly spied beautiful woman who tempts him to follow her out of the garden and into the wild country. He resists but when she comes repeatedly, he eventually follows her, armed with only five spells. In this age, such spells that remain to the knowledge of sorcerers are very complex and difficult to memorise, and disappear from memory once used. The eager magician follows the girl through hills and valleys, chanting his spells to avoid or destroy the strange creatures he encounters; these include the Deodand (a flesh-eating mutated man-creature) and Thrang the ghoul-bear. In due course, he closes upon the girl and is about to capture her - but they are both attacked by deadly vampire-grass. As Mazirian, out of spells, struggles drawing the attention of the deadly grass, the girl slowly crawls away with her life not disturbing the grass. Mazirian makes it past the grass with a paralysis spell, and is then beaten to death by trees. Battered and barely alive, she returns to Mazirian's garden, enters his house and releases Turjan. It is now revealed that the girl, known as T'sain, is a creation of Turjan and sacrificed herself to free him out of love. He bears her lifeless body away to his vats to recreate her.

He also served as a regular umpire in both early major leagues, the NL (1880-81) and American Association (1887-88, 1890). His son Jack was a major league pitcher for several years, mainly for the Brooklyn Superbas. Jack Doscher was the first son of a major leaguer to also play in the majors. Playing career Born in New York City, Doscher began his playing career in the National Association with the Brooklyn Atlantics as a right fielder. He only played in six games that year, but batted .360, and played in only one game in the season, also in Brooklyn. He didn't play in the Association in , but did return for the season when he played in 22 games, all at third base, for the Washington Nationals. He didn't hit very well, and was only able to play in the minor leagues for the next few seasons. One of his stops was with the London Tecumsehs in , a team that went on to win the championship that season. He reached the National League again in , when he joined the Troy Trojans. After that season, Doscher was named to the NL umpiring staff, and he worked 51 games in and 79 in before returning to the playing ranks with five games for his newest and last team, the Cleveland Blues. He appeared in 25 games in , ending his playing career. Mistaken expulsion and reinstatement In 1882, he accepted a temporary job as a scout with Cleveland, even though he had signed a contract with the Detroit Wolverines for the season. The Cleveland directors had him expelled from the league for \\"embezzelment and obtaining money under false pretense\\". It was later proven in NYC court that the original contract was never signed by Detroit, voiding the original contract. He was unanimously reinstated in , and returned to umpiring in the American Association in 1887. Umpiring career Known as a colorful, but a no-nonsense, hardline player, he was a natural to the umpiring profession. Once quoted as saying \\"I've got to play ring master, school teacher, poppa and momma, and doctor in every game\\", he would use any tactic he could to control the game, even physical force if necessary. His full-time return as an umpire lasted just three season, , and , but his officiating career was not without notable occurrences. He was involved in two no-hitters; one occurred on August 19, , when he was the umpire for Larry Corcoran's no-hitter, just the fourth no-hitter thrown in the major leagues. The other was Adonis Terry's no-hitter on May 27, , Terry's second career no- hitter. On September 21, , with the Rochester Broncos at the St. Louis Browns in the second game of a doubleheader, and St. Louis leading 10-3 in the eighth inning, Doscher ejected Rochester's Sandy Griffin for arguing and called an end to game, giving the victory to St. Louis because Griffin refused to leave the field. It was Doscher's only forfeit on record as an umpire. Later years Doscher's occupations in subsequent years include work as a scout; the discovery of future Hall of Famer Willie Keeler is attributed to him. Doscher died in Buffalo, New York at the age of 81, and was interred at Elmlawn Cemetery in Tonawanda, New York.

Margo is a friend and companion to Lamont Cranston, and an agent for his alter ego, The Shadow, in the wealthy set. Her first appearance was in 1937 in The Shadow radio drama. Her first appearance in a print story was in The Thunder King, a story in the April 1941 issue of The Shadow Magazine. Origins Margo was created for the radio version of The Shadow in 1937, because it was felt that having Harry Vincent as The Shadow's chief aid, and thus two male voices, would not provide sufficient \\"vocal contrast\\". Margo was based on socialite Brenda Frazier and You Can't Take It with You star Margot Stevenson. The relationship between Lamont and Margo was modelled on the Thin Man film series. During World War II, Walter B. Gibson felt he could no longer write stories about spy rings, since they had now become a reality. Instead he focused on whodunits, which suited the Cranston persona of the Shadow. Thus the character of Margo came to the fore, and eventually became a permanent fixture in the stories, finally being promoted to a full agent. Margo appears in at least 55 of the Shadow novels. Character While on radio Margo is The Shadow's confidante, in the novels Margo is depicted as a somewhat helpful nuisance who for years suspects but cannot prove the true identity of the Shadow, until finally in later years she becomes a full agent for the mysterious crimefighter. Portrayal She was initially portrayed on radio by Agnes Moorehead, who was followed by Margot Stevenson. Other actresses who portrayed Margo on the radio included Marjorie Anderson, Lesley Woods, Grace Matthews and Gertrude Warner. In an unaired 1954 TV pilot, Paula Raymond played Margo Lane opposite Tom Helmore as The Shadow. On film, Veda Ann Borg matched wits with Victor Jory's Shadow in 1940; Barbara Reed portrayed her three times in the mid-1940s with Kane Richmond; and Penelope Ann Miller was Margo opposite Alec Baldwin in 1994's The Shadow. On the radio and in the novels Margo's introduction to the novels created a storm of controversy reflected in the magazine's letters page. Older fans resented her intrusion, whereas newer readers, perhaps more familiar with the radio show than the pulp novel, accepted her readily. * In the novels her name is \\"Margo\\", while on radio it is \\"Margot\\". * In the novels she originally does not know Lamont is the Shadow, whereas on radio she does. In other media=Comics In the DC Comics book series The Shadow Strikes!, Margot is the daughter of a wealthy Southern land owner and a black prostitute. She is portrayed as one of the Shadow's chief agents. Film Penelope Ann Miller as Margo Lane in the 1994 film The Shadow. In the 1994 film, The Shadow, Margo (Penelope Ann Miller) has had psychic powers her whole life. Her father, Dr. Reinhardt Lane (Ian McKellen), is a scientist working to develop a new type of power source, using an implosive device to be contained within a beryllium sphere, which the villainous Shiwan Khan (John Lone) tries to turn into a weapon. Lamont Cranston (Alec Baldwin) and Margo first meet at the Cobalt Club, where they find they have an instant attraction. After they go out to dinner together, Lamont realizes that Margo has psychic powers and fears that she may uncover his secret identity as the Shadow if they spend more time together, so he vows never to see her again. However, when Khan begins controlling her father's mind, Margo approaches Lamont and Police Commissioner Wainwright Barth (Jonathan Winters) for help. Khan hypnotizes Margo and orders her to kill the Shadow. She proceeds immediately to Lamont's mansion and (unsuccessfully) attempts to shoot Lamont, who breaks the trance. Upon waking from the trance, she realizes that Lamont is the Shadow and volunteers to help him defeat Shiwan Khan and rescue her father. Together they investigate the last known sighting of Khan, a mysterious empty lot that every one in the city - Lamont included - believes was once the site of the Hotel Monolith; in reality, the hotel is still standing as Khan's base, but he has hypnotised the entire city so that they are unable to see it. When Khan's henchman Farley Claymore (Tim Curry) traps the Shadow in a high-pressure tank filling with water, the Shadow uses his psychic powers to contact Margo and she comes to rescue him. In the climax of the movie, Margo helps her father defuse the detonation device within the beryllium sphere (that has now become an atomic bomb), helping to save the day.

In 2006, the lineup has also included airings of general, family films that Freeform holds rights to, which included the Harry Potter films until January 2017, and other Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures films. In 2007, the block was extended to November with a Countdown to 25 Days of Christmas block. 25 Days of Christmas programming often attracts major surges in viewership for Freeform, with higher-profile film airings often attracting 3-4 million viewers or more. For 2017, Disney extended the 25 Days of Christmas branding to holiday programming shown by Freeform's sister properties in the Disney-ABC Television Group, including ABC, Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior. For most of the block's run, fourteen specials from the Rankin/Bass Productions library of Christmas specials (excluding the original Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman specials, both of which have aired on CBS since 1972 and 1969 respectively) served as the centerpiece of the 25 Days of Christmas. Freeform lost the rights to twelve of those specials (which included The Year Without a Santa Claus) to AMC in 2017 to serve as the linchpin of its new \\"Best Christmas Ever\\" schedule; Freeform still airs Santa Claus is Comin' to Town and The Little Drummer Boy.[Celebrate the Holiday Season With \\"AMC Best Christmas Ever\\" All Month Long]. amc press release. Retrieved December 11, 2017. In May 2019, Freeform announced it had acquired the cable rerun rights to the Rudolph and Frosty specials, reuniting the four pre-1974 Rankin/Bass programs on the same network.https://www.wdtvpress.com/freeform/2019upfront/press-releases/ CBS will continue to hold the free-to-air rerun rights to both specials.CBS holiday special schedule released.

Background and early life John Harbord was the younger of the two sons of Charles Harbord, 6th Baron Suffield (and also seventh baronet Harbord), and his wife Evelyn Louisa Wilson-Patten. His mother was the daughter of Captain Eustace John Wilson-Patten and Emily Constantia Thynne (1840‚Äì1926) (a granddaughter of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath, who later married again and became Marchioness of Headfort). John Harbord's paternal grandparents were Charles Harbord, 5th Baron Suffield (1830‚Äì1914) and Cecilia Annetta Baring, Lady Suffield (1834‚Äì1911), a daughter of Henry Baring (1776‚Äì1848), of the Barings Bank family. She was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria. He had one elder brother, Victor Alexander Charles, and two sisters, Doris Cecilia and Lettice Evelyn. John Harbord was educated at Gresham's School, Holt.

Olwen Gwynne Phillips in 1925 but had been divorced from her in 1937) died childless, and his younger brother John inherited the titles. However, John failed to marry, and in 1945 he also died without issue and was succeeded by a distant and elderly cousin, Geoffrey Harbord, 9th Baron Suffield (1861‚Äì1946), son of the Hon. William Harbord, third son of Edward Harbord, third Baron Suffield (1781‚Äì1835). However, the ninth baron died after holding the titles for only a year, and they next passed to another elderly cousin, Admiral Richard Morden Harbord-Hamond, 10th Baron Suffield (1865‚Äì1951), only son of the Rev. and Hon. John Harbord (1832‚Äì1900), fourth son of the third Baron. His son Anthony Philip Harbord-Hamond (1922‚Äì2011) became the 11th Lord Suffield and 12th baronet in 1951.

Joyce was born in 1946 in Wellington, New Zealand. For the 1968 Summer Olympics, New Zealand qualified an eight and had a pool of four rowers and a cox as a travelling reserve; Joyce was part of this reserve. Preparations were held in Christchurch at Kerr's Reach on the Avon River. The reserve rowers were unhappy with the \\"spare parts\\" tag and felt that they were good enough to perhaps win a medal if put forward as a coxed four. The manager, Rusty Robertson, commented about them that they were \\"the funniest looking crew you've ever seen\\". There were stern discussions with the New Zealand selectors. In a training run, the coxed four was leading the eight over the whole race. In the end, the reserve rowers got their way and New Zealand entered both the coxed four and the coxed eight. Joyce won the Olympic coxed four event along with Dudley Storey, Ross Collinge, Warren Cole and Simon Dickie (cox); this was New Zealand's first gold medal in rowing. He was 22 and had just finished his mechanical engineering degree. The crew's boat was sold to a rowing club to recoup costs, and ended up in splinters after a road crash. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich he teamed with Tony Hurt, Wybo Veldman, John Hunter, Lindsay Wilson, Joe Earl, Trevor Coker, Gary Robertson and Simon Dickie (cox) to win the eights. Joyce is one of only fifteen New Zealanders to have won two or more Olympic gold medals. He later owned an engineering business in Seaview, an industrial suburb of Lower Hutt. He has always been associated with the Hutt Valley and belongs to the Hutt Valley club, but has moved and now lives in Petone.

Plot Tom is chasing Jerry on top of a building and then through the building while during the chase two women first an older woman then a younger woman screaming until the duo reach a balcony. Tom pokes his head through the other window and yells at Jerry, scaring the spirit out of Jerry's body. Jerry's spirit then squeals at Tom, causing him to pale and age rapidly. Tom chases Jerry up work steps in a zigzag pattern and into the air until Jerry stops him and points to the ground, after which Tom falls through the piped balcony, splitting himself into pieces in mid-air. Jerry jumps down a water duct, and as Tom, seeing him, sticks his mouth out to swallow him, but misses, Jerry bursts through Tom. The duo are then forced to stop for a traffic light before the light turns yellow and both prepare to run, but that's when Tom dashes off too early and gets run over by a large red truck. Tom pursues Jerry around a corner, but is forced by Jerry to stop and fall into a manhole. Jerry flees, but as Tom pops out of another manhole under Jerry, Jerry spins on the manhole cover, twisting Tom's head before Tom stops it with his finger. Jerry, still going around in circles on the manhole, goes on the edge and hits Tom's nose repeatedly, before accidentally dropping it after clutching his nose, flattening Tom's toes and making him feel the pain and screaming. Jerry offers to inflate Tom's toes with a bike pump, but instead ends up poor inflating Tom into a ball before letting go, then sends him rocketing into the air. Tom falls into a pair of Long Johns and is thrown back up to the top of the building, catching a feather boa and a lady's hat on the way back up. A love crazed male cat pursues Tom and kisses him while reciting French poetry as Jerry taunts him by playing a romantic piece on a pretend violin. Tom eventually becomes so irritated that he attacks the love crazed cat and flees. Jerry briefly changes the tune to the William Tell Overture before heading down to the street with Tom giving chase. As Jerry is able to run under a bulldog walking down the street, Tom runs into the bulldog. Tom kisses the bulldog to flee and kicks him in the face. The furious bulldog chases after the cat, missing him several times for trying to bite Tom. Annoyed, Jerry places a manhole cover between Tom and the bulldog, causing the bulldog to run into it and be shaped into a concertina before fleeing. The chase between Tom and Jerry then continues although Tom shakes Jerry's hand to thank him for taking care of the bulldog.

History After the start of the Industrial Revolution woollen and worsted yarns were spun and woollen and worsted cloth woven in the mills and factories that were built in the valley. Rope and twine were also manufactured. In 1830 the township's population was 4,590 and in 1870 it had 1,423 houses and the population had risen to 6,645. A. Talbot & Sons manufactured sweets for many years in a factory with a landmark chimney which was originally a rag mill. The company originated in 1890, selling wholesale groceries from a horse-drawn vehicle, but moved into boiled sweet manufacture when its sweet supplier, John Kay of Flushdyke, retired and gave it his recipes. The company's humbugs, mint imperials, toffees and Yorkshire mixtures became popular throughout Yorkshire and further afield. The Talbots ran the business until the mid-1960s, when it was sold to Victory V lozenges. In the early 20th century, rhubarb was grown in the surrounding area, the region known as the Rhubarb Triangle. Forcing sheds were surrounded by fields of rhubarb plants. Governance Alverthorpe and Thornes was anciently a township which included Westgate Common, Flanshaw, Kirkhamgate and Silcoates in the ecclesiastical parish of Wakefield in the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The town hall was in Green Lane, and it had a workhouse off Light Lane, as well as its own sewage farm and slaughterhouse. After the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, Alverthorpe became one of the 17 constituent parishes of the Wakefield Poor Law Union formed in 1837. Geography Alverthorpe is north west of Wakefield in the valley of the Alverthorpe Beck which supplied water for the mills. The underlying rocks are the coal measures of the South Yorkshire Coalfield. Much of the meadowland between Alverthorpe and the neighbouring village of Wrenthorpe is a designated Local Nature Reserve, comprising 52 acres (25 ha). Economy Bective Mills, which now produces Sirdar hand knitting and rug wool, was established in Alverthorpe over 200 years ago. The company's 1791 Hebble Mill was replaced after being destroyed by fire in 1905. Thomas and Henry Harrap developed the business as Messrs Harrap Bros. Ltd. from 1880 onwards and the buildings and equipment continued to be upgraded and extended throughout the twentieth century. Now operating as Sirdar Spinning Ltd, the mill is one of Britain‚Äôs foremost worsted spinning mills for hand knitting wool. Transport The village is located on the road from Wakefield to Batley. It lies just over a kilometre north of the A638 road from Wakefield to Dewsbury, which intersects with the M1 motorway (at junction 40), about 5 km from Alverthorpe. A railway line ran through the village, and Alverthorpe railway station, close to the village centre, was opened in October 1872 by the Great Northern Railway. In 1923 it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway. The line passed to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948 and closed in April 1954. The railway, bridges and embankments have all now been removed. Education Silcoates School was founded in 1830 as the Northern Congregational School. St Paul's CofE Junior and Infant school is situated in Alverthorpe, with Mr Lee Swift as the current headteacher. Religious sites The stone built Anglican church of St Paul stands at the top of a hill, north of the village. It is a Commissioners' Church built in 1826 to accommodate 1,590 worshippers, at a cost of , (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£6,352,000 in 2016). The graveyard on the south, north and west sides of the church is specifically for church burials; there was a Local Authority graveyard to the south. There was a Methodist chapel in the centre of the village, but the building is now used for business purposes. A Presbyterian congregation met in a disused malt kiln in Flanshaw Lane from 1672, but moved to a new chapel in 1697 which combined the Flanshaw and Wakefield congregations. A Presbyterian burial ground with over a hundred graves remained in the village until the tombstones were removed around 1905 and the ground was used for market gardening.

Geography The A96 runs east to west across Alves and connects the village to the nearest towns of Forres (to the west) and Elgin (to the east). The hamlets of Garrowslack and Hillside lie to the southeast and are made up of isolated farms and houses. Alves Wood to the west of the village is a large conifer plantation. While out walking in 1981, Andrew Bain, a carpenter from Aberdeen, discovered what looked like an ancient spiral ditch, 8 feet deep, 60 feet in diameter. This may be the only one of its kind in the world. The people who planted the trees on the ditch must have thought the ditch was landscaping recently done for the estate on which Alves Wood is situated, or perhaps an unfinished drainage system. Recently there has been a small housing development on the corner of the road leading south out of the village. Just down this road is Royal Alves, comprising the disused railway station and cottages. The railway, (the main line running between Inverness and Aberdeen) is crossed by a small, weak bridge leading to Cloves and Mosstowie. Name The hamlet is named after the use of the railway station and some local buildings by the British Royal Family, as Alves was the nearest railway stop to Gordonstoun School and was close to other Royal Estates in Moray. Community The old village pub, The Crooked Inn has been refurbished and is now a coffee shop with gifts and crafts. The pub was rebranded as Green Gables, a vibrant part of the community and an easy place to stop along the A96. The Crooked Inn Churches Alves has two churches, the old North Church (also known as Mary Kirk) was built in 1769 and is believed to occupy the same site as earlier churches here which records show date back to the 13th century. This church became disused in 1932 although it briefly housed members of the RAF in 1941 whilst they awaited the completion of their quarters at nearby RAF Kinloss. The village cemetery, or kirkyard, is still located at this church. A recent survey by the Moray Burial Ground Research Group found a buried stone dated 1571, one of the earliest found by the group so far. The new South Church was built in 1878 as a Free Church and remains used to this day as part of the Presbytery of Moray. Services are held at 11.30 am on the first Sunday of the month. The bell in the South Church is actually the one removed from the old North Church after it closed.Moray Burial Ground Research Group Education The local Primary School educates around 60 pupils (as of 2018).

The attack was carried out facing the historic town of Miramar. Background Spain aligned itself with France by signing the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796. Britain then targeted both countries' Caribbean colonies. Admiral Sir Henry Harvey's fleet picked up Sir Ralph Abercromby's army in Barbados. Together, they captured Trinidad from the Spanish, before heading for San Juan. Battle On 17 April 1797, Lieutenant- General Sir Ralph Abercromby's fleet of 68 vessels appeared offshore Puerto Rico with a force of 7000, which included German auxiliaries and French √©migr√©s. Two of his frigates then blocked San Juan harbor. The governor, Field Marshal Don Ram√≥n de Castro y Guti√©rrez, had already mobilized his 4000 militia and 200 Spanish garrison troops which, combined with 300 French privateers, 2000 armed peasantry, and paroled prisoners, brought his troop strength up to almost equal that of the British. He also had 376 cannon, 35 mortars, 4 howitzers and 3 swivel guns. Abercromby landed 3000 troops on 18 April and took control of Cangrejos. Castro moved his forces to Escambr√≥n and the Spanish First Line of Defense. Print showing the battlefield. On 21 April, the British started a 7-day artillery duel with the Spanish forts of San Ger√≥nimo and San Antonio, located at the Boquer√≥n Inlet. At the same time, further Spanish forces put pressure on the British positions, the Spanish recaptured Mart√≠n Pe√±a Bridge, while militia led by Sergeant Francisco D√≠az raided behind British lines, bringing back prisoners. Then, on the 29th and 30th, the Spanish crossed the Boquer√≥n Inlet, and forced the British to pull back. Aftermath On 1 May, the Spanish learned the British were gone, leaving behind arms, stores and ammunition. ReferencesAdditional reading *Alonso, Mari√° M. and Milagros Flores (1997).

The epicenter was located south-southeast of Lima at a depth of . The United States Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center reported that it was a Very strong earthquake. The Peruvian government stated that 519 people were killed by the quake. Earthquake This earthquake occurred at the boundary between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, which are converging at a rate of per year. The earthquake occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates, with the South American Plate moving up and seaward over the Nazca Plate. Experts say this kind of earthquake is produced about once every 100 years. Coastal Peru has a history of very large earthquakes. The August 15th shock originated near the source of two previous earthquakes, both in the magnitude 8 range, which occurred in 1908 and 1974. This earthquake is south of the source of a magnitude 8.2 earthquake that occurred in northern Peru on October 17, 1966, and north of a magnitude 8.4 earthquake that occurred in 2001 near Arequipa in southern Peru. The largest earthquake along the coast of Peru was a magnitude 9 that occurred in 1868 in Arica. It produced a tsunami that killed several thousand people along the Peruvian coast and also caused damage in Hawaii. Damage The cities of Pisco, Ica and Chincha Alta in the Ica Region, and San Vicente de Ca√±ete in the Lima Region were most affected. The earthquake was also felt in the capital Lima, where the quake broke windows in downtown sectors of the city, as well as various other Peruvian cities, including Pucallpa, Iquitos, Contamana, Trujillo and Cajamarca. They were attending mass at the time the earthquake started. The city of Pisco, which is southeast of Lima, suffered the most damage, with its buildings about 85% destroyed, and as many as 430 residents died; 148 of those deaths occurred when the cathedral collapsed in the city's main square. On August 16, the government reported 510 deaths. As of August 28, losses were the following in total: * 519 people dead; * 1,366 injured; * 58,581 houses destroyed according to Peruvian Government preliminary assessments; * 13,585 houses affected; * 103 hospitals affected; and * 14 hospitals destroyed according to Peruvian Government preliminary assessments. Main shock and aftershocks map Aftershocks A magnitude 5.8 aftershock occurred at 19:02 local time, centered northeast of Chincha Alta. At 19:19 local time, another 5.9 magnitude aftershock occurred, centered south-southwest of Ica. At least a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 5.0 or greater have been recorded. The day after, survivors who could not be accommodated in local hospitals in Pisco were taken to Lima by airplane, arriving there later that night. On Sunday, August 19, the President of Colombia, √Ålvaro Uribe, arrived in Ica. Tsunami warnings A tsunami warning was issued for Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia and even as far as Hawaii following the earthquakes, but was later cancelled. Some areas of the port city of Callao were evacuated. Tsunami warnings were also made for Panama and Costa Rica, and a tsunami watch was posted for Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico and Honduras. All alerts were cancelled after a wave came ashore. A tsunami did occur on the Peruvian coast. It flooded part of Lima's Costa Verde highway, and much of Pisco's shore. It has been reported that the tsunami reached as high as in the zone of Lagunillas in Pisco neighbourhood's town Paracas. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning, projecting that waves higher than could reach Japan's northern island, Hokkaid≈ç, on Thursday, August 16, around 19:00 UTC (Friday, 04:00 JST). Response The Government of Peru led the response to the earthquake through the National Civil Defence System ( ‚Äì INDECI). It was supported by the military, the private sector (local, national and international) and by contributions from civil society and the international community, including governments, international NGOs and UN agencies. The initial response entailed searching for survivors, evacuating the injured, removing rubble, ensuring security and meeting the needs of affected people. Shelter was provided for those that had lost their homes, latrines were installed, clean water and medical services were established, food aid was distributed and education and psychosocial support was offered, especially to children. A Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP) in the wake of the earthquake raised approximately $37 million, $9.5m of which was provided by the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Despite the considerable relief effort, the initial response was chaotic, marked by a lack of coordination and inadequate information on the needs of people on the ground. It was hindered by a lack of capacity at the regional level and consequent political wrangling (particularly between the local, regional and national governments). Many local authorities were personally attacked for the earthquake, as survivors tried to find close relatives or overcome the traumatic shock of losing so many family members. As time passed the response became better organised, particularly once an OCHA coordination office was established in Pisco and a UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team arrived to support coordination and provide technical advice. Aftermath Several years on, Pisco is still feeling the effects of the earthquake and is struggling to recover. Many families who lost their homes are still living in temporary housing or tents. The social/economic impacts of the quake may take many years to heal.\\"Report\\", Pisco Sin Fronteras Website See also * List of earthquakes in 2007 * List of earthquakes in Peru ReferencesExternal links *Per√∫ earthquake: Videos * * Peru Earthquake Category:Megathrust earthquakes in Peru Category:2007 tsunamis Category:August 2007 events in South America Category:Earthquakes in Peru ","title":"2007 Peru earthquake"},{"id":"12789255","title":"Western Maryland Delegation"},{"id":"12789270","text":"Lothrop Hall at the University of Pittsburgh. Lothrop Hall at University of Pittsburgh Lothrop Hall is a major student dormitory at the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lothrop Hall is located adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) on Lothrop Street near Fifth Avenue, this hill is often referred to as \\"cardiac hill\\" due to its steep grade and its accessibility to medical care. The Hall is made up of 14 floors, some of which are segregated by sex in each wing (north and south). Most rooms in the hall are single occupancy (with sinks), with some double occupancy as well, and even some tripled on floors 2-10. The dorm houses 723 men and women, in addition to a resident director and 15 resident assistants. History Previously known as the Nurses' Residence, Lothrop Hall originally served as a 650-room residence hall for University of Pittsburgh nursing students. Construction was begun in 1950 and completed in May 1953 at a cost of $4.5 million ($ million today). The residence was officially dedicated on May 11, 1953 which intentionally corresponded to the 133rd anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. During the dedication, a brick from the Florence Nightingale Home was presented. During financial hardships of the university in the early 1960s, it was one of five buildings mortgaged as security in 1963. By 1976 its name had been changed to the Lothrop Street Residence. By 1979, it was known by its current moniker, Lothrop Hall. Lothrop Street itself is named for Sylvanus Lothrop, a prominent engineer and businessman who constructed the first locks and several major bridges on the Monongahela River in the 1830s and 1840s. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lothrop Hall was opened to house UPMC doctors and nurses who were working long hours. Facilities There is a fitness center, laundry room, student mail center, and e-mail kiosks in the lobby, as well as a lounge on every floor. Soon there will also be a communal kitchen built. The Hall also contains the Gender and Sexuality Living Learning Community and the Nursing Living Learning Community of the University of Pittsburgh. Lothrop Hall is directly connected, via a skywalk, to the School of Nursing in the Victoria Building and adjoining University of Pittsburgh Medical Center facilities. The Hall is appreciated for its mostly single rooms and the sinks in most rooms. The Hall is criticized, however, by its residents for a lack of air conditioning and for its distance from most main Pitt facilities (such as the Cathedral of Learning and the Dining Facilities). In addition, for many years Lothrop Hall contained medical offices on its lower floors. In 2010, Pitt announced that it had allocated $1.56 million ($ million today) to convert existing office space into 47 additional beds for undergraduate housing in Lothrop. Because of a student housing overflow in 2010, the lounges were converted into 4-person rooms for a total of 52 new beds. In recent years, however, the lounges have been restored to pre-2010 conditions.

The island itself is a cultural melting pot at the crossroads of the Micronesian, Melanesian and Polynesian divisions of the Pacific Ocean, and due to the seafaring nature of traditional Pacific cultures, the indigenous Rotuman have adopted or share many aspects of its multifaceted culture with its Melanesian, Micronesian and Polynesian neighbours. Ancestors It is believed by many academics that the first inhabitants of the island were probably the ancient seafaring people the Lapita, followed by waves of Micronesians and finally by Polynesians, giving Rotumans a similar but thoroughly distinct language, cultural heritage and metaphysical understanding to that of their preceding parent cultures. Rotuman mythology typically points to Samoans as the first people to inhabit the island of Rotuma. The most prominent creation myth speaks of Raho, a Samoan prince who, shamed by his family, sought a new home with his daughters. He travelled across the Pacific in his canoe, and when he came to a spot with two protruding rocks, poured baskets of sand from Samoa over the rocks, forming the islands of Rotuma. Physical appearance By most accounts, Rotumans are said to resemble most closely their Polynesian neighbours from Samoa and Tonga. Rotumans are generally noted as being of a light olive to medium brown complexion, with generally wavy black hair, although some individuals have naturally copper-ginger colouring to their hair. Traditionally, men kept their hair shoulder length or longer; however, post-colonial Rotumans look unfavorably on this. They are on average shorter than their Tongan or Samoan neighbours, and less prone to obesity. The appearance of some individuals more clearly indicates Micronesian (particularly Gilbertese) heritage evidenced by darker skin and curlier hair, and some people show decidedly Asian facial characteristics, such as long, oval-shaped eyes and straight hair. Rotuman appearance is further difficult to categorise as many Rotuman people can point to at least one white ancestor (usually from England or the United States) since European arrival. This can be attributed to the high ratio of whites to Rotumans in the early days of exposure to white people, when Rotuma became a haven to mutineers and stow-aways who appreciated the beauty of the island and found prosperity as the trading advisers to local chiefs when dealing with Occidental ships. Rotuman society Rotuman society is one based more on democracy than most other Pacific cultures. While somewhat stratified, Rotuman culture maintains no class distinctions such as in Fijian or Tongan systems, no noble caste, and no sense of primogeniture. The strength of Rotuman society is the high communal nature of activities. Every Rotuman person maintains a strong affinity for their community, and this is evidenced through participation in large-scale projects (kato'aga) and communal property, such as for agriculture. Rotuman society can be divided, in the broadest sense, into seven itu'u, or districts, each of which is headed up by a male chief, referred to as \\"gagaj 'es itu'u\\". It is his role to guide the community's communal works, and represent his constituents as a member of the Rotuma Island Council (RIC). Rotumans as a Pacific people On account of their location, the Rotuman people are often left uncategorised in terms of which Pacific ethnic group they belong to. Rotumans, by most accounts, physically most resemble the Polynesian people of Samoa and Tonga, the two races commonly attributed in Rotuman mythology as the true parent civilisations. But Rotuman musical tradition prior to European and Central Polynesian influence consisted primarily of chanting similar to traditional Tahitian or Maori styles (see Tautoga and Himene), both very distant cultures. In addition, many of characteristics of the Rotuman language distance it from Polynesian neighbours and align it more closely with Melanesian (particularly Western Fijian) languages.

Rowing career Storey at the medal ceremony of the coxless four at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich Storey was born in 1939 in Wairoa, New Zealand. After having received an invitation to the Henley Royal Regatta, he won the inaugural Prince Philip Challenge Cup regatta in 1963 in Henley-on-Thames. That year, the Henley regatta was regarded as the event that came closest to a world championship. Darien Boswell, Peter Masfen and Alistair Dryden made up the other rowers, and Bob Page was the cox. The same coxed four team then went to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where they placed a disappointing eighth. For the 1968 Summer Olympics, New Zealand qualified an eight and had a pool of four rowers and a cox as a travelling reserve; Storey was part of this reserve. Preparations were held in Christchurch at Kerr's Reach on the Avon River. The reserve rowers were unhappy with the \\"spare parts\\" tag and felt that they were good enough to perhaps win a medal if put forward as a coxed four. The manager, Rusty Robertson, commented about them that they were \\"the funniest looking crew you've ever seen\\". There were stern discussions with the New Zealand selectors. In a training run, the coxed four was leading the eight over the whole race. In the end, the reserve rowers got their way and New Zealand entered both the coxed four and the coxed eight. Storey won the Olympic coxed four event along with Dick Joyce, Ross Collinge, Warren Cole and Simon Dickie (cox); this was New Zealand's first gold medal in rowing. At the time, he was a 27-year-old carpet layer, whose wife was about to give birth to their first child. He was the only member of the crew to have previously rowed outside New Zealand. Storey competed at the 1971 European Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark, and came fourth with the coxed four, alongside Noel Mills, Ross Collinge, Raymond Barry, and Peter Lindsay as cox. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich he teamed with Dick Tonks, Collinge and Mills to win the Silver medal in the coxless four. Later career Storey was manager of the successful New Zealand rowing teams from 1982 to 1986. He managed the 1982 and 1983 New Zealand eight, the country's rowing teams at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the teams at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. He later coached Baradene College of the Sacred Heart's rowing squad. In the 1983 New Year Honours, Storey was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rowing. Storey's medal-winning 1968 rowing crew was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. The boat that won the 1963 Prince Philip Challenge Cup, bought in England for ¬£300, is on display at the Auckland Rowing Club. Death Storey died in Auckland on 6 March 2017, after a recent diagnosis of motor neurone disease.

Biography Alexander Spendiarov was born on 1 November (as 20 October) 1871 in Kakhovka, province of Tavrik (modern Ukraine). His artistic abilities were formed in early childhood. He inherited his musical abilities from his mother who played piano. When Alexander Spendiarov was seven he wrote a waltz. In 1890 he went to Moscow and studied for one year in the Natural Sciences faculty of Moscow University, and then in 1895 he graduated from the Law faculty. At the same time he continued his violin classes. In 1896 Alexander Spendiarov went to St. Petersburg to show his compositions to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, who greatly admired his music and encouraged him to turn deeper into his people's folklore. From 1896 to 1900 he took private composition lessons with Rimsky-Korsakov. According to Alexander Glazunov, \\"Rimsky-Korsakov was perfectly satisfied with the results of Alexander Spendiarov's work and considered him a serious, talented composer with a great flair for composition\\".Sovietskaya muzika, 1939, #9-10 Spendiarov was awarded the Glinka prize three times for his three works: the symphonic picture \\"Three Palms\\" in 1908, the legend \\"Preacher Beda\\" in 1910 and the melody declamation \\"We‚Äôll Have a Rest\\" in 1912. His symphonic pieces, songs and romances, choral works, and musico-declamatory pieces earned him high marks among audiences and professional musicians. Spendiarov led concerts in Kharkov, Odessa, Moscow, Petersburg, Doni-Rostov and New Nakhijevan. He spent much of his time in Yalta and Sudak. While he was living in Crimea, Spendiarov met Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Shalyapin. Alexander Glazunov was also a guest at his house. left In 1910 Spendiarov became a member of Yalta's Russian Musical Company. The symphonic poem \\"Three Palms\\" occupies a special place among Spendiarov's symphonic compositions. With its poetic tone, picturesque nature, and bright coloring, it resembles the oriental program works of the Mighty Handful.Alexander Shahverdyan, A. Spendiaryan, Yerevan, 1971, p. 30 Spendiaryan toured abroad performing this piece in Berlin, Copenhagen, New York, and elsewhere. Other works by Spendiarov include \\"Concert Prelude\\", \\"Concert Waltz\\", and \\"Etude of Jewish Themes\\", Cantabile and Prelude for string quartet, Baracarolle, Minuet, Scherzo, romances and vocal instrumental works. \\"Oh Rose\\" (Aye Vart) was a very famous classical piece in Russia and the former USSR. In 1916 Spendiarov performed in Tiflis, where he met poet Hovhannes Tumanian and decided to write an opera based on \\"The Capture of Tmkabert\\" poem. In 1916 the libretto of Almast opera was ready, and Spendiarov began work on the opera, and finished the opera's vocal score in 1923. He continued his work on the instrumentation right up to his death. The instrumentation of the fourth act of \\"Almast\\" was completed by composer Maximilian Steinberg. On 10 December 1924 Spendiarov, newly arrived in Yerevan from Russia, conducted an 18-member orchestra consisting of conservatory professors and students. This inaugural concert proved that Armenia had the potential to sustain a symphony orchestra. The following year, on 20 March 1925, Professor Arshak Adamian, Rector of the Yerevan Conservatory, led the first concert of the then newly founded symphony orchestra. At the time, Spendiarov accurately predicted, \\"There will come a time, when our yet modest student orchestra will proudly bear the honorary title of the Armenian State Orchestra.\\" The \\"Yerevan Sketches (Etudes)\\" (1925) comprise some of the best work of Spendiarov's last years. The sketches are proceeded by numerous notations of folk themes, and experiments in their arrangement and harmonization. In the sketches, Spendiarov introduced the dhol and the dayira, two Armenian musical instruments. In 1926 the Soviet Armenian government awarded Spendiarov the title of People's Artist on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his achievements in musical and public life. Spendiarov died after a short illness in Yerevan in 1928. He is buried in the yard of Yerevan State Opera and ballet Theatre. A death mask of his face and right hand is exhibited in his House Museum. \\"What he gave us is immortal\\", said poet Avetik Isahakyan about Spendiarov. Composer Aram Khatchaturian said of his predecessor, \\"I am profoundly convinced that Spendiarov and Komitas are the patriarchs of Armenian classical music; they have charted the principal trends in the evolution of Armenian musical art for many decades to come.\\" Spendiarov and Aram Khatchaturian met for the first time in Moscow. Spendiarov appreciated the potential in the young composer. Personal life The Yerevan Opera Theater named after Alexander Spendiarov Spendiarov had a brother, Leonid, and three sisters. When Leonid died, Spendiarov married the widow to prevent their children from growing up fatherless. Her name was Valentina; she was a relative to Hovhannes Aivazovsky. They had three daughters. Museum In 1967, the Alexander Spendiarov House Museum was established in the house where the composer lived during the last years of his life (the second floor apartment at 21 Nalbandyan Street, Yerevan). The Soviet Armenian government had given him a room in the communal apartment in 1926. Spendiarov used to enjoy the view of Mount Ararat from the small balcony. The museum has recreated the genuine atmosphere of the composer's study and presents the composer's personal belongings, numerous documents and other belongings. Spendiarov's portrait by Martiros Saryan painted in 1967, a poster announcing the opera, \`Almast,' as the first performance to open the Opera building in Yerevan (1933), two of his violins and a piano are displayed in the apartment.

His ancestors lived here and he used the family croft as a holiday home. He died in suspicion circumstances while en route here. Geography Map of Loch Alsh with Ardelve at start of the head reach The road from Invergarry to Invermoriston, today the A87 road, passes through the village and once terminated at the ferry station (today the road crosses the water by a bridge). It connects the village to Auchtertyre in the west. In 1882 it had a post office and a school. The village is divided into Upper and Lower Ardelve. Important landmarks on the road to Ardelve are the Loch Cluanie, the Seven Sisters of Kintail, the Kintail Lodge Hotel and Loch Duich and Balmacara Gardens of the National Trust for Scotland (4 miles to the west of the village). A forest area with historic linkage to Bonnie Prince Charlie's hiding in 1746, is the Glen Shiel with Glen Affric Forest to the north of the village. Avifauna During bird sighting tours to the Loch Alsh and the surrounding areas, sparrowhawk, whimbrel, house martin, sedge warbler and grebes have been sighted at Ardelve. Grebes were also sighted at Ardelve Point. Little grebes have also been seen all along the coast from Ardelve to Balmacara Bay. It is also inferred that little grebes seen at Ardelve in July or August could be migrants from the continent or Scandinavia.

Published in 2005 by Cornell University Press, the text claims that the NLRA guarantees that employees under that Act have the right to bargain collectively through minority unions‚Äîbut only on a members-only basis‚Äîin workplaces where there is not an established majority union, notwithstanding that the present practice and general understanding of the law is that only majority-union employees are entitled to engage in collective bargaining on an exclusivity basis. Contracts resulting from such minority-union bargaining would apply to union members only, not to other employees. Structure of the book The Blue Eagle At Work contains three parts: 1) An overview of collective bargaining law in the U.S.; 2) The legal framework in which members-only collective bargaining could occur; and 3) How unions could implement and strengthen members-only collective bargaining and use it as a strategic organizing tool. Part I Part I of the book addresses collective bargaining law in the United States. It is broken down into four chapters. Chapter One provides a historical overview of the rise of membership-based collective bargaining in the period prior to federal recognition of the right to bargain collectively, the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and the enactment and legal meaning of Section 7(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). Attention is paid to The Conference Board survey of labor relations conducted in November 1933.Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 26-31. Morris points out that the survey results indicate that members-only recognition and bargaining were common when the NLRA was enacted. Chapter Two provides an in-depth and exceedingly detailed history of legislative attempts to enact improvements in federal labor law. The chapter provides an extensive analysis of the nine legislative drafts of Senator Robert F. Wagner (D-NY) for his 1934 bill. The chapter also discusses the implementation of the NIRA under first the National Recovery Administration (NRA) and then the National Labor Board and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Morris documents how the concepts of representational exclusivity and majoritarianism were developed in cases such as Denver Tramway Corporation, 1 NLB 63 (1934)Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 36-40. and Houde Engineering Corp., 1 NLRB (old) 35 (1934)Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 48-52. and cites cases showing that employers refusing to bargain with a minority union violated the NIRA.National Lock Co., 1 NLB (Part 2) 15 (1934); Bee Line Bus Co., 1 NLB (Part 2) 24 (1934); Eagle Rubber Co., 1 NLB (Part 2) 31 (1934). Chapter Three is an extensive consideration of the legislative history of Wagner Act. The three drafts of the Act, committee hearings, floor debates, and committee reports are closely examined to tease out the meanings of the changes made. Morris uncovered one feature that required no teasing, a \\"smoking gun\\" that shows that congress clearly intended that collective bargaining would not be confined to majority unions only, to wit, the deliberate rejection of a version of the duty-to-bargain contained in Section 8(a)(5) that would have so confined the bargaining process. Instead, the present wording, which does not so limit the bargaining obligation, was selected.Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 62-63. Morris notes that the Senate committee and debate statements disparaging minority or plurality bargaining all referred to bargaining after a majority representative had been chosen. None referred to bargaining before majority selection, which was not a controversial issue. Chapter Four contains the history of members-only minority-union organizing and bargaining during the decade following passage of the NLRA and what followed. Morris notes: :For several years following the passage of the Wagner Act in 1935, there was never any legal question raised as to the scope of its bargaining requirements, either as to minority-union members-only bargaining or majority-union exclusivity bargaining. Both types of bargaining had prevailed earlier under the Blue Eagle administration of Section 7(a) of the NIRA and both were now widely accepted under the new NLRA.Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, p. 81. Morris points to the organizing history of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee and United Auto Workers as prime examples of members-only organizing and collective bargaining, and cites statistics from Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) and Twentieth Century Fund reports which document the widespread use and acceptance of members-only contracts. Morris concludes that several factors led unions to become dependent on representational elections. The NLRB itself favored representational elections, \\"for they provided a relatively simple pattern for bargaining-unit determinations, conduct of elections, and certification of majorities for exclusive union representation.\\"Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, p. 87. The conflict between the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations refocused attention away from organizing. The rapid expansion of unions during World War II and the massive waves of strikes which came after the war continued to divert attention away from organizing. Morris also argues that the Taft-Hartley Act led to \\"the phenomenon of unions becoming busily engaged in a multitude of legal defensive actions generated by the numerous union restrictions that the new law had created.\\"Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, p. 88. \\"As a consequence,\\" Morris concludes, \\"only a few years after Taft- Hartley, the NLRB and its union and employer constituents were routinely viewing majority-union bargaining‚Äîwhich was certainly the ultimate goal intended by the Act‚Äîas the only bargaining contemplated by the Act. Although unions had originally favored NLRB elections out of sheer convenience, their reliance on the election process had now become routine, with attendant misunderstanding of the true scope of bargaining offered by the statute. ... Thus was born the latter-day conventional wisdom that assumes that majority- union representation is the sine qua non of collective bargaining.\\"Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, p. 88 (emphasis in original). Part II Part II of The Blue Eagle At Work examines the legal interpretation of Sections 1, 7, 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), 8(a)(5), and 9(a) of the NLRA, and concludes that Morris' construction of the law is consistent with the statutory requirements and also with existing legal rulings and treaty obligations. Part II consists of five chapters. Chapter Five engages in a Plain-Meaning-Rule construction of the language of Section 7(a) and the NLRA. Morris examines Section 7, Section 8(a)(1), Section 9(a), and Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRB for their plain meaning, and concludes they guarantee the right of all employees to bargain collectively, whether before or after majority-union designation. Bargaining before such selection must be for members-only through a union of the employees' choice; bargaining after majority selection must be for all employees in the bargaining unit through the selected union only. This chapter provides the heart of Morris' thesis, for although it is supported by legislative history (and constitutional and international law), its primary basis is contained in the unambiguous text of the statute. The critical language is short, simple, and of clear meaning. Fourteen words in Section 7, borrowed verbatim from Section 7(a) of the NIRA, provide that \\"Employees shall have the right...to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing....\\" This is guaranteed and enforced by Section 8(a)(1) and reinforced by Section 8(a)(5) (which by its clear wording and its \\"smoking gun\\" legislative history requires bargaining both before and after majority selection). The only limitation on this bargaining right is a conditional limitation on the choice of representatives, but not on the duty to bargain. This limitation is contained in Section 9(a) which does not operate unless there is a majority representative, in which event the selected majority union becomes the exclusive representative. Morris points out that both the Supreme Court and the NLRB have approved minority and members only bargaining and resulting members-only contractsMorris, The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 94-97. where they exist voluntarily, and that the time is now ripe for a decision confirming that such bargaining is enforceable where there is not yet a majority representative. This universal concept of collective bargaining conforms to the \\"policy of the United States\\" expressed in Section 1 of the Act, which policy was expressly reconfirmed in the Taft-Hartley Act.Morris, The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 97-98. Chapter Six examines several rulings by the Supreme Court which are often cited as supportive of majority-only collective bargaining. Morris reviews the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of association, and how the concepts of indirect state action (as elucidated in NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), and Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516 (1960), and the test of indirect state action as outlined in Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982)), direct state action and compelling government interest protect and affirm members-only minority-union collective bargaining. Morris also discusses three key Supreme Court rulings‚ÄîNLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490 (1979), Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568 (1988) and Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735 (1988)‚Äîand concludes that they conform to the concept of members-only bargaining as well. In Chapter Seven, Morris discusses how the Supreme Court's doctrine of \\"administrative deference\\" (outlined in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)) could provide another avenue for judicial articulation of his thesis. Although it is a basic premise of his book that the defined duty to bargain is mandatory under the Act, if the NLRB were to find the applicable language ambiguous it could and should exercise its discretionary authority and require bargaining in accordance with the thesis‚Äîwhich under step two of the Chevron doctrine would be confirmed by a reviewing federal court even if the court were in disagreement, for the determination would not be \\"arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\\" In Chapter Eight, Morris outlines U.S. obligations under international law. He points out that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labour Organization's 1998 Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work both compel a construction of the NLRA which protects members-only collective bargaining.The concept is one advocated by the AFL-CIO as well during a series of rallies on Human Rights Day in December 2005. See: Rodriguez, \\"Union Supporters Picket White House,\\" Associated Press, December 9, 2005; Greenhouse, \\"Labor to Press for Workers' Right to Join Unions,\\" New York Times, December 9, 2005; \\"Labor Group to Celebrate World Human Rights Day,\\" Huntington Herald-Dispatch, December 10, 2005. Chapter Nine discusses the current state of NLRB and court rulings which might appear to exclude members-only minority-union collective bargaining. Morris identifies eight \\"false majority\\"Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, p. 159. cases in which the NLRB or a court appears to rule out bargaining with a minority union, but in each of those cases the union was either directly or indirectly seeking to represent the entire bargaining unit as a Section 9(a) majority representative, hence the designation of \\"false-majority\\" cases; in none of them did the union actually engage in members-only representation and bargaining. Morris also dismisses four \\"group-dealing\\"Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, p. 162. cases, in which the question was whether an employer has a duty to meet and bargain with groups of nonunion employees under the \\"mutual aid or protection\\" language of Section 7. But once more, Morris distinguishes the cases by noting that in none of the cases did the union engage in members-only representation or bargaining as defined by the \\"collective bargaining\\" language of Section 7, which is the text that provides minority unions with the right to bargain. Part III The three chapters of Part III discuss how unions might go about reaffirming the right to engage in members-only minority-union collective bargaining. Chapter Ten discusses using the NLRB and the courts to reaffirm the minority-union concept. Morris outlines how unions might use NLRB representational procedures or direct court rulings to revitalize the concept of members-only unions. Morris also discusses novel approaches, such as direct legal action against the NLRB's General Counsel and picketing for members-only recognition.Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 173-181. Other approaches he suggests include amending a Section 8(a)(3) complaint (made to the NLRB when an employee is discharged for engaging in protected union activity, a fairly common occurrence in NLRB representation electionsCastillo, \\"Workers at Labor Forum Recount Tales of Abuse by Their Employers,\\" Austin American-Statesman, October 19, 2005; Gaffney, \\"American Laws Violate Workers' Rights,\\" Detroit News, December 16, 2005; Knowles, \\"Report Says Deck Stacked Against Union Organization,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, December 7, 2005; Landrum, \\"American Rights at Work to Investigate Abuses at Workplace,\\" Associated Press, October 14, 2005; Lester, \\"AFL-CIO Leaders Recruit Groups to Get Out Word About Workers' Plight,\\" Associated Press, October 25, 2005.) to establish the fact of members-only unionization and to force the employer to bargain.Discharges are a mandatory subject of bargaining under the NLRA. See Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 181-182. He also advocates petitioning the NLRB to engage in administrative rulemaking on the subject, which is the process now pending before the Board in two rulemaking petitions. Chapter Eleven discussed how unions should establish members-only minority unions. Morris discussed the role of the union steward, Weingarten rights, employer notification, and how to force employers to engage in collective bargaining. Chapter Twelve concludes the work with a vision of industrial democracy. Morris argues that members-only unions represent the best way to revitalize the American labor movement. He outlines how workplace democracy is stunted without collective bargaining, argues that productivity is greatly enhanced when unions exist, and that strong unions strengthen social capital inside and outside the workplace. Appendices The book contains two substantive appendices. The first is an appendix to Chapter Two. It contains all the relevant provisions of the proposed 1934 \\"Labor Disputes\\" bill and the proposed 1934 \\"National Adjustment Bill\\" substitute for S. 2926. Both proposed bills are crucial to understanding the evolving concept of collective bargaining which led to the Wagner Act. The second appendix is meant to accompany Chapter Three. This appendix contains all relevant portions of the 1935 drafts of the National Labor Relations Act (S. 1958). The drafts provide the critical textual evidence for Morris' legislative history and plain-meaning interpretive arguments. Scholarly history The scholarly pedigree of The Blue Eagle At Work is somewhat lengthy. Although many in the labor movement saw the treatise as novel, the concept, as Morris noted, was recognized in a law review article as early as 1936Latham, \\"Legislative Purpose and Administrative Policy under the National Labor Relations Act,\\" George Washington Law Review, 1936, pp. 433, 453 & 456 n. 65. and was discussed generally as early as 1975.Schatzki, \\"Majority Rule, Exclusive Representation, and the Interests of Individual Workers: Should Exclusivity Be Abolished?\\", University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 1975. Morris himself published an early version of his thesis in 1994.Morris, \\"A Blueprint for Reform of the National Labor Relations Act,\\" Administrative Law Journal of the American University, 1994, pp. 517, 554-555. But the most prominent and complete statement of the legal theory came from Professor Clyde Summers in 1990 (which Morris acknowledges in his book).Summers, \\"Unions Without Majority - A Black Hole?\\", Chicago-Kent Law Review, 1990. The \\"Blue Eagle\\" concept of members-only unions has received additional attention since the early 1990s. Legal scholars addressed the merits of the theory, and discussed its application to a variety of other \\"pre-union\\" organizations such as worker centers.Carlson, \\"The Origin and Future of Exclusive Representation in American Labor Law,\\" Duquesne Law Review, 1992; Hyde, et al., \\"After Smyrna: Rights and Powers of Unions That Represent Less Than A Majority,\\" Rutgers Law Review, 1993; Finkin, \\"The Road Not Taken: Some Thoughts On Nonmajority Employee Representation,\\" Chicago-Kent Law Review, 1993; Estlund, \\"Rebuilding the Law of the Workplace In An Era of Self-Regulation,\\" Columbia Law Review, 2005. Reviews The Blue Eagle At Work was highly anticipated by many labor scholars, labor attorneys and activists in the labor movement.

Some of the reviews expressed greater or lesser degrees of skepticism about the likelihood of Morris' thesis being adopted but praised the work highly. One reviewer wrote: :There is the potential for private-sector US industrial relations to undergo the biggest change since 1947, or even 1935--all without any new laws or overturning any legal precedents. Not only will many workers obtain union representation when a majority of their co-workers are not interested, but the entire industrial relations environment might be altered. Morris shows how Senator Wagner--the father of the NLRA--viewed minority-unionism as a stepping stone to full-fledged majority unionism, especially as the benefits of union representation are vividly demonstrated to skeptical co-workers. The organizing process can thus change as unions can focus their attention on building organizations rather than winning elections.Budd, \\"Book Review: The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace,\\" British Journal of Industrial Relations, June 2007, p. 328. Legal analysis The book was widely praised for its scholarship. \\"[It] is a remarkably compelling, innovative stroke, one which should be taken very seriously by those who wish to see any kind of renaissance for workers' collective power,\\" wrote one reviewer, whose assessment was typical.True, \\"Review Essay: The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace: Professor Charles J. Morris,\\" Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, 2005, p. 189. Almost all of the labor law professors who have publicly commented on the members-only minority-union bargaining thesis have agreed that the Morris thesis is legally correct. Twenty-five of those professors joined in a letter to the NLRB on August 14, 2007, endorsing the rulemaking petition that was proposing adoption of such a rule. They stated to the Board that :(A) The plain and unambiguous language of the Act guarantees that in workplaces where there is not currently a Section 9(a) majority-exclusive representative in an appropriate bargaining unit, employees have an enforceable right to bargain collectively through minority unions of their own choosing, but for their employee members only. :(B) Such reading of the statute is fully supported by clear and consistent legislative history.http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/laborprof_blog/2007/03/morris_craver_c/html. Nevertheless, Morris' theory has been challenged. Although a few of the reviewers disagreed with some of Morris' secondary conclusions, none disagreed with his critical reading of the statutory language on which he relies. One supportive reviewer, Judge John True, wrote: \\"Nothing in the actual language of the NLRA, in its legislative history, in NLRB or court cases, in the constitution, in international law, or indeed in common sense or sound policy suggests that unions could not still use this 'members-only' bargaining approach.\\" He reads the language of Section 7 as \\"all inclusive,\\" explaining that :It does not by its terms limit in any way the rights it confers, including \\"activities for the purpose of collective bargaining,\\" to those who have designated a union as their exclusive representative. The clear language of the statute confers this right on all employees. So as a matter of simple logic, a minority group of employees is entitled to engage in \\"activities for the purpose of collective bargaining:\\" including, presumably, the right to make their employer respond to its bargaining demands.True, \\"Review Essay: The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace,\\" Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, 2005, pp. 184 & 190. Morris never denied, indeed emphasized, that the ultimate objective of the Act was majority-based collective bargaining.Morris, The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 69 & 101. Nevertheless, minority-union bargaining was always protected as a stepping- stone stage of bargaining that could be expected to lead to majority bargaining, which is exactly what happened during the decade following passage of the Act. None of the facts reported by historian Tomlins,Tomlins, The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960, 1985. on whom one historical criticism was erroneously basedSlater, \\"Do Unions Representing A Minority Of Employees Have The Right To Bargain Collectively: A Review Of Charles Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2005, p. 390. indicated the contrary; indeed The Blue Eagle at Work cited Tomlins.Morris, The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, pp. 250 note 89 and 350 notes 139 & 141. Legislative History and Statutory Text Morris' interpretation of the NLRA's legislative history and statutory text has come under fire from one scholar in a brief review in a Canadian journal. He presented his opposing opinion, but without any explanatory analysis or cited authority, as follows: :Morris's argument involves close reading of the pre-NLRA administrative cases, and then the successive drafts of the NLRA. ... I was not convinced. While I agree that the NLRB should have required employers to meet with organizations representing only a fraction of their workforce, I do not find a clear Congressional command that requires the Board to do so. Morris shows that, at several stages in the drafting process, such clear language was briefly part of the bill, but was later deleted as part of a general process of simplifying language and delegating detail to the new NLRB. Drafters similarly rejected a proposal that would clearly have restricted the duty to bargain to majority representatives. I read this history to mean that Congress delegated this issue, along with many others, to the new NLRB.Hyde, \\"Reviews/Comptes Rendus: Charles J. Morris, The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace,\\" Labour/Le Travail, Spring 2006, p. 230. One need only read the statute, however, with or without this history, to conclude that because of the lack of ambiguity in the language, step one of the Chevron doctrine mandates that \\"[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\\"Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). The pending rulemaking petition by the Steelworkers Union, et al., now awaiting the NLRB's decision, also notes the following regarding the clear statutory language on which the Morris thesis is based: :in workplaces where the majority/unit condition in Section 9(a) is not activated, the text of the Act guarantees that employees shall have the right to bargain collectively through a minority-union of their choice on a nonexclusive, i.e., members-only, basis; and an employer who refuses to bargain collectively with that union commits an unfair labor practice in violation of Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5). This statutory text is not Humpty- Dumpty language that naysayers might say means whatever they \\"choose it to mean.\\" Rather, it is plain, unambiguous language that means exactly what it says--the same kind of broad and sweeping language that Chief Justice John Roberts referred to when, as a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, he accurately observed in two separate decisions that \\"[t]he Supreme Court has consistently instructed that statutes written in broad, sweeping language should be given broad, sweeping application.\\"In re England, Secretary of the Navy, 375 F.3d 1159, 1179 (D.C. Cir. 2004); Consumers Electronics Ass'n v. Federal Communications Commission, 347 F.3d 291, 298 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Additional evidence indicates that the Congress did intend the NLRA to protect members-only unions, particularly the historical \\"smoking gun\\" of Congress having rejected specific language that would have limited bargaining to Section 9(a) majority unions only. The \\"false majority\\" cases Morris' discussion of the \\"false majority\\" cases has also been criticized. In a somewhat laudatory piece, Judge John True concluded that Morris read too much into otherwise ambiguous decisions: :A number of the other cases [Morris] characterizes as \\"false majority\\" claims feature ambiguities similar to Mooresville Cotton Mills. To be sure, none of them squarely disposes of Morris' interpretation, but neither does any seem like the \\"myth\\" and dicta that he says stand in the way of minority bargaining rights.True, \\"Review Essay: The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace: Professor Charles J. Morris,\\" Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, 2005, p.195 (footnotes omitted). However, in a response article, Morris pointed out the errors in Judge True's reading of the Moorsville Cotton Mills case.Morris, \\"Review Essay: Minority Union Collective Bargaining: A Commentary on John True's Review Essay on The Blue Eagle at Work, and a Reply to Skeptics Regarding Members-Only Bargaining Under the NLRA,\\" Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, 2006, pp. 179, 183-186. Constitutional and International Law Commentary Although Morris bases his thesis on the text of the NLRA, which is supported by legislative history, he also contends that constitutional and international law provide additional support. Some have argued that Morris' constitutional arguments based on freedom of association are not valid under current case law. One commentator takes issue with Morris' claim that collective bargaining under the NLRA constitutes direct or indirect state action,Slater, \\"Do Unions Representing A Minority of Employees Have The Right To Bargain Collectively?: A Review of Charles Morris' 'The Blue Eagle At Work',\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2005, p. 396-397. and also points out that Morris' reliance on international law is a weak reed. As Morris himself admits, \\"it is widely known and fully documented that the United States does not comply with ILO standards regarding the right of workers to engage in collective bargaining.\\"Slater, \\"Do Unions Representing A Minority of Employees Have The Right To Bargain Collectively?: A Review of Charles Morris' 'The Blue Eagle At Work,'\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2005, p. 399, quoting Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work, p. 151. Morris also admits that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights does not permit private citizens to sue in U.S. courts,Slater, \\"Do Unions Representing A Minority of Employees Have The Right To Bargain Collectively?: A Review of Charles Morris' 'The Blue Eagle At Work',\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2005, p. 399, quoting Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work, p. 146. but he explains, however, that the language of the Covenant and the features of its ratification permit raising the issue in NLRB cases.Morris, The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace, 2005, p. 146. Despite his criticism of Morris' constitutional and international law analyses, this reviewer agreed with Morris' primary analysis based on the wording of the NLRA, stating that \\"Section 7 protects concerted activities in various contexts by employees where there is no exclusive representative, and the language of section 7 itself does seem to provide for MUB [i.e., minority union bargaining].\\"Slater, \\"Do Unions Representing a Minority of Employees Have the Right to Bargain Collectively?: A Review of Charles Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2005, p. 403. Pragmatic issues Several reviewers have pointed out that Morris' prescriptions for reaffirming members-only minority-union collective bargaining contain problems of their own. They applaud Morris for crafting some inventive and aggressive strategies and tactics. One problem some commentators have noted is that members-only collective bargaining creates problems of competition within the workplace. Employers may not respond favorably when a proposed solution will force them to alter work rules and personnel policies across the entire workforce. As one reviewer argued: \\"Bargaining over wages for members only or a grievance procedure for members only may be possible. Many subjects will have an effect upon non-members and potentially all other non-represented employees. Such issues may adversely impact non-members who do not want representation.\\"Rosenfeld, \\"Review Essay: Worker Centers: Emerging Labor Organizations - Until They Confront the National Labor Relations Act,\\" Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, 2006, p. 506. On the other hand, the same problems‚Äîif they are problems‚Äîcould also exist where voluntary recognition and bargaining occurs with a members- only minority union, which is unquestionably legal under the Act. That was conceded by the General Counsel in the Dick's case Advice Memorandum.Dick's Sporting Goods Advice Memorandum, Case 6-CA-34821, June 22, 2006, p.11. Action by the NLRB The NLRB has not yet considered or acted upon Morris' thesis. In 2006, the United Steelworkers organized a members-only minority union at Dick's Sporting Goods, a sporting-goods retailer located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Director of the NLRB's Region 6 asked the NLRB General Counsel's Division of Advice for guidance and received an \\"Advice Memorandum\\",A legal memorandum giving guidance on a specific case, almost always involving a difficult or novel issue of law, in response to a query from the Regional Director whether to (a) find merit to a charge and issue a complaint in the case, or (b) find the charge lacks merit and dismiss it. When the General Counsel instructs a Regional Director to find merit and issue a complaint, the legal analysis set forth in the Advice Memorandum becomes the theory on which the General Counsel litigates the case, and the Memorandum is not public information until the case concludes. When the General Counsel instructs a Regional Director to find a charge lacks merit and dismiss it, dismissal will be based on the legal analysis in the Memorandum and the Memorandum will be publicly available shortly thereafter. Since the General Counsel investigates charges and presents those that it judges possess merit to the five-member Board (or its Administrative Law Judges) for adjudication, an Advice Memorandum does not reflect the views of the Board, but indicates the types of issues the General Counsel is likely to present to the Board. on the legal merits of the case. In the Advice Memorandum, Associate General Counsel Barry J. Kearney of the Division of Advice rejected the argument that the NLRA contained an affirmative duty to bargain with members-only minority unions.Dick's Sporting Goods, Advice Memorandum, Case 6-CA-34821, June 22, 2006. That Memorandum has been challenged by the two rulemaking petitions now pending before the NLRB. In his quarterly review of the activities of the Office of the General Counsel, Meisburg reiterated his conclusion that the NLRA does not require employers to bargain with members-only minority unions. :When Congress enacted Section 9(a), which sets forth the majority rule, it explicitly rejected other forms of representation, including plural and proportional representation, which were permitted under Section 7(a) of the NIRA. Statements by the Act's sponsors show that they did not intend to require employee representation by minority-supported unions because it could not lead to a working system of collective bargaining. ... In the early enforcement of the Act, the Board held that an employer may recognize and bargain with a minority, members-only union, as long as the employer does not extend that union exclusive status. Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, 4 NLRB 71, 110 (1937), enfd. 95 F.2d 390 (2d Cir.), modified on other grounds 305 U.S. 197 (1938). However, nothing in the statutory language, legislative history of the Act, or decisions interpreting the Act, establish an employer's duty to do so. ... Rather, the statutory language, the legislative history, and Board and Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Act all mandate the conclusion that an employer is not required to bargain with a union seeking to bargain as a minority representative for its members.Meisburg, Memorandum GC 07-02: Report on Case Developments, April through August 2006, December 15, 2006. That assertion was challenged by the rulemaking petition of the Steelworkers Union, et al., now pending before the NLRB,Greenhouse, \\"Seven Unions Ask Labor Board to Order Employers to Bargain,\\" New York Times, August 15, 2007; \\"Let Workers Decide,\\" Spartanburg Herald Journal, August 27, 2007. which noted that \\"not one sentence in either the Advice Memorandum or the Regional Director's Dismissal Letter\\" in the Dick's case presented any discussion of statutory language other than to reiterate the Morris reading without presenting any disagreement with that reading. It noted further that the Memorandum never addressed the relevant legislative history, particularly the \\"smoking gun\\" revelation. Regarding the alleged Board and Supreme Court cases, it pointed out that they are non-existent, for there are no cases holding that minority-bargaining for members only where there is not yet a majority representative is either legal or illegal, and the General Counsel was unable to cite any. Unions appear determined to bring their case to the NLRB. Because the General Counsel's refusal to issue a complaint is not deemed subject to review, in order to bring the issue before the Board the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO (Steelworkers Union), joined by six other unions, on August 14, 2007, petitioned the NLRB in a substantive rulemaking case for issuance of the following rule: :Pursuant to Sections 7, 8(a)(1), and 8(a)(5) of the Act, in workplaces where employees are not currently represented by a certified or recognized Section 9(a) majority/exclusive collective-bargaining representative in an appropriate bargaining unit, the employer, upon request, has a duty to bargain collectively with a labor organization that represents less than an employee- majority with regard to the employees who are its members, but not for any other employees.\\"Change to Win Joins Other Unions Seeking Rule on Minority- Union Bargaining,\\" Daily Labor Report (BNA), Jan. 8, 2008. The six unions that joined with the Steelworkers Union were the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Communication Workers of America, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, California Nurses Association, and United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. Following the filing of that petition, on August 14, 2007, 25 university professors of labor law submitted a letter to the NLRB indicating their agreement with the legal premise of the Steelworkers' petition and urged the Board to issue the rule proposed in that petition. On January 4, 2008, the Change to Win union federation, on behalf of its seven affiliated unions, to wit, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Laborers' International Union of North America, Service Employees International Union, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, United Farm Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and UNITE HERE, filed another rulemaking petition requesting the NLRB to issue the above proposed rule. The proposed rule is thus now backed by several major AFL-CIO unions, one independent union, and all of the CTW unions with their six million members. These petitioning unions represent the overwhelming majority of all private sector union members in the United States who are subject to the NLRA. The NRA Blue Eagle Title The title of the book refers to the symbol adopted by the National Recovery Administration. The National Industrial Recovery Act was enacted by Congress in 1933 to stimulate the American economy and help the nation recover from the Great Depression. The law created the NRA to administer the act. Section 7(a) of the Act promoted the formation of labor unions, and created a tremendous upsurge of union organizing. The NRA adopted the \\"Blue Eagle\\" icon as its symbol.

Run aground and converted into a storeship and hotel, she was a prominent landmark in the booming city for several years. The site of Niantic beside the Transamerica Pyramid is now a California Historical Landmark. Artifacts excavated in 1978 and the ship's log from her last voyage are on display in the San Francisco Maritime Museum. Early years The Niantic was built in 1832 in Connecticut; it was originally intended for trade with China. The owners in 1840 appear to have been N. L. and G. Griswold of New York. In 1840, the Niantic sailed, with Captain Doty in command (Captain Robert Bennett Forbes acting), with tea and silk from Port of Canton to an unstated destination (perhaps New York) via Anjer (Anyer), Indonesia, just missing a blockade by the British in Canton as part of the First Opium War. \\"Probably this was the last and most profitable voyage of Niantic as a merchant ship.\\" In 1844, the Niantic was bought by C. T. Deering for whaling. In June, 1844, she sailed from Sag Harbor, Captain Slate in command, for a Pacific whaling cruise, including New Zealand whaling grounds. The cruise lasted nearly three years until February 1, 1847, when the Niantic returned to Sag Harbor. In 1847, the Niantic was purchased by Burr & Smith of Warren, Rhode Island. On September 16, 1848, she sailed from Warren, Captain Henry Cleaveland of West Tisbury, Massachusetts (Martha's Vineyard) in command, and headed for the northwest Pacific. Captain Clevealand's sons, James and Daniel Cleaveland, were first and second mates, respectively. They all belonged to the Cleaveland whaling family, based in Nantucket, which shares the origin of its name with that of the ship, named after the Niantic people, in their own tongue the \\"Nehantucket\\". Peru, Panama, and the race to California, 1849 After rounding Cape Horn in January 1849, Niantic put into Paita (Payta), Peru on March 8, and received a letter there from the American consul in Panama requesting them to carry passengers from Panama to San Francisco. Large numbers of people (in some accounts referred to as Argonauts) had crossed the Isthmus of Panama and were waiting on the Pacific coast for transportation to California; the gold rush had begun. The vessel was immediately modified to carry passengers above and below the weather deck. They departed Paita for Panama on 25 March taking 150 mules, barrels of potatoes, a large amount of lumber, and other supplies. Arriving on the Panama coast April 8, Niantic spent nearly four weeks in preparations. She departed for San Francisco May 2 with 246 passengers; 20 are reported to have been accommodated in the captain's cabin alone. Sixteen passengers paid $250 each, and the remaining paid $150, or an unrecorded amount. Thus, the total passenger fees probably amounted to $38,500. One slave was included among the passengers. Two passengers died en route. Experience whaling in the Pacific and familiarity with its winds gave Cleaveland an advantage over other ships in the race to San Francisco; for 28 days he headed generally southwest, against the vocal objections of dismayed passengers, before catching the southeast trade winds beginning May 24, and finally turning northwest May 30. Niantic was thus one of the first ships to bring gold seekers to San Francisco, arriving at 11 pm July 5, 1849. Storeship and hotel The Niantic Hotel in 1850 In San Francisco harbor, most of the crew deserted to join the gold rush. Niantics log records that five of the crew deserted the first day, nine the second day, three more deserted the fourth day and two were arrested by the US Sloop of War for assaulting Captain Cleaveland with a knife, and five were released the sixth day (including one released by Warren). This may have left a crew as small as five to finish unloading the ship. Niantics log ends the next day, 12 July 1849. Without a crew to sail, and with more ships arriving daily, Niantics officers were instructed by her owners, probably through an agent in San Francisco, to sell the vessel. With the aid of her empty whale oil barrels tied to her hull for extra buoyancy, the ship was floated on a high tide into shallow water, just offshore from the intersection of Clay and Montgomery Streets. Now hard aground, Niantic was converted for use variously as a warehouse, store, offices, and hotel. \\"Over the gaping wound in her stout oaken side, where a doorway was cut for a public entrance, was inscribed the hospitable legend, 'Rest for the weary and storage for trunks.'\\" Access was first by a pier or footbridge, but later, the sandy bluffs along Montgomery Street were flattened and the shallows around the ship were filled. The Cleavelands appear to have purchased the smaller vessel Mary Wilder, and were able to sail out of San Francisco with a crew of just six. Fires, 1850-1852 The converted vessel burned repeatedly in the fires that devastated the new city of San Francisco over the next several years, but was repeatedly rebuilt as the Niantic Hotel, looking less like a ship each time. The Niantic Hotel was described in about 1852 as the finest hotel in San Francisco. ‚ÄúAfter the May fire, in 1851, the building since known as the Niantic Hotel was erected. It was first leased by L. H. Roby ‚Ä¶ under whose management it secured the reputation of being the best hotel in the city at the time.‚Äù ‚ÄúMen and Memories of San Francisco in the \\"Spring of '50‚Äù, 1873, by T. A.

Heritage Niantics hull was rediscovered when the old Niantic Hotel was demolished in 1872. Thirty-five baskets of champagne were found in the ruins. In 1907, Niantic was again discovered during rebuilding from the San Francisco Fire of 1906. A new Niantic Building was constructed. Niantic plaque (1919) A plaque was placed at 505 Sansome at Clay by the Historic Landmarks Committee of the Native Sons of the Golden West, on September 19, 1919. Excavation, 1978 Niantic was rediscovered once again in 1978 during excavation for the Mark Twain Plaza Complex next to the Transamerica Pyramid, now about six blocks from the waterfront. Excavations were hurried, and there was little time for preservation or study. One last basket of intact bottles of champagne was found deep in the charred remnants of the hull. One of these bottles was later given to Dionis Coffin Riggs, the great granddaughter of Captain Cleaveland, in appreciation for donating the ship's log to investigators. Although some of Niantics remains were removed to a landfill, a portion of the bow remains undisturbed under a parking lot. California Historic Landmark Niantics location is designated as California Historical Landmark #88. San Francisco Maritime Museum A portion of Niantics hull and rudder, with several related artifacts, is in the San Francisco Maritime Museum. The display includes the ship's log kept by First Mate James Cleaveland, recording the arrival in San Francisco. A diorama shows the ship as she is believed to have appeared in 1850, converted to a storeship but not yet landlocked. Niantic, Inc In 2010 the company Niantic, Inc was founded, developing Augmented Reality games for smartphones. Based in San Francisco, it was named after the ship.

Scotland. The Gaelic name, Ard Charnaich means \\"High Cliff\\", and refers to a prominent inland cliff to the north east of the township which whilst clearly visible from the loch is out of sight of the settlement itself.  History = Spelling  The name Ardcharnich has been spelled in different ways. The Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis includes a contract from 1628 for the preservation of deer and roe in various estates including Ardchernich. This spelling also appears on an early map drawn by Robert Gordon dated ca. 1636-52.Gordon, Robert. Coygach and Loch Breyn drawn out of many imperfyt papers of M.T. Pont, ca. 1636-52 . In 1807 a newspaper piece in the Caledonian Mercury advertised the sale of a \\"valuable sheep farm\\" in the lands of Inverlael including Ardcharnick. The Handbook for Travellers in Scotland (1875) describes Ardcharnac as a hamlet.  Enlargement of holdings appeals  In 1890 the estate of Inverlael in the township of Ardcharnich, belonged to Sir Arthur Mackenzie of Coul. Nine crofters from Ardcharnich appealed to Mackenzie for enlargement of their holdings. They argued that since the crofts had been cleared in the early 1800s, this once grazeable land which had been used by their predecessors, had become wild. The crofters said they needed more cultivated lands, that their crofts are poor and in a bad place. Mackenzie opposed the application for the return of 150 acres but consented to about ten acres, the land and rent to be divided between the applicants. A few years later ca.1902 the Estate was acquired by Mr. W. E. Gilmour. The crofters were once again cleared from the land along with most of the sheep. The land was added to the Inverlael deer forest. The crofters made a second appeal for enlargement. The application for land was opposed by Mr. Gilmour. He argued that the land was essential to him for the preservation of his forest, or as a farm if he needed it. The Crofting Commission found that his arguments were unfounded, and that the applicants needed the land. Twenty three acres were granted to the crofters, subject to suitable fencing being erected. In March 1911 the crofters or their successors applied for the grazing land previously requested in 1890. At the time the Commission felt that this was not feasible as it would require a large amount of fencing. On inspection it was found that the applicants holdings were small and they were in need of enlargement. It was also found that the small size of their holdings was due to the previous actions of the former proprietors of the Estate. With the help of the Commission enough fencing was purchased and the crofters were assigned 847 acres of grazing ground, to be divided between their households with a total rent of ¬£21, 3s, or ¬£2, 7s for each of nine shares.

The sediments that the ancient channel is cut into or buried by can be unconsolidated, semi- consolidated, consolidated or lithified. The word palaeochannel is formed from the palaeo, meaning \\"old,\\" and channel. It may be synonymous with palaeovalley and palaeoriver.  Recognition  A palaeochannel is distinct from the overbank deposits of currently-active river channels, including ephemeral water courses that do not regularly flow (such as the Todd River, Central Australia) because the river bed is filled with sedimentary deposits unrelated to the normal bed load of the current drainage pattern. Many palaeochannels are arranged on old drainage patterns, distinct from the current drainage system of a catchment. For example, palaeochannels may relate to a system of rivers and creeks that drained east-west if the current drainage direction is north-south. Palaeochannels can be most easily identified as broad erosional channels into a basement that underlies a system of depositional sequences, which may contain several episodes of deposition and represent meandering peneplain streams. Thereafter, a palaeochannel may form part of the regolith of a region and although it is unconsolidated or partly consolidated, it is currently part of the erosional surface. Palaeochannels can also be identified according to their age. For example, there are deposits of Tertiary lignites in the Tertiary river systems preserved on top of Archaean basement in the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia. The river systems have laid in place for 15 to 50 million years and would be considered palaeochannels.  Formation  Paleochannels form when river channels aggrade and so deposit sediment on their bed. For the channel deposits to be preserved, the flow must not occupy and erode them again. Examples of what may cause long-term preservation include the channels being in a net-depositional environment and/or being in a subsiding sedimentary basin. Paleochannels may also be preserved in the short- term on non-net-depositional floodplains in which the river migrates or avulses away from its previous course. The preservation is short-term because unless the channel deposits are buried, flow will eventually reoccupy its formerly-occupied course, reworking and eroding the channel deposits.  Geological importance  Palaeochannels are important to geology for a number of reasons: * Understanding movements of faults, which may redirect river systems and so form stranded channels that are, in essence, palaeochannels. * Preserving Tertiary, Eocene and Holocene sediments and fossils within them, important locations for palaeontology, palaeobotany and archaeology. * Preserving evidence of older erosional surfaces and levels, which is useful for estimating the net erosional budget of older regolith. * Preserving sedimentary records, which is useful for understanding climatic conditions, including various isotopic indicators of past rainfall, temperatures and climates, used to understand climate change and global warming.  Economic importance  Palaeochannels can host economic ore deposits of uranium, lignite, precious metals such as gold and platinum, heavy minerals such as tin, tungsten, and iron ore preserved as paleo-placer deposits.

Collinge was born in 1944 in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. He trained as a chemist at Petone Technical College. In rowing, he attracted attention due to his strong performance at the 1967 New Zealand championships, where he rowed for the Hutt Valley team; Dick Joyce was one of his team members. For the 1968 Summer Olympics, New Zealand qualified an eight and had a pool of four rowers and a cox as a travelling reserve; Collinge was part of this reserve. Preparations were held in Christchurch at Kerr's Reach on the Avon River. The reserve rowers were unhappy with the \\"spare parts\\" tag and felt that they were good enough to perhaps win a medal if put forward as a coxed four. The manager, Rusty Robertson, commented about them that they were \\"the funniest looking crew you've ever seen\\". There were stern discussions with the New Zealand selectors. In a training run, the coxed four was leading the eight over the whole race. In the end, the reserve rowers got their way and New Zealand entered both the coxed four and the coxed eight. Collinge won the Olympic coxed four event along with Dick Joyce, Dudley Storey, Warren Cole and Simon Dickie (cox); this was New Zealand's first gold medal in rowing. At the time, Collinge had newly qualified as a pharmacist, and recently married. The crew's winning boat was sold to a rowing club to recoup costs, and ended in splinters after a road crash. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich Collinge teamed with Dick Tonks, Dudley Storey and Noel Mills to win the silver medal in the coxless four. He rowed with the coxed eight in the 1975 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, Great Britain, and won a bronze medal. He is married to Valerie Collinge with whom he had two children. Since the 1980s, they have been living in a house adjacent to the house of the Indian High Commissioner in Lower Hutt.

Initially charged with first-degree attempted murder, she eventually pleaded guilty to first-degree aggravated assault and served seven years in prison. Paroled in 1999, Fisher became a writer, a webcam model, and a pornographic actress. Early life Fisher was born in Merrick, New York, on Long Island, to Elliot and Roseann Fisher; her father was Jewish while her mother's family, Fisher has said, was \\"a mixture of a lot of different things, including English\\".In My Story, Fisher says her maternal grandfather \\"wasn't Italian, he was a mixture of a lot of different things, including English\\". As a 16-year-old student at Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York,\\"Classics: 'Long Island Lolita' May 19, 1992\\" , WCBSTV.com, May 18, 2006 Fisher allegedly met 35-year-old Joey Buttafuoco in 1990, when she was 16 and her father took his car for repairs to Buttafuoco's auto body shop; Fisher later said she had damaged her own car several times as a pretext to see him, and later admitted that they had an affair when she was still under-age. Crime and prison Fisher became increasingly jealous of Buttafuoco's wife, Mary Jo Buttafuoco. She obtained a .25-caliber handgun with the assistance of Peter Guagenti, a Brooklyn auto supply salesman who acted as her getaway driver. When Mary Jo Buttafuoco answered the door, Fisher told her that Joey Buttafuoco was having an affair with Fisher's (imaginary) younger sister, providing a T-shirt advertising Buttafuoco's auto body shop as \\"proof\\". The conversation lasted about 15 minutes, during which Buttafuoco became increasingly angry. She finally told Fisher to leave and then turned her back to return to the house. Fisher took out the gun, struck Buttafuoco twice with it, then shot her in the head; she later said the severely wounded Buttafuoco fell on her. Fisher dropped both the shirt and the gun and ran towards the car, but then returned for them and Guagenti drove off. Neighbors called 911; Buttafuoco was operated on all night, and although they could not remove the bullet, doctors were able to save her life. When interviewed by police, Joey Buttafuoco told them that Fisher could be the shooter. When Mary Jo Buttafuoco regained consciousness the next day, she recognized Fisher from a photo. Fisher was arrested and charged with attempted murder, and on September 23, 1992, after accepting a plea bargain, she pleaded guilty to first-degree assault. Paul Makely tape In September 1992, the tabloid television show Hard Copy broadcast a videotaped conversation between Fisher and Paul Makely, the owner of a gym in Massapequa. In the tape, recorded hours before she agreed to the plea in court, Fisher could be seen talking about her future, saying that she wanted to marry Makely so he could visit her in prison. Fisher explained that her lawyer believed requiring people to be married for such visits was unconstitutional and that she intended to challenge the law on this matter. Fisher could be seen on the tape saying: \\"That will keep my name in the press. I want my name in the press. Why? Because I can make a lot of money. I figure if I'm going through all this pain and suffering, I'm getting a Ferrari.\\" Imprisonment On December 2, 1992, Fisher was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison. She served seven years and was granted parole in May 1999 after Nassau County Court Judge Ira Wexner shortened her maximum sentence to 10 years, which made her immediately eligible for parole. The judge acted after having found that she had not been appropriately represented by her lawyer at the time of her 1992 guilty plea. Joey Buttafuoco denied having an affair with Fisher. In October 1992, the Nassau County District Attorney stated that Buttafuoco would not be prosecuted. However, in February 1993, the case against him was reopened due to rape charges made by Fisher. She testified against him in court and based on this testimony and hotel receipts (dated before Fisher's 17th birthday) with Buttafuoco's signature on them, Buttafuoco was charged with statutory rape. Buttafuoco pleaded guilty in October 1993. He served four months in prison. Life after prison After her release from prison, Fisher became a columnist for the Long Island Press. Her biography, If I Knew Then..., written by Robbie Woliver, was published in 2004 and became a New York Times bestseller. In 2003, Fisher married Louis Bellera. The couple had three children before divorcing in 2015. Fisher and Buttafuoco revisited In 2006, Fisher reunited with Mary Jo Buttafuoco in sessions televised for Entertainment Tonight and its spinoff, The Insider. Fisher said she wanted to heal and move on with her life. However, two years later, she said she felt \\"no sympathy for Mary Jo\\", without giving an explanation. Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco eventually reunited for the first time at the 2006 Lingerie Bowl for the coin toss. In May 2007, Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco met for dinner in Port Jefferson, Long Island, in what TV producer David Krieff said was an attempt to develop a reality-television show. In June and July 2011 Fisher appeared as a cast member in the fifth season of the reality-television series Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, which aired on VH1. Sex tape and adult entertainment career Fisher in 2010 In October 2007, the New York Post published allegations that Fisher's husband, Lou Bellera, had sold a sex tape of the couple to Red Light District Video of Los Angeles. Red Light District Video published a press release stating that it intended to release a sex video of the couple. On October 31, nude pictures of Fisher from the video were posted at various Internet sites, and on November 1, 2007, a teaser clip was released by Red Light District Video that showed a nude Fisher showering and sunbathing. Of note were a tattoo surrounding her navel and a breast augmentation. On November 6, 2007, Fisher sued Red Light District and its owner David Joseph, claiming copyright infringement and other damages. But by November 8, 2007, amyfisher.com, a website whose ownership Fisher had previously fought to win, had begun pointing directly to the Red Light District website. In early January 2008, Fisher announced that she had settled with Red Light and agreed to do a related promotional appearance. The same announcement indicated that she and Bellera had reconciled. The promotional appearance took place at Retox in New York City on January 4, 2008. Clips of the video were played on The Howard Stern Show. On March 6, 2008, Fisher was a guest on the Stern show, and one topic of discussion was meant to be her video. But after the first phone call, which was from Mary Jo Buttafuoco's daughter Jessica, Fisher left the show six minutes into her interview. On January 12, 2009, Fisher released a pay-per-view adult film titled Amy Fisher: Totally Nude & Exposed. Fisher signed a deal with Lee Entertainment to become a stripper doing club shows at least once a month. Fisher claimed she planned to strip until her fans told her, \\"Dear, please put your clothes back on. You're too old.\\" In September 2010, DreamZone Entertainment released the adult film Deep Inside Amy Fisher, calling it the first of eight such films Fisher would produce and in which she would star. The company had announced the movie in July 2010 under the working title The Making of Amy Fisher: Porn Star. In June 2011, Fisher said she was no longer making adult films.

Ardroil is within the parish of Uig. Geography Ardroil is more accurately the name of a fertile machair district by the expanse of Uig Bay between two rivers: The Forsa River and the Red River. The land is made fertile from the wind blown shell sand which has fertilised the black earth for centuries. History What is today known as Ardroil is an elongated township of re- settled crofts from five previously cleared settlements. These clearances occurred in the 1830s as the landowner, the Earl of Seaforth, decided that the best land should be taken from tenant crofters and given to sheep farmers. This particular clearance evicted the tenants of the former healthily populated townships of Capadale (Capadal), Penny Donald (Peighinn Dhomhnaill), Balgowan (Baile Ghobhainn), Balgreasach (Baile Ghreusaich) and Erista (Earastadh). The inhabitants were forcibly sent to other parts of Lewis notably Swainbost, Ness but also to Canada. The Lewis Chessmen were found in 1830 at a sand dune in Penny Donald by a man named Calum an Sprot and are among some of the greatest treasures found in Scotland.

Ardross lies near the B9176, inland from the east-coast town of Alness and progressively becomes more mountainous to the west and north. The area is populated by a small rural community mainly confined to the more fertile lower slopes to the east and the glacial glens of Strathrusdale and Strathy (Ardross). The total area comprises about , most of which is lower slope farming, commercial pine forest on foothills and open mountain to the north and west. The largest concentration of dwellings are in the village of Dublin comprising about 30 houses and a church, so named as it was founded by Irish immigrant workers who built Ardross Castle.  History  The earliest inhabitants of Ardross were the Picts (6-10th century), and there are still recognisable remains of Pictish roundhouses at various locations in the area. The most notable surviving artefacts of their time in Ardross are two carved stone slabs depicting a wolf and a deer, some of the finest surviving Pictish animal symbols ever discovered, which are now displayed at Inverness Museum. The carvings were recovered from a drystone wall in Stittenham, Ardross in 1891. After the 10th century, habitation of the area became progressively more influenced by the Norse. The Duke of Sutherland bought the Ardross Estate in the late 18th century, and in 1845, sold it to Sir Alexander Matheson, 1st Baronet for ¬£90,000. Matheson improved the estate and placed it under the supervision of factor William MacKenzie, an engineer by profession. By 1875 the number of agricultural tenants had increased fivefold to over 500, with around of arable land being improved. The architect Alexander Ross was commissioned to re- design Ardross Castle in the Scots Baronial style and following Sir Alexander's death, his son, Sir Kenneth Matheson, sold the estate in 1898 to Charles William Dyson Perrins, a Captain in the Highland Light Infantry, with interests in the Worcester Royal Porcelain Company and Lea & Perrins (Worcester) sauce. The estate was broken up and sold in 1937. Mr and Mrs Austin Mardon purchased Ardross Castle and of associated land and lived there until 1983, when the castle and grounds were sold to the McTaggart family, who began a program of restoration work. The castle is now used as a wedding and conferance venue. Famous people from Ardross include Sir John McKenzie, who emigrated to New Zealand and became a prominent politician. He is remembered in New Zealand as the Minister of Lands and Agriculture who developed a policy which disfavored large landowners. This stemmed from his experience in Ardross where he was deeply moved by the misery he witnessed among tenants on Ardross Estate. Some of his near relatives suffered in this way and were forced to emigrate to Canada and the United States. Many years later McKenzie related how, when once walking home with his father, he came upon a number of dispossessed tenant farmers who had been forced to camp in the local cemetery at Ardross Church as there was nowhere else to go. Many years earlier, in 1792 tenants at Strathrusdale, which forms the western area of Ardross, led a famous revolt against landowner's such as the Duke of Sutherland who were pursuing a policy of clearing land.'KENZIE, Sir John, K.C.M.G.', An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand  Local area  The community has its own primary school with a roll of about 35 pupils and a recently built well- founded village hall for hosting local community activities and social events. Other local services can be found in the nearby town of Alness. Most inhabitants of the area today are employed in the North Sea oil industry, agriculture or the provision of local services.

All of the species in this genus, like all other lemurs, are native to Madagascar.  Description  A lithograph of a dwarf lemur from Carl Vogt and Friedrich Specht's The Natural History of Animals (1888) Measuring 19‚Äì27 cm in body length with a tail about 16‚Äì17 cm, they are larger than the mouse lemur but smaller than the gentle lemur. Their heads are globular compared to the fox-like heads of the lemurs, but their muzzles are more pointed than those of the hapalemurs. Their hind limbs are slightly longer than their forelimbs, but not as elongated as in lepilemurs or indriids. Dwarf lemurs have an intermembral index of 71 on average. In contrast to most other primates, their grip is similar to that of South American monkeys with objects picked up and branches grasped between the second and third fingers, rather than between the thumb and index finger. Their nails are somewhat keeled and pointed. Dwarf lemurs roam the lower strata of the foliage in the coastal forests of eastern Madagascar. They are nocturnal and quadrupeds. They have a period of inactivity (torpor) during the winter season lasting between four and five months. Their tail serves as an area for fat storage, most of which is consumed during periods of food scarcity. Like most nocturnal prosimians, dwarf lemurs are reported as living solitary or in pairs. They nest in tree holes where they often sleep together in curled up positions. Their territories are marked by fecal and scent markings. Their diet consists primarily of fruits and flowers and they seem to play a part in the pollination of certain plants.  Classification  As of 2018, 9 species are known. * Genus Cheirogaleus: dwarf lemurs ** Montagne d'Ambre dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus andysabini ** Furry-eared dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus crossleyi ** Groves' dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus grovesi ** Lavasoa dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus lavasoensis ** Greater dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus major ** Fat-tailed dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius ** Lesser iron-gray dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus minusculus ** Ankarana dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus shethi ** Sibree's dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus sibreei  See also  * List of lemur species * List of mammals of Madagascar References Category:Dwarf lemurs ","title":"Dwarf lemur"},{"id":"12789615","text":"Ardtoe () is a place on the coast of Ardnamurchan, Lochaber, in the Highland council area of Scotland.

Education  Arncroach once had two schools, despite it only being a very small village. One was a boys' school and the other was for girls. Later they were combined, as having two became impractical. The Old School of Arncroach has been a residential home since the school was closed in the mid-1990s.

It lies on the north shore of Loch Hourn, around 10 miles down a single track road from Glenelg. It has a permanent population of around 30 and several holiday cottages. At the end of the village is a large white-painted hunting lodge called Arnisdale House, built by architects Robert John Macbeth & Alexander Ross in 1898-1916. The house was built for Valentine Fleming of the banking family (father of the writer and explorer Peter Fleming and of Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond), who was killed in action in World War I, a year after the house was completed. Arnisdale House Arnisdale is in the Highland Council area.

Career  Cole was born in 1940 at Palmerston North, New Zealand, and was educated at Hamilton Boys' High School. He later lived in Whakatane, and was a member of the Whakatane Rowing Club. For the 1968 Summer Olympics, New Zealand qualified an eight and had a pool of four rowers and a cox as a travelling reserve; Cole was part of this reserve. Preparations were held in Christchurch at Kerr's Reach on the Avon River. The reserve rowers were unhappy with the \\"spare parts\\" tag and felt that they were good enough to perhaps win a medal if put forward as a coxed four. The manager, Rusty Robertson, commented about them that they were \\"the funniest looking crew you've ever seen\\". There were stern discussions with the New Zealand selectors. In a training run, the coxed four was leading the eight over the whole race. In the end, the reserve rowers got their way and New Zealand entered both the coxed four and the coxed eight. Cole won the Olympic coxed four event along with Dick Joyce, Dudley Storey, Ross Collinge and Simon Dickie (cox); this was New Zealand's first gold medal in rowing. At the time, Cole was living in Whakatane with his wife and two young children, and selling milking shed equipment. The crew's winning boat was later sold to a rowing club to recoup costs, and ended up in splinters after a road crash. At the 1970 World Rowing Championships in St. Catharines in Canada, he won a bronze medal with the coxed eight. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich he competed again in the coxed four which finished sixth. Cole worked for the National Dairy Association in marketing and sales. He later moved to Hamilton and sold equipment for the dairy industry. Cole died in Hamilton on 17 July 2019. No cause was given.

He developed his solo career starting in 2001 with a number of albums in various genres including pop, rock, and folk music. He sings both in English and Armenian. Biography=In band Lav Eli Gor Mkhitarian (middle) in Lav Eli band Gor was widely known throughout Armenia as the lead guitarist for one of country's best rock bands, Lav Eli (in Armenian ‘º’°’æ ’ß’¨’´) that he established with fellow musician Mher Manukyan in 1996. The original set-up was: *Mher Manukyan - vocals and guitar *Gor Mkhitaryan - guitar, backing vocals *Vahe Terteryan - bass *Davit Grigoryan - drums Later on, with drummer David Grigoryan and bassist Vahe Terteryan leaving, the band was accentuated with more members, including a new bass player: *Tigran Voskanyan - bass *Bagrat Aznavouryan - guitar, backing vocals (2007-2019) *Gor Tadevosyan - guitar, backing vocals *Shogher manukyan - cello *Vardan Paremuzyan - drums Besides Lav Eli, Mkhitaryan also worked with the group Snack.

Having been nominated for 14 industry music awards, he makes fresh and compelling music that successfully fuses traditional Armenian music with both rock and folk idioms. In 2003, Mkhitarian moved to Los Angeles where drummer Andranik Harutyunyan, bassist Varoujan Hovakimyan, pianist Art Grigorian and guitarist Jay Dean joined the band. Stepping away from his previous acoustic- driven \\"signature\\", with the new band he features remarkable musicianship and showcases a different approach to his songwriting.

Dickie was born in 1951 in Waverley in Taranaki, New Zealand. He was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School where he was part of the Maadi Cup winning crews between 1966 and 1968. For the 1968 Summer Olympics, New Zealand qualified an eight and had a pool of four rowers and a cox as a travelling reserve; Dickie was part of this reserve as their cox. Preparations were held in Christchurch at Kerr's Reach on the Avon River. The reserve rowers were unhappy with the \\"spare parts\\" tag and felt that they were good enough to perhaps win a medal if put forward as a coxed four. The trainer, Rusty Robertson, commented about them that they were \\"the funniest looking crew you've ever seen\\". There were stern discussions with the New Zealand selectors. In a training run, the coxed four was leading fours formed from the eight over the whole race. In the end, the reserve rowers got their way and New Zealand entered both the coxed four and the coxed eight. Dickie won the Olympic coxed four event along with Dick Joyce, Dudley Storey, Ross Collinge and Warren Cole; this was New Zealand's first gold medal in rowing. At the time, he was a 17-year-old schoolboy at Wanganui Collegiate, called in to replace a previous cox who had been killed in a training accident. The crew's winning boat was later sold to a rowing club to recoup costs, and ended up in splinters after a road crash. Dickie was part of the eight that was formed for the 1971 rowing season; he teamed up with Dick Joyce, Tony Hurt, Wybo Veldman, John Hunter, Lindsay Wilson, Joe Earl, Trevor Coker and Gary Robertson. They won gold at the 1971 European Rowing Championships, defeating the favourite team from East Germany. The New Zealand eight would go on in unchanged composition to with the 1972 Olympic eight event where they again won gold. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal he was again cox for the eight which this time won the bronze medal. His crewmates this time were Tony Hurt, Alec McLean, Ivan Sutherland, Trevor Coker, Peter Dignan, Lindsay Wilson, Joe Earl and Dave Rodger. Dickie is one of only fifteen New Zealanders to have won two or more Olympic gold medals. He later owned an adventure company in Taupo. Death He died at his house in Taupo on 13 December 2017. He was 66 years old. The day prior to his death, he had held a reunion for the 1968 coxed four, and he was involved in organising a reunion for the 1972 coxed eight at the next Halberg Awards function. He is survived by his wife, Adi, and his three daughters.

Created in collaboration with composer Hanns Eisler and director Slatan Dudow, it consists of eight sections in prose and unrhymed, free verse, with six major songs. A note to the text by all three collaborators describes it as an \\"attempt to use a didactic piece to make familiar an attitude of positive intervention.\\"Willett (1959, 38‚Äì39). Plot Four agitators from Moscow return from a successful mission in China and are congratulated for their efforts by a central committee (called The Control Chorus.) The four agitators, however, inform the committee that during their mission they were forced to kill a young comrade for their mission to succeed. They ask for judgment from the committee on their actions. The committee withholds its verdict until after the four agitators re-enact the events that led to the young comrade's death. The four agitators tell of how they were sent on a mission to educate and help organize the workers in China. At a party house (the last before they reach the frontiers of China) they meet an enthusiastic young comrade, who offers to join them as their guide. The agitators must hide their identities because educating and organizing the workers in China is illegal. The director of the party house (the last before the frontier) helps the four agitators and the young comrade in the obliteration of their true identities. They all put on masks in order to appear as Chinese. They are told to keep concealed that they are communist. Their mission must remain a secret. Should they be discovered, the authorities will attack the organization and the entire movement; not merely the lives of the four agitators and the young comrade will be put in danger. The agitators and the young comrade all agree to these conditions. However, once in China, the sights of injustice and oppression enrages the young comrade and he is not able to contain his passion, immediately acting to correct the wrongs he sees around him. He shows no discretion in teaching the oppressed how to help themselves and has no tact when dealing with small-time oppressors to help the greater good of the revolution. As a result, he eventually exposes himself and the four agitators by ripping off his mask and proclaiming the teachings of the party. When he does this, he puts the entire mission and movement in danger. He is identified, unmasked, just as riots break out and a revolutionary uprising among the workers is beginning. The authorities are now in pursuit of the young comrade and his friends. Still shouting out against the party, the young comrade is struck in the head by one of the agitators and they carry him as far away as they could, to the nearby lime pits. There, the agitators debate on what to do with him. If they help him to escape they will be unable to help the uprising, and escape is near impossible from their current position anyway. If he is left behind and caught, his mere identity will unwittingly betray the movement. The four agitators realize that \\"he must vanish, and vanish completely/ For we can neither take him with us nor leave him.\\"Brecht, Bertolt. 1998. Collected Plays: Three, (The Decision) Ed. and trans. John Willett. London: Methuen Drama. pp. 86‚Äì87 To save the movement, they conclude that their only solution is for the young comrade to die and be thrown in the lime pits where he will be burned and become unrecognizable. They ask him for his consent to this. The young comrade agrees to his fate in the interest of revolutionizing the world and in the interest of communism. He asks the four agitators to help him with his death. They shoot him and throw his body into the lime pit. The central committee (The Control Chorus), to whom the four agitators have been telling their story, agree with their actions and reassures them that they have made the correct decision. \\"You've helped to disseminate / Marxism's teachings and the / ABC of Communism,\\" they assure the four agitators. They also mark the sacrifice and cost that the wider success entailed: \\"At the same time your report shows how much / Is needed if our world is to be altered.\\" Note: The \\"ABC of Communism\\" is a reference to the popular book by Nikolai Bukharin. Translations The most common translation for the title, ', in English is The Measures Taken. The only translation titled The Decision is by John Willett. The first known published English- language translation of ' is the inaccurate and libelous version of the cantata, titled The Rule [or Doctrine]. This version of the text was made specifically for the House Un-American Activities Committee for use when interrogating both Bertolt Brecht and Hanns Eisler. The text is derived from the Eisler score published by Universal Edition and was made by Elizabeth Hanunian on September 18, 1947. The full translation is available in the Thunder's Mouth Press/Nation Books book: Thirty Years of Treason (New York, 2002) edited by Eric Bentley. [Note: First published by The Viking Press, Inc. in 1971.] Eric Bentley himself made two published translations of ', both as The Measures Taken. The two different translations corresponded to two different German versions of the text. The first appeared in the Bentley edited collection of plays The Modern Theatre volume 6 (New York, 1960.) The second was published in a Grove Press collection of Brecht plays The Jewish Wife and Other Short Plays (New York, 1967.) Bentley also made verse translations to be sung for selected pieces from ' as sheet music to directly correspond to the Eisler score in The Brecht-Eisler Songbook, published by Oak Publications (New York, 1967.) Carl R. Mueller translated ' as The Measures Taken in the Brecht collection The Measures Taken and Other Lehrst√ºcke edited by John Willett and Ralph Manheim, first published by Methuen (London, 1977) and later by Arcade Publishing (New York, 2001.) John Willett translated ' as The Decision specifically to fit the Eisler score. This translation was published by Methuen Drama in Brecht's Collected Plays: Three (London, 1998.) Score Hanns Eisler's score for ' calls for a tenor soloist, three speakers/actors, a mixed choir (SATB) and a small orchestra. The score involves choral pieces, speaking choir, recitatives and songs.Eisler, Hanns. 1930. ', piano vocal score. Vienna: Universal Edition.

Brecht refused and suggested that Hindemith resign, protesting the implication of censorship. The piece was rejected by the festival directors citing the \\"artistic mediocrity of the text.\\" Brecht and Eisler wrote an open letter to the festival directors. In it they propose an alternative venue for their new work. \\"We render these important activities wholly independent, and let them be managed by those for whom they are intended and who alone have use for them: the workers' choirs, amateur theater groups, school choirs and school orchestras ‚Äì in short, the people who do not want to pay for art, who do not want to be paid for art, but who want to create art.\\"V√∂lker, Klaus. 1975.

The play was also produced in Moscow around 1934.Bertolt Brecht and the Politics of Secrecy by Eva Horn, p. 17 The opera was given its first post-war performance by a chamber orchestra ‚Äì the Phoenix Ensemble and the Pro Musica Chorus, conducted by Robert Ziegler in the Union Chapel, Islington, London, on election night 1987. 39 critics attended the performance and wrote it up and the BBC requested that the entire opera be recorded and subsequently broadcast on Radio 3. Heiner M√ºller, a postmodern dramatist from the former East Germany who ran Brecht's Berliner Ensemble for a short time, used the ' style and storytelling of The Decision as a model when writing his plays ' (1970) and The Mission: Memory of a Revolution (1979). The Decision/The Measures Taken influenced South African playwright, Maishe Maponya, when writing his play, The Hungry Earth, about labor and apartheid in 1978.Maponya, Maishe. 1994. Doing Plays For A Change. Witwatersrand University Press: Johannesburg. pp. xiii‚Äìxiv Brecht and his critics Brecht wrote the play in 1930. Since then, some critics have seen the play as an apologia for totalitarianism and mass murder while others have pointed out that it is a play about the tactics and techniques of clandestine agitation.Bertolt Brecht and the Politics of Secrecy by Eva Horn, p. 7 They have also pointed out that it is thematically similar to his 1926 poem, \\"Verwisch die Spuren\\", (\\"Cover Your Tracks\\"), that his friend Walter Benjamin saw as \\"an instruction for the illegal agent.\\"Walter Benjamin, \\"\\", in ', vol. 2 (Frankfurt, Germany: Suhrkamp 1991), 556. Elisabeth Hauptmann told controversial Brecht biographer John Fuegi that \\"she had written a substantial portion of it,\\" but had forgotten to list herself as co- author.Fuegi, John. 1987 Bertolt Brecht: Chaos, according to Plan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 71 Ruth Fischer, the sister of Hanns Eisler, denounced Brecht, as \\"The minstrel of the G.P.U.\\". She also viewed the play as a foreshadowing of the Stalinist purges and was among its harshest critics.Ruth Fischer, Stalin and German Communism: A Study in the Origins of the State Party Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1948. Katerina Clark wrote that the play \\"is a contender for being more Stalinist in this respect than Stalinist literature itself where writers deftly avoided explicit mention of the brutality of a purge.\\"Katerina Clark, Moscow, the Fourth Rome: Stalinism, Cosmopolitanism, and the Evolution of Soviet Culture, 1931‚Äì1941 (Harvard University Press, 2011; ), p. 54. In his journals, Brecht, however, relates how he had rejected explicitly that interpretation, referring the accusers to a closer scrutiny of the actual text; \\"[I] reject the interpretation that the subject is disciplinary murder by pointing out that it is a question of self-extinction\\", he writes, continuing: \\"I admit that the basis of my plays is Marxist and state that plays, especially with an historical content, cannot be written intelligently in any other framework.\\"Brecht (1993, 372). The play was praised as inspirational by Ulrike Meinhof, one of the leaders of German left-wing terrorist organization Red Army Faction. She frequently quoted one of the passages, that in her opinion served as justification for the acts of violence: It is a terrible thing to kill. But not only others would we kill, but ourselves too if need be Since only force can alter this Murderous world, as Every living creature knows. Banning the play Brecht and his family banned the play from public performance, but, in fact, the Soviet government did not like the play and other governments banned it as well.Otto Friedrich. 1995.

The Decision and the F.B.I. The F.B.I. translated the play in the 1940s, and titled it The Disciplinary Measure. The report described it as promoting \\"Communist World Revolution by violent means.\\"This translation can be found in Hanns Eisler's F.B.I file and a summary in his own F.B.I file. The Decision and the House Committee on Un-American Activities Brecht appeared before the Committee on October 30, 1947. Only three members of the Committee and Robert E. Stripling, the committee's chief investigator were present. Brecht wanted no attorney, and unlike the previous ten witnesses, was charming, friendly and seemingly cooperative. The committee tried to trick him by reading some of his more revolutionary plays and poems, but he was able to dismiss those questions by saying they were bad translations.Lester Cole, Hollywood Red, 1981, (Ramparts Press) 285 Some of his answers were cleverly evasive, such as when he was asked about Comintern agent Grigory Kheifets. At one point, he stated that he had never joined the Communist party. Despite Brecht's extensive support for Communism, most authors agree that he really had not officially joined the party.Joy Haslam Calico. Brecht at the opera. p. 113Ann Stamp Miller. p. 62.

Brecht and method. p. 17 Brecht was asked specific questions about The Decision. He said it was an adaption of an old Japanese religious play. When asked if the play was about the murder of a Communist party member by his comrades \\"because it was in the best interest of the Communist party\\", he said that that was \\"not quite\\" right, pointing out that the member's death is voluntary, so it is basically an assisted suicide rather than a murder. He compared that to the tradition of hara-kiri in the Japanese play. The interrogators suggested that the title of the play (German ') could be translated as \\"The Disciplinary Measure\\".Bertolt Brecht before the Committee on Un-American Activities: An Historical Encounter, Presented by Eric Bentley (Record Label: Folkways Records. Originally released: 24 October 2006) During his testimony, Brecht objected to this title, and argued that a more correct translation of the title would have been \\"Steps to Be Taken\\". The committee went lightly on him despite frequently interrupting his answers. At the end, Committee chairman J. Parnell Thomas said, \\"Thank you very much. You are a good example ...\\"Communist Infiltration of the Motion Picture Industry, House Committee, 491‚Äì504 The next day, Brecht left the United States for good and returned to Europe, eventually taking up residence in East Germany. Brecht was embarrassed by Parnell's compliment but said the committee was not as bad as the Nazis. The committee let him smoke. The Nazis would never have let him do this. Brecht smoked a cigar during the hearings. He told Eric Bentley that this let him \\"manufacture pauses\\" between their questions and his answers. Examples of Brecht's testimony about The Decision Brecht: This play is the adaptation of an old religious Japanese play and is called N≈ç Play, and follows quite closely this old story which shows the devotion for an ideal until death. Stripling: What was that ideal, Mr Brecht? Brecht: The idea in the old play was a religious idea. This young people ‚Äì Stripling: Did it have to do with the Communist Party? Brecht: Yes. Stripling: And discipline within the Communist Party? Brecht: Yes, yes, it is a new play, an adaptation. ‚Äî\\"From the Testimony of Bertolt Brecht\\" The interrogators ask explicitly about the death of the young comrade: Stripling: Now, Mr Brecht, will you tell the committee whether or not one of the characters in this play was murdered by his comrade because it was in the best interest of the party, of the Communist Party; is that true? Brecht: No, it is not quite according to the story. Stripling: Because he would not bow to discipline he was murdered by his comrades, isn't that true? Brecht: No; it is not really in it. You will find when you read it carefully, like in the old Japanese play where other ideas were at stake, this young man who died was convinced that he had done damage to the mission he believed in and he agreed to that and he was about ready to die in order not to make greater such damage. So, he asks his comrades to help him, and all of them together help him to die. He jumps into an abyss and they lead him tenderly to that abyss, and that is the story. Chairman: I gather from your remarks, from your answer, that he was just killed, he was not murdered? Brecht: He wanted to die. Chairman: So they killed him? Brecht: No; they did not kill him ‚Äì not in this story. He killed himself. They supported him, but of course they had told him it were better when he disappeared for him and them and the cause he also believed in. ‚Äî\\"From the Testimony of Bertolt Brecht\\" NotesBibliography * Brecht, Bertolt. 1993.

He also held teaching positions at the University of Texas, Indiana University, and the University of Michigan. He made a large number of transcriptions for the double bass, increasing the literature for the instrument. Sankey was born in Los Angeles, Calif., in 1927. He attended the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, and the Juilliard School of Music. His teachers included Frederick Zimmermann, Jean Morel and Henry Brant. Sankey was appointed to the Juilliard faculty immediately upon completion of his master of music degree in 1953. His long and distinguished teaching career took him from there to the University of Texas School of Music in Austin, Texas (1969‚Äì80); the Indiana University School of Music in Bloomington, Ind. (1980‚Äì86); and the U-M beginning in 1986. Sankey began teaching at the Aspen Music Festival in 1951; plans to celebrate his 50th year of teaching there included a July 16 concert. He also held guest teaching appointments at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing and the Toho Academy in Tokyo. His students include some of the world‚Äôs most distinguished solo bassists and the principal bassists in dozens of renowned orchestras, as well as bass teachers around the globe. Sankey dedicated his musical career to expanding the repertoire of the double bass through exhaustive editions, arrangements and original compositions including more than 45 publications, many issued for the first time. He authored a dozen articles on double bass playing and technique that have been published in the United States and abroad. His original compositions include two major works for double bass and orchestra, chamber music, solo repertoire and the Variations for Orchestra. In 1962‚Äì69, Sankey was the principal bassist for the American Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski.

He performed chamber music with the Juilliard Quartet, the Cleveland Quartet, the Paganini String Quartet, the New Music String Quartet, the Lenox String Quartet and the Curtis Quartet. In Aspen, Sankey appeared with Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Szymon Goldberg, William Primrose, Zara Nelsova, Rosina Lhevinne and Oscar Gighlia, among many other distinguished artists. In 1990, Sankey was recognized with the Outstanding Teacher Award from the International Society of Bassists and the Award of Honor from the China Society of Bassists.

Life and work Born in Barcelona, Spain of Catalan origin, he lost his right arm at the age of 9. His childhood would be marked by the Spanish Civil War. He studied art in Barcelona. He began working in paint and ceramic before expanding his focus to include metal and concrete reliefs. He emigrated to Canada in 1954, establishing himself in Quebec, where he continued his studies. After briefly returning to Spain, he established an atelier in Mont-Saint-Hilaire in 1960. Over the next 20 years, he created more than 100 works in Quebec and abroad, and associated with major art figures such as Salvador Dal√≠. In 1964, he was commissioned by the Government of Sierra Leone to deliver the mural which can still be seen at the front of the Bank of Sierra Leone building, in the capital, Freetown. His signature is situated at the bottom right-hand of the mural, with the words \\"Jordi Bonet '64\\" His relief in the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Qu√©bec created a scandal in 1971 because of the line \\"Vous √™tes pas √©c≈ìur√©s de mourir bande de caves?

Presents and Conflict at The Classic TV Archive (site currently blacklisted by Wikipedia's spam filters) Conflict was fully an anthological series. However, since Cheyenne and Conflict alternated the Tuesday 7:30 P.M. time slot, the net effect was that of a proper wheel series‚Äîeven though Cheyenne and Conflict were not under the same umbrella title. The name change was imposed upon its production company, Warner Bros., by ABC executives who believed that \\"conflict\\" was the missing element in Casablanca and Kings Row from Warner Bros. Presents.Conflict full summary at tv.com Actor James Garner caught producer Roy Huggins' attention with a comedic performance as a gambler in the series' sixth episode, a time travel scenario entitled \\"Man from 1997\\", leading Huggins to cast Garner as the lead the following year in his television series Maverick, according to Huggins' Archive of American Television interview. In the episode, Charles Ruggles portrays an elderly time-traveling librarian from the future attempting to retrieve a 1997 almanac that he mistakenly left 41 years before it is supposed to exist. Garner portrays \\"Red,\\" the brother of Maureen (Gloria Talbott); the show also stars Jacques Sernas as Johnny Vlakos. Huggins noted in his Archive of American Television interview that he subsequently cast Garner as the lead in Maverick due to his comedic facial expressions while playing scenes in \\"Man from 1997\\" that were not originally written to be comical, leading staffers in the screening room watching the rushes to unexpectedly laugh. The series does not fit neatly into standard American television seasons, technically superseding Warner Bros. Presents after Casablanca concluded its run in April 1956 and apparently providing at least one week of new material at the beginning of the 1957 season, before Sugarfoot, starring Will Hutchins, replaced it.

Malaysia generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care, operating a two-tier health care system consisting of both a government base universal healthcare system and a co-existing private healthcare system. Infant mortality rate ‚Äì a standard in determining the overall efficiency of healthcare ‚Äì in 2005 was 10, comparing favourably with the United States and western Europe. Life expectancy at birth in 2005 was 74 years. While there is a universal healthcare system, specialist services require queuing despite being free. Hence the private health care plays a major role in providing specialist services which complements the universal health care. Most insurance covers medical fees in Malaysia. History Healthcare in Malaysia has undergone radical transformations. Earliest pre-colonial medical care was confined to traditional remedies current among local people. The advent of colonialism brought western medical practice into the country. Since the country's independence in August 1957, the system of medical care transferred from the British colonial rule has been transformed to meet the needs of emerging diseases, as well as national political requirements. Healthcare today in Malaysia A health clinic in Tangkak District, Johor. Malaysia has a widespread system of health care. It implements a universal healthcare system, which exists alongside the private healthcare system. Infant mortality fell from 75 per 1000 live births in 1957 to 7 in 2013. Healthcare in Malaysia is divided into private and public sectors. Public provision is rather basic, especially in rural areas. The government produced a plan, 1Care for 1Malaysia, in 2009, with the intention of reform based on the principle ‚Äòuse according to need, pay according to ability‚Äô, but little progress towards its implementation has been made. Malaysian society places importance on the expansion and development of healthcare, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into public healthcare, an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of telehealth. Over the last couple of years, they have increased their efforts to overhaul the systems and attract more foreign investment. Hospitals The government hospitals have the country's best healthcare equipment and facilities apart from having specialists in the field. However, the main drawback is the shortage of staff in public hospitals compare to number of patients seeking treatment has led to long queues. Private hospitals are mostly located at urban areas and are equipped with the latest diagnostic and imaging facilities. Private hospitals were not seen as an ideal investment: it has often taken up to ten years before companies have seen any profits. However, the situation has now changed and companies are now exploring this area again, corresponding with the increased number of foreigners entering Malaysia for medical care and the recent government focus on developing the health tourism industry. The Government has also been trying to promote Malaysia as a health care destination, regionally and internationally. Government agencies have invested heavily in healthcare companies. About a third of private hospital beds are in concerns with government investment. Government policy and action The Malaysian government places importance on the expansion and development of health care, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into public health care‚Äîan increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of telehealth. A major problem with the health care sector is the lack of medical centres for rural areas, which the government is trying to counter through the development of and expansion of a system called \\"tele-primary care\\". Another issue is the overprescription of drugs, though this has decreased in recent years. Over the last couple of years, the Malaysian Health Ministry has increased its efforts to overhaul the system and attract more foreign investment. There is also an initiative by the Malaysian government to provide 1 Malaysia Clinic, a government based clinic that is free for all citizens. The medicine are usually cheap while consultations are free. Influenza The Malaysian government has developed a National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPP) which serves as a time bound guide for preparedness and response plan for influenza pandemic. It provides a policy and strategic framework for a multisectoral response and contains specific advice and actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Health at the different levels, other governmental departments and agencies and non- governmental organisations to ensure that resources are mobilised and used most efficiently before, during and after a pandemic episode. Since the Nipah virus outbreak in 1999, the Malaysian Health Ministry have put in place processes to be better prepared to protect the Malaysian population from the threat of infectious diseases. Malaysia was fully prepared during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) situation (Malaysia was not a SARS affected country) and the episode of the H5N1 (bird flu) outbreak in 2004. Medicine via Post In January 2011 the Malaysia government launched a program to renew prescriptions via mail. Medicine via Post targets patients with chronic diseases. To be eligible to participate patients have to receive a certification from a pharmacist that their condition is stable and that they understand how to properly use their medication. Patients pay delivery costs which are RM3.5 in Putrajaya, RM5.0 for other locations in Peninsular Malaysia, and RM8.0 for Sabah and Sarawak. The program is based on a pilot- project conducted at Putrajaya Hospital started in October 2009.Medicine via Post in govt hospitals, by Husa Yusop, 24 January 2012 Medical education The Malaysian health care system requires doctors to perform a compulsory three years service with public hospitals to ensure that the manpower in these hospitals is maintained. Doctors are required to perform 4 years including 2 years of housemanship and 2 years government service with public hospitals throughout the nation, ensuring adequate coverage of medical needs for the general population. Foreign doctors are encouraged to apply for employment in Malaysia, especially if they are qualified to a higher level. There is still, however, a significant shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists; thus, certain medical care and treatment are available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment. As a result, certain medical care and treatment is available only in large cities. The Malaysian takes its training of doctors seriously with usually time of 5 years degree with another 2 years of housemanship. The Malaysian Medical council currently oversees the medical profession in Malaysia. Some of the universities offering health care education in Malaysia is recognized overseas. Malaysia offers a strict healthcare training for medical professionals and research. All varieties offer a minimum 5 years of undergraduate degree in medicine, before undergoing another training. This is known as housemanship. The period of housemanship is for a period of 2 years before becoming a fully qualified general practitioner. The body overseeing the medical profession is known as the Malaysian Medical Council. The council was privatized as a corporate body.

It houses two Soviet-designed VVER-440/213 PWR reactors, with capacities of 507 MW each. It is one of Finland's two nuclear power plants, the other being the two-unit Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant. The reactors at Loviisa NPP went into commercial operation in 1977 and 1980 respectively. To comply with Finnish nuclear regulation, Westinghouse and Siemens supplied equipment and engineering expertise. This unorthodox mix of Western and Soviet enterprise led to the project developers being given the nickname \\"Eastinghouse\\". The plant is operated by Fortum Oyj. In 1996, the pressure vessel of Unit 1 was successfully heat annealed in order to clear embrittlement caused by neutron bombardment and impurities of the welding seam between the two halves of the vessel. The operating licence for both units has been renewed for a 50-year lifetime, Loviisa-1 to 2027 and Loviisa-2 to 2030. Fortum is reportedly considering applying for a further 20-year lifetime extension until 2050, which is a change from plans just a year earlier that would have seen the plant decommissioned on the earlier schedule. Fortum Power and Heat Oy applied to build a third reactor unit, to produce up to 1000 MWt of district heating supply and from 800 - 1,600 MW of electrical generation, which the Finnish government declined on 21 April 2010. Spent fuel from the reactors were planned to be stored permanently at the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository operated by Posiva. In 2014 Rolls-Royce took over the modernisation of safety-related systems for both units from an AREVA-Siemens consortium and the project was completed in 2018. Since then, both Unit 1 and Unit 2 are operating at a nominal 507 MW capacity after updates.

The gap is traversed by Virginia State Route 7. The Appalachian Trail also passes across the gap. Bear's Den and Raven Rocks are adjacent to the gap. During the autumn bird migration the gap is a favored spot for birdwatchers to count and study the many raptors that follow the ridge on their way south. Geography At the gap is approximately below the adjacent ridge line and above the surrounding countryside. Due to the dwindling height of the Blue Ridge as it approaches the Potomac River, Snickers Gap is one of the lowest wind gaps of the ridge in Virginia, with only Manassas Gap and the adjacent Keyes Gap being lower. The gap connects the northern Virginia piedmont with the lower Shenandoah Valley and serves as a main thoroughfare between the two regions. Snickers Gap road sign, where Virginia State Route 7 leaves Loudoun County and enters Clarke County History The gap has been a major thoroughfare between the Piedmont and the Shenandoah Valley since before the European colonization of the area. Native Americans originally cut a trail through the gap that continued to be used by white settlers. The gap was known as Williams' Gap until the early 1780s, when the modern name began to be used. The gap derived its name from Edward Snickers, who owned the gap and surrounding land and operated a ferry across the Shenandoah River on the western side of the gap. By the late 18th century the Snickersville Turnpike and the Snickers Gap Turnpike were completed, and Snickers Gap became the main thoroughfare between Loudoun County and the Shenandoah, bypassing Keyes Gap, which to that point had been the preferred route. The two turnpikes joined at Snickersville (present-day Bluemont) and then proceeded over the gap to Winchester. The toll at the gap persisted well into the 20th century. The Snickers Gap turnpike was eventually made into Virginia State Route 7, and the toll was dropped. The gap was the scene of many small American Civil War skirmishes, and part of the Battle of Cool Spring (sometimes referred to as the \\"Battle of Snicker's Gap\\") took place there.

History of Spivey Records The label recorded a wide variety of blues musicians who were friends of Spivey and Kunstadt, including Muddy Waters, Otis Spann, Big Joe Williams, Lonnie Johnson, Memphis Slim, and Louis Armstrong. Kunstadt had a rough and ready approach to recording; he was known to walk through the session and shout \\"More mistakes!\\" On March 2, 1962, Bob Dylan contributed harmonica and backing vocals to a recording session featuring Big Joe Williams. These tracks appeared on Spivey LP 1004, Three Kings And The Queen.Gray, The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, pp. 630-631 However, this was not Dylan's first recording session. He had already recorded his debut album Bob Dylan for Columbia Records, which was released on March 19, 1962. In recognition of her entrepreneurial achievements with Spivey Records, Spivey was awarded the \\"BMI Commendation of Excellence\\" in 1970. Victoria Spivey died in 1976. The label became dormant after the death of Len Kunstadt in 1996. In 2007, Len Kunstadt's niece, Lisa Weiner, announced the revival of the label on the Spivey Records website.

Written between 1921 and 1924, it received its first theatrical production under the title Im Dickicht (\\"In the jungle\\") at the Residenztheater in Munich, opening on 9 May 1923. This production was directed by Erich Engel, with set design by Caspar Neher. The cast included Otto Wernicke as Shlink the lumber dealer, Erwin Faber as George Garga, and Maria Koppenh√∂fer as his sister Mary. Im Dickicht was produced at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater in Berlin, where Brecht had been employed as a dramaturg. The production opened on 29 October 1924, with the same director and scenographer, but in a cut version with a new prologue (reproduced below) and the title Dickicht: Untergang einer Familie (\\"Jungle: decline of a family\\"). Fritz Kortner played Shlink and Walter Frank played George, with Franziska Kinz, Paul Bildt, Mathias Wieman, and Gerda M√ºller also in the cast. Willett and Manheim report that this production \\"was not a success\\".Willett and Manheim (1979, viii). Brecht revised the play almost to its final form‚Äînow with the title Im Dickicht der St√§dte and a subtitle proclaiming \\"the struggle between two men in the great city of Chicago\\"‚Äîin 1927, when it was produced at the Hessisches Landestheater in Darmstadt, directed by Carl Ebert.See Willett (1967, 24‚Äì25) and Willett and Manheim (1970). In the prologue to the play, Brecht informs his audience: :\\"You are in Chicago in 1912. You are about to witness an inexplicable wrestling match between two men and observe the downfall of a family that has moved from the prairies to the jungle of the big city. Don't worry your heads about the motives of the fight; concentrate on the stakes. Judge the contenders' technique impartially, and keep your eyes fixed on the finish.\\"Brecht (1927, 118).

Shlink is a wealthy lumber merchant and Garga is a book clerk. The play opens with Shlink and his accomplices, notably Skinny, The Worm, and The Baboon. He tries to buy Garga's opinion on a book, but Garga refuses to sell it. As a result, Shlink declares war on him and starts to destroy the bookshop. Maynes arrives and soon fires Garga. After Garga leaves, Shlink pays for the damage and departs. Garga arrives at the lumberyard, and Shlink makes himself Garga's servant. Garga accepts the challenge and immediately makes the business sell the same lot of lumber twice, thereby cheating one of the buyers. He invites a Salvation Army Officer into the room and promises to donate the entire building to him if the Officer will allow them to spit in his face. Shlink then goes over to the officer and spits at him. Shlink goes to live with The Worm. Garga's sister Marie moves in with him, having fallen in love. Garga's girlfriend Jane is also there, working as a whore for The Baboon. Soon thereafter Garga decides to go away to Tahiti. Shlink arrives at Garga's house and offers to work for them and provide them with money if they give him a place to stay. Although they all think that Garga has gone to Tahiti, it turns out that he never left Chicago. He soon goes to the hotel where Shlink is staying. When he learns that Marie is living there, he is upset that Shlink has taken over both his sister and his family. Garga starts to try to make Shlink marry Marie, but she becomes afraid and runs to Manky, who happily agrees to take her. Garga also makes Shlink give him all of his remaining money. Meanwhile, Garga has returned home and married his former girlfriend Jane after stealing her away from The Baboon. His family is living very nicely on the money that Shlink gave him. While celebrating the marriage dinner, Shlink arrives with a letter informing him that he will have to go to jail for three years for making a fraudulent lumber deal. Garga decides to go to jail instead even though it will destroy his family. When his mother hears this, she leaves the family. Garga writes a letter that accuses Shlink of raping his sister and violating his wife. He puts the letter into his pocket and tells his father that he will give the police the letter on the day that they release him from prison. Three years later Garga gives the police the letter. Shlink is forced to flee from his new lumber yard that he has built during those years. Garga takes some men and visits the Chinese Hotel in order to show them what has become of his sister and wife. Both Marie and Jane are now prostitutes in the hotel, and Jane refuses to even consider returning with Garga. Shlink manages to return to the hotel after setting fire to his lumber yard. He tells Garga that the fight is not yet over and that they need to flee immediately. In a tent outside of a Chicago, Garga realizes that the fight has been about trying to touch another person by hating them. However, he decides that the fight has gone on too long. Garga proclaims himself the victor and leaves. Marie arrives and watches as Shlink dies in the tent. She defends his dead body from an angry mob that has arrived to lynch him. Back in Chicago, Garga sells off the burnt down lumber yard to Manky. Garga decides to go to New York City.  Premiere interrupted by Nazis  In the Jungle of Cities premiered at the Residenz Theater (Residenztheater) in Munich on 9 May 1923, starring Erwin Faber and Otto Wernicke in the central roles of Garga and Schlink. The premiere was interrupted several times by Nazis, hooting, whistling and throwing stink bombs at the actors on the stage. It caused a scandal that became an anticipated part of premieres of Brecht's plays and musicals during the Weimar Republic.McDowell, W. Stuart. \\"Acting Brecht: The Munich Years,\\", The Brecht Sourcebook. (Routledge, 2000) p. 71‚Äì83. The production was directed by Erich Engel ‚Äì his first Brecht production in what was to become a long association with Brecht, lasting up to the time of Brecht's death in 1956. During a pause before the beginning of rehearsals, Brecht, Engel and Faber collaborated with Karl Valentin and other Munich actors to make a short, comic film, Mysteries of a Barbershop.McDowell, W. Stuart. (Winter, 1977) \\"A Brecht-Valentin Production: Mysteries of a Barbershop\\", Performing Arts Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 5.  Famous productions  The world-famous German director Peter Stein directed a landmark production of Im Dickicht der St√§dte at the Munich Kammerspiele in 1968, when he was Assistant Director there, and before he founded the very influential Schaub√ºhne am Halleschen Ufer in West Berlin a few years later. Dieter Laser, known to English-speaking audiences for his role as Dr. Josef Heiter in The Human Centipede (2010), made his film debut in the role of Collie Couch. Al Pacino starred in a short-lived production at the Circle in the Square Theatre in New York City in 1979, directed by the famous Romanian director Liviu Ciulei.http://www.ziarulring.ro/stiri/24523/liviu-ciulei- despre-rebengiuc-al-pacino-si-padurea-spanzuratilor Judith Malina directed a Living Theatre production of the play in New York, opening on 16 December 1960.Willett (1967, 25). In October 1991, Ruth Berghaus directed the play at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg as part of a series of 'related texts', as she called them (which also included B√ºchner's Danton's Death).Meech (1994, 54).

The Partido de Nicoya was a major part of what is now the Guanacaste province in Costa Rica. Originally the territory was bounded on the northeast by the La Flor river and Lake Cocibolca, or Lake Nicaragua, on the south by Costa Rica (Gulf of Nicoya, Tempisque River, Salto River), and on the east by a line that joins the northernmost part of the Gulf of Nicoya to the mouth of the San Juan River. Etymology The name is thought to derive from the Nahuatl words Nicoa and Necoclau, the latter which seems to mean peninsula; necoc meaning both sides and lau meaning sea. History Colonial church of Nicoya The Nicoya region was organized in 1554 as a Corregimiento or Alcald√≠a Mayor, under the direct control of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. In 1787, the Corregimiento was added to the Intendencia of the Le√≥n of Nicaragua. Nicoya was considered a Subdelegado of the Intendencia, and a subalterno of the Intendente of Le√≥n. In 1812, the Spanish Constitution divided the territory of the Kingdom of Guatemala into political parts. One of these was the Partido de Nicoya. In 1820, upon the administrative division of the Province of Nicaragua y Costa Rica, Nicoya became one of its Partidos, ruled by a Jefe Pol√≠tico Subalterno, in turn ruled by the Jefe Pol√≠tico Superior resident in Le√≥n. In 1821, on the division of Spain and the dissolution of the province of Nicaragua y Costa Rica, the Partido of Nicoya came under the primary authority of the governor of Granada de Nicaragua and then, in 1823, the governor of Le√≥n. Annexation of the Partido of Nicoya The people of Nicoya, in a public event called \\"cabildo abierto\\", the equivalent to modern referendums, decided to annex the Partido de Nicoya to the Republic of Costa Rica. On July 25, 1824, Nicoya was formally annexed to Costa Rica. Since then, the coat of arms of Nicoya states the words: \\"De la patria por nuestra voluntad\\" which could be translated as \\"part of the homeland by our own will\\".

The play is also translated as Round Heads and Peaked Heads, Roundheads and Peakheads (trans. N. Goold-Verschoyle, Grove Press 1966, reprinted 1994) or Roundheads and Pointheads (translation by Michael Feingold). The Goold-Verschoyle translation, the first English version of the play, was originally published in the U.S.S.R. in 1937. see Willett (1959, p.41). Margarete Steffin is named \\"Mitarbeiter\\" by Brecht in his Collected Works (1955). See Willett (1967, 42-43) and Thomson and Sacks (1994, 190). The play's subtitle is Money Calls to Money and its authors describe it as \\"a tale of horror.\\"Brecht (2001, 1). The play is a satirical anti-Nazi parable about a fictitious country called Yahoo in which the rulers maintain their control by setting the people with round heads against those with pointed heads, thereby substituting racial relations for their antagonistic class relations. The play is composed of 11 scenes in prose and blank verse and 13 songs. Unlike another of Brecht's plays from this period, The Mother, Round Heads and Pointed Heads was addressed to a wide audience, Brecht suggested, and took account of \\"purely entertainment considerations.\\"Brecht describes the play in this way in his essay \\"On the Use of Music in an Epic Theatre.\\" See Brecht (1964, 89). Brecht's notes on the play, written in 1936, contain the earliest theoretical application of his \\"defamiliarization\\" principle to his own \\"non-Aristotelian\\" drama.Brecht (1964, 103). History At the suggestion of Ludwig Berger, the theatre and film director, the play was first conceived in November 1931 as an adaptation of Shakespeare's Measure for Measure for the Young Actors' Group, to be premi√®red in January 1932 at the Berlin Volksb√ºhne.Willett (1967, 42-43) and Kuhn and Willett (2001, viii). Brecht considered this play to be Shakespeare's most philosophical and progressive work, which argued that \\"those in positions of authority [...] ought not to demand of their subjects a moral stance which they cannot adopt themselves.\\"Brecht writing in 1936 in the Copenhagen theatre journal Rundhoder og Spidshoder. See Kuhn and Willett (2001, ix, 304). Rehearsals for Brecht's play The Mother distracted him from developing the Round Heads project in December and its planned production in January failed to materialise, but Brecht and his collaborators returned to its development during 1932.Kuhn and Willett (2001, ix). The play was re-written in 1934 in preparation for a planned production under the direction of Per Knutzon in Copenhagen, which fears of censorship prevented. After another re-write in light of its premi√®re in 1936, the play was published in German in 1938.Kuhn and Willett (2001, x). Earlier versions of the play had already been published in Russian and English (published as Round Heads, Peak Heads: or, Rich and Rich Make Good Company, trans. N. Goold Verschoyle, in International Literature, 5 May 1937). Brecht did not return to the play after that date, though he did include it in his collected works of 1955. Productions After going into exile from Nazi Germany in 1933, Brecht sent the play to the Soviet playwright Sergei Tretyakov and offered it to theatres in Paris, London, New York, and Prague. Erwin Piscator considered directing the play in Moscow several times during 1935-36. Fears of censorship had prevented a planned production in Copenhagen in 1934 under the direction of Per Knutzon. The play finally received its premi√®re in a Danish-language production there two years later, which Ruth Berlau instigated.Thomson and Sacks (1994, 32). It opened on 4 November 1936 at the Riddersalen Theatre (a 220-seat venue), under the direction of Knutzon. Niels Bing played the Landlord, Lulu Ziegler (Knutzon's wife) played Nanna Callas, while Isbella was played by Astrid Schmahl.Willett (1967, 42-43). Svend Johansen designed the sets, based on ideas by the American designer Mordecai Gorelik.Kuhn and Willett (2001, x). The critical response was mixed. Brecht was not upset by this -- he remarked some years later that he had seen some people crying at the same scene that others were laughing at, \\"And I was satisfied with both.\\" Ewen (1967), citing Brecht's \\"Anmerkung zu Rundk√∂pfe...\\" in St√ºcke VI (1957-1967). Brecht thought it was \\"one of his best productions\\" so far, while it provoked a storm of protest from local fascists. The production ran for 21 performances. The play received its German premi√®re in 1948 in Dresden.Kuhn and Willett (2001, xii). Berlin saw productions of it in the East in November 1983 at the Deutsches Theater directed by Alexander Lang and a year and a half later in the West at Theatermanufaktur. Manfred Karge directed a production in 1993 at the Akademietheater in Vienna. Brecht's own company, the Berliner Ensemble, staged the play in 1998. The first US production was directed by Andy Doe in California in 1971, with music for 2 songs by Hanns Eisler and the rest by Lucy Coolidge. Under the title The Roundheads and the Pointeheads or The Rich Work Powerfully Well Together (published by The Risley Review of Reviews), Leonard Lehrman translated (with Gesa Valk), adapted (with Bill Castleman) and staged the first US production with all 14 of Eisler's songs (plus incidental music by Lehrman) in the original orchestrations in November 1973 at Cornell. In 1998, for the Hanns Eisler Centennial, Lehrman presented a concert version with piano and 6 singers of just the songs with narration, at West Park Church in Manhattan. This was in conformance with a note Brecht had written regarding the possibility of presenting the piece with just 6 singers. Eric Bentley, who was present, remarked that perhaps this was the best way to present the play, as the music is its strongest element. In the summer of 1981, coached by Bill Castleman, students presented song excerpts translated by Lehrman at the Aspen Festival under the direction of Martha Schlamme. An Off-Broadway production in New York City was mounted in 1985 from a new translation by Michael Feingold.Gussow, Mel. \\"Theater:Brecht's 'Roundheads and Pointheads'. New York Times (April 14, 1985) The Feingold translation also served as the basis for Uncivil Wars: Moving with Brecht and Eisler, an adaptation of the play which was created and directed by David Gordon. After several years of development, including a workshop at Cornell University that used the N. Goold-Verschoyle translation, it officially premiered at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in March 2009, and was subsequently performed at The Kitchen in New York City, and at the Alexander Kasser Theater of Montclair State University.\\"Uncivil Wars\\" at Peak Performances Gordon's production used all but one of the original Eisler songs, performed by Gina Leishman on piano, pump organ, accordion and ukulele. The piece was re-explored in Philadelphia in 2014.

The Ministry of Home Security was a British government department established in 1939 to direct national civil defence, primarily tasked with organising air raid precautions, during the Second World War. The Ministry for Home Security was headed by Sir John Anderson, the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. The Ministry's responsibilities covered all central and regional civil defence organisations, such as air raid wardens, rescue squads, fire services, and the Women‚Äôs Voluntary Service. It was also responsible for giving approval to local ARP schemes and providing public shelters. The Ministry, run under the auspices of the Home Office, produced hundreds of leaflets that were delivered to the population and advised on how to deal with the impending air raids. It also managed propaganda poster campaigns, such as to encourage the carrying of gas masks and volunteers to join civil defence groups like the Fire Guards. In October 1940, Sir John Anderson was replaced by Herbert Morrison in a reshuffle precipitated by Neville Chamberlain's resignation for ill health. With the Allied victory in Europe, the Ministry was disbanded in May 1945. Background Surprisingly, little had been done to defend against attacks on the civilian population during the First World War, and a need for such measures was seen in the years before 1939, so that plans for the new Ministry were in place when war broke out. Organisation The ministry came into existence following the passing of an order within the Ministers of the Crown (Emergency Appointments) Act 1939. This order transferred to the Minister of Home Security the statutory powers of the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Privy Seal. The former Lord Privy Seal, Sir John Anderson was appointed the first Minister of Home Security and Home Secretary. The new department he headed combined the Lord Privy Seal's Office and the Home Office ARP Department. Additional staff were recruited from other government ministries as well as local authorities. The ministry also took over control of the Industrial Air Raid Precautions Division from the Air Ministry. The ministry was responsible for two key wartime issues. Firstly, the coordination of all the civil defence services provided by other departments. Secondly, the overseeing of its own central and regional services and local authority civil defence services (including the approval of all ARP schemes, oversight of local authority civil defence services, arranging, building and delivering air raid shelters, sounding of air raid warnings (from 1943), the supply of ARP equipment, and the co-ordination and supervision of the civil defence regional organisation, which included the Civil Defence Rescue Service, Air Raid Warden Service, Fire Guard Service, Shelter Service, Women's Voluntary Service and the Civil Defence Reserve. The ministry set up 12 civil defence regions, each with a regional commissioner that coordinated, from May 1940, all local authority services. A central Home Security War Room in London collated information from 12 regional war rooms concerning air raids, casualties and where necessary the movement of civil defence personnel between regions. At its inception the ministry was organised in five divisions: # Air Raid Precautions Department # Fire and Police Services Division # Regional Organisation Division and Home Security War Room # Inspector General's Department # Public Relations and Civil Defence Personnel Division Ministry dissolved With victory in Europe the ministry was dissolved in May 1945 and any residual departments and functions falling under the control of the Home Office. Structure and responsibilities Twelve commissioners, acting for the government, were appointed to manage twelve regions of the UK. Their responsibilities included providing air raid shelters and air raid wardens, gas identification officers, ambulances, and rescue operations. Millions of gas masks were distributed, and almost five million people were enrolled as fire watchers and firefighters.

History The two involved clans, the Strangio-Nirta and Pelle-Vottari-Romeo families, both belong to the 'Ndrangheta crime organization. After a fight at a carnival celebration in 1991 turned ugly, two young men from Strangio-Nirta were killed, leading to a series of feuds.A mafia family feud spills over, BBC News, August 16, 2007 In May 1993, four people were killed in an hour.

Giorgi fled to Piedmont, but the family of Favasuli killed his brother Antonio Giorgi. The Nirta-Strangio clan reacted by shooting Francesco Pelle, \\"Ciccio Pakistan\\", while on the balcony with his newborn child. A bullet entered his back and he remained paralyzed. From his wheelchair he claimed revenge, and on Christmas Day, December 25, 2006, they attacked the house of a boss of the rival Nirta- Strangio clan, Giovanni Luca Nirta, killing his wife Maria Strangio. At the funeral of Maria Strangio, her cousin Giovanni Strangio appeared with gun, presumably to kill members of the Pelle-Romeo clan. He was arrested and released in July 2007. Until August 2007, five more murders and eight attempted murders in Calabria were attributed to the feud. During the reconstruction of Christmas at the trial in 2011 the prosecution said that there was a \\"state of war\\" between the two clans. Evidence collected by phone taps, interceptions and declarations of turncoats showed that the instigator of the attack was Francesco Pelle, also known as 'Ciccio Pakistan', while the order came from Franco Vottari. Among the perpetrators of the crime, was Sebastiano Vottari, a brother of Franco.

It was completed in 1940. In it, the great Roman general Lucullus appears after death before a judge and jury of the underworld, who are to decide whether he should be condemned to Hades or admitted to the Elysian fields. The jury, representing the lower classes, allows Lucullus to call as witnesses portrayed on a triumphal frieze. All the evidence is against Lucullus, except for the fact that he introduced the cherry tree to Europe, grieved over the destruction of books, and was possessed of a fine culinary experience. Though first conceived as an opera, the text was set to music by Paul Dessau. Communist authorities banned it, causing Brecht to revise scenes and changing the title to The Condemnation of Lucullus.

The game is based on the arcade game and film of the same name. The resulting product differed from the arcade version in several aspects, but kept the same underlying premise and style. By December 1988, there were two versions of the game available, distributed by Tengen and Mindscape, although the software itself was identical. After a lawsuit, Tengen's unlicensed version was pulled from the shelves and Mindscape's became the standard. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom gives the player control of Indiana Jones as he makes his way through the temple in a series of 12 levels or \\"waves.\\" In the final wave, the player must defeat the villain of the film, Mola Ram, on a rope bridge that recreates the final scene in the movie. Reception of the game was generally negative. Version history The film version of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released in 1984 and starred Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. A year later, in 1985, Atari Games capitalized on the franchise by releasing the initial version of the game on arcade machine. This version was a platform and fighting game and featured theme music and sound clips from the actual film. The game takes place over three zones that are based on the movie's plot, where the objective is to free the slave children and recover the Sankara stones. This version was also the first translated from any of the movies in the Indiana Jones series into an arcade game, although Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari 2600 and Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom for the Commodore 64 had come out in 1982 and 1985 respectively. Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was the best-selling console system and almost all video game developers and publishers wanted to contribute the video game library. The NES, at its peak, controlled 90% of the 8-bit market in the United States. Companies such as Konami, Capcom and Acclaim Entertainment derived many of their gaming ideas from two sources to better capitalize on the growing industry. The first strategy was to take games that were already popular on arcade, such as Contra, and port them to home console versions. Their second idea was to produce game versions of popular movies and television. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom satisfied both of these categories. Aside from the original arcade version, in 1987 ports were released for the Atari ST, Commodore 64 (completely independent ports for NTSC and PAL regions), Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, and MSX. By December 1988, the Nintendo Entertainment System had already seen two separate editions of the Temple of Doom game. The first version, distributed by Tengen, came in a black cartridge that was different from Nintendo's traditional grey colour format. By this point, however, Tengen had split from Nintendo and was producing unlicensed games that attempted to circumvent the need for a 10NES lockout chip. Nintendo filed suit and Tengen lost, forcing it to remove its NES games from the market. The officially licensed version was released by Mindscape in the form of a standard Nintendo cartridge. Aside from the differences in cover art and cartridge form, however, the actual software of the two games is identical. After the NES version, the game was subsequently released for the Amiga, DOS, and Apple II in 1989. There are several differences between the arcade game and its console adaptation. In the original arcade version, the Sankara Stones were not all found in one location at the end of a wave. Instead, Jones had to travel through a temple every two rounds. In addition, the entire style of play is different and bestows upon the player more weapons and items for Jones to collect from the slave children he frees. Jones was also unable to jump in previous incarnations of the game. Plot and gameplay The Sankara Stones in Wave 9. The plot of the NES version follows the storyline of the original movie. At the onset of the game, Jones has just reached the Pankot Palace featured in the movie and is preparing to free the slave children, recover the missing Sankara Stones and defeat Mola Ram and his Thuggee entourage. The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout and the manner in which one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions. The player advances through 12 levels (called \\"waves\\"), the first nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies. Wave 9 requires the player to cross a river of lava by stunning the monsters that live there. Once across, Jones must grab the Sankara Stones to progress to the Map Room where he can use the map pieces he has collected to figure out where the secret door exit is in Wave 10. Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass requires the use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones. Wave 11 leads to the exit and Wave 12 recreates the scene with the rope bridge and the final battle with Mola Ram. The game contains a variety of elements that both aid and hinder the player's progress through the waves. At his disposal, Jones has TNT, guns, swords, hats for extra lives, jewels for extra time and his classic whip. Opposing him are bats, rats, snakes, spiders and an endless supply of Thugee servants. In addition, if Jones lands in any of the lava pits, crashes a mine cart or hits a boulder or spike trap, he loses one life. Reception Although hyped up in Nintendo Power's \\"Video Shorts\\" section as an upcoming release, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom met with generally negative reception. Aside from the difficulty level of the game, the official reviewer for the Indiana Jones fan community TheRaider.net noted that Jones' new jumping ability is glitchy, causing him to leap downwards no matter which direction he is facing, unless the player is holding down the button for the particular direction in which they want to jump. Also cited as flaws are poor controls, unappealing graphics, the number of enemies, and the text-only ending screen. The reviewer admitted, however, that the game's \\"respectable attempt to preserve John Williams' musical score\\" was one of its only highlights. The original arcade version was the first Atari System 1 game to talk to the players using speech capability, a feature lacking in the console version due to the limitations of the hardware. The arcade game, like the console adaptation, obtained its theme music (as well as sound effects that were absent on the NES version) from the film itself. Skyler Miller, a reviewer at Allgame who compared the console adaptation to the original game, admitted that the graphics are \\"recognizable,\\" but claims that the version is \\"missing much of the original's detail and character.\\" Miller's final judgment was to call it \\"a passable effort\\" and to compare unfavourably to the arcade version. Edward J. Semrad, a contemporary technical writer and computer specialist with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel included the game in his list of games that were \\"watered- down versions of what we see in the arcades\\" and praised the PC version for its superiority.

The term is frequently employed in the field of child development and playwork for the assessment of toys, games, equipment and spaces. When they are fun and engaging, playthings and spaces are said to have play value; those that are quickly discarded or are considered uninteresting do not. In short, objects of play must be compelling and encourage the child's involvement in order to have true play value. Play value has been defined as 'how much play can you get out of something'. Classic toys are examples of toys with true play value as they continue to provide new discoveries and adventures in each subsequent session of play..  Assessment of play value in the selection of toys and games  The selection of toys and games has long been a concern to parents and educators. Many fail to sufficiently engage children. Stevanne Auerbach emphasizes that products should last as long as possible and have many different and long lasting uses. Good examples of toys with high play value are blocks, construction toys and yo-yos. The toy should have clear instructions so the parent and child are guided to its best use by the designer and manufacturer. In playwork terms it is the child who determines the play value of an object rather than adults or instruction manuals  Multiple uses  Toys tend to have high play value when they may be used, engaged and employed in manifold ways. A good example is Lego bricks which may be assembled and connected in myriad ways to make cars, trucks, planes, trains, etc. Another good example is polymer clay which may be used for sculpting hand-shaped items, such as beads, jewelry, and charms.  Self- directed play  Children need to be in charge of their own play activity. According to PBS' The Whole Child Web site when adults plan the play activity and structure the outcome of playtime it is far less effective than if children have the freedom to form their own ideas, practice skills and use playthings at their own speed. Cardboard box toys are an example of playthings which allow children to use their own imaginations.PBS - The Whole Child: ABC's of Child Development  Appeal to more than one age or stage of development  Playability is a word that when applied to games has a similar meaning to play value. Those games with strong playability appeal to more than one age or stage of development. For example, Monopoly and Risk are two games that appeal to a wide range of ages, though generally not to very young children. Similarly, toys that appeal to more than one age or stage tend to have higher play value.  Inverse relationship with linkage to TV, movies and video games  Authors Nancy Carlsson-Paige & Diane LevinNancy Carlsson-Paige & Diane Levin note that play value in toys can be seen as inversely related to their degree of linkage with TV, movies and video games. For example, G.I. Joe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Power Rangers are all examples of toys that have cross-feeds with television shows that have violent themes. Similarly, Godzilla, Small Soldiers, Spawn, Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers toys are marketed to children 4 and up.  Complement or supplement other play activities  Computer games or electronic toys are examples of toys that can complement or supplement other play activities. According to author Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett,Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett while often stimulating, engaging and fun, these toys should never become a substitute for traditional play activities such as drawing, pretending, or block building. Instead, electronic games are best thought of as adding to or reinforcing other kinds of play, and are not a suitable replacement for parental interaction and attention. Children playing with marbles  Stay with children as they develop  Classic toys such as Mr. Potato Head, the Radio Flyer wagon and Chutes and Ladders or in a general sense, spanning generations, the teddy bear, stay with a child as he or she develops new interests and matures. They \\"stand the test of time\\", and evolved can accompany a child into more and more elaborate play when social surroundings, life and a knowledge of history (for example) create diversified and extended ideas. Organized toy kingdoms can grow up in the rooms of European children. Named stuffed animals or dolls often occupy lifelong positions of honor, as visualized imaginary friends, in the lifetimes of sociable people with many real friends.  Promote respectful interaction  Toys have greater play value that promote respectful, non- violent and non-stereotyped interaction among children. For example, Barbie is an example of a toy that reinforces gender stereotypes for girls despite its status as a classic toy.  Useful for further learning  Play value from a child development perspective is enhanced by toys and games that help children develop skills useful for further learning and mastery such as Scrabble and The Game of Life TRUCE In playwork terms - play value is the individual child's subjective assessment of the space and the equipment available to them, rather than a pre-conceived adult idea about what sorts of play are 'valuable'. 'Play value' and 'the value of play' are two separate judgements in playwork - the former chiefly made by children, and the latter chiefly made by adults.

The play was jointly written with Lion Feuchtwanger and was completed during their exile in Los Angeles. Set in France in 1940, it portrays Joan as the patron saint of the resistance movement against the Germans. It was first staged in Frankfurt am Main, in 1957. In the play, an adolescent girl named Simone works at a gas station in central France. Her older brother is a soldier in the army, and the Wehrmacht forces are approaching. While engrossed in a book about Saint Joan, she slips into a series of dreams in which the real persons in her life take on other identities. Her brother appears as an angel, her boss as the coward Connetand, and herself as Saint Joan who helps starving refugees and defies her employer. In real life she sets fire to a secret supply of gasoline before the Germans can get to it. In her dream she is captured and sentenced to death, but in real life she is not yet considered a saboteur. The Germans hand her over to the French as a mere arsonist, and she is led away by nuns to a mental institution.

It dramatises the rise and fall of the Paris Commune in 1871. The play is an adaptation of the 1937 play The Defeat by the Norwegian poet and dramatist Nordahl Grieg.When the Nazis had invaded Norway in 1940 Grieg escaped to Britain, and served in his country's government in exile. He also served as a war correspondent and observer for operational missions for the RAF, and died in 1943 after being shot down during a raid on Berlin. Brecht's collaborator Margarete Steffin translated the play into German in 1938 and Brecht began working on his adaptation in 1947. The process was driven by another Brecht collaborator, Ruth Berlau, who had introduced Brecht to Grieg in 1931. The work forgoes the individual dramatic hero and focuses on the Paris Commune itself, a collective composite of people. The scenes shift between the different lives of people, going from the street corners of Montmartre to the Paris City Council. On this council, the enemies of the Commune, Thiers and Bismarck, engineer its collapse. The play details an event that is considered to be the original proletarian revolution and a major event in the socialist revolution. Karl Marx viewed the Commune - which remained the only attempt at a decidedly socialist government during his lifetime - as the prelude of a classless communist society. Brecht's play develops a Leninist interpretation of the Commune. It is one of the main sources for the first act of Luigi Nono's opera Al gran sole carico d'amore. It was performed on the 100th anniversary of the Paris Commune, in March, 1971, in two performances at Harvard University and at Yale University under the direction of Leonard Lehrman.

It serves as the campus of the Regional Science High School Union system for the Cordillera Administrative Region. Considered as one of the most prestigious schools in the region, the school was established in November 18 on the Philippine school year 1994-1995. History The school is among the eleven Regional Science High Schools established in the country in the school year 1994-1995 by virtue of DECS order No . 69, s. 1993. It is operated and supervised by the Department of Education. It is also dependent on funds provided by the Department of Education and not the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), as was a popular misconception. The school opened in the school year 1994-1995 with an enrollment of 86 first-year students. It operated under the Benguet National High School until Republic Act No. 8376, authored by then Congressman Ronald M. Cosalan, entitled ‚ÄúAn Act Establishing the Cordillera Regional Science High School in La Trinidad, Benguet and Appropriating Funds Therefor‚Äù was approved on November 13, 1997. From June 1994 to December 1998, the school used the Benguet School Teacher's Association building in the barangay hall and warehouse at the Puguis Elementary School site for its classes. The school was transferred to its present site at Wangal on January 4, 1999. School curriculum CRSHS implements the curriculum for Regional Science High Schools prescribed by the Department of Education, which is different from the 2003 Basic Education Curriculum (BEC). The CRSHS curriculum is enriched with science, mathematics and English subjects, although Filipino, MAPE and TLE are also included. For Technology Livelihood and Economics (TLE), the only component offered is computer education and it is only given to the first and second year students. The curriculum is prescribed by the Dep-Ed central office. The school year 2003-2004 was the first year of implementation of the 2003 Revised Curriculum for Regional Science High Schools. It was implemented in the First Year level, and the old students were left to graduate with the old curriculum. The main differences between the old and new curriculum are the time allotment and elective subjects. Physical facilities=Land The school is located on a 1,732 square meter lot area adjacent to the Dep-Ed- CAR Regional office. The lot was donated by the Provincial government of Benguet through Governor Raul M. Molintas. Building There are two primary buildings, a laboratory complex, and an extension building. The two primary buildings consists of eight classrooms utilized for classes, a science laboratory room, a computer room, a faculty room, two offices, two female comfort rooms, and two male comfort rooms. The three classrooms of the first floor of the first building can be merged to form a multi-purpose hall for programs and events. The laboratory complex contains the physics and chemistry labs. Last October 2016, a building with two classrooms, made purposely for the Senior High, was completed after construction started last November 2015. It was turned over to the school on its foundation anniversary on November 9 of the same year. Equipment Cordillera Regional Science High School is among the few schools in CAR that has various school equipment. Aside from the equipment received from other agencies, Dep-Ed CAR, and the division office of Benguet, it had been receiving a special MOOE fund of 2 million per year from CY 1997 to CY 2002. The amount has been used to purchase science, math and English equipment. Based on the Regional Science High School manual issued by Dep-Ed, the maximum number of students per class is 36.

The original Lenz play was produced in 1774 and is also known by the title \\"The Advantages of a Private Education\\". Brecht contributed few additions to the plot of the original work, but made many cuts and alterations.Parker, S. (2014). Bertolt Brecht: A Literary Life A&C; Black. Brecht's work is two thirds the length of the original play and over half the material is new.Subiotto, A. V. (1975). Bertolt Brecht's Adaptations for the Berliner Ensemble MHRA. The play was Brecht's first production which featured work from the German Classical Era for the Berliner Ensemble.Parker, S. (2014). Bertolt Brecht: A Literary Life A&C; Black Overall, it was the third production the Berliner Ensemble performed.Wekwerth, M., & Hozier, A. (2011). Daring to Play : A Brecht Companion (1st ed.). Hoboken: Taylor and Francis. Brecht himself directed this production. 'The Tutor' was translated by Ralph Manheim and Wolfgang Sauerlander. Plot Lauffer is a tutor who earns a meagre living teaching a retired major's two children. When he tries to negotiate his salary it is cut by his masters. The major's daughter and Lauffer's student, Gussie, seduces Lauffer and becomes pregnant by him. Pursued by the major and his friends, Lauffer runs away and takes refuge with a village schoolmaster, Wenceslas. There he becomes attracted to the schoolmaster's ward and, to prevent repetition of the previous disaster, castrates himself. He then finds that he is acceptable to all, and eventually marries the girl. Lauffer is then acclaimed as the perfect teacher and entrusted with the education of Germany's youth.French, S. (2012). The Tutor. Retrieved June 21, 2014, Retrieved from http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/4328/tutor-the Historical Context Post World War II, Germany was split in four zones by the allied powers. By 1949, these zones had essentially become an \\"eastern\\" and \\"western\\" block. The Federal Republic of Germany was founded in the west with the promulgation of the basic law on 23 May 1949. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) was founded in the \\"eastern zone\\" on 7 October 1949.Schayan, J. (16 April 2009). 30 german years: 1950-1980. Retrieved 25 June 2014, Retrieved from https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/politics/germany-europe/30-german- years-1950-1980 In 1950, the German Democratic Republic was finding its new direction as a socialist state. In this defining time, Germans were hopeful of disassociating themselves from the horrors of Nazism and World War II. As a lesson to the German people, Brecht adapted a play from its past, Lenz's 'The Tutor', to serve as a pointed warning and reminder of the nation's history.Bryant-Bertail, S. (2000). Space and Time in Epic Theater: The Brechtian legacy (Illustrated ed.) Boydell & Brewer. Lenz wrote 'The Tutor' prior to the French Revolution in 1789, which changed not only the social structure of Europe, but also Germany. This parallels the social changes faced by Germany post World War II, especially in the eastern block which had adopted socialism. Brecht's play drew upon the themes of subverting class in the original to remind the German people that they had control of their future and that they did not need to subject themselves to a ruling class. Brecht was specifically targeting the German intellectuals and their habit of \\"intellectual servitude\\" to the higher classes. In the play, Lauffer's self- castration was representative of the moral collapse of German intellectuals and educators during the Nazi era. Brecht aimed to portray this as negative in order to prevent the cycle of blind servitude from beginning again.

He also was a magazine founder, an author, and the chief organizer of the LDS Church's efforts to build a number of historical monuments in the early 1900s. Early Life and education Born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, Wells was the son of LDS Church leader Daniel H. Wells and his fourth wife, Hannah Corrilla Free. He studied at the University of Deseret. On 17 June 1879 Wells married Helena Middleton Fobes.Richard N. Holzapfel. \\"Junius F. Wells\\" in Arnold K. Garr, Donald Q. Cannon and Richard O. Cowan ed, Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History, p, 1326 Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association leadership In 1875, church president Brigham Young organized the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association. The first implementation of the organization was in the Salt Lake 13th Ward, with Junius F. Wells as president. Among his counselors was Heber J. Grant. In 1876, Young selected Wells to lead the organization throughout the church. In 1880, John Taylor released Wells from his duties and revised the leadership of the YMMIA, appointing Wilford Woodruff as the general superintendent. After Wells's release, the church's organization for young men would be led by general authorities of the church until 1935. The Contributor and other works Wells was also the founding editor and publisher of The Contributor, an independent publication that sought to represent the YMMIA and the church's equivalent organization for young women. Wells continued in these roles until 1892, when the magazine was purchased by the Cannon family and Abraham H. Cannon became the editor and publisher. The Contributor ceased publication in 1896. Wells was also the author of eleven biographies, including those of John C. Fr√©mont, Thomas L. Kane, Charles C. Rich, James A. Garfield, and Orson Pratt.Mormon Literature Database: Junius Free Wells. He also authored numerous articles and short stories, the majority of which appeared in The Contributor. Mormon historical monuments In 1884, Wells visited the birthplace of church founder Joseph Smith in Sharon, Vermont, and conceived a plan to build a monument to the Mormon prophet.Susa Young Gates, \\"Memorial Monument Dedication\\", Improvement Era, Feb. 1906. Under the direction of Joseph F. Smith, Wells oversaw the construction of the Joseph Smith Birthplace Memorial in 1905. The monument was dedicated by Smith on December 23, 1905, the 100th anniversary of Joseph Smith's birth.Mormon Historic Sites Registry: Joseph Smith Monument . Wells also was the chief organizer in having a monument erected by the church to the Three Witnesses in Richmond, Missouri, in 1911.Junius F.

Although not a destination resort, Le Relais provides a very good ski experience thanks to the skiable field which can be entirely snow-covered artificially. Moreover, all of the tracks are well illuminated attracting a lot of people for night skiing. Le Relais is also the home of the Centre national acrobatique Yves Laroche (CNAYL), an aerial skiing center. The CNAYL has a water ramp making summer training possible. In summer Le Relais becomes an adventure center providing five high rope courses better known in the region as arbre en arbre.  History  Le Relais was founded in 1936, but the idea of it came during the 1933-1934 winter. At that time, it was suggested to locate the ski center on the Plains of Abraham but Herman \\"Jackrabbit\\" Smith-Johannsen, proposed another location : the Murphy mountain. The mountain of the actual site of Le Relais was then bought for the price of $1000. $8500 was raised to build a small lodge at the bottom of the mountain.

At the 60th Locarno International Film Festival, where Vexille made its world premiere, the film was sold to 75 countries, including the United States-based distributor, Funimation Entertainment; however since that time the number increased to 129 countries. Plot By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed ‚Äî 270 off- shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror ‚Äî the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine. In actuality, the disease was created by Daiwa and the \\"vaccine\\" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing experimental nanotechnology. Every Japanese citizen was converted into a form of synthetic life. But there were unforeseen side effects; the conversion was imperfect, resulting in the infected humans losing their free will and becoming just lifelike machines. Some of the nanotech went amok, creating the \\"Jags\\", giant whirling constructs of semisentient metal that prowl the wilderness. The Jags destroyed all of Japan, save Tokyo which is protected by an inedible wall of ceramic. The Resistance plans to draw the Jags along a service bridge to Daiwa's corporate headquarters, which now stands in the middle of Tokyo Bay. Vexille volunteers her assistance (and that of her flight-capable armor). However, though Vexille and Maria succeed in drawing the Jags to the end of the service bridge, the bridge has been detached from the headquarters, the Jags fall into the sea, and Vexille and Maria are captured. They are taken to Kisaragi, the master of Daiwa, who boasts that his research is nearly complete. And as he needs more test subjects, he is going to invade America. Vexille attacks him with a hidden knife, revealing that his blood is still human ‚Äî he has not used the process himself. Saito, then strangles him. The town council forces the ceramic gates open, destroying Tokyo and enabling the Jags to enter Daiwa's headquarters. Kisaragi, having somehow survived, shoots Saito and escapes with his research. The underling then releases Vexille and Maria before succumbing to his wounds. Vexille pursues Kisaragi while Maria frees Leon, who shows concern for Vexille, angering Maria. Thus when Vexille prevents Kisaragi's escape in a helicopter, Maria grabs him and holds them together as a Jag devours them. Vexille and Leon are rescued by a SWORD helicopter just as Daiwa headquarters collapses into the bay, along with every Jag in Japan. As Vexille and Leon are flown from a now completely lifeless Japan, Vexille comments that humanity's spirit can never be taken away. Cast=Japanese *Meisa Kuroki as Lt. Cdr.

McEvoy also orchestrated and programmed the score. Reception This movie has been said to have a Resident Evil-like plotline and has drawn many comparisons to the movie. A review of the DVD on website IGN gave this film 6 out of 10, finding it difficult to follow and riddled with plot holes. They also found fault with the soundtrack, particularly Paul Oakenfold's score: \\"A couple of tracks manage to rise to the occasion, but for the most part, Vexille's tunes feel limp and repetitive.\\" Hyper comments on the film for \\"retreading of familiar territory already covered effectively by Ghost in the Shell\\". It commends the visuals for its \\"cel-shading and rotoscoping, leading to some incredibly impressive looking set pieces\\". However, it criticises the action scenes which \\"aren't nearly as exciting as they should be ‚Äî most of the action scenes boil down to rather mundane gun fights or chases, and while they look great there's no real energy in them.\\" It currently has a 60% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Following the establishment of the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) in October 1955, the Special Forces were formed at Nha Trang in February 1956. During the rule of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, the Special Forces were run by his brother, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, until both were assassinated in November 1963 in a coup. The Special Forces were disbanded in 1975 when South Vietnam ceased to exist after the Fall of Saigon. Early years The Special Forces came into being at Nha Trang in February 1956 under the designation of the First Observation Battalion/Group (FOG). By 1960, most Special Forces units were involved in the FOG program. At Long Th√†nh, they were trained in intelligence gathering, sabotage and psychological operations (PSYOP). The main duties of the Special Forces entailed the recruitment and training of one-to-four man teams in intelligence, sabotage, and psychological warfare missions in North Vietnam. The success of these missions was poor. Although minor sabotage and unrest was fomented, Hanoi declared that all agents were to be killed or captured. Those who were captured were interrogated and executed. In 1961, the Special Forces and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 1st Infantry Division, based in the northernmost area of South Vietnam, conducted a joint operation against Communist infiltrators in northern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. In the autumn of 1961, Special Forces units began Operation Eagle at B√¨nh H∆∞ng with a night parachute assault. In September 1962, United States Special Forces personnel assumed responsibility of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)'s border surveillance and Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) programs and began working with the ARVN Special Forces. The Special Forces continued to expand and began to increasingly operate with the CIDG. Di·ªám era ARVN and US Special Forces During the rule of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, the Special Forces were used mainly for repressing dissidents. Despite the fact that South Vietnam was struggling against the communist insurgency of the Viet Cong in the rural areas, the Special Forces were mostly kept in the capital Saigon, where they were used to prevent coups or harass regime opponents. Under Di·ªám, the Special Forces were headed by Colonel L√™ Quang Tung, who had been trained by the CIA in the United States and commanded some 1,840 men under the direction of Nhu. Tung's most notable military activity was leading a group run by the CIA, in which ARVN personnel of northern origin were sent into North Vietnam, posing as locals, in order to gather intelligence as well as sabotaging communist infrastructure and communications. They were trained in bases at Nha Trang, ƒê√† N·∫µng and sometimes offshore in Taiwan, Guam and Okinawa. Of the eighty groups of operatives, numbering six or seven per group, that were deployed in 1963 via parachute drops or night time sampan journeys, nearly all were captured or killed. Those who were captured were often used for propaganda by the North Vietnamese. Tung was heavily criticised for his management of the operations. Buddhist crisis In 1963, South Vietnam faced civil unrest in the face of Buddhist protests against discrimination by the Catholic-oriented Di·ªám regime. In the wake of the shootings of nine Buddhist protesters on the birthday of Gautama Buddha for defying a ban on the Buddhist flag, mass protests calling for religious equality erupted around the country. With opposition to Di·ªám growing, Nhu plotted an attack against X√° L·ª£i Pagoda, the largest Buddhist centre in Saigon, where the movement was organizing its activities. Tung's special forces under Nhu's orders were responsible for the raid on 21 August 1963, in which 1,400 monks were arrested and hundreds were estimated to have been killed, as well as extensive property damage. These attacks were replicated across the country in a synchronised manner. Following the attacks, U.S. officials threatened to withhold aid to the Special Forces unless they were used in fighting communists, rather than attacking dissidents. Another infamous religious assault on the Buddhist community was carried out by Tung's men in 1963. In a small pond near ƒê√† N·∫µng, a hugely oversized carp was found swimming. Local Buddhists began to believe the fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond grew larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among the district chief and his officials, who answered to Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n, another younger brother of Di·ªám. The pond was mined, but the fish swam on unhindered. After raking the pond with machine gun fire, the fish still lived. To deal with the problem, Tung's forces were called in. The pond was grenaded, killing the carp. The incident generated more publicity as newspapers across the world ran stories about the miraculous fish. ARVN helicopters began landing at the site, with ARVN paratroopers filling their bottles with water which they believed had magical powers. Tung was reported to have been planning an operation at the request of Nhu to stage a government organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung and his operatives would assassinate U.S. ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., other key officials and Buddhist leader Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang, who was given asylum after being targeted in the pagoda raids. On 1 November 1963, a coup was launched by the ARVN against Di·ªám. Knowing Tung was a loyalist who would order his Special Forces to defend Di·ªám, the generals invited him to Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters on the pretext of a routine meeting. He was arrested and later executed along with his deputy and younger brother, L√™ Quang Tri·ªáu. Di·ªám and Nhu were also executed after being captured at the end of the successful coup and the ARVN's leadership consequently changed. In 1964, the U.S. Army's 5th Special Forces Group was officially assigned to Vietnam. The LLDB worked closely with the U.S. command and although the Americans funded the CIDG camps, the LLDB assumed ultimate responsibility. These camps were commanded by the ARVN Special Forces, supplemented by U.S. Special Forces advisors. From 24 June to 1 July 1964 under Project DELTA, LLDB teams performed five parachute drops into Laos to gather intelligence. By 1965, LLDB personnel were working with the ARVN in recruiting and training as well as sending groups into communist areas in South Vietnam to gather information. US Special Forces referred to the LLDB as \\"LL\\" or \\"LIMA-LIMA\\" using the phonetic alphabet. Over the radio they were called \\"XRAY\\" so it would not reveal the unit as CIDG.  1970s  In March 1970, aware of the impending withdrawal of U.S. Special Forces from Vietnam as part of a general withdrawal, the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) agreed to convert CIDG camps into ARVN Border Ranger camps. The most highly regarded of the CIDG units, the Mobile Strike Force followed the conversion and integration into the ARVN as well. The LLDB were eventually disbanded. The former indigenous reconnaissance team personnel previously assigned to work with MACV-SOG (the US military reconnaissance office for MACV) were regrouped into the Intelligence Directorate of the JGS. This directorate was usually known by the nickname \\"the 7th Technical Directorate\\" and was divided into three sections: * the Coastal Defense Office to deal and manage with all maritime-related reconnaissance activities. * the Liaison Office to manage the reconnaissance and military intelligence in the northern part of South Vietnam and the adjoining tri-border area (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia). * the Topography Office to manage the field reconnaissance activities within South Vietnam. The ARVN also fielded an airborne-qualified special strike unit, 81st Airborne Ranger group (Vietnamese: Li√™n ƒëo√†n 81 Bi·ªát c√°ch d√π), under the direct command of the JGS. It can be counted as part of the Special Forces and was under the Special Forces command, later being placed under the JGS command. The unit was bloodied during the 1968 Tet Offensive and the 1972 Easter Offensive when it was launched into battle to relieve the garrison of An L·ªôc northwest of Saigon from a People's Army of Vietnam siege. Some former LLDB personnel were formed into a new clandestine unit, the Vietnamese Special Mission Service (SMS), while others went to serve in the Republic of Vietnam National Police Field Force (Vietnamese: C√£nh S√°t D√£ Chi√™n ‚Äì CSDC).Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 39. Approximately 5,000 personnel served in the Special Forces during the Vietnam War. After the Fall of Saigon, those who did not managed to escape were sent to reeducation camps. Effectiveness The LLDB's largest operation occurred with the CIDGs, an immense network of ethnic minorities and montagnards funded and trained with CIA-U.S. Special Forces resources. Historically, the South Vietnamese considered such minorities inferior, especially the semi-primitive mountain tribes, and this diminished effective cooperation and a mutual sense of purpose between the LLDB and its Central Highland militia. Command and control was frequently strained, a factor that contributed to an unsuccessful rebellion in September 1964, by tribal groups loyal to the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (FULRO).Kelly, Francis J. U.S. Army Special Forces, 1961-1971. 1973.Reske, Charles F. MACV-SOG Command History, Annex B. Vols. 1 and 2. 1990.Simpson, Charles M., III. Inside the Green Berets. 1983.Stanton, Shelby. Green Berets at War. 1985. The degree to which the tribal minorities influenced the war cannot be underestimated. They provided intelligence, acted as scouts, and in many cases became effective guerrilla soldiers. Thus, the South Vietnamese, despite their racist attitudes, needed the assistance they received from the montagnards, and U.S. Special Forces and Australian Special Air Service (SAS) advisers acted as intermediaries when clashes occurred between the LLDB and the montagnards. Ultimately, however, the advisers could not exercise complete jurisdiction because the South Vietnamese were technically, though not realistically, in charge of these programs. During the period of Vietnamization (1969-1972), the number of U.S. advisers was reduced, then eliminated, which forced the LLDB to assume complete control over tens of thousands of ethnic troops, which the ethnic troops resented.

Marriage negotiations  A member of the House of Poitiers, Philip was one of the younger sons of Bohemond IV, a Norman who ruled the Principality of Antioch and the County of Tripoli, and his first wife, Plaisance of the Genoese Embriaco family. Raymond-Roupen, Philip's first cousin who had waged the War of the Antiochene Succession with Philip's father for many years, also claimed the throne of Cilicia as the former heir designate of King Leo I. Upon his defeat and imprisonment by Constantine of Baberon, regent on behalf of Leo's daughter Isabella, the Armenians wanted to renew their alliance with Antioch. They requested that Bohemond IV send a husband to their young queen, and Bohemond offered Philip. Since Philip was Bohemond's fourth son, who could not be expected to inherit Antioch, the Armenians accepted. They made the union conditional upon Philip joining the Armenian Apostolic Church, to which Bohemond agreed.  Reign  Philip's marriage to Isabella was celebrated in June 1222. Before his coronation as king, Philip swore to uphold the rites of the Armenian Apostolic Church and Armenian customs. Philip's victory over the attacking Seljuk Turks made a good initial impression upon his subjects. Their hopes that Philip would become a good Armenian, however, were frustrated, as he had \\"incorrigibly Latin tastes\\". Philip spent as much time as he could in Antioch, showed favoritism towards his French advisors, and refused to adhere to Armenian Apostolic rites. This instigated a revolt by the Armenians. In late 1224, Philip was arrested during a night journey to Antioch. He was accused of stealing the crown jewels of Cilicia and sending them to Antioch. He spent months imprisoned in the fortress of Partzerpert near Sis, the Cilician capital, while his father appealed to Constantine. The negotiations were in vain, and Philip was poisoned in prison in 1225. Bohemond planned to avenge his son's death, but was prevented when his allies, the Ayyubids, switched to the side of the Armenians.

Theodore Roosevelt in Rough Rider uniform Roosevelt's World War I volunteers was a proposed military volunteer formation of Americans to fight in France for the Allies. Background In his book Foes of Our Own Household (1917), Theodore Roosevelt explains that he had authorization from Congress to raise four divisions to fight in France, similar to his earlier Rough Riders, the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and to the British Army 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers. He had selected eighteen officers (including Seth Bullock, Frederick Russell Burnham, James Rudolph Garfield, John M. Parker, and Henry L. Stimson) and directed them to actively recruit volunteer troops shortly after the United States entered the war. With the help of John Hays Hammond, the New York-based Rocky Mountain Club enlisted Major Burnham to raise the troops in the Western states and to coordinate recruitment efforts. Wilson ultimately rejected Roosevelt's plan and the volunteer Army disbanded. After several months of correspondence with Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, Roosevelt sent this telegram to President Woodrow Wilson: President Wilson, as Commander-in-chief, sent back this response: Roosevelt then sent the following to the men who had volunteered for immediate service on the firing line in the Divisions which Congress authorized: A few days later, Roosevelt sent this letter to all the men who had done work in personally raising units for the proposed Divisions which had been authorized by Congress: In his correspondence with President Wilson and the Secretary of War, Roosevelt did not mention the fact that he was planning to recruit at least one regiment, and perhaps a brigade (two regiments) of African-American troops for the division. He discussed plans for raising and equipping such a unit with F. S. Stover, a wealthy Philadelphia businessman who was raising funds for the proposed division. In May, 1917, while he waited for Wilson's response to his proposal, he offered command of the regiment (or the brigade, if one were formed) to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Young, the senior African- American officer in the Regular Army, a friend and associate of W.E.B. DuBois, and author of a systematic study of the cultural bases of military power, The Military Morale of Races and Nations (1912). Roosevelt had known Young since 1901, had great respect for his talents, and in 1904 had appointed him to the newly formed Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff. On May 8, 1917 Young had written to ask Roosevelt's help in opposing the Army's effort to force his retirement for supposed medical reasons. In fact, the army wanted to avoid having to give Young the kind of active-service appointment his rank and experience entitled him to, because the army wished to avoid any situation in which White officers might have to take orders from a senior Black officer. Roosevelt's response was to offer him command of the proposed regiment or brigade: \\"there is not another man [than yourself] who would be better fitted to command such a regiment.\\" He also promised Young \\"carte blanche\\" in appointing staff and line officers for the unit. He then wrote to Stover, telling him to \\"communicate with Lieutenant Colonel Young, the colored United States Officer, a thoroughly fine fellow. It seems to me he should command your regiment if it is raised. I would love to have [the regiment] with me if the President lets me go.\\" On May 30, Young thanked Stover for giving him the opportunity to command \\"a regiment of my own people,\\" and added: \\"I know men of high character and efficiency who could make good in these positions and do honor to themselves, their race, country, and to yourself [Stover] as the Organizer of the regiment.\\" All these plans came to nothing when Wilson refused Roosevelt permission to organize his volunteer division. Young was retired for medical reasons during the war, then reappointed to active duty after it was over. Nevertheless, the proposal indicates a change in Roosevelt's racial attitudes, perhaps influenced by the persuasive scientific and sociological arguments of Young's book.The correspondence among Roosevelt, Young and Stover is in the John Motley Collection, Tredegar Museum. A fuller account is in Richard Slotkin, \\"Lost Battalions: The Great War and the Crisis of American Nationality,\\" (2005), pp. 41-2. In fiction In the alternate history story Over There by Mike Resnick, Roosevelt managed to blackmail Wilson into letting him raise a revived force of Rough Riders and take it to France, but Wilson ordered General Pershing keep them away from the front and avoid any chance of Roosevelt getting killed. Disobeying orders and determined to recreate his glorious moment of San Juan Hill, Roosevelt led his men to a completely aggressive and victorious head-on attack on entrenched German machine-gun positions, capturing the enemy‚Äôs position. On hearing of his courageous actions, President Wilson said \\"He is one of the greatest Americans in history, America is waiting for his return... His actions will always be remembered\\".

New York, 1982. The Life of Edward II of England (German: ), also known as Edward II, is an adaptation by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht of the 16th- century historical tragedy by Marlowe, The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward the Second, King of England, with the Tragical Fall of Proud Mortimer (c.1592). The play is set in England between 1307 and 1326. A prefatory note to the play reads: Brecht wrote his adaptation in collaboration with Lion Feuchtwanger. It is written mostly in irregular free verse, with two songs (one of which is from Marlowe's original), over twenty-one scenes.Willett (1967, 25‚Äì26). Looking back at the play-text near the end of his life, Brecht offered the following assessment of their intentions: \\"We wanted to make possible a production which would break with the Shakespearean tradition common to German theatres: that lumpy monumental style beloved of middle-class philistines.\\"Brecht, \\"On Looking Back Through My First Plays\\" (1954). In Willett and Manheim (1970, 454). Influence on the development of epic theatre The production of Edward II generated a moment in rehearsal that has become one of the emblematic anecdotes in the history of theatre, which marks a genuine event; a new organizing force had suddenly arrived on the theatrical scene and the shape of 20th-century theatre would come to be determined by the passage of the 'epic' through the dramatic, theatrical and performative fields. Walter Benjamin records Brecht's recollection in 1938 of the pivotal incident: In this simple idea of applying chalk to the faces of Brecht's actors to indicate the \\"truth\\" of the situation of soldiers in battle, Brecht located the germ of his conception of 'epic theatre'. As Tony Meech suggests, the material that Brecht was re-working to a certain extent lent itself to this treatment, but it was the combination of several factors that enabled this production to become so significant: Production history=Munich, 1924 The play opened at the Munich Kammerspiele on March 19, 1924, in a production that constituted Brecht's solo directorial d√©but.Up until that point, Brecht had co-directed a production of Paster Ephraim Magnus by Hans Henny Jahnn with Arnolt Bronnen in 1923, been involved with rehearsals during the productions of his plays Baal (1923), In the Jungle (1923), and Drums in the Night (1922, both productions), and had withdrawn from directing a production of Bronnen's Vatermord (1922) at the experimental Junge B√ºhne after the actors had walked out and he had been taken to hospital suffering from malnourishment; see Sacks (1994, xvii‚Äìxviii) and Willett and Manheim (1970, viii). Caspar Neher designed the sets, as he had for the production of Brecht's In the Jungle the year before.According to Willett (1967, 26), four drawings from Neher's design for Edward II were published in Brecht's St√ºcke II in 1924 (Berlin: Kiepenheuer). An additional (fifth) drawing by Neher appeared on the cover of the first edition (1924) of Leben Eduards... depicting three figures, presumably Queen Anne, King Edward, and Gaveston, facing forward, with a banner before them which reads \\"Das Leben K√∂nig Edward II von England\\". Brecht, Leben Eduards... Cover and p. 1 Oskar Homolka played Mortimer and Erwin Faber played Edward, with Maria Koppenh√∂fer and Hans Schweikart also in the cast.Willett (1967, 25‚Äì26) and Sacks (1994 xvii‚Äìxviii). According to Faber, Brecht's entire production, from the script to the staging of the scenes, was \\"balladesque\\".McDowell (2000). New York City, 1982 The Riverside Shakespeare Company staged the play's Off Broadway premiere at the newly renovated The Shakespeare Center on West 86th and Amsterdam, New York City. The production opened on April 23, 1982. W. Stuart McDowell directed, with assistance from Jeannie H. Woods. It featured Dan Southern as Gaveston and Tim Oman as Edward. The cast also included Andrew Achsen, Larry Attille, Christopher Cull, Michael Franks, Margo Gruber, Dan Johnson, Will Lampe, Joe Meek, Jason Moehring, Gay Reed, Count Stovall, Patrick Sullivan, and Jeffery V. Thompson. Dorian Vernacchio designed the set and lighting, David Robinson was the costume designer, and Valerie Kuehn was responsible for the props. Michael Canick composed an original musical score for percussion, which was played by Noel Counsil.\\"Brecht; Another Production\\", The New York Times, February 6, 2000. Bertha Case (the literary representative for the Brecht estate in the United States) and Stefan Brecht (Bertolt Brecht's son) authorized the production in August 1981, to take place the following year.See \\"Bertha Case\\" in The New York Times, December 13, 1984. Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival sponsored the production, with additional support from the Goethe House and Marta Feuchtwanger (widow of Lion Feuchtwanger, the play's co-author). As part of the director's dramaturgical preparation, McDowell travelled to Germany to interview Erwin Faber and Hans Schweikart, two of the actors in Brecht's original production of 1924.See the interviews with Faber and Schweikhardt in McDowell (2000).

The ranch was located at the northwest corner of Waalew Road and Dale Evans Parkway in Apple Valley, just outside the city limits of Victorville. It was owned by African Americans and catered primarily to an African American clientele.Thompson, Richard. Murray's Ranch:Apple Valley's African-American Dude Ranch Murray's Ranch Accessed 8/20/07 It also served as the set for a number of \\"all-black cast\\" western movies including groundbreaking Western musical Harlem on the Prairie (1937). History The site was purchased for $100 in 1926. The ranch was founded by husband and wife Nolie B. and Lela Murray, both of whom ran successful businesses in Los Angeles and were prominent members of the city's Black community.Nolie B. and Lela Murray Operated for nearly 20 years as a dude ranch with a pool, several small houses, tennis courts, and riding stables, the ranch was used by entertainment personalities and by ordinary families. It was open to all who could afford to come. Murray's was a recreational favorite for Blacks, and a marker in the history of Black recreation. In the 1920s, when Murray's Dude Ranch opened, widespread segregation practices limited Black Californians' access to most private and public recreational facilities. Resorts, hotels, nightclubs, and even public parks in many California communities were closed to Black patrons. For nearly half of the 20th century, recreational activities of the Black community were carried out in separate facilities. Apple Valley was once well known for the guest ranches that flourished there from about World War I to the mid-1950s. Black-owned resorts were established in the first two decades of the 20th century, including Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, and Piru in Ventura County. Films shot on location at Murray's Dude Ranch were four \\"all-black cast\\" westerns, starring Herbert Jeffries as a black singing cowboy, made in the late 1930s. Harlem on the Prairie (1937), Two-Gun Man from Harlem (1938), The Bronze Buckaroo (1939), and Harlem Rides the Range (1939) featured songs by Jefferies and the Four Tones, his backing vocal group.Mulroy, Kevin. Seeking El Dorado: African Americans in California, University of Washington Press, p. 262 (2001). Murray's hosted about 100 people each week during the height of the season, from May to September.

It is a retelling of the story of the Horatii and Curiaces, a subject treated by Corneille (Horace) and subsequently by many opera composers (see Horatii). Commissioned by the Red Army, the play was printed in Moscow in 1936 but never performed until 1958, two years after Brecht's death. The two choruses are the main characters. Brecht had initially planned the work as a collaboration with composer Hanns Eisler, but the two broke off their collaboration midway through the project. Two letters (from August 29, 1935 and shortly thereafter) to Hanns Eisler document Brecht's frustration over the attempted long distance collaboration with the composer, also in exile. Thus, the work was initially published without a musical score. In 1954, Brecht invited composer Kurt Schwaen to set the play to music.

Syring pleaded guilty to the charges June 12, 2008,Department of Justice press release: Former Foreign Service Officer Pleads Guilty to Federal Civil Rights Charges was sentenced to one year in prison July 11, 2008, and was released early, in January 2009.Bureau of Prisons inmate locator Syring was again indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia on very similar alleged offenses on February 21, 2018.\\"A Decade Later, Former Diplomat Again Charged With Threatening Arab Group\\" At Syring's arraignment on March 14, 2018, Syring pleaded not guilty before The Honorable Robin M. Meriweather, United States Magistrate Judge, United States District Court for the District of Columbia . The Honorable Randolph Moss United States District Judge will preside at Syring's trial in March 2019. Background From 1993 to 1994, and from 1998 to 1999, Syring was consular/commercial officer at the United States Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon.U.S. Department of State profile of Lebanon, January 1994 (archived from the original on 2007-06-15) He was also posted to the United States Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1994-1998, and subsequently, to the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, Office of Economic Policy Analysis, among other assignments, at the United States Department of State. Syring retired from the State Department in July 2007. Syring's retirement concluded a career of nearly 26 years at the State Department. Indictment Syring sent three voice mails and four emails to the Arab American Institute in July 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War. A Federal Grand Jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment on August 15, 2007, charging Syring with violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 875(c), threatening messages in interstate commerce to injure an individual, and violation of Title 18 of the United States Code Section 245(b)(2)(C), by threat of force, to interfere with the civil rights of the founder and employees of the Arab American Institute. Syring identified himself in the voice mails and emails he left at the headquarters of the Arab American Institute on July 17, 2006. From July 17, 2006 to July 29, 2006, Syring sent seven email and voice mail messages to the Arab American Institute headquarters offices from his home in suburban Virginia. The indictment claims Syring \\"did willfully intimidate and interfere with Arab American Institute employees because of their race and national origin\\", and \\"threatened to injure Arab American Institute employees\\". Asked about Syring, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said on August 16, 2007, \\"Let me just underline the seriousness with which the Secretary approaches the idea that the State Department should be a workplace that in no way, shape or form, tolerates discrimination or hateful language or any other action that would violate federal laws or regulations. It is just not condoned or acceptable in this department.\\" On August 16, 2007, the Arab American Institute issued a statement that said \\"The threats were both intimidating and frightening ‚Äì and the fact that the defendant was a 20 year career officer at the Department of State made it of even greater concern.\\" Deposition Syring pleaded not guilty on August 30, 2007, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. On November 19, 2007, United States District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied a motion from Syring to dismiss the charges against him, ensuring that the case would go to trial. \\"Whether [the] Defendant's communications constituted a true threat,\\" Kollar-Kotelly wrote, \\"is an issue properly left to the jury.\\" In the memorandum opinion November 19, 2007, the judge added \\"the Court agrees with Defendant, that on its face the Indictment does not present a compelling case. Nevertheless, even based on the meager context alleged in the Indictment, it is possible a reasonable jury could interpret Defendant's communications as 'a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals'.\\" In an order filed December 14, 2007, Syring's trial was tentatively rescheduled to begin February 11, 2008, but was subsequently rescheduled. On March 13, 2008, Syring sent an e-mail to a U.S. television network where Zogby had been interviewed, repeating some of the language of his earlier messages. This e-mail prompted the Assistant United States Attorney for Civil Rights to withdraw a conditional plea offer of no prison time. Also, on March 20, 2008, United States District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly revoked Syring's pre-trial release; Syring was incarcerated for 111 days in the District of Columbia Department of Corrections prior to Syring's sentencing on July 11, 2008. Syring pleaded guilty to federal civil rights charges on June 12, 2008, was sentenced on July 11, 2008 to one year in prison, but was released from prison early in January 2009. His sentence included a fine of , paid in July 2008, three years post-release supervision, completed on January 27, 2012, and 100 hours community service completed in April 2009.

It measured over 50,000 Gross tons, and had a deadweight of over 100,000 tons, measured approximately in length, across the beam, and in draft. It required a crew complement of 32. Disaster During the morning of January 11, 1986 the Castillo de Salas, property of the Spanish company \\"Elcano\\", ran aground over rocks 740 metres North/North-west of Gij√≥n. The ship was anchored outside Gij√≥n's seaport (El Musel) when the ship's anchor came loose in bad weather. Efforts to re-anchor, self-propel and even tow the ship away from the coast failed due to harsh seas. The cargo was nearly 100,000 metric tonnes of coal loaded in Norfolk, Virginia as well as over 1000 tonnes of fuel-oil used for propulsion. On January 15, 1986 the hull broke in two during efforts to bring the ship afloat, therefore releasing a spill of diesel oil and coal ore. On February 23, 1986 the bow half of the hull was refloated, towed into the sea and scuttled in waters of 4000 metres in depth. Officials stated that no diesel oil was left in the bow section of the hull. During the following spring, the company \\"Fondomar\\" was tasked with scrapping the remainder of the stern portion of the hull. Second salvage of the stern section Small balls of decomposed oil were found sporadically since until 2001, when a major find of these balls was confirmed to be from fuel remaining in the double bottom fuel tank of the stern section that was not removed in 1986. This led to a second salvage operation to remove the fuel during 2001-2002 and the complete the removal of the remainder of the wreck in 2003 due to public out-cry. Trophies \\"Memoria\\", by Joaqu√≠n Rubio Cam√≠n On November 15, 2003 Gij√≥n artist Joaqu√≠n Rubio Cam√≠n's sculpture \\"Memoria\\" (Memory) was unveiled on the Camino del Cervig√≥n overlooking the sea. The sculpture was made using part of the remains of the Castillo de Salas which sank off Gij√≥n and were recovered earlier in the year. One of the ship's anchors is displayed in the Philippe Cousteau Anchor Museum in Salinas beach, Spain, 30 km west of Gij√≥n. Side effects Since the accident, it is common to find dark sand contaminated with coal on the beaches in the Bay of Gij√≥n, particularly after rough sea conditions. The amounts recovered continue to reduce over time, but patches of dark coloured sand, high in black coal particles, can be seen at low tide.

It is sometimes thought of as an \\"almost halt,\\" asking the horse to prepare to halt in balance, before pushing it onward to continue in its gait. Uses The main purpose of the half-halt is to rebalance the horse, asking it to carry its weight slightly more on his hindquarters and less on its forehand. Additionally, it may be used as a warning signal to the horse, calling its attention back to the rider to tell it that it is about to be asked to do something, such as perform a transition between or within a gait, make a turn, perform a difficult movement, or jump an obstacle. It can also be used to encourage the horse to take a lighter contact with the bit. The half-halt should not make the horse break into a different gait. However, repeated half- halts are used to help collect a gait.the gait that it is in needs to half halt to get right on to the next gait as in a gallop Half-halts are universally useful, regardless of riding discipline, although they are used in great abundance in the dressage arena, where perfect control of the horse is required. Performing the half-halt The half-halt: the rider sits up and deepens her seat as she applies the rein aids, then immediately releases. The entire process is completed in one step of the trot, and then repeated slightly softer. The half-halt may be performed two ways, both of which are commonly used by various skilled horse people. The first is a split-second application of the driving aids, to create energy, which is then quickly and immediately harnessed with the restraining aids, and then released. The second is the opposite approach: an application of the restraining aids, asking the horse to \\"almost halt\\" and bring its hindquarters under itself in the process, then immediately applying the driving aids to maintain the gait. In both cases, the driving and restraining aids should never be applied for a prolonged period, as that will only cause the horse to lean against the bit, tighten its back, and finally ignore the aids. The yielding of the aids is just as important as the application of the aids. The degree of pressure applied by the aids will vary greatly between horses, depending on the animal's training, temperament, balance, and the situation in which the half- halt is given. The degree of the aid is usually performed by instinct and feel, a result of experience from the rider, and often one half-halt will be slightly different from the one preceding it, depending on the horse's balance and the requirements of the upcoming exercise. However, the aids should not be so great that they signal the horse to make a transition. In dressage, the primary restraining aids will be made by bracing the lower back and briefly preventing the hips from following, while adding slight rein pressure, although very well-trained and sensitive horses will respond simply to a deepening of the seat. When jumping, especially if the rider is in two-point position, the rider may instead apply the restraining aids by sinking down slightly into their heels and bringing his shoulders more upright, adding slight rein pressure as needed. In extreme situations, such as when a horse is galloping and excited, it may be necessary to use even more rein pressure to ensure the restraining aids are respected, which may even result in a harsh jerk. This is reserved for the worst-case scenario, when the horse needs to be rapidly re-balanced (for example, due to an upcoming obstacle), and usually only occurs if the horse is ignoring the rider or if the rider did not prepare the horse properly in advance. The driving aids are created by the legs and by softening the seat. Timing According to Thomas Ritter, the best time to apply the half-halt is the moment when the hind leg it is meant to control touches the ground. \\"When it first touches down in front of the vertical, it carries, i.e. the haunches flex. That is the correct moment for the half halt. As soon as the hind leg passes the vertical, however, it starts to thrust. If you were to half halt against the thrusting leg, the horse would brace against you and either go against, above or behind he bit. If you half halt when the leg is in the air, you would shorten the stride and prevent the hind leg from stepping under. It would have to set down prematurely, maybe not even reaching the vertical, much less reaching in front of it. That way, the carrying phase would be shortened or even made impossible. The result would be loss of balance and relaxation not to mention collection.\\" Category:Riding techniques and movements ","title":"Half-halt"},{"id":"12790566","text":"Roberto Arango-Vinent is a Cuban American politician who served in the Senate of Puerto Rico from January 2005 until August 2011 representing the San Juan district for the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico (NPP), which is a conservative group derived from the Republican Statehood Party.

It is most similar to the highly potent opioid carfentanil (4-carbomethoxyfentanyl), only slightly more potent. Lofentanil can be described as 3-methylcarfentanil, or 3-methyl-4-carbomethoxyfentanyl. While 3-methylfentanyl is considerably more potent than fentanyl itself, lofentanil is only slightly stronger than carfentanil. This suggests that substitution at both the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring introduces steric hindrance which prevents Œº-opioid affinity from increasing much further. As with other 3-substituted fentanyl derivatives such as ohmefentanyl, the stereoisomerism of lofentanil is very important, with some stereoisomers being much more potent than others. Lofentanil is very similar to carfentanil in effects, but has a longer duration of action. This makes it unsuitable for most practical applications, with carfentanil being the preferred agent for tranquilizing large animals, and short-acting derivatives such as sufentanil or remifentanil being preferred for medical use in human surgical procedures. The long duration and high lipophilicity of lofentanil has been suggested as an advantage for certain types of analgesia, but the main application for lofentanil at the present time is research into opioid receptors. Side effects of lofentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea, and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life- threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear. Side effects from lofentanil might be particularly problematic given its reportedly long duration of action. Another side effect which is characteristic of fentanyl and its derivatives is their tendency to rapidly induce tolerance, due to their high binding affinity triggering rapid internalization of chronically activated opiate receptors. This might be expected to be a particular problem with lofentanil as it is not only one of the most potent drugs in the series, but also is longer acting than most other fentanyl analogues, meaning that development of tolerance triggered by receptor over- activation could be rapid. In addition to acting on the Œº-opioid receptor, lofentanil has also been found to act as a full agonist of the Œ∫-opioid receptor (Ki = 8.2 nM; EC50 = 153 nM; Emax = 100%).

Clumps of fur that stick out at least 1‚Äì2 cm beyond the paw pad can be considered tufts. In addition to soft paw pads, toe tufts help a cat to silently stalk its prey by muffling excess noise. However, outdoor cats tend to lose their toe tufts due to excessive abrasion on the rougher outdoor surfaces. This is in distinct contrast to indoor cats who spend most of their time walking on carpet or smooth floors. Although toe tufts do not cause additional hairballs in cats, it does make some aspects of hygiene a bit more difficult. For example, cat litter, dirt and other particulates may stick to toe tufts and cause the cat some discomfort. Therefore, a cat with extra long toe tufts should be checked regularly for tangles and taken in for grooming.

The play's title is sometimes translated as He's Driving Out a Devil; see Hayman (1983, 50). It was written in prose, probably in 1919, and was first published in volume 13 of Brecht's St√ºcke.Thomson and Sacks (1994, xvii) and Willett (1967, 27). The play charts the attempts of a self-confident and manipulative Bavarian peasant boy to outwit the vigilant parents of a girl of his village.Hayman (1983, 50-51). Ronald Hayman suggests that this play dramatises most clearly Brecht's own ability to influence people.Hayman writes that the play shows us \\"the way Brecht imposed his will on both women and men\\" (1983, 50).
