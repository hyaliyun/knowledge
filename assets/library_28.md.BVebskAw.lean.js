It's about a group of high school teenagers. The film was a huge box-office success in Philippine cinema after it was shown and its popularity was proven after teenagers, especially boys started copying the hairstyle and clothing style of the film's lead stars. Its popularity also set the trend for youth oriented movies in Philippine cinema. Bagets = Plot  The movie focuses on the lives of five young boys - boy next door Adie, \\"overstaying\\" Tonton, the geeky Gilbert, the martial arts buff Toffee, and rich guy Arnel - as they try to pass senior year in a different high school (they were kicked out from their previous school). Along the way, they encounter some of the typical adventures and misadventures common to adolescents - young love, family problems, and sexual hijinks. However, all does not go well, as their separate backgrounds generate problems of their own. Arnel is the only son whose parents want to take over the family business and his mother disapproves of his choice of girlfriend, Janice, who comes from a middle-class background. Toffee seeks companionship in Christine, an older flight attendant, because his own mother, an actress, does not attend to his needs. Gilbert lives in a rented apartment where his mother is hard at work as a businesswoman and the father, a policeman, often hangs out at sauna baths when the rent is already months overdue. His situation is also the same as that of Tonton, who has stayed in senior year for four years. Adie's in love with Ivy, a girl next door who's actually married. Reality hits the gang the hardest when Tonton loses his girlfriend, Rose, in a car accident while drag racing on the same night of the junior- senior prom. As graduation day draws near, it dawns on the gang that they will have to grow up to prepare for life after high school. Cast * William Martinez as Tonton * J.C.

The film mostly deals with their participation in an arts workshop and inter-personal relationships with three new characters - Wally, Gilbert's cousin and a young man forced by his mother to become a priest; Mikee, a TV director's son looking for his big break, and Ponce, an auto expert-cum-dancer. Also included in the mix is Ruth, Tonton & Toffee's balikbayan cousin.  Cast  Most of the cast from the original movie returned, including the actors who played the lead characters' parents. However, Aga Muhlach (Adie) and Jobelle Salvador (Melissa) did not reprise their roles. According to the Bagets DVD feature \\"Flashback: The BAGETS Reunion,\\" Muhlach's career was already taking off at the time. Salvador's absence has not been explained. As a result, their circumstances were written in the story - Adie flew off to the United States at the start of the movie, while Melissa went to Davao to join her father. *William Martinez as Tonton *J.C.

The original cast of both Bagets films was supposed to star in this installment. The movie had a 2008 production start date. However, Raymond Lauchengco, one of the original five lead actors, said the film will not be done at all because some members of the cast no longer had the appetite to see it through.No go for Bagets reunion flick - Raymond Lauchengco (GMA News)  Remake  Bagets: Just Got Lucky is an afternoon youth-oriented television show in the Philippines that is produced by Viva Television and developed by TV5.

Plot Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey) is a successful single businesswoman who has always put her career before her personal life. Now in her late thirties, she finally decides to have her own child, but her plans are dampened when she discovers she has a minuscule chance of becoming pregnant because her uterus is T-shaped. Also denied the chance to adopt, Kate hires an immature, obnoxious, South Philadelphia woman named Angie Ostrowski (Amy Poehler) to become her surrogate mother. When Angie becomes pregnant, Kate prepares for motherhood in her own typically driven fashion‚Äîuntil her surrogate shows up at her door with no place to live. Their conflicting personalities put them at odds as Kate learns first-hand about balancing motherhood and career and also dates the owner of a local blended- juice cafe, Rob Ackerman (Greg Kinnear). Unknown to Kate, the in-vitro fertilization procedure Angie had did not succeed and she is feigning the pregnancy, hoping to ultimately run off with her payment. Eventually she starts to regret lying about not being pregnant, but she continually puts off confessing. When she gets an ultrasound, she discovers she is pregnant for real. Realizing the baby is her own‚Äîwith her common-law husband Carl (Dax Shepard), from whom she is separated‚ÄîAngie is forced to confess at Kate's baby shower. When Kate explains to Angie that the pregnancy test was supposed to be taken two weeks after the procedure, and that the baby could still belong to her, a wedge is driven between the two women. A court hearing determines that the baby is Angie's, and Angie makes an impassioned apology to Kate. As the women meet face-to-face after the proceedings, Angie's water breaks and Kate rushes her to the hospital, then passes out during the birth. As she wakes up, the doctor supervising Angie's pregnancy tells Kate that she's two months pregnant (the result of her relationship with her new boyfriend). After receiving the news, she visits Angie, who is holding her new baby daughter Stef, named for Gwen Stefani. Kate forgives Angie and the two become best friends, ultimately changing each other for the better. Angie and Kate raise their children and are in a sister-like relationship one year later at Stef's first-birthday party. It is revealed that Kate and Rob are parents of a baby daughter and are engaged. Although he does not reunite with Angie, Carl stays close to his daughter and takes parenting classes. The final scene shows Angie and Kate sitting in front of a television set with their children, watching Tom and Jerry cartoons.

History The village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 AD as Cranchesberie in the hundred of Blackwell, in the county of Derbyscire. The settlement was one of seven berewicks (surrounding estates) within the royal manor of Bakewell. It was listed as part of the lands owned by William the Conqueror, with the following details documented for Bakewell (including Burton; Conksbury; Holme; Monyash; [Nether and Over] Haddon; One Ash and Rowsley): * Households: 35 villagers. 16 smallholders. 2 priests. 1 men-at- arms. * Farming: 18 ploughlands. 7 lord's plough teams. 11 men's plough teams. * Meadow 80 acres. Woodland 1 by 1 leagues. 1 mill, value 10 shillings and 7 pence. 1 church. 3 church lands. * Tenant-in-chief in 1086: King William * Lord in 1066: King Edward William the Conqueror subsequently granted the manor of Bakewell to the Norman knight William Peverel. Peverel established Lenton Priory and set up Meadow Place as a monastic grange for the priory next to Conksbury. Conksbury and its mill were later given to the Abbey of St Mary de Pre by William Avenal of Haddon. Conksbury and Meadow Place became property of the Crown after the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th-century. By 1610 the Cavendish family had purchased the land, which became part of the Devonshire estate. The site of the deserted village is a protected Scheduled Monument. There are visible earthwork remains of building platforms and enclosures either side of a road that was wide. Conksbury medieval bridge over the River Lathkill is a designated Grade II listed structure. The bridge was built in the mid 18th-century from limestone rubble with gritstone dressings. It carries the road between Bakewell and Youlgreave. The bridge was authorised to collect tolls in the 1758 Turnpike Act. The curving bridge has three main arches with pointed cutwaters. Conksbury Hall is an 18th-century gritstone house on the western edge of the site of the medieval village. It was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1967. On the same side of the site, Conksbury Farmhouse is also a Grade II listed building, dating from 1725 (the door lintel is inscribed 'S/CF 1725 BH').

Ali wants to shoot a marauding tiger, but the orangutans Tua and his baby Rango get in the way, and Rango is almost grabbed by the tiger.

There have been several \\"generations\\" of the figure, all bearing the same name. The figure was originally created as one of two standard characters which also included the male character \\"Michael\\" (\\"Stephanie\\" being a full body female morph of Michael). Besides being poseable, using preset morph dials the figure can be manipulated into a variety of different aesthetic and ethnic female forms. The figure comes pre-rigged with standardized features, and earlier versions can be exported to a variety of 3D modeling/animation applications.  History  Victoria 1 was released by then-Zygote in February 1999 and was the first named medium-resolution figure for use with Poser. She was originally released as 'The Millennium Woman', but the resulting colloquial shortening to \\"Millie\\" led to Zygote renaming her as Victoria. Zygote also sold an anime-morphed character for Victoria named Aiko, and each successive generation of Victoria has so far had an accompanying Aiko (whose facial morphs can vary between anime and a less exaggerated Asian). Victoria 2 was the next step in the figure development, refining the rigging and coming with as a reduced polygon version. Released in 2001, V2 contained more body shaping features and a wider range of facial expressions but was rigged to be compatible with V1's clothing and accessories. From this point forward, the Stephanie character (following the Generation numbering) was no longer a remorphed Michael but a character based on (and requiring) Victoria. Victoria 2's eyebrows were separately transmapped objects. Victoria 3, released in 2002 yet again raised the poly count and resculpted the face, leaving out transmapped eyebrows in favor of painting them directly onto the face texture, but was no longer backwards compatible to Victoria 2's rigging, textures or clothing. This generation was the first to have both the male and female figures be modeled from the same base \\"unimesh,\\" allowing Victoria 3 and Michael 3 to easily share poses, texture maps and even morph targets. This was also the first figure for which neither Victoria nor Michael had genitals modeled on the body mesh; V3 provided a fine enough poly count in the region to make it possible for third party morphers to design their own while Michael 3's genitals were a parented prop (which continued with the next generation). This figure has an even higher density of polygons (74,510 polygons compare to 28,989 polys for V1 and V2 ) with improvement in rigging over the previous millennium figures. Victoria 3 was the first of DAZ 3D figures to support morph injection poses, which allowed users to apply morphs from the Pose Library rather than manually selecting body parts and loading morph target files. Victoria 3's eyebrows were not transmapped but textures painted onto the face texture. The fourth and final standalone generation of Victoria was released in late 2006, which included a new body shape and added several technical improvements to the figure. As with V3, V4's proportions and rigging were not designed to be backwards compatible. The mesh for Victoria 4.0 was developed using Luxology's modo. Sporting an almost mannequin-like appearance, Victoria 4's head nevertheless contains enough polys to make photorealistic, real-person likenesses possible. Version 4.1 was released in April 2007 and included a separate rigged eyeBrow prop and improved on the capability to load multiple sets of morphs into the character without causing conflicts. Version 4.2 was released in February 2008 which added a set of built-in male morphs and further technical improvements. As Stephanie and Aiko had been characters for Victoria's base figure, Victoria 5 was released near the end of 2011 as a character for Daz Studio's Genesis Female rather than a standalone figure and was not initially compatible with Poser. Victoria 5 is rigged to support V4's texture maps and Daz Studio's cloth fitting allows her to wear Victoria 4's clothing, but due to having a different mesh she cannot use the same morph targets as Victoria 4. During the beta testing phases of Daz Studio 4, there was released information briefly regarding the preparation of Victoria 5 as a part of Genesis. As a Genesis figure, all clothing made for one Genesis- derived character auto-fits all others (a feature of Daz Studio). Finally, the mesh of Victoria 5 was updated and made smoother, with the use of SubD, weight maps and other Daz Studio native optimizations. Software like Poser can now load her using some plugins or Daz Studio .cr2 export, but Daz Studio-specific features will not be supported in Poser.http://forum.daz3d.com/viewtopic.php?t=176537 In June 2013, in sync with the release of the Genesis 2 figures, DAZ released Victoria 6 as a Genesis 2 character. In June 2015, DAZ released Victoria 7 as a Genesis 3 character. In June 2017, DAZ released Victoria 8 as a Genesis 8 character. If used with the Daz Studio \\"Autofit\\" tool, Victoria 8 can use add-on wardrobe resources created for Victoria 5, Victoria 6, and Victoria 7.

Edinger said that it took them more than an hour to return to Marcus Island, during which he kept kicking Sample in the face with his foot to keep the Admiral from passing out. Sample was a big man: Edinger was afraid that if they ended up in the water, he wouldn't be able to get him out of the plane. Each time Sample would warn Edinger to make sure the machine gun in the tail was empty. He was afraid that when they landed the gun would go off.

He attended high school at Mercersburg Academy, and he attended college at Princeton University, pitching for the Tigers from 1910 to 1913. During the 1912 collegiate baseball season, Lear pitched every inning of the four Big Three (referring to Princeton, Harvard, and Yale) games, defeating Yale University in both games and defeating Harvard University in one. After graduating from Princeton, Lear fielded offers from the New York Giants and other teams before signing with the Cincinnati Reds on January 3, 1914. He was noted in his time as one of the early pitchers of the knuckleball. Lear made his major league debut on May 2, 1914 for the Reds, and remained on the roster for the season as a relief pitcher. He finished the 1914 season having pitched in 17 games for the Reds, starting four and finishing nine. He won one game, lost two, threw three complete games, one shutout, and had an earned run average (ERA) of 3.07. Lear's most productive season came in 1915 when he pitched 40 games.

The film is a behind-the-scenes documentary shot while Buster Keaton's film The Railrodder (1965), was being produced. Although it is a production documentary, the film is actually longer than The Railrodder, which was only 24 minutes long. Both films were produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). In addition, a French version of Buster Keaton Rides Again, Avec Buster Keaton was released. Synopsis Buster Keaton Rides Again combines behind-the-scenes footage during the filming of The Railrodder with a retrospective of Keaton's work including scenes from The Butcher Boy (1917), The Frozen North (1922), Seven Chances (1925), and The General (1927). Keaton and Gerald Potterton, his director on The Railrodder, discussed and occasionally argued over gags in the film with the director concerned about the safety of his star. During the filming of The Railrodder, Keaton celebrated his 69th birthday. He also had the opportunity to meet fans across Canada. Production Filmed concurrently with the production of The Railrodder during the fall of 1964, the NFB documentary was filmed in black-and-white, as opposed to the short film itself, which is in colour. The choice of black-and-white was not only for economic reasons, as the format allowed for an easy integration of the footage from Keaton's earlier films. Reception Buster Keaton Rides Again was released with The Railrodder.

Career LaCapra received his B.A. from Cornell and his Ph.D. from Harvard. He began teaching at the Cornell University Department of History in 1969. LaCapra's work has helped to transform intellectual history and its relations to cultural history as well as other approaches to the past. His goal has been to explore and expand the nature and limits of theoretically informed historical understanding.Gordon, Peter (2011) Review of History and Its Limits: Human, Animal, Violence, Journal of Modern History 83 (no. 1), pp. 139-40. His work integrates recent developments in critical theory, such as post-structuralism and psychoanalysis, and examines their relevance for the rethinking of history.See Goldberg, Amos (2000) Interview, The Multimedia CD 'Eclipse Of Humanity', Yad Vashem, Jerusalem, available on-line at http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203648.pdf It also explores and elaborates the use in historical studies of techniques developed in literary studies and aesthetics, including close reading, rhetorical analysis, and the problem of the interaction between texts or artifacts and their contexts of production and reception.See, for example, Berkhofer, Jr., Robert (1995) Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (Harvard University Press); Clark, Elizabeth A.

The Bush administration maintained that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists,U.S. Department of Justice White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities \\"Legal Authorities Supporting the Activities of the National Security Agency Described by the President\\" January 19, 2006. and that the President's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to conduct foreign surveillance trumped the FISA statute. However, the Supreme Court decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld placed the legitimacy of this argument into question.Supreme Court's Ruling in Hamdan Means Warrantless Eavesdropping is Clearly Illegal, Glenn Greenwald, July 9, 2006Hamdan and the NSA Domestic Surveillance Program: What Next?, Marty Lederman, July 7, 2006 On July 28, 2007, President Bush announced that his Administration had submitted a bill to Congress to amend FISA. He suggested that the current law was \\"badly out of date\\" ‚Äì despite amendments passed in October 2001 ‚Äì and did not apply to disposable cell phones and Internet-based communications. The bill he submitted to Congress would address these new technologies, Bush said, as well as restore FISA's \\"original focus\\" on protecting the privacy of people within the United States, \\"so we don't have to obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence about foreign targets located in foreign locations.\\" He asked that Congress pass the legislation before its August 2007 recess, stating that \\"Every day that Congress puts off these reforms increases the danger to our nation. Our intelligence community warns that under the current statute, we are missing a significant amount of foreign intelligence that we should be collecting to protect our country\\".President's Radio Address ‚Äì July 28, 2007 On August 3, 2007, the Senate passed the bill (S. 1927) in a vote of 60 to 28(110th Congress 1st Session Vote 309). The House followed by passing the bill, 227‚Äì183 (House Roll Call 836) on August 3, 2007. The bill altered the original 1978 law in many ways, including:GovTrack U.S. ‚Äì S. 1927 Text of Legislation Warrant and notification requirements The bill amended FISA to substitute the requirement of a warrant to conduct surveillance with a system of NSA (National Security Agency) internal controls. The bill required notification to the FISA Court of warrantless surveillance within 72 hours of any authorization. The bill also required that \\"a sealed copy of the certification\\" be sent which would \\"remain sealed unless the certification is needed to determine the legality of the acquisition.\\" Domestic wiretapping The bill allowed the monitoring of all electronic communications of \\"Americans communicating with foreigners who are the targets of a U.S. terrorism investigation\\" without a court's order or oversight, so long as it is not targeted at one particular person \\"reasonably believed to be\\" inside the country. Foreign wiretapping The Act removed the requirement for a FISA warrant for any communication which was foreign- related, even if the communication involved a U.S. location on the receiving or sending end of communication; all foreign-foreign communications were removed from warrant requirements, as well. Experts claimed that this deceptively opened the door to domestic spying, given that many domestic U.S. communications passed via non-US locations, by virtue of old telephony network configurations. Data monitoring In the bill, the monitoring of data related to Americans communicating with persons (U.S citizens and non- citizens) outside the United States who are the targets of a U.S. government intelligence information gathering efforts was addressed. The Protect America Act differed from the FISA in that no discussion of actions or character judgment of the target was required for application of the statute (i.e., to receive a FISA surveillance warrant, a FISC foreign agent definition was required). This data could be monitored only if intelligence officials acted in the context of intelligence information gathering. Foreign agent declaration not required No mention of foreign agent status is made in the Protect America Act of 2007. Under prior FISA rules, persons targeted for surveillance must have been declared as foreign agents before a FISA warrant would be accorded by the FISC court. 'Quasi-anti-terrorism law' for all- forms of intelligence collection Vastly marketed by U.S. federal and military agencies as a law to prevent terror attacks, the Protect America Act was actually a law focused on the 'acquisition' of desired intelligence information, of unspecified nature. The sole requirement is geolocation outside the United States at time of Directive invocation; pursuant to Authorization or Order invocation, surveillance Directives can be undertaken towards persons targeted for intelligence information gathering. Implementation of Directives can take place inside the United States or outside the United States. No criminal or terrorism investigation of the person need be in play at time of the Directive. All that need be required is that the target be related to an official desire for intelligence information gathering for actions on part of persons involved in surveillance to be granted full immunity from U.S. criminal or civil procedures, under Section 105B(l) of the Act. Authorization power Under the bill, the director of national intelligence and the attorney general could authorize the surveillance of all communications involving persons outside the United States (U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens). The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, normally the venue for intelligence-related warrants, was limited in power by the Protect America Act to an accept or reject power for government guidelines related to persons (U.S. and non-U.S. citizens) targeted for intelligence information gathering. =1. Purpose of Directive= :The most significant of five points, comprising guidelines for Authorizing Certain Acquisitions Concerning Persons Outside the United States was that: :* A significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information. =2. Minimization procedures= :One of the five points referred to minimization procedures (how information was collected) :* the minimization procedures to be used with respect to such acquisition activity meet the definition of minimization procedures under section 101(h). =3. Requirement to assist= :Any person or company could be enjoined and requested, on a compulsory basis, to assist with the intelligence information gathering. :* The acquisition involves obtaining the foreign intelligence information from or with the assistance of a communications service provider, custodian, or other person (including any officer, employee, agent, or other specified person of such service provider, custodian, or other person) who has access to communications, either as they are transmitted or while they are stored, or equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store such communications; =4. Removal of FISA Strictures from warrant authorization; warrants not required= :But the most striking aspect of the Protect America Act was the notation that any information gathering did not comprise electronic surveillance. This wording had the effect of removing FISA-related strictures from Protect America Act 2007-related Directives, serving to remove a number of protections for persons targeted, and requirements for persons working for U.S. intelligence agencies. :* The acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance ::The removal of the term electronic surveillance from any Protect America Act Directive implied that the FISC court approval was no longer required, as FISA warrants were no longer required. In the place of a warrant was a certification, made by U.S. intelligence officers, which was copied to the Court. In effect, the FISC became less of a court than a registry of pre-approved certifications. ::Certifications (in place of FISA warrants) were able to be levied ex post facto, in writing to the Court no more than 72 hours after it was made. The Attorney General was to transmit as soon as possible to the Court a sealed copy of the certification that would remain sealed unless the certification was needed to determine the legality of the acquisition. =5. Geolocation procedures= :Assuring that the person targeted for intelligence information gathering was outside U.S. there are reasonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information under this section concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States, and such procedures will be subject to review of the Court pursuant to section 105C of this Act; Reporting requirements The Attorney General would report to Congress semi-annually with: * Reporting incidents of corporation non-cooperation. A description of any incidents of non-compliance with a directive issued. * Reporting incidents of non-cooperative persons. Incidents of noncompliance by a specified person to whom the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence issued a directive. * The number of certifications and directives. Issued in the preceding six months. * Reporting procedural failures. Incidents of non-compliance with the guidelines or procedures established for determining that the acquisition concerns persons outside the United States by any entity of the Intelligence Community. Legislative history Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the act on August 1, 2007, during the 110th United States Congress. On August 3, it was passed in the Senate with an amendment, 60‚Äì28 (record vote number 309).GovTrack U.S. ‚Äì S. 1927 On August 4, it passed the House of Representatives 227‚Äì183 (roll number 836). On August 5, it was signed by President Bush, becoming Public Law No. 110-055. On February 17, 2008, it expired due to the sunset provision. Sunset The Act provided for six months of time for new Directives to be issued; ::*Sunset ‚Äì Except as provided in subsection (d), sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall cease to have effect 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. FISA Amendments of 2008 Whereas it is generally understood that the FISA Amendments of 2008 repealed the Protect America Act, this is not the case for existing directives and authorizations. :(1) IN GENERAL ‚Äì Except as provided in section 404, effective December 31, 2012, title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended by section 101(a), is repealed. Continuance of Protect America Act 2007 Rules for Existing Orders Section 404 (Transition Procedures) allows for continuance of Protect America Act Sections 105A, 105B and 105C for all existing orders. So for authorizations for intelligence information and directives issued under such authorizations, Protect America Act application continues to apply. :Section 404(a)2(A) subject to paragraph (3), section 105A of such Act, as added by section 2 of the Protect America Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-55; 121 Stat. 552), shall continue to apply to any acquisition conducted pursuant to an order, authorization, or directive referred to in paragraph (1); and'' :Section 404(a)2(B) sections 105B and 105C of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as added by sections 2 and 3, respectively, of the Protect America Act of 2007, shall continue to apply with respect to an order, authorization, or directive referred to in paragraph (1) until the later of-- :*(i) the expiration of such order, authorization, or directive; or :*(ii) the date on which final judgment is entered for any petition or other litigation relating to such order, authorization, or directive. Section 404 (Continuance Procedures) allows for continued authorizations and directives to be renewed under same circumstances indefinitely; It also allowed for continuance of Immunities for persons and corporations (including but not limited to telecoms) under FISA 2008 Amendments. :Section 404(a)7(B) CONTINUATION OF EXISTING ORDERS - If the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence seek to replace an authorization made pursuant to section 105B of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as added by section 2 of the Protect America Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-55; 121 Stat. 522), by filing a certification in accordance with subparagraph (A), that authorization, and any directives issued thereunder and any order related thereto, shall remain in effect, notwithstanding the expiration provided for in subsection (a) of such section 105B, until the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (as such term is defined in section 701(b)(2) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (as so added)) issues an order with respect to that certification under section 702(i)(3) of such Act (as so added) at which time the provisions of that section and of section 702(i)(4) of such Act (as so added) shall apply. Controversy Controversial debates arose as the Protect America Act was published. Constitutional lawyers and civil liberties experts expressed concerns that this Act authorized massive, wide-ranging information gathering with no oversight. Whereas it placed much focus on communications, the Act allowed for information gathering of all shapes and forms. The ACLU called it the \\"Police America Act\\" ‚Äì \\"authorized a massive surveillance dragnet\\", calling the blank-check oversight provisions \\"meaningless,\\" and calling them a \\"phony court review of secret procedures.\\" FISC ruling, January 2009 In January 2009, a United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review ruling was made in favor of the warrantless wiretapping role of the Protect America Act 2007, in a heavily redacted opinion released on January 15, 2009, which was only the second such public ruling since the enactment of the FISA Act.

It opened in 1812, and served the iron and coal industries for almost 65 years. The arrival of railways in the area did not immediately affect its traffic, but the failure of the iron industry in 1875 and increasing subsidence due to coal mining led to it becoming uneconomic. The Marquess of Bute failed to halt its decline when he took it over in 1885, and in 1900 it was closed on safety grounds. The company continued to operate a tramway until 1944. Most of the route was buried by the construction of the A4059 road in 1923, although a short section at the head of the canal remains in water and is now a nature reserve. The company was wound up in 1955. History By the 1780s, industry in the area around Aberdare was developing. John Maybery and Thomas Wilkins owned an ironworks at Hirwaun, which was leased by Anthony Bacon. He died in 1786, and the lease was taken over by Samuel Glover from Birmingham, who built a tramway. The nearby Neath Canal was authorised in 1791, and from its terminus at Glynneath, a tramway could be constructed to reach Hirwaun. Glover joined several others who were promoting the development of the Taff Valley, and plans for a branch canal from the Glamorganshire Canal to Aberdare, with feeder tramways, were conceived. Funds to survey a canal to link the Glamorganshire Canal to the Neath Canal were raised in 1792, and the canal engineer John Dadford surveyed a route for a road along the Aberdare Valley at the same time. Dadford presented evidence to a House of Commons Committee in February 1793, and to the House of Lords in early March. The Aberdare Canal Company was incorporated by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 March 1793, which authorised the company to build a canal from Aberdare to Abercynon (at the time called Navigation) and a railway from Aberdare to Glynneath, on the Neath Canal. The Act also empowered the company to build tramroads to any mines, quarries or works within of the route of the canal and railway. To complete this task, it had powers to raise an initial ¬£22,500, and a further ¬£11,000 if required. A turnpike road from Abercynon to Glynneath via Aberdare was authorised on the same day. Although construction of the canal was authorised, it was not deemed to be viable at the time, as the Hirwaun Ironworks was the only potential user. Instead, James Dadford was employed to survey a route for a tramway which would run from Aberdare to Penderyn via Hirwaun. The track used edge rails, similar to modern railway lines, and consequently trucks with flanged wheels. The tramway linked a colliery, a limestone quarry and an ironworks. The company leased some limestone quarries at Penderyn, and conveyed the stone along the tramway to the Hirwaun Ironworks and to their own lime kilns. The route of the canal was re-surveyed in 1800 by Dadford's brother, Thomas, but with the opening of two further ironworks by 1806, the company finally resolved to build the canal at a meeting held in September 1809. Edward Martin from Morriston was employed to re-survey the route, which was completed by 9 January 1810, and Thomas Sheasby junior was employed as engineer. Construction of the of canal began, with the Glamorganshire Canal Company agreeing to waiving tolls on all stone and lime cargoes which were for the new canal. Thomas Sheasby resigned as engineer in August 1811, and was replaced by George Overton, who worked for two days each week. The canal level dropped by 13 ft (4m) over its length, and this was accommodated by building two locks, one at Cwmbach and the other at Dyffryn. A feeder from the Afon Cynon supplied water to the canal at Canal Head, an aqueduct carried the canal over Nant Pennar, and a stop lock was built at the bottom end, where the canal joined the Glamorganshire Canal just below lock 17. There was a dispute with Richard Blakemore, who owned the Pentyrch ironworks and the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works, and who wanted surplus water to be returned to the river, but he was ultimately ignored, and the water supplied the Glamorganshire Canal. The canal was open for traffic by May 1812, although some outstanding work was completed over the following months. Trade The four main carriers on the canal were given wharf space at Canal Head, Ty Draw, where four wharves were constructed and the Glamorganshire Canal Company also allocated them wharf space at the pound at Cardiff Sea Lock. Trade in iron began well, but a disastrous depression began in 1813, resulting in the bankruptcy of the Hirwaun and Abernant ironworks, and the Llwydcoed ironworks ceasing production. With no sources of income, the canal effectively closed, and the tramway to the Neath Canal was abandoned. The economy began to recover in 1818, and William Crawshay leased the Hirwaun ironworks. Having reconstructed and expanded it, he gradually bought out the Aberdare Canal Company, to ensure the route for his goods, and owned 96% of the shares by 1826. Between 1823 and 1826, the banks were raised, in order to allow the capacity of boats to be increased from 20 tons to 25 tons. This was financed by selling eleven shares, with additional costs being met from revenue, with the result that no dividend was paid in 1826. In 1837, the first pit for the extraction of steam coal was sunk at Abernant-y-Groes by Thomas Wayne and his family. Wayne had previously been the Clerk for the canal company. An entrepreneur called Thomas Powell started another pit at Tyr Founder in 1840, and hit the Four Foot seam two years later. Fifteen more pits were sunk in the Cynon Valley between 1840 and 1853, and a number of basins and tramways were constructed to facilitate export of the coal. Thomas Powell negotiated the right to carry coal in boxes in the boats, as a way to reduce breakage and ease handling of the product, with the empty boxes not incurring tolls on the return journey. With the increasing traffic, more water was needed, and the ponds on Hirwaun Common, which were owned by the Tappendens, were converted into a reservoir, covering , from which water was supplied to the canal via the Afon Cynon and the feeder at Canal Head. In 1845, the company decided to build a pumping engine at Tyr Founder, to supply water from the Afon Cynon to the canal just above Cwmbach lock. The Glamorganshire Canal Company were approached to share the cost, on the basis that they would benefit from the extra water, and they agreed to pay two thirds of the cost, providing that they owned the installation. The Coming of the Railways Aberdare Canal, c.1900 With the increasing coal production, railways were attracted to the area. The Aberdare Railway was the first in 1846, branching off from the Taff Vale Railway's line from Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil at Abercynon, and running up the valley to Aberdare. Many of the collieries were linked to the railway by branch lines and sidings, but the canal company withheld consent to build bridges over the canal, and it was not until 1851 that a court ruling allowed the Wyrfa Coal Company to build the first, after which others followed. A second railway, the broad gauge Vale of Neath Railway, reached Aberdare in the same year. Despite the competition, the canal continued to carry a good volume of coal, rising from 159,653 tons in 1848 to 216,704 tons in 1858. In 1864, the Great Western Railway built a line to Middle Duffryn (later renamed Mountain Ash), and further depleted the trade in coal on the canal. The iron trade collapsed in 1875, when the Aberdare ironworks stopped production due to a strike, and the canal was increasingly affected by subsidence, caused by mining, but was unable to get any compensation from the mine owners. In 1885, both the Aberdare Canal and the Glamorganshire Canal were obtained by the Marquess of Bute, who bought the shares from the Crawshay family. Despite his efforts, the canal was no longer profitable. In 1888, 102,805 tons of goods were carried, but the rates were low in order to encourage use of the canal, and the income did not cover the running expenses. Decline The derelict Abedare Canal at Cwmbach c.1920 By 1897, the volume of traffic had dropped to 7,855 tons, and passage along the canal was extremely difficult, as a result of bridges and towpaths sinking. Maintenance costs kept increasing, and the decision was taken to close the canal in November 1900 on safety grounds. The company continued to operate the tramroad between Penderyn, Hirwaun and Aberdare, with the Penderyn to Hirwaun section being converted to standard gauge and linked to the Great Western Railway in 1904, and the remaining section being sold to the owners of the coal pits in 1944. The canal lay unused and derelict until 1923, when it was bought by Aberdare Urban District Council and Mountain Ash District Council. The Aberdare Canal Act was passed in 1924, authorising the purchase, and most of the canal bed was buried under the A4059 and B4275 roads. The Aberdare Canal Company was finally wound up in 1955. The route The Cynon Valley is a narrow valley, and the canal followed the course of the northern bank of the Afon Cynon for most of its length. Water was supplied to the top pound by the feeder from the Afon Cynon, and later by the pumping engine at Tyr Founder. The Cwmbach lock had a fall of , after which the middle pound crossed the Nant Pennar stream on an aqueduct to arrive at the Dyffryn lock, which lowered the level by another . There were a total of seven overflow weirs, to allow surplus water to return to the river, and a stop lock before the junction with the Glamorganshire Canal. Road building has obliterated most traces of the canal, but the top section from Canal Head to Ynyscynon House is in water and is now a nature reserve. Canal Head house, the original residence of the clerk of the canal also remains as a private dwelling. The junction with the Glamorganshire Canal was close to Lock Street in Abercynon.

In time this company became BMW AG. He is acknowledged by BMW AG as an indirect founder of the company. Early life Little is known of Karl Rapp's childhood and adolescent years. However, it is known that Rapp learned the engineering profession and was employed by Z√ºst automotive company from approx. 1908 to 1911. It is believed he was active as a technical designer with Daimler Benz until 1912. Rapp left Daimler-Benz to head a branch of Flugwerk Deutschland GmbH. Aircraft engine manufacturing Flugwerk Deutschland GmbH probably transferred its headquarters from Gelsenkirchen- Rotthausen to Brand near Aachen. The articles of association were ratified on 15 February 1912, and the entry in the Aachen Commercial Register was effected on 5 March 1912. The object of the business was the manufacture and sale of aircraft, the construction and sale of machinery and equipment in the areas of aircraft engineering and operation of airfields and aerodromes. On 20 May 1913, a branch was set up for aeroengine production at Schleissheimer Stra√üe 288 (near the first airport on the Oberwiesenfeld) in Munich-Milbertshofen, and Karl Rapp and Joseph Wirth were given power of attorney in Munich. Rapp, working as an engineer and operations manager for the company, engaged in the construction of several biplanes and a monoplane. Rapp also designed aeroengines, one of which was the FD 1416 aeroengine. The company took participation in the General Air Show in Berlin in 1912. However, the company was dissolved by a resolution of the shareholders on 16 April 1913, and Joseph Wirth was appointed as sole liquidator. After the liquidation process had been brought to an end, the company was wound up on 8 August 1916. Rapp Motorenwerke - the BMW foundation Karl Rapp and Julius Auspitzer founded Karl Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH with a capital stock of RM 200,000 on 29 April 1913 on the site of Flugwerke Deutschland (after the company went into liquidation). General Consul Auspitzer was the company's sole shareholder, with the operational side of the company managed by Karl Rapp. The idea was for the new company to build and sell \\"engines of all types, in particular internal combustion engines for aircraft and motor vehicles\\", in addition to building an engine for the 2nd Kaiser's Trophy Competition, (but it was not ready in time). The company expanded rapidly and employed 370 coworkers by 1915. Several aircraft prototypes were designed in the Rapp Motorenwerke, but success eluded all these prototypes because of weaknesses in the design. At the beginning of the First World War, the company was one of the key Bavarian companies for the war effort, and appeared to have gained a certain reputation, despite the fact that none of the designs and developments achieved any real success. Although the Prussian Army Administration rejected a delivery of Rapp engines as unsuitable, the Bavarian Army Administration and the Imperial Naval Office of the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Army Administration continued to order Rapp engines licensed through Austro-Daimler. On behalf the Austrian war Ministry, Franz Josef Popp supervised the handling of the order in Munich. The decision by the Prussian Army Administration to order 600 units of the innovative high-altitude aero-engine (project name \\"BBE\\"), originated by the designer Max Friz, entails reorganizing the legal structure of the company. The unsuccessful managing director and shareholder Karl Rapp resigned from the company around that time, most likely due to ill-health. In this connection, Rapp-Motorenwerke is renamed Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH. On 4 October 1917, Franz Josef Popp is appointed Managing Director of the company. The new company takes over the employees and manufacturing facilities. Until the end of the war, aero-engines remain the company's only product. The BBE aero-engine was a big success under the designation BMW IIIa. Later life thumb After Rapp left the company (immediately it was renamed BMW) he became chief engineer and head of the Aeroengine Department of the L.A. Riedlinger Machine Factory where he was probably employed until October 1923. Rapp lived in Switzerland from 1934, running a small observatory making solar observations. Karl Friedrich Rapp died in 1962 in Locarno.

Standards The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Reflective Insulation Manufacturer's Association (RIMA) have established an industry standard for evaluating paints claiming to have insulating characteristics. The energy conserving property has been defined as thermal emittance (the ability of a surface to release radiant energy that it has absorbed). Those coatings qualified as Interior Radiation Control Coatings must show a thermal emittance of 0.25 or less. This means that an IRCCS will block 75% or more of the radiant heat transfer. These low \\"E\\" coatings were originally developed in 1978 at the Solar Energy Corporation (SOLEC) in Princeton, New Jersey for use in tubular evacuated solar collectors. The developer, Robert Aresty, designed them to be used as low emissivity surfaces on glass to replace vacuum deposited surfaces. While SOLEC was doing collaborative work with the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), Phillip Fairey, research director at FSEC and world-renowned researcher in radiant barriers discovered the availability of these coatings in the SOLEC labs. He immediately grasped that they might be used as a replacement for foil radiant barriers, and proceeded to perform experiments verifying their viability for this use. In 1986 these coatings were applied for the first commercial application in homes built by Centex Corporation. Uses Uses of IRCCS includes residential and commercial building insulation, as well as industrial and automotive applications.

Further, Chitty's health was in decline and he was becoming increasingly anxious about his parlous state. Much of his energy became taken up in avoiding the attentions of his creditors. He retired from practice in 1833 but continued to publish. He died in London and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Family He married Elizabeth Woodward, and they had eight children.

He was the key contributor of engine design and innovation that led to the founding of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) in 1917. Early life Assumed to be originally from Urach, very little is known about Friz' youth. It is known however, that at a young age, he apprenticed to the Kuhn steam engine company in Cannstatt starting in 1898. In 1902, he enrolled at the Royal Building Trade School in Stuttgart-Esslingen furthering his engineering skills. In 1906, he was employed by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, in the Design Office, making major contributions to the design of the racing engine for the 1914 Mercedes Grand Prix car that won the French Grand Prix.BMW Group archives Friz designed the first practical German aircraft engines in 1912-1913 while at Austro-Daimler. The engines had separate cylinders on the crankcase and an overhead camshaft driven by a vertical shaft and bevel gears. At the end of 1916 the young engineer Max Friz applied for a position with Rapp Motorenwerke. At that time Friz was still working for the Daimler engine company in Untert√ºrkheim, near Stuttgart. However, he was frustrated because the chief engineer, Paul Daimler, ignored the suggestions of his young assistant on engine development. Faced with this situation, Friz remembered his former colleague, Karl Rapp. At first Rapp was going to turn down Friz‚Äôs request; however, Josef Popp successfully intervened on Friz‚Äôs behalf, because he recognized that Rapp Motorenwerke lacked an able designer. At the Daimler engine company, Max Friz had tried in vain to develop an oversized, high-compression engine, but Paul Daimler had firmly committed himself to supercharger technology. Not until he had moved to Munich was Friz able to put his own ideas for a high-altitude engine into practice. In the space of a few weeks he designed a new aero-engine, which, with an innovative carburettor and a variety of other technical details, was superior to any other German aero-engine. Later, this engine would gain world renown under the designation \\"BMW IIIa\\". Aircraft Engines BMW IVa- This engine set the World Altitude record in 1919 by Franz Zeno Diemer Upon arriving at Rapp Motorenwerke, Friz was tasked to develop an aircraft engine that could attain very high altitudes as well as be durable and aerodynamically favorable. A higher operational flight ceiling was a critical strategic advantage for the pilot (since the atmospheric pressure decreases the higher a pilot flies a plane, a conventional engine at this time literally stalled out above 3,000 meters). In the spring of 1917, at the time Friz was working at the drawing board on his groundbreaking engine, the outlook for Rapp Motorenwerke was bad. The Army High Command wanted to commit itself to a few types of aircraft and aeroengine and then get these built under license by several companies. In the spring of 1917 a commission from the Reichswehr therefore inspected the Rapp engine plant. They had to decide which engines would in future have to be produced under license in Munich. In the end, the Rapp management was faced with the choice of manufacturing either Daimler or Benz engines. However, Franz Josef Popp seized the opportunity of presenting the new engine to the commission of experts, an engine which up to now had only existed in Max Friz‚Äôs drawings. The interest shown by the officers was considerable, and soon there was no more talk of the Rapp engine factory being relegated to the rank of a mere assembler. In fact, the Reichswehr was so impressed by the new engine that it placed an order for 600 units, even before a single prototype had been produced. The aeroengine developed by Friz had turned Rapp Motorenwerke into an essential contributor to the war effort virtually overnight. On 20 May 1917, Rapp Motorenwerke registered the documentation for the construction design for the new engine, dubbed project \\"BBE\\". Friz' design, based on Karl Rapp's design) was laid out as an in-line six-cylinder, which guaranteed optimum balance, therefore few, small vibrations. The engine was successful, but the real breakthrough came in 1917, when Friz integrated a basically simple throttle butterfly into the \\"high-altitude carburettor\\", enabling the engine to develop its full power high above the ground. This is precisely the reason why the engine, now dubbed \\"Type IIIa\\", had unique superiority in air combat. The water-cooled in-line 6-cylinder engine's reputation grew very quickly. Franz-Zeno Diemer, the pioneering aviator, sets a new world altitude record with a 32,000 ft (9760 m) flight in 1919 using the BMW IVa engine. It was the success of this engine that allowed the company to grow exceptionally fast, necessitating the restructuring of the company. In 1917, Rapp Motorenwerke is renamed Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH the predecessor to the modern day BMW AG. Friz, as Design Director for BMW, designed further aircraft engines which strengthened BMW's reputation still further in later years. Motorcycles With World War I over, the company was forbidden from aircraft design. This necessitated the need for new avenues of growth for the company. Friz, with his designs and engineering expertise, launches BMW into the motorcycle market with the development of the R32 motorcycle, which established the foundation for all future boxer powered BMW motorcycles (in addition to numerous motorsport titles and world records). The boxer engine in an R32 Friz and his team of engineers design the first \\"boxer\\" (or opposed twin) engine was the fore-and-aft M2B15, based on a British Douglas design. It was manufactured by BMW in 1921/1922 but mostly used in other brands of motorcycles, notably Victoria of Nuremberg. The M2B15 proved to be moderately successful and BMW used it in its own Helios motorcycle. BMW also developed and manufactured a small 2-stroke motorcycle called the \\"Flink\\" for a short time. When BMW Gmbh went public in 1922, Friz was named the first Chief Engineer and Design Director of BMW AG, a post he would hold until 1937. The 1924 R32 motorcycle With the development of its first light alloy cylinder head, a much more significant \\"across the frame\\" version of the boxer engine was designed. In 1923 the R32 debuted at the Paris Auto Show, and caused quite a sensation among engineers and consumers alike. Using the new aluminum alloy cylinders, Friz designed a engine with and a top speed of .BM Bikes BMW R32 specifications The R32 was the second major product Friz designed for his company, effectively keeping the company solvent during a difficult time. The engine and gear box formed a bolt-up single unit. At a time when many motorcycle manufacturers used a total-loss oiling systems, the new BMW engine featured a recirculating wet-sump oiling system. However, it was not a \\"high- pressure oil\\" system based on shell bearings and tight clearances that we are familiar with, but a drip feed to roller bearings. This system was used by BMW until 1969. The wet-sump system was not overly common on motorcycles until the 1970s and the arrival of Japanese motorcycles. Until then, many manufacturers had used dry sump, with an external oil-tank made of sheet-metal. Automobiles Friz was appointed to General Manager of BMW-Flugmotorenbau GmbH, Munich in 1934, and was there until 1937. With BMW continued growth into automobiles, Friz succeeded Leo C. Grass as General Manager of Flugmotorenfabrik Eisenach GmbH, overseeing development of automobile engine design and development. 1945 Friz retired from BMW. Friz was honored with an Honorary Doctorate from the Munich College of Advanced Technology in 1954. Friz died in Tegernsee on June 9, 1966.

Biography Born in Bristol, England, Wraxall was the son of John Wraxall, a merchant. Peter became a seaman after his family suffered financial hardship. He traveled to the Netherlands and Jamaica before finally settling in New York. In 1746, during King George's War, he raised a company for the expedition into Canada. The next year, he went back to England on private business. While in England, Wraxall received two royal commissions in 1750: secretary for the New York government to the Indians and clerk of the common pleas in the county and city of Albany. When he returned to New York, however, he found that the governor had already appointed Harmon Gansevoort to the Albany clerk position. Wraxall attempted through the courts to have his clerk's commission honored, to no avail. Wraxall did have his commission as New York's secretary of Indian affairs, which proved to be an important position as the French and Indian War approached. In 1754, Wraxall attended the Albany Congress, where British officials attempted to improve their relationship with the Iroquois and recruit native support for the coming conflict. At the same time, Wraxall published An Abridgement of the Records of Indian Affairs: Contained in Four Folio Volumes, Transacted in the Colony of New York, from the Year 1678 to the Year 1751, an important compilation of documents chronicling New York's dealings with Native Americans. Wraxall's work highlighted the incompetence of New York's Indian commissioners at Albany, and suggested that Indian affairs should be centralized under a single official. The Abridgement was sent to officials in Great Britain, and may have influenced the policy changes that followed. At the Albany Congress, Wraxall met William Johnson, an influential New York official. In April 1755, Johnson was commissioned as sole British agent to the Iroquois. Wraxall was appointed as Johnson's secretary, a position he held for the remainder of his life. In 1755, Wraxall accompanied Johnson on the Crown Point expedition. Johnson's victory at the Battle of Lake George on 8 September made him a British hero, but Wraxall, though important, remained obscure. Wraxall's final years were relatively uneventful. He continued to serve as Johnson's secretary, and attended Indian conferences, but poor health kept him from further military service. In 1756 he married Elizabeth Stillwell. He died three years later in New York City. His replacement as the crown's Indian secretary was Witham Marshe. ReferencesSources * Allen, Robert. \\"Wraxall, Peter\\".

September 28, 1998) was a prominent lawyer and civil rights advocate from Wilmington, Delaware. Redding, the first African American to be admitted to the Delaware bar, was part of the NAACP legal team that challenged school segregation in the Brown v. Board of Education case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. He was 96 when he died at a hospital in Lima, Pa. Background Louis Redding was born in Alexandria, Virginia to parents Lewis Alfred Redding and Mary Ann (Holmes) Redding, but moved to Wilmington, Delaware during his childhood. The Redding family resided at 203 East 10th Street in the heart of Wilmington's African-American community. Redding attended segregated public schools and graduated from Howard High School (the only high school for African Americans in the state at the time) in 1919. He subsequently enrolled at Brown University and graduated with honors in 1923. After college, Redding became vice principal of Fessenden Academy in Ocala, Florida and later taught at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1925, Redding entered Harvard Law School. He was the only African- American in Harvard Law's 1928 graduating class. Redding was admitted to the Delaware bar in the following year. In 2009, the Redding House Foundation opened the Redding House Museum in his childhood home in Wilmington. Career Telegram to Governor J. Caleb Boggs requesting assistance to integrate Milford High School in 1954 Redding began practicing law in Delaware in 1929, becoming the first African American lawyer in Delaware. He remained the sole non-white lawyer for more than 25 years. Redding handled cases that successfully challenged discrimination in housing, public accommodations, employment, and the criminal justice system. Redding represented the plaintiffs in several Delaware cases that challenged segregation in Delaware. In 1950, he brought a case before the Chancery Court against the University of Delaware, which barred black students from admission, citing the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine. Parker v. the University of Delaware was decided for the plaintiffs, thereby requiring the University to admit black students. It was the first state-funded undergraduate institution to desegregate by court order. In 1952, Redding brought two cases to desegregate public schools in Claymont (Belton v. Gephart) and Hockessin (Bulah v. Gephart). Gebhart v. Belton was combined with cases from three other states and the District of Columbia to become part of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in 1954 known as Brown v. Board of Education. Redding argued the Brown case with a team of attorneys that included Thurgood Marshall. Redding also successfully argued Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority before the US Supreme Court in 1961 which held that segregation in public accommodations was not permissible. He practiced law for 57 years, opening doors to education and accommodations for many in Delaware and the nation. After his death in 1998, the University of Delaware established the Louis L. Redding Chair for the Study of Law and Public Policy. A residence hall (opened in 2013) at the University of Delaware's Newark Campus was named after him.Udel.edu In 2016, an historic marker was unveiled for Louis L. Redding to educate future generations about his legacy and modern relevance. Personal Louis Redding was the eldest of seven children. Redding's brother, J. Saunders Redding, was a noted author and college professor. His sisters Lillian Redding Bailey and C. Gwendolyn Redding were teachers in the Wilmington School System. Two of his siblings, Joseph and Hattie, died in childhood and another, Jannetta Mayson Redding, died during her college years. Louis Redding was married twice. He had three daughters‚ÄîAnn, Rupa, and Judith‚Äîwith his first wife Ruth Albert Cook Redding. After they divorced he married Gwendolyn Carmen Kiah.

The site is owned and managed by the Tr‚Äôond√´k Hw√´ch‚Äôin First Nation, and is operated by the First Nation's Department of Heritage. In the late 19th century Tr'och√´k was the camp of Chief Isaac, the leader of the Tr'ondek Hwech'in during the Klondike Gold Rush. The Tr'ondek people used this site primarily in the summer, hunting moose in the flats across the Klondike and fishing for salmon during their migration up the Yukon. Tr'ochek lies on the upstream flat, an alluvial deposition of the Klondike River, at the river confluence. Dawson City is directly north of the site, just across the Klondike. The river flat has a mixture of poplar trees, alder and willow bushes, with open grassy meadows. The steep hillside behind the site is covered with vegetation typical of a northern exposure boreal forest - thick moss, spruce, and small birch groves. On the bench above the flat, mining activity has stripped away both vegetation and soil, leaving a fringe of the original spruce forest along the edge of the river bluffs. The gold rush was a period of great disruption for the Tr'ondek Hwech'in. Thousands of stampeders overwhelmed them at their summer camp. To avoid the worst excesses of this time, the Tr'ondek Hwech'in made arrangements, with the assistance of the Anglican Church and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to move a few kilometres downriver to a site known as Moosehide. After the Tr'ondek Han relocation to Moosehide (), Tr'ochek was used by the non-native newcomers for a series of urban and industrial activities. Several bridges connected the site to Dawson City and until the 1910s, Klondike City, as the site became known, remained a fairly active part of the Dawson urban area. Later, as the newcomer population dwindled, the site was used for a time for market gardening. First Nation people began resettling the site in the 1950s. In the early 1990s mining activity on the site instigated a lawsuit by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in challenging Canada's right to issue mining claims on unsurrendered Indian lands. The Tr'ondek Hwech'in reaffirmed their ownership of the site in their land claim final agreement in 1998, and designated it as a heritage site. It was subsequently designated as a National Historic Site of Canada on July 19, 2002.

In 2019, they served 6,000 parents and children. Its services include intake and referral to shelter, emergency shelter, transitional housing, and childcare‚Äîin addition to a broad spectrum of counseling, parenting education, prevention, and support services.  Mission  Compass Family Services serves San Francisco families facing homelessness to help them secure stable housing and attain economic self- sufficiency and family well-being.  History  Compass Family Services, known until 1995 as Travelers Aid San Francisco, was established in 1914 to provide assistance to newcomers to the city, particularly young women and girls drawn by the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915). Since that time, Compass has served a wide range of populations, from stranded travelers to refugees to homeless families, but a common denominator among the various groups has been a need for help in an often unfriendly urban environment. In 1976, the agency responded to the need for respite childcare among the growing number of families making use of its services by opening the Tenderloin Childcare Center (now called Compass Children's Center). In 1990, the Tenderloin Childcare Center became the first licensed childcare center in San Francisco to reserve slots exclusively for homeless and children from families with extremely low incomes.Viets,J.\\"Tenderloin Kids Want Their Child-Care Center Back\\" The San Francisco Chronicle, December 26, 1985 Homeless children experience developmental delays at four times the rate of other children Bay Area Foundation Advisory Group to End Homelessness and almost 50 percent have emotional problems such as anxiety and depression.Better Homes Fund-W.K.

In 1990, in response to the burgeoning crisis of family homelessness, the agency opened an emergency shelter program, Compass Family Center (CFC), providing homeless families with short-term housing, counseling and referrals and assistance in obtaining permanent housing. Homeless families represent the fastest growing segment of homeless people in the U.S.Institute for Children and Poverty and forty percent of the entire population are children and families Better Homes Fund- W.K. Kellogg Foundation In 1995 an aftercare component was added along with pre-employment and psychotherapy services. In 1995, Compass Community Services opened Clara House, a long-term Supportive housing program.Zane,M.\\"Home Away From Homelessness\\" The San Francisco Chronicle, February 13, 1995 Families entering this program are given the opportunity to live in a stable service-enriched environment for up to two years while preparing to maintain permanent housing on their own. The program came under scrutiny from San Francisco homeless advocates for its proposed program rules requiring all families referred to the program to provide proof of their legal status in the U.S.Burdman,P.\\"Homeless Agency's Plan to Screen for Illegals - Travelers' Aid idea blasted even before S.F. program starts\\" The San Francisco Chronicle, December 23, 1994 This stipulation was added because under the recently adopted Proposition 187 undocumented individuals were barred from publicly financed employment services - a central piece of the Clara House program. Clara House then received a quarter of is funding from the City of San Francisco and it was unclear if they would legally be able to serve undocumented clients. The program ultimately decided to remove legal immigration status as a requirement for admission.Burdman,P. \\"Travelers Aid Drops Screening - Immigration status won't be checked\\" The San Francisco Chronicle, December 24, 1994 Also in 1995, at the request of and with funding from the San Francisco Human Services Agency, the agency began Connecting Point (CP), which serves as the central intake and assessment center for any family in San Francisco needing to access the city's shelter system. In 2007, CP was awarded a contract in partnership with the Eviction Defense Collaborative to provide rental assistance that allows families to maintain housing before they become homeless. In 2006, CFC received a 3-year grant through the SF First Five Commission to provide parent-child services with the goal of improving the developmental outcomes for children ages 0‚Äì5. The result was the Positive Parenthood Project, which outreaches to homeless families with children ages 0‚Äì5 and offers a range a support services. In 2007 CFC was awarded a contract, in joint venture with Catholic Charities CYO, to provide housing subsidies to families that are either homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. This program follows the housing first principal adopted by all San Francisco agencies in 2007 that provide services to homeless families. This approach places an emphasis on rapidly rehousing families or preventing them from losing their existing housing preventing families entering the cycle of homelessness in the first place. The project, SF HOME, provides intensive services to participating families to assist them to increase their income through employment and training. Today, Compass has been recognized as one of the Best Non-Profits in the Bay Area by the San Francisco chapter of the Association for Corporate Growth (ACG) and has been awarded the national Mutual of America Community Partnership Award. Compass has been one of 23 agencies nationwide to be awarded a federal grant through the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development to rapidly re-house homeless families.

About 50 active singers make up the mixed chorus, which forwards a tradition of preserving German music and German culture in the Washington Metropolitan Area with numerous concerts and musical performances during the year, often in conjunction with other groups. A Spring Concert, a Fall Concert and a traditional German Christmas Concert at United Church on 20th and G St, Washington, D.C. are part of the repertoire. An annual Masquerade Ball at Mardi Gras time and participation at the local Oktoberfest celebrations are some of the other activities. The Washington S√§ngerbund's mission statement is to preserve German song and the German language. The organization cultivates the study of music and instructs the members in choral singing and in the theoretical knowledge of music. History Early in 1851 a few young Germans of the choir of the Concordia Church (today United Church/Vereinigte Kirche) located at 20th & G Sts., NW in Washington, DC decided to organize a German Singing Society. They were planning to participate as a German chorus in the Second Song Festival of the Nord√∂stlicher S√§ngerbund of America, which was to be held in Baltimore, Maryland in June 1851. The group formed and elected its first president, Julius Viedt. Following an invitation from the members of the new singing club, Mr. Charles Walter of Baltimore accepted the musical directorship and set the date for the first rehearsal for April 12, 1851 at the German Hall on 11th Street, NW between F & G Sts in Washington, DC. But, as it turned out, in those days travel was not that easy and Mr. Walter was unable to attend due to inclement weather. In a letter he explained; \\"I am sorry for not appearing last night. But I thought I better stay home since I didn't think a rehearsal would get together in this kind of weather. I am happy about your intentions and I will become a member, if chosen as the new director or not. Please go ahead and schedule another rehearsal next Wednesday, April 20, 1851 at 8:30 in the evening at the German Hall.\\" This date marks the first rehearsal of record of the Washington S√§ngerbund (www.saengerbund.org). The S√§ngerbund never went to the Song Festival in Baltimore in 1851 because the director felt that the group was not ready. In the following years, however, they began participating in those Song Festivals of the Northeastern S√§ngerbund and brought home prizes and awards on several occasions. Its first success in the then popular singing competitions came in July 1869 in Baltimore when it won the first prize, a grand piano which it triumphantly brought home to Washington. During its first 50 years of existence, the Washington S√§ngerbund (www.saengerbund.org) grew to be recognized as the stellar singing group in Washington, D.C. and along the entire Eastern seaboard. It performed at many notable occasions and before many dignitaries. The Washington S√§ngerbund (www.saengerbund.org) is mentioned in the early history of the United States when during the Civil War in July, 1861 German district soldiers stood at the Great Falls on the Potomac River to guard the local water supply utilities. One of the first two casualties was Henry Ricks, an active member of the Washington S√§ngerbund. And in 1865, after President Lincoln's death, the Washington newspaper Columbia carried an article on April 22 which stated, \\"The S√§ngerbund furnished an honor guard at the head of the bier of the dead President. Suddenly the men from the S√§ngerbund sang through the silence \\"Gesang der Geister √ºber den Wassern\\" by Franz Schubert. Prospect Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. By 1901, at its 50th Anniversary, the S√§ngerbund had a total of 3,179 members, including 398 active singers, 2,754 passive members and 27 honorary members. By 1929 bad economic conditions and the prohibition caused the Washington S√§ngerbund to cease operations. It even lost its S√§ngerbund Hall at 314 C St., NW which it had built, and moved into on December 19, 1893. But in 1934 a new singing organization by the name of the M√§nnergesangverein Washington was founded. After three years the M√§nnergesangverein realized that the original charter was still on record, changed its name and the Washington S√§ngerbund was reborn. While the S√§ngerbund had always been a men's chorus, the ladies in 1936 decided to form their own singing society which was to exist for almost 30 years as the Washington S√§ngerbund Ladies Chorus. In 1967 they eventually decided to join the men to become a mixed chorus. In 1981 the Washington S√§ngerbund published a 200-page hard-cover book describing its first 125 years. Frank H. Pierce III and his wife Nancy, both members of the Washington S√§ngerbund, did extensive research to cover many details of the S√§ngerbund's role in our nation's capital of Washington DC, reaching back to the days before the Civil War. The book is still available for purchase from the Washington S√§ngerbund. The Nord√∂stlicher S√§ngerbund serves as an umbrella organization for German-American choruses in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and holds a Song Festival (S√§ngerfest) every three years in a different city. As a member, the Washington S√§ngerbund has hosted this Song Festival four times: in 1960 at the Uline Arena, in 1973 at the Sheraton Park Hotel, in 1988 at the Washington Hilton Hotel and in 2009 at the National Building Museum. In 1993 it also organized a National Song Festival in Washington, DC with participating choruses from as far away as Germany, the West Coast and Canada. The grand finale was an outdoor concert presented on the west steps of the Capitol with chorus and orchestra. On May 22‚Äì24, 2009 the Nord√∂stlicher S√§ngerbund gathered for the 50th time to hold its S√§ngerfest and our Nation's Capital Washington, DC was selected for the event. The concert with about 300 singers, accompanied by soloists and the orchestra of the National Gallery of Art was held in the grand hall of the historic National Building Museum. Today the Washington S√§ngerbund continues its long tradition of preserving German music and German Culture in the Washington Metropolitan area with numerous concerts and musical performances during the year, often in conjunction with other groups. Its repertoire consists of music in the German language and rehearsals are held weekly on Friday evening. In addition the S√§ngerbund sponsors other social activities such as an annual \\"German Fasching - Costume Ball\\", brings authentic German flavor to several local Oktoberfests, or plays host to visiting choruses from Germany.

Formed in 2007, it was based in Portland, Oregon. In July 2012, Climate Savers Computing Initiative combined with The Green Grid and its programs continue within that organization. Participating manufacturers committed to producing products that meet specified power-efficiency targets, and members committed to purchasing power-efficient computing products. By 2010, the initiative sought to reduce energy consumption by computers by 50 percent and reduce global emissions from the operation of computers by 54 million tons a year.This reduction in emissions was calculated based on IDC projections of desktop and server volumes in the years 2007-2011, using a baseline of 295 kWh/year energy consumption for a typical desktop in the first half of 2007, and assuming market penetration of 60% of desktop units shipped in 2010 being Energy Star, 25% meeting the 85% PSU efficiency standard, 10% meeting the 88% standard, and 5% meeting the 90% standard; it also assumed that 80% of desktop PCs shipped in 2010 use power management features. Under these assumptions, total power consumption for PCs shipped in 2010 was reduced by over 50%, for a total savings of 62 billion kWh in 2010, worth over $5.5 billion (at an average cost of $0.0885/kWh ). Note: the total savings in 2010 is based on power consumed by units shipped in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.  Goal  The goal of the new environmental effort was to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting targets for energy-efficient computers and components, and promoting the adoption of energy-efficient computers and power management tools globally. The typical desktop PC wastes more than half of the power it draws from a power outlet.Based on IDC projections of desktop and server units shipped, a baseline of typical desktop and server power consumption in the first half of 2007, and an average cost of $0.0885/KW. Servers typically waste 30-40% of the power they consume. This energy is wasted as heat. As a result, offices, homes, and data centers have increased demands on air conditioning which in turn increases energy requirements and associated costs. By increasing the effectiveness of power-management features in computers as well as implementing these features and aggressive power- management policies, the average business desktop can save 60% of the electricity consumed, with no compromise to productivity. These results combat climate change and cut costs. With individual member and company participation, this effort worked toward a 50% reduction in power consumption by computers by 2010, and committed participants aimed to collectively save $5.5 billion in energy costs and 54 million tons of emissions a year. That would be the equivalent of taking 11 million cars off the road every year. Participants in the Climate Savers Computing Initiative represented both the demand and supply side of the computer industry, including computer manufacturers and chip makers, as well as environmental groups, energy companies, retailers, government agencies and more. Supporters of the initiative included Intel Corporation, Google, Dell, EDS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Microsoft, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;), World Wildlife Fund and others. Specifications The Climate Savers Computing Initiative operated in a manner similar to the U.S. Government's Energy Star program. It was intended to promote both the deployment of existing technologies and investment in new energy-efficiency technologies. The Energy Star 4.0 standard for desktops, laptops, and workstations, which took effect in July 2007, requires power supplies to be at least 80 percent efficient for most of their load range. In addition, it puts limits on the energy used by devices when inactive and requires systems to be shipped with power management features enabled.  PCs  The Initiative started with the 2007 Energy Star requirements for desktops, laptops and workstations (including monitors), and gradually increased the efficiency requirements over the next four years, as follows: # From July 2007 through June 2008, PCs must have met the Energy Star requirements. This means 80 percent minimum efficiency for the power supply unit (PSU) at 20 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent of rated output, a power factor of at least 0.9 at 100 percent of rated output, and meeting the maximum power requirements in standby, sleep, and idle modes. # From July 2008 through June 2009 the standard increased to 85 percent minimum efficiency for the PSU at 50 percent of rated output (and 82 percent minimum efficiency at 20 percent and 100 percent of rated output). Equivalent to 80 Plus Bronze level. # From July 2009 through June 2010, the standard increased to 88 percent minimum efficiency for the PSU at 50 percent of rated output (and 85 percent minimum efficiency at 20 percent and 100 percent of rated output). Equivalent to 80 Plus Silver level. # From July 2010 through June 2011, the standard increased to 90 percent minimum efficiency for the PSU at 50 percent of rated output (and 87 percent minimum efficiency at 20 percent and 100 percent of rated output). Equivalent to 80 Plus Gold level.  Servers  In addition, the Initiative set the following high-efficiency targets for volume servers (1U/2U single- and dual-socket servers): # From July 2007 through June 2008, volume servers must have had 85 percent minimum efficiency for the power supply unit (PSU) at 50 percent of rated output (and 81 percent minimum efficiency at 20 percent and 100 percent of rated output), and power factor of at least 0.9 at 100 percent of rated output. # From July 2008 through June 2009 the standard increased to 89 percent minimum efficiency for the PSU at 50 percent of rated output (and 85 percent minimum efficiency at 20 percent and 100 percent of rated output). # From July 2009 through June 2010, the standard increased to 92 percent minimum efficiency for the PSU at 50 percent of rated output (and 88 percent minimum efficiency at 20 percent and 100 percent of rated output. Relationship with The Green Grid On July 19, 2012 Climate Savers Computing Initiative and The Green Grid announced a joining of the two organizations resulting in Climate Savers Computing Initiative's programs and membership being moved under The Green Grid brand to build on TGG's success in improving resource efficiency in information technology and data centers. TGG and CSCI fused their separate but closely aligned resources together to accelerate the implementation of energy efficiency and sustainability within the IT and communications industries.Call to action video at YouTube See also * 80 Plus * Energy Star * Green computing * Power management ReferencesExternal links *Climate Savers Computing Initiative - website Category:Computers and the environment Category:Climate change organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations based in Portland, Oregon Category:2007 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Climate Savers Computing Initiative"},{"id":"12696682","text":"Anthony Evans (born 11 January 1954) is an English former professional footballer.

This territory, so designated by the ruling Russians of the time, encompassed most of the Vistula River (Weichsel in German, Wis≈Ça in Polish) watershed of central Poland up to just east of Toru≈Ñ (Thorn). Migration history The Vistula River flows south to north in a broad easterly loop that extends from the Carpathian Mountains to its mouth on the Baltic Sea near Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig). Many were invited in by German and Polish nobility but most settled in cities and large towns which were often governed under a form known as German town law. German settlement on abandoned or empty land in Kujawy and Royal Prussia increased as land owners sought to re-populate their lands after the losses of the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721).Karol Ciesielski, Osadnictwo \\"Olƒôderskie\\" w Prusach Kr√≥lewskich i na Kujawach w ≈õwietle Kontrakt√≥w Osadniczych Studia i Materia≈Çy do Dziej√≥w Wielkopolski i Pomorza, vol. IV, Issue 2 (1958), p. 226 Migration up the Vistula River, to P≈Çock, Wyszogr√≥d, and beyond, continued through the period of the Partitions of Poland by Prussia, Austria and Russia. Much of the Vistula River watershed region came under Prussian rule in 1793 and became the provinces of South Prussia and New East Prussia. In spite of the brief liberation of Polish territories by Napoleon (when the region was known as the Duchy of Warsaw) and in spite of the takeover by Russia following the Treaty of Paris (1815), German migration continued into the region throughout the 19th century. They often settled in existing communities but also established many new ones so that, by World War I, well over 3000 villages with German inhabitants can be documented.Kolonizacja Niemiecka w Poludniowo-Wschodniej Czesci Krolestwa Polskiego w Latach 1815-1915; Wieslaw Sladkowski, Wydawnictwo Lubelskie Some German villages in the area were identified by the adjective Niemiecki, which means \\"German\\" in Polish (e.g., Kƒôpa Niemiecka). This differentiated a German village from another in the same immediate area where Poles lived (the Polish village might have the adjective Polski (e.g., Kƒôpa Polska). After World War II, due to anti-German feelings, the adjective was commonly dropped or replaced by a term like Nowe (new). However, some villages even today still retain the old identifier. The vast majority of Germans in this region were Lutheran. While they retained a clear Germanic ethnicity, traditions and language, they often adapted or adopted Polish culture and food and sometimes surnames. A limited amount of intermarriage between the cultures occurred.See There were no Mixed Marriages? at Upstream Vistula Large numbers of these Germans chose to leave the area during the Napoleonic occupation, heading further south and east to the Black Sea and Bessarabian regions of Russia. Still others headed east to Volhynia during the Polish uprisings of the 1830s and 1860s. In addition to fleeing these unsettled conditions, the latter were also attracted by offers of land that became available as a result of emancipation of serfs in Russia. Significant numbers of these Vistula Germans (including many who had spent a generation or more in the Black Sea, Bessarabia, and Volhynia regions) migrated to North America in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Since most were farmers, they tended to head for opportunities of inexpensive or virtually free homestead land in the Midwestern and Plains States and Canadian prairies. They are of course scattered about in other regions as well. Those who remained in this area through World War II were expelled to German territory in accord with the post-war agreements between the Allied Powers of Britain, Russia, and the United States. In a few cases, ethnic Germans who had been detained by Communist Polish authorities for forced labor remained in Poland, as did some ethnic Germans who had family ties with ethnic Poles. Some ethnic Germans were captured by Soviet troops, and were forced east to settle in Kazakhstan and Siberia. They were never repatriated.

This type of village organization became known as the \\"Olƒôder Law,\\" and such villages were called \\"Holendry\\" or \\"Olƒôdry.\\" Inhabitants of these villages were called Olƒôdrzy, regardless of whether they were of Dutch, German or other descent.For example, in 1715-1716, parish records for P≈Çonkowo referred to Lutheran Germans from villages in the manor of Kaczkowo, Inowroc≈Çaw County as being from \\"Olƒôndr√≥w Rojewskich\\", \\"Olƒôndr√≥w Kaczkowskich\\", \\"Glinskich Olƒôndr√≥w\\" or \\"Jezuickich Holƒôndr√≥w.\\" See Family History Library Microfilm No. 2256803, Item 1, Frames 5-26. There were two Mennonite communities in Mazovia: one at Wymy≈õle Polskie and one at Deutsch Kazun.Jerzy Sza≈Çygin, Katalog Zabytkow Osadnictwa Holenderskiego Na Mazowszu (Warsaw: DiG Wydawnictwo, 2004). Much, but not all, of this book's text is available in an English translation at: Catalogue of Monuments of Dutch Colonization in Mazovia Unfortunately, the translation rendered the term Olƒôder into English as \\"Dutch.\\" This sometimes creates the impression in the English-language text that the author meant persons descended from settlers from the Netherlands or Friesland, when he actually meant persons (most often ethnic Germans) living in villages organized under the Olƒôder law. Despite this translation problem, Sza≈Çygin's work is an excellent source of information for numerous villages in the subject region. Some Mennonite adherents lived in nearby villages where a substantial majority of the inhabitants were Lutheran Germans, such as Sady or ≈öwiniary, and there was some intermarriage between the two faith groups. These contacts may have contributed to Germanization of these Mennonites. Genealogy Records for Lutheran Churches (as well as some Baptist and Moravian Brethren), many of them dating back to the late 18th century, can be found in Warsaw Archives and were microfilmed by the LDS Family History Library. Known available Lutheran records are listed on the website of the Society for German Genealogy in Eastern Europe.Society for German Genealogy in Eastern Europe - Lutheran Records In some places few if any records exist, primarily because of their destruction in World War II. Where Lutheran Churches did not exist, or in times prior to their existence, the Germans would have been obligated to register at a Roman Catholic church.

History Station WKBB signed on in 1925 from Joliet, Illinois. In 1931, the station's ownership wanted to move WKBB to Dubuque as it did not have any radio stations. However, the complicated licensing quota system put into place by the Davis Amendment to the Radio Act of 1927 limited the number of stations that could be licensed to one state. At the time, both Iowa and Illinois were at their quota, and the Federal Radio Commission was forced to deny any relocations or new stations. WKBB was required to stay in state, and its application to move to East Dubuque, Illinois was granted in 1932 over the objections of the Dubuque Telegraph Herald, which desired to build its own station but could not due to the quota. The Davis Amendment was repealed in 1936; WKBB applied to move to Dubuque proper in the next year.

Designed for the Mitsubishi Aircraft Company by the British aircraft designer Herbert Smith, the 1MF, also known as the Navy Type 10 Carrier Fighter was operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1923 to 1930. Development and design The Japanese shipbuilding company Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Engineering Co Ltd set up a subsidiary company, the Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Co Ltd (Mitsubishi Nainenki Seizo KK) in 1920 to produce aircraft and automobiles at Nagoya. It quickly gained a contract from the Imperial Japanese Navy to produce three types of aircraft for operation from aircraft carriers: a fighter, a torpedo bomber and a reconnaissance aircraft. To produce these aircraft, it hired Herbert Smith, formerly of the Sopwith Aviation Company to assist the design of these aircraft, Smith bringing to Japan Jack Hyland and a team of six other British engineers . The fighter designed by Smith and his team, designated the 1MF by Mitsubishi, and known as the Navy Type 10 Carrier Fighter by the Japanese Navy (referring to the year of design of 1921, the 10th year of the Taish≈ç period), first flew in October 1921. The 1MF was a single-seat, single-bay biplane with unequal-span wings and all-wooden construction, powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8 engine (license produced as the Mitsubishi Hi engine). It was fitted with claw-type arrestor gear for use with British-style fore and aft arrestor cables. After successful flight testing, the aircraft was accepted by the Japanese Navy as a standard fighter, with 138 of various versions being built, production continuing until 1928. Operational history The 1MF entered service with the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1923, replacing the Gloster Sparrowhawk. A 1MF aircraft became the first aircraft to take-off from and land on Japan's new aircraft carrier on 28 February 1923. The 1MF series proved a tough and reliable aircraft, operating from the carriers and - as well as from H≈çsh≈ç - when they entered service in 1927 and 1928 respectively. It continued in service until 1930, being replaced by the Nakajima A1N. Variants ;1MF1 :Initial prototype. Fitted with car-type radiator on front of nose.

The club was founded with only two junior teams in 1995 and has since grown into one of the largest clubs in Yorkshire with teams for children of all ages. More recently the club founded an open-age team into which the junior players could progress. The club has eleven junior teams playing the West Riding League and Yorkshire Combination League. The open age team currently play in division 1 of the Pennine League. Newsome Magpies The first ever club to play rugby league in the Newsome area was the Newsome Magpies open age team. The team played Newsome High School and Sports College in the village with their home being the Fountain Inn on Towngate in Newsome. The club was established in 1989 by founder members Andy Brewster, Paul Brick, John Taylor and Sue Taylor. The club consisted of one open age team coached by Bryan Ward. After a period of success during which the club reached Division 1 in the Pennine League, won the Huddersfield Supplementary cup twice and were losing finalists in the LB Holiday Cup once, the club was unfortunately disbanded in 1994/95 due a struggle to find new players. Birth of the Panthers Newsome Panthers U13s circa 1995 In 1995, as the Newsome Magpies open age team disbanded, Paul and Gail Brick with the help of a number of willing parents launched a junior section that once up and running would provide a regular supply of able players to the open age team. Due to league rules the name 'Magpies' could not be used. The first official committee meeting was held on Monday 23 October 1995 and the name Panthers was adopted, and the club was born. The new junior club was still to be based at the Fountain Inn and with home games played at Newsome High School and Sports College. The first season saw an under 9 and an under 11 team enter the West Riding league. As the players in these initial teams got older and the teams moved up through the age groups they were replaced by a steady stream of younger players to the point where the Panthers now have a team for children of all ages above 7 years old in one of their eleven junior teams. In the 2006‚Äì2007 season the Panthers had over 180 junior members. The club hope to add a new age group every season with the aim to be the strongest club in the West Riding league. Open Age With the original purpose of the junior club in mind, the Panthers founded an open age team in 1999 and entered division 6 of the Pennine League under the banner of Newsome Panthers. The first squad was made up of some ex Magpie players, ex Almondbury Lions players and some new players to the game who together gained promotion to division 5 for the 2000/01 season. The 2000/01 season was a testing time for the Newsome Panthers, losing a number of the founder member players and also suffering through a number of injuries. Through this period the team still held its own in division 5. In the 2001/02 season, five ex-junior players from the successful under 16s squad took their places in the open age squad, helping them to promotion to division 4. In the 2002/03 Season, promotion from division 4 as champions, success in the Huddersfield Supplementary Cup and a place in the final of the Huddersfield Holiday Cup Final cememeted the squad together. In the league the team had a 100% record. The 2003/04 season brought together a genuine championship team with the squad winning every competition that they were able to take part in. The team achieved promotion to division 2 of the Pennine League and won the Shipley Cup, Holiday Cup and Supplementary Cup. This was achieved under the leadership of Bob Linford & Andy Bainbridge. The 2004/05 season saw successful retention of the Huddersfield Holiday Cup and Supplementary Cup. A third-place finish in division 2 behind Kippax and New Earswick All Blacks saw the team promoted into the 1st division, the division the Magpies had played in all those years ago. The 2006/07 season saw the beginning of the transition period where players retired or moved on and the introduction of further players from the junior ranks. After a poor start, where they lost their first 5 games away, the team turned the season around. The introduction of Phil Joseph as head coach with Andy Boothroyd as his assistant and further coaching assistance from Anthony Farrell has ensured that the foundations are now in place going forward. Clubmark Award and Hall Bower In 2003, through the hard work of the management committee, the club were awarded the Sport England Clubmark award. It also became evident that as the club grew, the two fields at Newsome High School and Sports College alone would not be enough to stage the number of games required each weekend. Therefore, in 2003 the club took a 30-year lease on the playing fields at Hall Bower Lane. Games were first played on the fields in September 2004 with the club now splitting games between these fields and the fields at the high school.

Howard, written by S.N. Behrman, and starring Warner Baxter, Leila Hyams, Ralph Bellamy, C. Aubrey Smith, and Alexander Kirkland. It is based on Axelle, a novel by Pierre Benoit.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Surrender The film is widely considered to have exerted an enormous influence upon Jean Renoir's subsequent Grand Illusion.  Plot  During World War I, the wily and attractive French POW Sergeant Dumaine is sequestered in a prison camp near the castle of a prideful Prussian nobleman and military general, Count Reichendorf, who lives for the day that his four sons will march triumphantly into Paris. Having lost three sons to the French and English armies, and left with only one son, Dietrich, Reichendorf laments the days when his family made Prussia \\"the might of land.\\" He is forced to recruit military men from the prison camp. Axelle, the daughter of one of the sons, who became his ward when her parents died, lives in the Reichendorf castle and makes periodic goodwill visits to the prison compound, where she first encounters Dumaine. Captain Ebbing, the martinet and disfigured prison commandant, develops an interest in Axtelle. He courts her, but Axelle shows little interest in him, and when he reminds her how he dazzled her before he went into battle, she rejects his affections and tells him that she is engaged to Dietrich. Ebbing pleads with her, insisting that his love for her is more intense and enduring than that of any other man, but she is not swayed. Ebbing soon puts Dumaine and the other prisoners to work at the unpleasant task of burial detail. When Dumaine, Fichet and other prisoners escape by overpowering the guards, they break into the Reichendorf castle and take refuge there, but are soon discovered by Axelle and taken back to the prison. One day, after noticing billows of smoke coming from the castle, Dumaine heroically rushes into the castle and puts out a kitchen fire. In gratitude for his valor, Ebbing commissions Dumaine, an electrical engineer by profession, to wire the castle. Dumaine's new assignment puts him in close contact with Axelle, and they soon become friends. After one month, Axelle begins to trust Dumaine and suggests that he remove his prison number from his uniform. When news reaches Germany that Dietrich has led his regiment in victorious battle against the French, an end to the war is predicted. Axelle is overjoyed at the news, but Dumaine, whose loyalties still remain with France, is upset. Back at the prison, Dumaine's fellow inmates resent Dumaine's privileged status at the castle, and plan a breakout without him. Soon after Dietrich returns from the battlefront, he discovers his fianc√©e in the arms of Dumaine, and learns that Ebbing, too, is trying to woo Axelle, so he decides to return to the front. When the jealous Ebbing learns of Dumaine's affair with Axelle, he sends the Frenchman to be executed despite Axelle's pleas to spare him. Ebbing later has a change of heart, however, and decides to call off the execution. News of the Armistice and the end of the war brings with it orders to suspend all disciplinary action against prisoners of war, and Ebbing, who sees no further use for himself as a military leader, commits suicide. With the battlelines suddenly erased, Dumaine and Axelle resume their romance with a kiss.

A genius with only a highschool education, Hendrix was a prolific inventor who by his death in 1962, in addition to his accomplishments and contributions to astronomy and optics had hundreds of patents to his name, most of which were donated to the U.S. Government. He experimented with various technologies and among many firsts was the first person to use aluminum instead of silver in the mirrors he created for the Carnegie Institute's telescopes. During the time he spent at the Carnegie Institute he worked on many projects for the U.S. government, including a co-authored patent for the proximity fuse for use in missiles and bombs, considered to be one of the most important inventions in history outside of the discovery of atomic energy. Due to the top secret nature of this and other projects, he never openly received credit for these inventions. During his time at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories, he became a protege of Edwin Hubble, and many other noted astronomers, and it is believed that alongside Hubble he contributed to the big bang theory. He was responsible for finishing and polishing the Palomar Observatory's 200-inch primary and the 120-inch primary at Lick Observatory, among many other contributions. In 1958 he became a member of the board of directors of Davidson Optronics, Inc. He invented a modified Twyman-Green interferometer (called the Hendrix Interferometer). The crater Hendrix on the Moon is named after him.

Another villa whose name invites confusion is the Villa Pisani (Bagnolo) which was also designed by Palladio. Veneto, northern Italy.  Architecture  It was designed by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio about 1552, for Cardinal Francesco Pisani. Pisani was also a patron of the painters Paolo Veronese and Giambattista Maganza and the sculptor Alessandro Vittoria, who provided sculptures of the Four Seasons for the villa, which is in fact provided with fireplaces to dispel winter chill. Unlike more typical Palladian villas ‚Äì and their imitations in Britain, Germany and the United States ‚Äì the Villa Pisani at Montagnana combines an urban front, facing a piazza of the comune, and, on the other side, a rural frontage extending into gardens, with an agricultural setting beyond. Unlike many of Palladio's villas in purely rural settings, it has an upper storey, set apart from more public reception rooms on the main floor; twin suites of apartments are accessed by twin oval staircases that flank the central recess on the garden side. On the exterior, little differentiation between floors is made: there is no obviously visible piano nobile. On the garden front, access to the park is from the central recessed portico only; a balustrade above a deep ditch keeps out informal wanderers. The Villa Pisani at Montagnana from I quattro libri dell'architettura, Giacomo Leoni, 1742. Not built as planned. Construction of the villa was under way by September 1553, and it was complete in 1555. The central block is an uncompromising rectangle, with a pedimented tetrastyle portico, Ionic over Doric, that has been sunk into its wall-plane so that the columns are embedded half-columns. On the garden front, the similar structure instead forms a screen across the fronts of a recessed portico surmounted by a loggia, which become in single recessed central feature. The Doric friezeIt is fully developed, with bucrania and paterae in the metopes between the triglyphs. runs uninterrupted round the building, further binding all elements together. There are no surviving autograph drawings related to this project. However, Palladio published a version of the building in his I quattro libri dell'architettura.

It is eaten as is or as an accompaniment to a number of savoury dishes (most notably, dinuguan). Puto is also an umbrella term for various kinds of indigenous steamed cakes, including those made without rice. It is a sub-type of kakanin (rice cakes). Description Puto is made from rice soaked overnight to allow it to ferment slightly. Yeast may sometimes be added to aid this process. It is then ground (traditionally with stone mills) into a rice dough known as galapong. The mixture is then steamed. The Filipino dish dinuguan is traditionally served with puto Putong lalaki topped with egg from Bulacan Puto with cheese toppings from Mindanao The most common shape of the putuh√°n steamer used in making puto is round, ranging from in diameter and between deep. These steamers are rings made of either soldered sheet metal built around a perforated pan, or of thin strips of bent bamboo enclosing a flat basket of split bamboo slats (similar to a dim sum steamer basket). The cover is almost always conical to allow the condensing steam to drip along the perimeter instead of on the cakes. A sheet of muslin (kats√¢) is stretched over the steamer ring and the prepared rice batter poured directly on it; an alternative method uses banana leaf as a liner. The puto is then sold as large, thick cakes in flat baskets called bilao lined with banana leaf, either as whole loaves or sliced into smaller, lozenge-shaped individual portions. Properly prepared puto imparts the slightly yeasty aroma of fermented rice galapong, which may be enhanced by the fragrance of banana leaves. It is neither sticky nor dry and crumbly, but soft, moist, and with a fine, uniform grain. The essential flavour is of freshly cooked rice, but it may be sweetened a bit if eaten by itself as a snack instead of as accompaniment to savory dishes. Most puto cooked in the Tagalog-speaking regions may contain a small quantity of wood ash lye. Puto eaten on its own commonly add toppings like cheese, butter/margarine, hard-boiled eggs, meat, or freshly grated coconut. In Bulacan, puto with cheese toppings are humorously called putong bakla (\\"homosexual puto\\"), while puto with egg toppings are called putong lalaki (\\"man's puto) and those filled with meat are called putong babae (\\"woman's puto). Variants Assorted modern puto in various flavors Puto is also an umbrella term for various kinds of indigenous steamed cakes, including those made without rice. The key characteristics are that they are cooked by steaming and are made with some type of flour (to contrast with bibingka, which are baked cakes). There are exceptions, however, like puto seko which is a baked dry cookie. The traditional puto made with galapong is sometimes referred to as putong puti (\\"white puto\\") or putong bigas (\\"rice puto) to distinguish it from other dishes also called puto. Modern variants of puto may also use non-traditional ingredients like ube (purple yam), vanilla, or chocolate. Notable variants of puto, as well as other dishes classified as puto, include the following: Rice-based puto Puto bumbong, a type of puto steamed in bamboo tubes commonly sold during the Christmas season *Puto bagas - a puto shaped like a concave disc that is made from ground rice (maaw). Unlike other puto it is baked until crunchy. It originates from the Bicol Region. *Puto bao - a puto from the Bicol region traditionally cooked cooked in halved coconut shells lined with a banana leaf. It distinctively has a filling of sweetened coconut meat (bukayo). * Puto bumbong ‚Äì traditionally made from a special variety of sticky or glutinous rice (called pirurutong) which has a distinctly purple colour. The rice mixture is soaked in saltwater and dried overnight and then poured into bumb√≥ng (bamboo tube) and then steamed until steam rises out of the bamboo tubes. It is served topped with butter or margarine and shredded coconut mixed with moscovado sugar. It is commonly eaten during Christmas in the Philippines along with bibingka, another type of rice cake. *Puto dahon or puto dahon saging - a puto from the Hiligaynon people that is traditionally cooked wrapped in a banana leaf. * Puto kutsinta (typically just called kutsinta or cuchinta)- a steamed rice cake similar to putong puti, but is made using lye. It is characteristically moist and chewy, and can range in color from reddish brown to yellow or orange in coloration. It is typically topped with shredded coconut meat. *Putong lusong - an anise-flavored puto from Pampanga typically served in square or rectangular slices. * Puto Manapla ‚Äì a variant specifically flavored with anise and lined with banana leaves. Philippine Daily Inquirer ‚Äì Lifestyle section It is named after the municipality of Manapla where it originates. * Puto maya ‚Äì more accurately, a type of biko. It is made from glutinous rice (usually purple glutinous rice called tapol) soaked in water, drained and then placed into a steamer for 30 minutes. This rice mixture is then combined with coconut milk, salt, sugar and ginger juice and returned to the steamer for another 25 to 30 minutes. It is popular in the Cebuano-speaking regions of the Philippines. It is traditionally served as small patties and eaten very early in the morning with sikwate (hot chocolate). It is also commonly paired with ripe sweet mangoes. *Puto pandan ‚Äì puto cooked with a knot of pandan leaves, which imparts additional fragrance and a light green color. * Puto-Pao ‚Äì a combination of siopao (meat-filled bun) and puto. It uses the traditional puto recipe but incorporates a spiced meat filling. It is similar to some traditional variants of puto (especially in Bulacan) that also have meat fillings. *Putong pula - a Tagalog puto from the Rizal Province which uses brown muscovado sugar, giving it a brownish color. *Putong pulo or putong polo - small spherical puto from Tagalog regions that typically use achuete seeds for coloring, giving the puto a light brown to orange color. They are traditionally served with a topping of cheese or grated young coconut. *Putong sulot - a version of puto bumbong that uses white glutinous rice. Unlike puto bumbong it is available all-year round. It originates from the province of Pampanga and Batangas. * Sayongsong ‚Äì also known as sarungsong or alisuso, they are steamed ground mixture of glutinous rice, regular rice, and young coconut or roasted peanuts, with coconut milk, sugar, and calamansi juice. It is distinctively served in cone-shaped banana leaves. It is a specialty of Surigao del Norte and the Caraga Region, as well as the southeastern Visayas. Others * Puto flan (also called leche puto, or puto leche) ‚Äì a combination of a steamed muffin and leche flan (custard). It uses regular flour, though there are versions that use rice flour. *Putong kamotengkahoy - also known as puto binggala in Visayan and puto a banggala in Maranao. A small cupcake made from cassava, grated coconut, and sugar. It is very similar to cassava cake, except it is steamed rather than baked. * Puto lanson ‚Äì puto from Iloilo which is made of grated cassava, and is foamy when cooked. * Puto mam√≥n ‚Äì a puto mixture that has no rice but combines egg yolks, salt and sugar. A mixture of milk and water and another of flour are alternately mixed into the yolks, then egg whites are beaten and folded in before the dough is poured into muffin cups and steamed for 15 to 20 minutes. It is a steamed variant of mam√≥n, a traditional Filipino chiffon cake. * Puto seco (also spelled puto seko) ‚Äì a type of powdery cookie made from corn flour.

As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he represented South Longford from 1888 to 1892. He was a strong supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. Fitzgerald was born in 1850 in County Limerick to Maurice Fitzgerald and Maria Teresa Gubbins. He was baptised on 26 December 1850 in Kilfinane. His grand nephew was Irish hurler Tommy McCarthy (hurler). Fitzgerald trained at the Meath Hospital and Mercer's Hospital, Dublin. He won a prize certificate for surgery in 1872. Thereafter he moved to England where he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1876 and was an assistant surgeon at the Edmonton Infirmary. He became a Licenciate of the Apothecaries‚Äô Hall, Dublin in 1877 and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons at Edinburgh in 1884. He lived the rest of his life in South London, at Brixton, Balham, Norbury and finally from 1919 at Beddington. He was elected unopposed to represent South Longford at a by-election on 30 June 1888, filling the vacancy created by the resignation of Laurence Connolly. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over Parnell's leadership, Fitzgerald was one of the inner circle of Parnell's supporters. He was one of the small group to be read Parnell's manifesto in reply to Gladstone on 28 November 1890 before its publication,Lyons (1960), p.99 and took part with Parnell and other Parnellite MPs in the repossession by force of the newspaper United Ireland on 11 December 1890. He was active in the by-election campaigns which took place between then and Parnell's death in October 1891. He was one of the few people to see the dead Parnell at Brighton.Lyons (1960), p.307 Fitzgerald did not contest the general election in 1892. At the general election in 1895 he attempted to dislodge the sitting Anti-Parnellite MP, Daniel Ambrose ‚Äì also a doctor ‚Äì at South Louth, but was defeated by almost 2 to 1. However, by 1897 Fitzgerald had become alienated from his Parnellite colleagues and their leader John Redmond. In a letter printed in the Freeman's Journal on 5 March 1897 he referred to 'the hollow sham of Redmondism' and wrote 'any Parnellites or Nationalists in the country who still believe that Parnellism and Redmondism are, or ever have been, one and the same thing, will now be undeceived'.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed the last field promotion was believed to have happened during the Korean War in 1953. United States A battlefield promotion is awarded to enlisted soldiers who are promoted to a higher enlisted rank during combat or combat conditions. The US Army discontinued this practice after the Vietnam War with the centralized promotion system, but in 2009 decided to again allow such promotions.http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/06/army_battlefield_062909w/ Battlefield-promotion pilot program now policy \\"Battlefield promotions are predicated on extraordinary performance of duties while serving in combat or under combat conditions.\\" It can be used to promote an individual soldier one grade, to at most staff sergeant, and has a variety of constraints.AR 600-8-19 Enlisted Promotions and Reductions (30 April 2010) See Chapter 11 Battlefield Promotions, page 152 This promotion does not involve a promotion board and does not require the soldier meet time in service or time in grade requirements.

The granting of a battlefield commission has its historical precursor in the medieval practice of the knighting or ennoblement of a plebeian combatant on the battleground for demonstration of heroic qualities in an exceptional degree. In the medieval context, this martial achievement was often one of the main restricted pathways into the sword-bearing feudal aristocracy. Normally, enlisted service members or non-commissioned officers cannot attain commissioned officer rank through regular promotion. Starting in 1917, during World War I, the United States Army started awarding battlefield commissions to soldiers to replace the \\"Brevet Officer\\" system (the promotion of an enlisted man to a commissioned officer without an increase in pay). The Marine Corps started awarding battlefield commissions in place of the Brevet Medal, which was second only to the Medal of Honor. From World War I to the Vietnam War, over 31,200 sailors, soldiers, Marines, and airmen had been awarded battlefield commissions. Such a commission is usually advancement from a position of non- commissioned officer to a commissioned officer, generally O-1 - Second Lieutenant, or Ensign in the Navy and Coast Guard. The most significant aspect of a battlefield commission is that it is granted apart from the regular commission sources: Officer Training School/Officer Candidate School, Reserve Officer Training Corps or a service academy. Battlefield commissions are awarded on the basis of merit and demonstration of leadership, and bypass this step. The most notable recipient of a battlefield commission was Audie Murphy, who was promoted from Staff Sergeant to Second Lieutenant during World War II. Once on a peacetime footing, battlefield-commissioned officers are required to meet the normal requirements within a timeframe in order to be retained (e.g., a bachelor's degree). History From 1845 through 1918, enlisted men who were commissioned for outstanding leadership on the field of battle were referred to as Brevet Officers. The Marine Corps recognized the value of combat leaders who were commissioned in this manner and created a Brevet Medal which was second only to the Medal of Honor. In the wars following 1918, enlisted men and warrant officers, commissioned for the same reason, were referred to as battlefield commissioned. * World War I -- From 1917 to 1918 approximately 6,000 non-commissioned officers were awarded battlefield commissions. * World War II -- From 1941-1945 approximately 25,500 men were awarded battlefield commissions worldwide. The United States Marine Corps also awarded battlefield commissions during the same period but no records were kept of the total. At the conclusion of World War II a board of officers reporting to the Commanding General of the European Theater stated \\"The one sure method of determining whether any individual has qualities which make him a successful leader in combat is to observe that man in combat.\\" Battlefield commissions were approved by the War Department. * Korean War -- From 1950-1953 a system parallel to that of World War II was adopted. The Department of Defense cannot provide figures on the number promoted. The Marine Corps did not award battlefield commissions during the Korean War. * Vietnam War -- From 1963-1973 the Marine Corps Commandant appointed a permanent Board with the mission of selecting those enlisted men of the Marine Corps whose performance under fire while serving in Vietnam merited a commission. A list of 62 enlisted men who were commissioned includes one man who was killed before he could accept his commission. * The US Army has current regulations AR 601-50 Appointment of Temporary Officers in the Army of the United States Upon Mobilization (4 December 1987) See Section VI Battlefield Appointments on page 3 allowing battlefield commissions (technically \\"Battlefield Appointments\\") but it is unclear when they were last used. India Lieutenant Vikram Batra was given a field promotion to Captain in 1999, during the Kargil War (Operation Vijay). During the war, the task of capturing Point 5140 was assigned to the \\"13 JAK RIF\\" under the command of (then) Lt. Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi. On 27 June 1999, after the capture of Point 5140, Lt.

Biography At an early age, White formed himself, his two brothers (Eric and Clarence) and his sister (Joanne) into a bluegrass band which performed locally. When the family moved to California, the group won a talent show on a local radio station, after which a television station hired them (minus Joanne) as The Country Boys. After a two-year US Army enlistment, White re-joined the Country Boys, now renamed The Kentucky Colonels. In 1967, he had the opportunity to join the Blue Grass Boys, the backup band of his childhood idol Bill Monroe. He contributed to nine cuts with this band.http://countrydiscography.blogspot.no/2009/10/bill- monroe-part-i.html He stayed with that group until 1969, when he joined the Nashville Grass, the new backup band of Lester Flatt. White stayed with Flatt until 1973, when he, Clarence and Eric re-united as The New Kentucky Colonels. This only lasted a few months; he and Clarence were struck by an automobile as they loaded their equipment into their car after a performance. Roland White suffered a dislocated shoulder, but Clarence died in the accident. White then joined the progressive bluegrass group Country Gazette, staying with them for 13 years. In 1987, he joined the Nashville Bluegrass Band, staying with that group until 2000. After that he formed the Roland White Band, which is still active. White is a noted mandolin teacher who gives many workshops and private lessons and has published book/CD instruction sets.

It is owned by the Neuhoff Corporation, which also owns four other local radio stations, WCZQ, WDZQ, WSOY and WSOY-FM. Studios and offices are located on North Water Street and the transmitter site is near St. Louis Bridge Road. WDZ operates on 1050 kHz, a clear channel frequency assigned to Mexico, with 1000 watts by day but must reduce power to 250 watts at night so it doesn't interfere with other stations on the frequency. WDZ is diplexed (i.e., shares the vertical radiator) with co-owned 1340 WSOY. Programming WDZ is an affiliate of ESPN Radio and also airs some local sports shows including area high school games. WDZ carries Chicago Cubs baseball and Chicago Bears football, as well as local high school football games and Millikin University Football, and other sports. History=9JR Although WDZ was first licensed as a broadcasting station in early 1922, this was actually a relicensing and continuation of operations begun under an amateur station license, 9JR,\\"Ninth District\\", Amateur Radio Stations of the United States (June 30, 1921 edition), page 191. The \\"9\\" in 9JR's call sign indicated that the station was located in the ninth Radio Inspection district, while the fact that \\"J\\" fell in the range A-W meant that it was operating under a standard amateur license. issued to James L. Bush a year earlier. (Some WDZ publicity calls itself the oldest radio station in Illinois, starting as an experimental agricultural station in 1917 (although WBBM in Chicago traces its history to 1911). However evidence is lacking for a pre-1921 establishment date. Clyde E. Wiley later claimed that, assuming a 1921 start, WDZ was \\"the second broadcasting station in the country, (some say third, but what difference does it make now?) \\".)\\"I like it‚ÄîHERE!\\" by Clyde E. Wiley, The (Decatur, Illinois) Staley Journal, September 1946, pages 12-17 (staleymuseum.com) James Bush was a commodity broker who operated the James Bush Grain Company in Tuscola, Illinois. At the start of the 1920s the company received price quotations by private telegraph wire from the Chicago Board of Trade. Clyde E. Wiley was hired as a telegraph operator to receive the reports, which were then individually telephoned to various local grain elevators that might be interested in selling their holding. Wiley also had extensive experience as a radio operator, and was aware of recent advances in vacuum-tube radio technology that made audio transmissions practical. He proposed that the company establish a station to simultaneously distribute grain price information to all interested parties, and thus avoid the complexity and cost of individual telephone calls. Bush agreed with this idea, and a new organization, The Tuscola Radio Supply Station, was formed to conduct the broadcasts as well as sell and install radio receivers.\\"Broadcasting Market Information by Radiotelephone\\" by Clyde E. Wiley, The Grain Dealers Journal, December 25, 1921, page 846. The first transmitter, installed by Wiley, had a power rating of 10 watts.\\"Modern Grain Price Broadcasting Originated in Tuscola Man's Office\\", Decatur (Illinois) Herald, June 4, 1953, page 24. The new service debuted on March 17, 1921,\\"Grain elevator audience crucial to early radio\\" by Robert Lee Zimmer (AP), Jacksonville (Illinois) Journal Courier, July 16, 1978, page 35. and it is thought that this was the first radio station to provide this kind of service. Initially there were only two customers: elevators at Dorans, near Mattoon, and on the Illinois Central Railroad branch line in Decatur. Curtis Marsh, then a 14-year-old office boy, later reported that he was drafted to make the announcements. The first organized programming consisted of five- to ten-minute blocks every half-hour, each consisting of a phonograph record that was played to aid tuning the receivers, followed by a gong sounded as an alert signal, then the market reports. After this the station remained silent until the start of the next report. A review by Clyde E. Wiley in The Grain Dealers Journal that appeared at the end of 1921 explained the new service as: \\"Mr. Bush, in furnishing the conditions to us, has in mind only the reduction of telephone tolls, labor and so forth. He has no means of knowing when a person receives the market through us and gives his grain business to another firm. Our service is like newspaper service in that respect. Naturally, however, he expects that most of the people receiving markets through us will at least give him the benefit of some of their trade, and regards the system as an up- to-date advertising feature. The Tuscola Radio Supply Station will be glad at any time to take up the matter of installing similar systems at other points.\\" In late 1921 there were an estimated six county elevators and banks that had installed radios to receive the quote broadcasts. One participant calculated that there was a one-time cost of approximately $258 to install a high quality receiver, which then could pick up the half-hourly reports at no additional cost. This compared favorably to the $18 per month that Western Union charged for its more limited telegraphed grain and live-stock report services. In addition, the radio broadcasts were used by the Bush company to confirm executed sales for its clients, using a code number to insure confidentiality.\\"Receiving Market Quotations by Wireless Telephone\\", The Grain Dealers Journal, December 25, 1921, page 846. After the service gained popularity, Western Union and Postal Telegraph tried to have James Bush expelled from the Chicago Board of Trade, on the grounds that he was infringing on what they claimed were their exclusive rights to distribute prices. But, after a review, the Broad sided with Bush. The station soon added some general entertainment programming. A September 10, 1921 letter from Clyde E. Wiley to an electrical supplier reported that \\"Twice each week we broadcast phonograph music, and in each case the big unit is run for one hour without stop.\\"The Ray-Di-Co Organization (advertisement), QST magazine, November 1921, page 124. In November, the station's market report schedule was reported to start at 9:30 a.m., running subsequent half hours after that until the final report at 1:00 p.m.\\"Install Wireless\\", Decatur (Illinois) Herald, November 20, 1921, page 20. WDZ Tuscola Radio Supply Station sdvertisement (1922)Tuscola Radio Supply Station (advertisement), Decatur (Illinois) Review, August 27, 1922, page 20. Beginning in late 1912, radio communication in the United States was regulated by the Department of Commerce. Initially there were no formal standards for which stations could make broadcasts intended for the general public, and after World War One stations under a variety of license classes, most commonly Amateur and Experimental, began making regularly scheduled programs on a limited basis. In order to provide common standards for the service, the Commerce Department issued a regulation effective December 1, 1921 that stated that broadcasting stations would now have to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on two designated broadcasting wavelengths: 360 meters (833 kHz) for \\"entertainment\\", and 485 meters (619 kHz) for \\"market and weather reports\\".\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. On April 5, 1922 a broadcasting station license with the randomly assigned call letters WDZ was issued to James L. Bush, for operation on 360 meters. In 1923 the number of available operating frequencies was greatly expanded, and WDZ was reassigned to broadcast on 1080 kHz,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1923, page 11. although its power initially remained at 10 watts.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1923, page 9. On November 11, 1928 the newly formed Federal Radio Commission made a sweeping reallocation of transmitting frequencies under the provisions of its General Order 40, and WDZ was shifted to 1070 kHz, sharing this assignment with WCAZ in Carthage, Illinois. Moreover, this was a \\"clear channel\\" frequency, and WDZ and WCAZ were limited to daytime-only operation in order to eliminate any potential interference to the nighttime signal of the frequency's primary occupant, WTAM in Cleveland, Ohio.\\"Broadcasting Stations\\", Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the United States (June 30, 1928 edition), page 169. In 1937 WDZ moved to 1020 kHz and raised its power from 100 to 250 watts. It no longer had to share transmitting hours with WCAZ, but was still restricted to daylight hours, in order to protect the frequency's \\"clear channel\\" station, KYW in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WDZ's power was increased to 1000 watts in 1939 with a new tower. During this time, WDZ aired remote broadcasts that were unique for a rural station. The station started the use of remote broadcasting equipment which included a truck called the \\"WDZ White Relay Truck\\",Perry, Stephen D. (2001) \\"Securing Programming on Live Local Radio: WDZ Reaches Rural Illinois 1929-1939\\", Journal of Radio & Audio Media, 8: 2, 347 ‚Äî 371 equipped with a 100-watt transmitter to relay broadcasts from area locations, and some two-watt, battery operated transmitters that could be worn on the backs of assistants when a program originated from remote sites.Cassens, G.

Rhythm Riders: L to R 'skinny' Masseneli, John Samuel Cox, Cecil Wright, posing with WDZ truck, circa 1939. The Federal Communications Commission took over regulation of U.S. radio stations in 1934. In 1941 the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) resulted in another major reallocation of transmitting frequencies, and WDZ was moved to 1050 kHz, where it has remained ever since. In 1949, WDZ moved from Tuscola to Decatur, although a remote studio was maintained in Tuscola until 1958. This relocation allowed for the eventual allocation of a station on 1080 kHz, WNWI in Oak Lawn, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Under the 1941 NARBA agreement, 1050 kHz was designated a Mexican clear channel frequency, assigned to XEG in Monterrey. American stations operating on Mexican clear channel frequencies were restricted to 1,000 watts, daytime-only, until the \\"Rio\\" treaty took effect in the late 1980s. Afterward, it was a simple matter for WDZ to add night operations with the maximum power permitted, 250 watts. Anything more than 1,000 watts days and 250 watts nights very likely would require installation of an expensive directional antenna system. On March 31, 2008, the station switched from an Urban Adult Contemporary music format branded as \\"Magic 1050\\" to an all-sports format as part of the Fox Sports Radio network. Within a year the station switched programming from Fox to ESPN Radio. WDZ and its sister stations 105.5 WCZQ in Monticello and 95.1 WDZQ, 1340 WSOY, and 102.9 WSOY-FM in Decatur, were sold to Neuhoff Media in February 2009.Consummation Notice (Form 905) (application #101297640), FCC file number BAL-20081219ADP, .

He was hired after he came to the station to do an advertising spot for the furniture store where he worked. Burnette ran all aspects of the radio station from being the disc jockey and music director to doing janitorial work. He was known to read the comics from the day's newspaper using different voices and sound effects, as much of his audience were children. Smiley (real name Lester) got his nickname from a character in Mark Twain's \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\", which he was reading on the air. He initially used \\"Smiley\\" as a name for a character in a new children's program he was creating for the station but it later became his nickname, as did the name \\"Frog\\". He then left WDZ to work with Gene Autry on Chicago's WLS in December 1933.\\"Smiley Burnette\\", Roanoke Rapids (North Carolina) Herald, February 14, 1946, Section B, page 4, Two decades later Smiley's wife, Dallas wrote: \\"Smiley's first employers were Mr. and Mrs. James L.

The 1490 frequency was re-allocated to Decatur after WHBS- AM/1490 in Huntsville moved from 1490 kHz to 1550 kHz in 1952. In December 2002, the then-WAJF was sold to WAJF Inc. (Ira Littman, president) by Daniel L. Oppenheim for $150,000. ProTalk logo (2007-2009) In June 2007, WDPT was sold to Christian Voice of Central Ohio Inc. by WAJF Inc. (Troy Bryant, president) for a reported sale price of $167,500. The station, branded as \\"ProTalk 1490\\", was operated as a simulcast of sister station WTKI until both ceased operations and went temporarily silent on January 30, 2009, due to the late 2000s recession. Both stations returned to the air in November 2009 broadcasting a mix of talk radio and sports talk programming. The station's callsign was changed to WEKI on November 19, 2009, to better match its simulcast partner. On December 23, 2009, Christian Voice of Central Ohio Inc. applied to the FCC to transfer the broadcast license for WEKI to FRC of Alabama LLC, doing business as \\"Focus Radio Communications\\" (Frederick Holland, managing member). The Commission approved this application on February 16, 2010, and the transaction was consummated April 30, 2010. Focus Radio, which provided programming for both WEKI and WTKI under a local marketing agreement from November 2009, paid a total of $235,000 for the licenses and assets of both stations. Upon commencement of the local marketing agreement with Focus Radio, WEKI was originally a simulcast of sister WTKI Huntsville. Also in 2009, WEKI began broadcasting on FM translator W234AD, Decatur at 94.7 FM. In 2010, WEKI broadcast at least 85 Southern League baseball games as a member of the Huntsville Stars Radio Network. The network also includes sister station WTKI and WWIC in Scottsboro. In 2011, WEKI separated from the WTKI simulcast, catering to Decatur, Alabama, and the western part of the metro area - although the two stations carry much of the same programming throughout the week. On March 8, 2018, WEKI changed their format from talk to oldies, branded as \\"94.7 Oldies Radio\\" under new WIEZ calls.Alabama Broadcast Media Page Veteran DC programmer Chris Roth became the Program Director. On March 4, 2019, an application was filed with the FCC to transfer ownership of WIEZ and the 94.7 translator (now W234DN) to MKRadio I, LLC (Joshua Bohn, managing member) for $131,500. Ownership transferred from Focus Radio to MKRadio 1 on July 1, 2019. Accuweather forecasts and ABC News were added in October. The format shifted from Oldies to Soft Oldies variety on October 25, 2019.

It was the second of the Northern Expeditions led by Shu-Han's chancellor-regent, Zhuge Liang, to invade Wei. It was part of an attempt to divert Wei forces away from Jing Province following the Battle of Shiting between Wei and Shu's ally state, Eastern Wu. The siege came to an end when Shu forces retreated after failing to capture Chencang. Background In 228, after Eastern Wu defeated Cao Wei at the Battle of Shiting, Wei reinforced the east by mobilizing its troops in the west. Shu Chancellor and regent, Zhuge Liang, hoped to use this opportunity to launch an incursion into Wei territory. Before the Chancellor finalized an operation plan, Cao Zhen of Wei had distinctly anticipated Zhuge's route of advancement and recommended Hao Zhao to build fortifications for Chencang. The Supreme General, Cao Zhen, assured the young emperor Cao Rui of the defence against probable invasions from Shu. However, Hao Zhao was only assigned 1,000 men for his task. The prognosis was made after Zhuge Liang had lost the first expedition earlier that year.Chen Shou. Records of Three Kingdoms, Volume 35, Biography of Zhuge Liang. The battle=Prelude After his failure on Mount Qi and Jieting, Zhuge Liang indeed changed his target to Chencang as Cao Zhen reckoned. Thoroughly prepared, the Shu Chancellor brought with him a selection of siege weapons and an expedition force of one hundred thousand men. Although a few officers including Wei Yan recommended an alternate route, Zhuge Liang was determined to follow the Jialing Valley, which emerges in the north where the Wei River widens considerably near the city of Chencang. Zhuge Liang planned to capture Chencang as a midpoint for further military actions against the great metropolis Chang'an. The Shu army reached the fortress-city of Chencang during December 228, wherein the Wei defences were apparently not completed as Cao Zhen had not sent additional forces to move in. Having completed the encirclement, Zhuge Liang sent Jin Xiang, a personal friend of Hao Zhao, to convince the latter to defect. The first time the two friends spoke, Hao Zhao would hear none of it, saying \\"The laws of Wei are what you practice; the nature of me is what you know. I have received so much from my country and I can't let down my family. You ought to say no more, I'll only die defending this city.\\"(‚ÄúÈ≠èÂÆ∂ÁßëÊ≥ïÔºåÂçøÊâÄÁªÉ‰πüÔºõÊàë‰πã‰∏∫‰∫∫ÔºåÂçøÊâÄÁü•‰πü„ÄÇÊàëÂèóÂõΩÊÅ©Â§öËÄåÈó®Êà∑ÈáçÔºåÂçøÊó†ÂèØË®ÄËÄÖÔºå‰ΩÜÊúâÂøÖÊ≠ªËÄ≥„ÄÇ‚Äù). Brief History of Wei. Jin Xiang told Zhuge Liang what Hao Zhao had said, and again Zhuge Liang sent Jin Xiang to soften Hao Zhao. \\"Our armies are enormous while you only have a tiny force, what good is it to perish for a futile effort?\\" said Jin Xiang outside the city gate. This time, however, Hao Zhao fitted an arrow to his bow and replied, \\"What I said earlier remains solid. I know you, but my arrow doesn't\\",(‰∫ÆÂèà‰ΩøËØ¶ÈáçËØ¥Êò≠ÔºåË®Ä‰∫∫ÂÖµ‰∏çÊïåÔºåÊó†‰∏∫Á©∫Ëá™Á†¥ÁÅ≠„ÄÇÊò≠Ë∞ìËØ¶Êõ∞Ôºö‚ÄúÂâçË®ÄÂ∑≤ÂÆöÁü£„ÄÇÊàëËØÜÂçøËÄ≥ÔºåÁÆ≠‰∏çËØÜ‰πü„ÄÇ‚ÄùËØ¶‰πÉÂéª„ÄÇ). Brief History of Wei. implicitly threatening to kill Jin Xiang. Upon hearing this, Zhuge Liang commenced the offensive. Siege Zhuge Liang aimed to take the fortress directly; he carried out an escalade tactic through the use of siege ladders, but Hao Zhao countered with fire arrows, burning the platforms and parching the men upon them. While the ladders were still aflame, Zhuge Liang's battering rams designed to breach the city gate had arrived, and Hao Zhao hurriedly chained some boulders and rolled them down, smashing the rams. The quick response and leadership of Hao Zhao shocked Zhuge Liang, as the latter never expected such a determined resistance. Zhuge Liang then ordered a withdrawal and reconsidered his tactics. Since moats made access to the walls difficult for siege weapons, which needed to be brought up against a wall to be effective, Zhuge Liang decided to remove the trenches to create more possible attack points. Following Zhuge Liang's order, the besiegers started to fill the chasms and prepared their siege towers. With the ditches removed, the siege engines moved upon the castle while foot-soldiers climbed the walls like ants. However, Hao Zhao outwitted Zhuge Liang by building interior walls within the outer walls.(‰∫Æ‰πÉÊõ¥‰∏∫‰∫ïÈòëÁôæÂ∞∫‰ª•Â∞ÑÂüé‰∏≠Ôºå‰ª•Âúü‰∏∏Â°´Â†ëÔºåÊ¨≤Áõ¥ÊîÄÂüéÔºåÊò≠Âèà‰∫éÂÜÖÁ≠ëÈáçÂ¢ô„ÄÇ) Brief History of Wei. As long as the siege towers could not pass the outer walls, the soldiers on top of the towers who managed to overcome the outer walls could not climb the second inner walls. Trapped inside the two gates of walls, those soldiers who descended from the towers became easy targets for archers on the inner walls. Suffering another defeat, Zhuge Liang adopted an architectural approach by asking his soldiers to dig tunnels that led to the substructure of the fortress. However, his method was actually different from the more common mining tactic, which is to excavate beneath the foundations of the walls, and then deliberately collapsing or exploding the tunnel--it is recorded that Zhuge Liang wanted to create some underground passages for his armies to enter the city directly in order to catch his opponent off guard.(‰∫ÆÂèà‰∏∫Âú∞Á™ÅÔºåÊ¨≤Ë∏äÂá∫‰∫éÂüéÈáåÔºåÊò≠Âèà‰∫éÂüéÂÜÖÁ©øÂú∞Ê®™Êà™‰πã„ÄÇ). Brief History of Wei. Eventually news came of Wei reinforcements led by Zhang He, so the Shu army retreated. Seeking glory, a Wei general, Wang Shuang, led his cavalry in pursuit of the enemy to the Qinling Mountains, where he fell into an ambush planted by Zhuge Liang and was killed. On the other hand, Zhang He precisely predicted Zhuge Liang would retreat before he even arrived at Chencang, so Zhang He headed for Nanzheng, but was not able to catch up with Zhuge Liang. Aftermath Scoring such a victory, Hao Zhao instantly became a celebrity, and an imperial decree was passed down to grant him a marquis title. Cao Rui also summoned Hao Zhao to the Wei capital, Luoyang, where he highly praised the general for his valiant defence of Chencang. However, Hao Zhao soon died of illness during his stay in Luoyang. In the same year of 229, Zhuge Liang launched the third Northern Expedition. This time, he again changed his target, sending Chen Shi to besiege Wudu and Yinping commanderies. The Wei defending general, Guo Huai, ceded the two commanderies to Shu forces, in fear he would be sandwiched by Chen Shi and Zhuge Liang. In popular culture The Siege of Chencang is featured as a playable stage in the fifth instalment of Koei's video game series Dynasty Warriors 5.

He named his project \\"Australis\\" (which in Latin literally means \\"from the South\\") because that word symbolizes his origins and the places where he received his primary musical influences. History Australis was officially created as a musical project in the U.S. on August 2004. In January 2005, he won the \\"2004 Morpheus Music's Best Independent Artist\\" award with material released only to selected online radio stations. His debut album \\"Lifegiving\\" was independently released on May 2005. By early 2006 \\"Lifegiving\\" was re-released in Southern Asia by the Orange Music record label. In August 2006 two tracks from Australis' debut album \\"Lifegiving\\" were included in the New Vibes Music's compilation Echoes of Tuvalu. Work for Australis' second album, \\"The Gates of Reality\\", was announced on August 2005, and almost two years later on February 2007 two of its tracks were included in the audio compact disc accompanying the last issue (#16) of the now defunct Netherlandic publication \\"E-dition Magazine\\", despite the fact that the album was not yet released at the time. \\"The Gates of Reality\\" was released on November 2008 under the label Essential Noises. On June 13, 2009 Australis' official website announced work for a third release has started. The upcoming album's temporary title was \\"Human Genus\\". In early July 2010 its official title was announced as \\"Sentient Genus\\". \\"Sentient Genus\\" was released on November 2010 under the label Essential Noises. Musical style Under the wider new age genre, Australis' music styles include Ambient music, World music, Electronic music, Ethnic music, Symphonic music and Soundtrack. Among other adjectives, his musical signature has been described as melodic, intense, contagious, emotional and meaningful. Australis' style is characterized by very rich instrumentation present even in his most simplistic pieces: very melodic and clearly defined leads built over solid tonal bases (consisting of deep evolving pads or full orchestral arrangements), along with engaging rhythms, often ethnically influenced. Instrumentally, Australis' music uses the expected electronic synthesizers and samplers, bringing unusual and interesting sound effects to blend with the main musical body. However, much of his material also exhibits classical instruments which include piano, strings (solos and ensembles) and winds (clarinets, oboes, etc.). Additionally, he also includes exotic instruments for his more ethnic material: native winds and strings (zampona, charango) from the Andes regions of South America, and also from the Middle East (zurna, darbouka, etc.). Another interesting characteristic of Australis' music is the dissimilar styles he explores and compiles in his discs. For example, the album \\"Lifegiving\\" starts with a very soft, relaxing, nature-driven title track; but the second track carries a completely different more electronic flavor. Then the third track comes and it has yet another color that falls into the category of dramatic soundtrack. Later on the disc other styles are also represented, including quasi-techno-dance \\"Fire Tamer\\", classic orchestra \\"The Enchantment\\", and the ethnic \\"Sacred Earth\\". According to an interview he did for Lost Frontier late 2005, this gathering of styles is a consequence of the messages he is trying to convey through his music: \\"I don't pay as much attention to styles as to the messages I am trying to communicate.\\" The release of Australis' second and third albums, strengthens this feature. They comprise a wide range of styles that go from the purely electronic, to the ethnic, to the epic.

For her work as a tugboat in some very dangerous battle areas, she earned five battle stars during World War II. She ended her battle career when she was sunk by a crashing Japanese bomber. The second U.S. Navy warship to be named Sonoma, the tugs keel was laid down on 7 November 1911, at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Co.. The vessel was launched on 11 May 1912 and commissioned on 6 September 1912, Chief Boatswain William Darrington in command. Operational history= World War I operations  Upon commissioning, Sonoma was assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet as a tender, and she served in that capacity through World War I. In 1919, the tug was transferred to the U.S. Pacific Fleet and, on 17 July 1920, was designated AT-12. Sonoma was assigned to Train Squadron 2 of the newly organized Base Force during the winter of 1923 and 1924 and remained with the Base Force through the early years of World War II.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  At the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan, Sonoma was in transit from Wake Island to Pearl Harbor: and, after a voyage to Canton Island and back in February and March 1942, she remained at Pearl Harbor until October, serving as a channel guard vessel. At that time, she departed Pearl Harbor in company with the destroyer and auxiliary to tow ARD-2 and YO-24 to New Caledonia. The group arrived at Noumea on 3 November and, after two weeks of repairs and upkeep, Sonoma sailed for Sydney, Australia, with in tow. She returned to Noum√©a on 6 December and stayed there until 2 January 1943. On that date, she put to sea to aid damaged United States Army workboat P-111 to limp into port. She and her charge made Noum√©a on 5 January. For the next eight months, Sonoma towed ships between the ports of the South Pacific Ocean. Based at Noumea, New Caledonia, she visited the Fiji Islands, the New Hebrides Islands, Australia, and New Guinea, both at Milne Bay and Buna. On 3 September 1943, she arrived off Lae, New Guinea, to participate in her first combat operation and, in the afternoon, was straddled by four bombs-near misses-and sprayed by shrapnel during a raid by seven Japanese twin-engine bombers. Later on, she cleared the area for Morobe Bay. Sonomas scrapes with Japanese air power continued through the month of September as she operated in the vicinity of Lae. She came under attack on 12, 21, and 22 September and assisted in shooting down one Japanese aircraft on 12 September. For the remainder of 1943, she operated in and around Buna Harbor. On the second day of 1944, she got underway for Saidor, New Guinea. Her formation came under automatic weapons fire on the following day and Sonoma was hit by several .50 caliber machine gun bullets. The fire had come from friendly shore batteries which mistook the ships for Japanese barges known to be operating in the vicinity. The echelon made Dreger Harbor on 15 January; then headed on to Milne Bay. From there, Sonoma towed APC-4 to Brisbane, Australia, arriving on 1 February. Following overhaul and repairs, she got underway on 15 February to return to Milne Bay. After spending most of March 1944 around Milne Bay, she headed for Manus in the Admiralty Islands on 31 March. For the next three months, Sonoma supported General Douglas MacArthur's ‚Äúleapfrog‚Äù operation up the back of the New Guinea bird. On 15 May 1944, Sonoma was redesignated ATO-12 and, later that month, she moved to the Hollandia area in the vicinity of Biak Island, where she did salvage, fire fighting, and towing duty for the landing craft which had been bombed and strafed by the Japanese. She spent the month of June in Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, then lent her support to the Noemfoor attack during the first week in July. By 15 July, she was back at Milne Bay for repair and upkeep. On 11 September, she got underway for the assault area off Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies. She remained there for 10 days-again providing salvage, fire fighting, and towing services. During that period, she suffered a broken crankshaft and had to put in at Gila Bay for repairs. On 21 September, she sailed back to Humboldt Bay where she went into availability for a week; then resumed salvage duty around Jautefa Bay. On 14 October, she sailed in company with echelon LI, as Task Unit 78.2.9, bound ultimately for the Leyte invasion. Sonoma entered San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, on 20 October. On the morning of 24 October, she opened fire on several Japanese planes with her starboard guns.  Japanese aircraft collision and loss  As she cast off from merchant freighter , next to whom she had been moored, a flaming Japanese bomber crashed into Sonoma on the starboard side amidships. Two explosions followed immediately, and she began taking water at an alarming rate. LCI-72 and came alongside the stricken tug, extinguished the fires on her starboard side, and removed casualties. Chickasaw then made an unsuccessful attempt to beach her on Dio Island. Later in the afternoon, Sonoma sank in of water off Dio Island. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 27 November 1944.  Military awards and honors  Sonoma (ATO-12) earned five battle stars during World War II.

The Pennsylvania Association of School Nurses and Practitioners is not affiliated or associated with the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. is a labor union in Pennsylvania that represents about 8,300 nurses and allied health professionals. History Many of the bargaining units which comprise PASNAP were originally organized in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s by the Pennsylvania Nurses Association (PNA). However, the majority of PNA's members remained managers (and unable to form a labor union under the National Labor Relations Act) or associate members outside formal collective bargaining units. Unionized members of PNA became increasingly dissatisfied with the poor representation and low militancy of the nurses association. In 1994, the Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA) raided PNA's private-sector and Temple University Health System bargaining units.\\"Pennsylvania Nurses Association Files Complaint vs. PSEA,\\" press release, Pennsylvania Nurses Association, May 12, 1994. SEIU District 1199P raided PNA in 1997, taking over a large unit of state-employed nurses and health professionals.\\"The History of Collective Bargaining in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Part Three: A Timeline of Important Dates,\\" Labor in the News, May 2007. Never eager to engage in collective bargaining, PNA voluntarily shed its remaining collective bargaining unit (composed of nurses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education) by holding an election in which the nurses agreed to affiliate with the Office and Professional Employees International Union. The nurses, however, remained restless under the leadership of PSEA. A number of local union leaders within PSEA HealthCare felt the nurses should disaffiliate from PSEA and form an independent union. At a national meeting of unionized nurses sponsored by the California Nurses Association (CNA) in March 2000, CNA staff approached PSEA HealthCare leaders and suggested forming an independent nurses association associated (but not affiliated) with CNA. Many of the PSEA nurse leaders were receptive to the idea.Pilla, \\"Pennsylvania Nurses Create New Collective Bargaining Unit,\\" Nurses.com, May 31, 2000. Although the executive board of PSEA HealthCare approved the dual affiliation with the AFT, 12 local unions (primarily located in southeastern Pennsylvania) held their own meeting on May 24, 2000, and disaffiliated from PSEA. PSEA brought the issue before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In October 2000, in what was described as a Solomonic decision because it \\"split the difference,\\" the Pittsburgh region of the NLRB ruled that each local union was free to do as it wished. Seven bargaining units with about 1,000 members became dual affiliates of AFT and PSEA. This organization became known as HealthCare PSEA. The 12 other bargaining units, with a membership of about 3,500, formed PASNAP. Collective bargaining PASNAP has proven to be one of the most militant nurses unions in Pennsylvania, striking or threatening to strike numerous times in its short history as an independent union. The union led a 23-day nurses' strike in the winter of 2003, one of Pennsylvania's longest health care walkouts.Allabaugh, \\"W-B General Hospital RNs Strike Today,\\" Wilkes-Barres Citizens' Voice, January 30, 2003; Allabaugh, \\"Nurses Going Back to Work,\\" Wilkes-Barre Citizen's Voice, February 15, 2003. In April 2010 the union led a month-long strike at Temple University Hospital defeating many hospital demands, including one banning nurses from making public critiques of management policies related to patient care. The union led a 24-hour strike against the Tennessee based Community Health Systems in December 2010 in Wilkes Barre while the threat of a second strike on May Day 2010 later backed the for profit company off of major healthcare concessions and anti union demands. PASNAP is also recognized for its aggressive collective bargaining, which has won union members significantly higher wages and improved working conditions. The union's more notable collective bargaining achievements include: * The contract signed covering over 1,000 RNs after the strike at Temple University Hospital in April 2010 will have experienced staff nurses earn $46.40 per hour. The union also pushed back on managements demand to cap employee retirement matches at 4.5%, nurses and other healthcare professionals in the system are now eligible for employer retirement matches of 8.5%. * The next contract signed at Temple will have senior RNs earning $50.13 per hour with all current benefits; retirement, health, and prescription, remaining unchanged. * The current contract signed at Temple will have senior RNs earning upwards of $57.71 per hour with nurses who have a little as 10 years experience earning $52.45 per hour. Organizing PASNAP's initial organizing efforts were not successful. The union formed a loose association with SEIU 1199P to organize workers wall-to-wall at hospitals near existing collective bargaining units or which provided enhanced collective bargaining power to existing locals. The union's first organizing campaign was among a unit of 252 licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and two units of other workers (47 business office workers and 140 technical and professional workers), at Wyoming Valley Hospital. SEIU attempted to organize the service and maintenance employees. Management asked The Burke Group, a notorious anti-union consultant, to advise the hospital on strategy and tactics. The LPNs rejected the union by a mere six votes, leading PASNAP leaders to decry what they saw as \\"widespread illegal behavior on the part of the employer.\\"Jackson, \\"Union Says Wilkes- Barre, Pa., Hospital Swayed Nurses in Unionization Vote,\\" Wilkes-Barre Times- Leader, July 17, 2001. PASNAP entered into contract negotiations with the hospital. But three years later, the technical and professional workers decertified the union when no contract was signed.Fennick, \\"Hospital Workers Boot Union,\\" Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader, November 2, 2004. PASNAP did not attempt to organize another collective bargaining unit until 2005. The union's next foray into organizing was a small one. In July 2005, the union organized 17 nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants at the Delaware County, Pennsylvania, George W. Hill Correctional Facility.Carey, \\"Prison Nurses Decide They Want to Unionize,\\" Delaware County Times, July 24, 2005. In March 2006, the union organized a small unit of 40 registered nurses and technicians at Wills Eye Surgical Center in Philadelphia.George, \\"Wills Eye Workers Vote to Unionize,\\" Philadelphia Business Journal, March 27, 2006. The union quickly expanded its organizing program. In May 2007, 275 registered nurses at Jeanes Hospital (a member of the Temple University Health System) voted to join PASNAP.\\"Jeanes Hospital Nurses Unionize,\\" Philadelphia Business Journal, May 17, 2007.After just six months of bargaining (a very short period of time), the nurses at Jeanes Hospital won a first contract. See \\"Temple Health Nurses Approve 3-Year Contract,\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, November 11, 2007. On July 19, 2007, 400 nurses at Community Medical Center in Scranton voted overwhelmingly to join PASNAP. The election was the largest nurses' organizing victory in Pennsylvania since over 700 registered nurses at Altoona Regional Health System joined SEIU two months earlier.Dobo, \\"Nurses at CMC Approve Union,\\" Scranton Times-Tribune, August 9, 2007; \\"Scranton CMC Nurses Vote In Favor of Union Representation,\\" Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader, August 9, 2007. In June 2009 nurses and other healthcare professionals at Fair Acres Geriatric Center voted 125 to 70 in favor of joining PASNAP. In 2013 Nurses at Armstrong County Memorial Hospital near Pittsburgh, a bargaining unit that had originally decided to stay with PSEA during the split in 2000 and now frustrated with the poor representation and lack of militancy of PSEA, aggressively petitioned to join PASNAP. The nurses voted 200 to 30 to join PASNAP with 4 voting for no union. Soon afterwards, unrepresented technical and professional employees at the same hospital petitioned to join PASNAP. Encouraged by the presence of the new union, the previously non union workers voted 82-27 to join PASNAP. Union organizing from PASNAP was highly successful throughout 2016. In January, PASNAP successfully led unionizing campaigns two major Philadelphia-are hospitals: Delaware County Memorial Hospital (DCMH) and Hahnemann University Hospital, for a total of 1200 organized nurses. In April, PASNAP successfully formed a union amongst staff nurses at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, who voted in favor (54%-46%). The hospital and PASNAP engaged in negotiations which have moved toward an accepted contract that was overwhelmingly ratified. In the meantime, St. Christopher's Hospital for Children had also voted to form a PASNAP-led union. 2016 also saw the successful organization of Eagleville Hospital, primarily a drug rehabilitation hospital in Montgomery County. In September 2016, Nurses at Pottstown Memorial Medical Center in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania voted 189 to 129 to join a PASNAP.The Pottstown local reached their first bargaining agreement in October 2018, after a change of hospital ownership and an unsuccessful effort to decertify the unit. Legislative and Nursing Practice Activity PASNAP has been very active politically since its inception. It began pressing for an end to mandatory overtime in 2001, and drafted a bill which was introduced in the Pennsylvania General Assembly banning the practice in acute-care hospitals in 2002. The union has been able to get the measure reintroduced in each successive legislative session.\\"Nurses Rally for Bill Easing Mandatory OT,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 6, 2001; Glover, \\"Safe Staffing and Quality Care Act Introduced,\\" Pittsburgh Business Times, June 28, 2002; Boehm, \\"PASNAP Targets Mandatory Overtime,\\" Revolution, May‚ÄìJune 2005. PASNAP, and unions in general, will be directly affected by National Right to Work laws. If Pennsylvania were to become a RTW state, PASNAP would risk losing dues paying members as well as agency fee payers because these members would have a choice of union membership or not. This differs currently in Pennsylvania and 22 other states where unions and employers are free to negotiate \\"union security\\" agreements wherein all members of the collective bargaining group are required to become a member of the union, despite personal beliefs.Right-to-work law These are variously called \\"fair share agreements\\" or \\"forced unionism\\". Unions who have been elected the exclusive agent are generally required to represent all employees within the bargaining unit, creating the \\"free rider\\" problem.Right-to-work law#Free riders As part of its campaign to end mandatory overtime, the union has repeatedly polled Pennsylvania nurses about their hours, the acuity (level of illness) of their patients, and patient load. In 2001, the union's independently-conducted poll of 6,000 registered nurses in the state found that 56 percent of nurses would enter the profession today due to mandatory overtime and poor nurse-to-patient staffing ratios. At the time, the poll was the largest survey of RNs ever conducted in Pennsylvania.Brenner, \\"Pa. Nurses Fed Up With Short Staffing,\\" York Dispatch, November 14, 2001. In 2004, a second poll of more than 2,500 registered nurses in the southeastern Pennsylvania region found that nearly one in three nurses planned to quit nursing within the next five years due to long working hours.George, \\"Nurses Union Lobbying to End Overtime Rules,\\" Philadelphia Business Journal, May 21, 2004. The bill eventually passed the state house and went into effect on July 1, 2009. A subsequent bill to mandate minimum nurse-to-patient ratios (so-called \\"safe staffing\\" legislation) was introduced in the Pennsylvania State House on September 26, 2011, advanced substantially by PASNAP.

History The first settlement at Big Springs was made in the fall of 1854. The town was founded by William Harper and John Chamberlain but had always been a popular watering hole along the Oregon Trail. It was named from the mineral springs nearby. On September 5, 1855, Big Springs was home to a free-state convention in which determined men vowed to give their lives to defend their homes from border ruffians from Missouri. The first sermon was preached in 1855 by Reverend W.A. Cardwell in the log home of Ephraim Banning. The first church was built a year later. Also in 1856, the first post office was established, as well as the first schooling took place then in the town hall. The post office was discontinued in 1903. The population did not grow, but hovered around 40 people, as there was no railroad running through the town. According to the Lawrence Journal-World, Big Springs was the location of T. J. Custard's birth, making him the first American citizen to be born in Douglas County. Today it has a water tower, tool shop, church and a fire station that is part of the Lecompton Township Fire Dist. 1. Its mailing address is Lecompton. In 2010, a building on the east side of town caught fire, leaving a restricted area of charred rubble. Education It is part of USD 450 Shawnee Heights School District in Tecumseh. Infrastructure US Highway 40 runs through the community. ReferencesFurther reading * Fitzgerald, Daniel. Ghost Towns of Kansas: A Traveler's Guide. 1988.

Avery then married Martha Marsh in 1841 before they immigrated to Oregon Country in 1845. Oregon After wintering at Oregon City, the family moved south the next year. Joseph Avery settled at the mouth of Marys River where it flows into the Willamette River in the central part of the Willamette Valley of what would become the state of Oregon. At that location he operated a ferry across the Willamette and established a farm. In 1848, Avery went to the gold fields of California and mined for a brief time before using his gold to purchase mercantile goods. Avery then returned to Oregon where he opened a store on his land claim where he then established a town site. He surveyed and platted the area and named it Marysville in 1850.

Joseph Avery, the father of 12 children, died on June 16, 1876. He was buried at the Masonic Cemetery in Corvallis.

The Corvallis Gazette [Corvallis] 23 Aug. 1873: n. pag. Print. Found in the thesis of Bruce Martin, titled \\"History of Corvallis: 1846 - 1900\\" submitted to U of O, June 1938. He was later accused of using this press to operate the pro-slavery Occidental Messenger. Although surviving copies of the Occidental Messenger do not identify Avery as the paper's owner and do not indicate that Avery had control of the paper's editorial content, several contemporary sources identify Avery as the central force behind the Occidental Messenger's publication.https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/sites/leadership.oregonstate.edu/files/OID/BuildingPlaceNames/Historical- Reports/averylodgehistoricalreport.pdf This connection to the pro-slavery movement led to an inquiry in 2017 by Oregon State University about whether to retain the Avery name on a residence hall.

Its role is to force generate and force prepare fighting elements, including the Headquarters, globally, for current operations and deliver capability to contingent forces as directed by 1st UK Division in order to support the delivery of operational success.  History  102 Logistic Brigade traces its origin to 102 Beach Sub-Area, Normandy, France. It was one of 3 such formations raised late in 1943 to run logistic support operations across JUNO Beach, from D-day until the Mulberry artificial harbours were operational. Once the Mulberry harbours were in use, there was no further requirement for the Beach Groups, which then dispersed to their original Lines of Communication roles. In 1993, 50 years after the original formation of 102 Beach Sub Area, Headquarters Combat Service Support Group (Germany) was established in G√ºtersloh, Germany. In July 1999 the formation was re-titled 102 Logistic Brigade and in October 1999 the Halberd was officially adopted as the formation tactical recognition flash. The Halberd appears in Jeremiah as a symbol of strength, success and restoration. Its interpretation as a restorer of combat power following bloodshed, exhaustion and hunger reflects the operational role of 102 Logistic Brigade. The dual capability of the Halberd, both as a weapon and a hand tool represents the combination of artisan and technical skills, which complement the military training of Brigade personnel.  Current organisation  Under the Army Regular Basing Announcement and the Reserve Basing Announcement, the Brigade changed its composition in line with the Army 2020 reforms. As of 27 February 2015, it was placed under operational control of 1st (United Kingdom) Division. A written statement in December 2016 stated that its headquarters will be rationalised, with all manpower in this unit being redeployed to other areas of the British Army.

The Rev Dr Ralph Wardlaw, DD (22 December 1779 ‚Äì 15 December 1853) was a Scottish Presbyterian clergyman and writer. Life He was born in Dalkeith, just south of Edinburgh, but his family moved to Glasgow when he was six months old. His father was a prosperous merchant and civic magistrate, whilst his mother was the daughter of the Rev. James Fisher and the granddaughter of Ebenezer Erskine, two of the founding ministers of the United Secession Church. At the age of eight he was enrolled at the High School of Glasgow for four years, before being accepted as a student of theology at the University of Glasgow, aged twelve. Despite his strong familial connections to the Secession Church, shortly after his University studies were complete he turned to Independent Congregationalism, as introduced to Scotland (from England) by James and Robert Haldane. He was ordained in 1803 by Rev. Greville Ewing, the popular minister of Lady Glenorchy's church, shortly after a chapel had been erected for him by his friends and family in Albion Street. Although his first congregation numbered only 61, his success as a preacher was sufficient that by 1811 he and Ewing founded Glasgow's first academy for congregationalist theology students. In 1818 he moved his congregation to a new church in West George Street capable of holding more than 1,500 people, where he remained until the closure of his ministerial life. In the same year he was awarded an honorary doctorate (DD) from Yale University.https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSE01077 Wardlaw strongly influenced David Livingstone, who attended his lectures in divinity, and was inspired by his campaigns against slavery to fight the African slave trade during his years as a missionary and explorer. He died at home Provan Hall, Easterhouse near Baillieston in 1853.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1853 Wardlaw was married to his cousin, Jane Smith, for almost fifty years until his death aged 74. He is buried on the brow of the hill at the Glasgow Necropolis, overlooking Glasgow Cathedral.

The site underwent intermittent periods of extended downtime in its history due to the occasional need to move the server, generally caused by cancellation of ISP service due to local political pressure. Reports announced the accidental death of its founder Deimos in August 2018. Following the event, the website was closed on September 17, 2018. In July 2019, Demonoid staffers launched a new version of the website to revive the project.  Features and policies  Demonoid features RSS with different feeds for each of its torrent categories and their sub-categories. It tracked and displayed users' upload/download ratios, but, except in its early years, took no action against users with low ratios (members who took more than they share). The website previously banned users with low ratios, but stopped doing so due to the ratio system being inaccurate for some users, such as those with dynamic IP addresses. Demonoid prohibits linking to torrents containing pornographic material and malicious software. In addition to forums, the website features an IRC channel, #demonoid at P2P-Network, which supports discussion among users.  History  Demonoid was founded on April 21, 2003 by a Mexican Internet user known under the pseudonym of 'Deimos'. It initially worked as a fully-private BitTorrent tracker with intermittent periods of open registrations. From the mid-2000s, Demonoid grew as one of the largest trackers in the world along with The Pirate Bay, which led to an increase in legal threats from copyright owners. On April 10, 2008, Deimos stepped down as the administrator of Demonoid, citing a number of reasons and \\"distraction with real-world issues\\". He also stated that he has \\"handed the reins over to a new administrator\\" - \\"a close friend of [his]\\", whom they trust completely and has the knowledge and time to take care of the site. Over the course of the next few days, RSS feeds for the site came back online and by April 16, 2008 a mass email was sent out to all Demonoid users informing that the site was \\"finally back online.\\" The official explanation read as follows: In August 2012, Deimos faced criminal investigation in Mexico, and was eventually released from jail in February 2013. After a decrease in the audience during the 2010s, he was reportedly working in early 2018 to rebuild the website to the thriving community of the previous decade. Deimos died in an accident in August 2018, leading to the closure of Demonoid on September 17, 2018. In July 2019, staff of the original community relaunched the website.  Legal issues  In a 2007 study, Slyck.com found twelve cease and desist letters to users of Demonoid. On September 25, 2007, the Demonoid website, forums and trackers went offline. They came back four days later with the exception of the website, which came back the day after. Over the next few days, the website continued experiencing intermittent downtime until October 2, 2007. The explanation as widely speculated was that they had received a letter from a lawyer for the Canadian Recording Industry Association threatening legal action. Demonoid began blocking Canadian traffic, a strategy similar to that taken by isoHunt and TorrentSpy in blocking American traffic to avoid RIAA complaints. Visitors from Canadian-based IPs would be redirected to the downtime version of the website, which contained an explanation of the legal threats. However, it was still possible for Canadians to visit the website at that time using proxy servers. Additionally, while the website may have been blocked in Canada at the time, the tracker was still readily accepting Canadian IP addresses. The threats are in spite of the open question of the legality of music file sharing in Canada. The CRIA has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement despite Demonoid's claims. On November 9, 2007, the site again went offline, reportedly due to legal threats to their service provider from the Canadian Recording Industry Association. A placeholder page stated, \\"The CRIA threatened the company renting the servers to us, and because of this it is not possible to keep the site online. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for your understanding.\\" According to the IRC channel, the trackers themselves were not affected. Six days later, the placeholder page was updated with a link to a new forum, unrelated to file sharing, for the community. On November 29, 2007, Deimos posted on that forum a problem preventing the site from coming back up: The site then came back online on April 11, 2008. The homepage announced that the site had a new administrator, and that the old one (Deimos) had left for personal reasons.  Technical issues = Website downtime  Demonoid experienced a prolonged downtime in late 2009 due to hardware failure. On September 14, 2009, Demonoid's torrent tracker went down after it was reported that they had experienced a number of hardware problems stemming from power outages. The tracker returned to service on November 5, and the main site returned on December 13. A message was posted on the homepage stating that \\"We might have to shut down everything to fix and prevent further damage,\\" and that it could be \\"days maybe, until we can change the power circuit.\\" During the downtime that followed, several new messages appeared, mostly providing updates on the repair status and promising that the site would return soon. On November 4, 2009, the tracker, which communicates with a BitTorrent client, began responding to some torrents, and returned to full operation on November 17. The main site, however, did not become operational until December 13, 2009. On April 26, 2010, Demonoid.com, started experiencing downtime or extreme slowness. A message was posted on the site that it was due to a denial-of- service attack, which has subsided as of July 2010. The site temporarily banned Taiwanese and Chinese IP ranges.\\"Demonoid Blocks Taiwan and China After DoS Attack\\" TorrentFreak. 15 Jul 2010. Last accessed 12 Feb 2011. On July 24, 2012, Demonoid.me suffered another denial-of-service attack, bringing the site down for an indeterminate amount of time. The following week, its hosting provider, ColoCall, terminated its contract with Demonoid. An anonymous ColoCall source reported that the Ukrainian police had raided the hosting provider and seized Demonoid's data. However, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Ukraine, the termination occurred without police intervention. No explanation has been given for the prolonged downtime, nor was there any word about the site's return until March 2014. On November 12, 2012, demonoid.me began resolving to an IP address based in Hong Kong, where a tracker was operating. The tracker did not accept new torrents, but honored existing ones. However, the website and forums remained offline. The tracker went offline on December 15, 2012, first actively refusing all connections, and then becoming unreachable when demonoid.me's DNS servers went down. In November 2013, demonoid.me and demonoid.ph started redirecting to demonoid.com, whose website began displaying a page that hints at a possible comeback of the site, with the message \\"We will rebuild! Coming back soon, please check back later. Thanks for your visit!!\\" along with a Bitcoin donation link. On January 9, 2014, a tracker came online at inferno.demonoid.com and quickly became one of the five busiest BitTorrent trackers on the Internet; in only a few hours, the tracker was coordinating the communication of 1.3 million people scattered across 388,321 torrent files. In March 2014, after 20 months of downtime, the Demonoid BitTorrent tracker came back online. Former users were still able to use their login details, and most of the old torrents were still listed on the site. In July 2018, Demonoid stopped working on all used domains. The issues are related to server-side problems. There are no backups or mirrors on the internet.  Domain name changes  On December 2, 2010, Demonoid changed its domain from .com to a .me address, to avoid US government seizure. In April 2012, the website changed its domain to a .ph TLD, and started an open beta of the new site on Demonoid.me. On June 15, 2012, Demonoid reverted to its previous .me domain, but returned to the .ph domain a week later. The Demonoid website and tracker last went offline in July 2012 for a period of nearly two years, the longest hiatus ever. At the time it went offline, Demonoid was hosted by an ISP in Ukraine. Subsequent signs of activity led to no new developments until March 29, 2014, when the site, once again, went online. The revived site now uses a remote server. On May 7, 2013, d2, an unofficial website based on Demonoid's databases went live at d2.vu, with hosting provided by the U.S.-based service RamNode. Around November 2013, a website showing the Demonoid logo and saying \\"We will rebuild!\\" came online at the .com domain, and the .me and .ph domains began redirecting web traffic to it, indicating they are all under control of the same owner. In January 2014, a tracker came online at the .com domain and provided service for the old torrents. On March 29, 2014, Demonoid came back online at the demonoid.ph domain. On December 3, 2014 domain name was changed to demonoid.pw. On February 17, 2019 an official statement was made stating that ownership of demonoid.pw was lost and to avoid visiting it. In August 2019, Demonoid came back online at dnoid.to with registrations open intermittently.Demonoid On November 2 2019, the website moved to the domain demonoid.is to distance itself from scams.  d2  During Demonoid's most recent downtime, an unofficial website based on Demonoid's databases was launched on May 7, 2013. The site went live at http://www.d2.vu/ with hosting provided by the U.S.-based service RamNode. d2's administrators stated, \\"No former admins have been involved with this rebranding or launch. This effort is independent and undertaken entirely for the benefit of the community.\\" Based on a Demonoid backup, d2 contained Demonoid's torrent and user databases. All previously registered Demonoid users were able to log in using their already existing Demonoid accounts, while new invite codes were being generated. Unlike Demonoid, d2 had no user forums, and to minimize legal risk, the site had no torrent tracker; all torrents instead used public trackers. RamNode eventually terminated d2's hosting and, in August 2013, d2.vu was hosted on a server in Sweden. d2 closed on March 30, 2014 when Demonoid went back up.

Afrithelphusa afzelii Afrithelphusa afzelii (Colosi, 1924) is known from two specimens collected before 1800 from a single, unknown locality in Sierra Leone. Although formerly listed as critically endangered, the lack of information about this species has led to its reappraisal as Data Deficient. Afrithelphusa gerhildae Afrithelphusa gerhildae Bott, 1969 is known from three specimens collected in 1957 in Kindia, Guinea. Although population sizes are not known, the expansion of slash and burn agriculture and deforestation are likely to have caused it to decline. The lack of information about this species has led to its reappraisal as Data Deficient. Afrithelphusa leonensis Afrithelphusa leonensis (Cumberlidge, 1987) is known from three specimens collected in 1955 at one locality in Guinea. Although formerly listed as critically endangered, the lack of information about this species has led to its reappraisal as Data Deficient.

Therion guitarist Kristian Niemann previously had the desire to produce more brutal music and had made earlier attempts with his brother Johan Niemann, although none of this earlier work had appeared on any records. Fellow Therion member Christofer Johnsson had later joined the project along with Rickard Evensand who was working with Therion as a drummer at that time.  History  So far they have released only one album, Riders of the Apocalypse, in 2004. The album is about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Christofer never intended to tour and only joined as a session vocalist for the studio recording of the first album, and with two other members busy touring with Therion, Demonoid never played any live concerts. On March 25, 2006, it was officially announced that Christofer Johnsson had withdrawn from Demonoid and that an unannounced replacement vocalist had been found.Chris retires from Demonoid On October 7, 2007, the new singer was revealed to be Emperor Magus Caligula of Dark Funeral, and on the same day the new band website was opened. Since then, the band also opened a forum in which Kristian keeps fans up to date, leaving the website without updates since January 16, 2008.

It is found in Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and possibly Malawi. Habitat Its natural habitats include standing waters in open highlands (often grasslands), usually with emergent grasses; often boggy. Description and identification The patterns of colour on the thorax and abdomen of the wisps are striking, but are seldom useful for identification as they are similar in many of the species and they vary considerably with age. The following can be useful: * Postocular spots of A. pinheyi these are oval and intermediate in size between the smaller ones of A. exilis, and the larger ones of A. gratiosa; they are not elongated towards the centre of head (as in A. falcifera). * The lower frons (antefrons) of A. pinheyi forms a light green moustache that runs from eye to eye; in A. gratiosa, this \\"moustache\\" is always broken by black in the centre of the face (and is usually broken in A. exilis). In South Africa, this moustache is pruinose only in mature males of A. falcifera. * Labrum of A. pinheyi is glossy black with a pale (generally bright green) border, rather than all black with a purple sheen (A. falcifera). * Hindlobe of prothorax: incised at two sides, separating fan-like middle section (A. pinheyi, A. falcifera, A. ruberrima); in A. exilis the hind margin of prothorax is a simple, entire curve - not incised. * Green thoracic stripe of A. pinheyi is narrow (wider in A. gratiosa). * Pterostigmas of A. pinheyi are similar in all wings, rather than being darker in the hindwing than in the forewing (A. falcifera). * Apex of S10: This is only slightly raised in A. pinheyi; A. ruberrima has S10 apex distinctly raised. * Cerci: Those of A. pinheyi and A. falcifera have a sharp triangular pointed end that is directed inwards towards S10; the tips of the cerci of A. gratiosa point outwards from S10. * Paraprocts (lower appendages) of A. pinheyi and A. falcifera are almost as long as the cerci, tapering to a pointed apex in lateral view, but in caudal view (from below) ending broadly, so visible as black ridge that is wider than high; paraprocts of A. gratiosa are longer than the cerci. * Length: A. pinheyi is smaller (20 mm long) than A. gratiosa (25 mm) and A. falcifera (24‚Äì25 mm) - similar in size to A. exilis (18‚Äì22 mm).

Members submitted \\"experiences\\"‚Äîtheir personal, first-person stories about various life experiences they had. Users could then form or join communities based on these experiences and/or interests, and interact with other members who shared them. As of May 2016, the site had over sixty-seven million of these \\"experiences\\". In March 2016, Experience Project announced that it would suspend operations indefinitely. The existing content of the site would remain publicly available, but members would no longer be able to post new content or access their accounts. The site was officially suspended on April 21, 2016. As of March 2018 all links to the website redirected to a new page which contained only a short message on a blank white background informing that the website is \\"taking a break\\" and thanking the community of the site. As of June 2019, the website is down. Description The nodes of the network were \\"life experiences\\", such as starting a new job, battling depression or surviving a divorce. Members who had listed experiences in common were automatically connected. Reversing the \\"f.r.i.e.n.d.s.\\" concept of traditional social networks, in which connections are made between known individuals who then may or may not share experiences, on the Experience Project, connections were made based on shared experiences. The site emphasized anonymity to promote more authentic conversations that would otherwise be quelled by fear of recognition or embarrassment. In March 2016, it was announced that Experience Project would be closing for the long term on April 21, 2016. New registrations or the posting of new content was suspended, freezing the current library of experiences. Reasons cited for the closure included difficulties maintaining user privacy in the face of increasing governmental powers, challenges complying with new data privacy laws, and general online trends that were moving away from long-form content.  Leadership  Armen Berjikly was founder and CEO of the community, with executive leadership including Neil Sheth as CTO, and Erik Darby as SVP.  Origins  Experience Project was started by Armen Berjikly in late 2004. In 2013, Berjikly gave a popular TEDx talk that told the origin story of the site. After a close friend's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis Berjikly created This is MS, an online community for MS patients and caregivers focused on inspiring hope in patients through knowledge of current research. As This is MS grew, Berjikly identified that the key benefit to patients was not the editorialized content, but the relationships that formed between people who understood each other through the shared experience of having multiple sclerosis. Experience Project extended the ability to connect with people who understood each other and had similar experiences.

He was also widely known for his involvement in gambling in the San Antonio area throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Biography Berry was born 27 February 1899 near Fort Smith, Arkansas, one of 13 children. As a young man, he worked as an office clerk in Fort Smith, and, later, for the Union Pacific Railroad as a machinist apprentice. In World War I, he served in the 60th Railway Transportation Corps in the U.S. Army in France. He was later stationed at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio as an MP. In this capacity he patrolled downtown San Antonio streets for wayward soldiers. After his departure from the Army, Berry returned to San Antonio in 1929. With his knowledge of San Antonio's seamier side, he entered the gambling business. He opened the elegant Turf Club in 1934 on Soledad Street. He was convicted for shooting Otto \\"Skeeter\\" Klaus‚Äîa bootlegger and murderer‚Äîwith a sawed-off shotgun. The verdict was appealed, but no retrial ever took place, sparing Berry jail time. The Turf Club was raided by the Texas Rangers in October 1944, but the club remained open. Berry was considered the prime suspect in the 1945 shotgun-blast murder of another San Antonio gambling kingpin, Hersel Gray, but was never indicted. He was indicted two other times for murder, but never convicted. By the time the Turf Club finally closed in 1957, Berry had moved his gambling operations twice. The first move was to the nearby town of La Vernia, Texas. While his gambling interests were based there, Berry won‚Äîin a game of Pitch‚Äîtitle to an tract of land southeast of Fort Sam Houston. In 1951, he constructed a house in the style of a French chateau that included a full basement, where he subsequently moved his casino. A police raid in 1955 confiscated his gambling equipment and closed down the operation. In 1960, with the dual goals of gaining respectability for himself and pushing for the legalization of parimutuel wagering on horse-racing in Texas, Berry won the Democratic Party primary for District 68, Place 4, in the Texas House of Representatives. In the general election, the 61-year-old Berry faced off against 29-year-old Republican Henry Catto, son of a prominent insurance man in San Antonio. During the campaign, which included a televised debate, Berry referred to Catto as \\"kiddo\\" and \\"fat cat Catto\\". In the heavily Democratic Texas of the era, Berry won the election with 54 percent of the vote. After serving his freshman term in the Texas House in the 57th Legislature, Berry was re-elected to the 58th and the 59th Legislatures. When Walter Richter did not seek re-election to his Texas Senate seat, Berry successfully ran for the District 19 seat in 1966. Berry was re- elected in 1968. While still a sitting senator, Berry succumbed to cancer on 24 November 1969 in San Antonio. Berry was married to the former Lydia Josephine Galloway. They had a son, Duke Edward Berry, in 1938.

Its monotypic genus Amanipodagrion was formerly in the subfamily Argiolestinae of the flatwing damselfly family (Megapodagrionidae). As a result of molecular phylogenetic studies by Dijkstra et al. in 2013, the genus Amanipodagrion is now considered \\"incertae sedis\\", without an assigned family but within the superfamily Calopterygoidea. This species is commonly known as the Amani flatwing. It has a slender dark-coloured abdomen with a white tip, and males have a dark wing band. This insect is endemic to a stretch of stream in the Amani-Sigi Forest Reserve in the eastern Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. Because of its small area of occupation and the continuing destruction of the mountain forests in the area, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of the Amani flatwing as being \\"critically endangered\\".  Description  The Amani flatwing has a long, extremely slender abdomen, which is darkly coloured with a conspicuous white tip. Its wings are distinctly narrower at their base than at their tip, and the males have a broad brown band close to their wing tips.  Range  It is endemic to the Amani Sigi Forest of the East Usambara Mountains from Tanzania. The Amani flatwing population appears to be largely confined to a 500 meter long stream in the Amani-Sigi Forest Reserve, although a single male has been found outside of this reserve.  Habitat  Adult damselflies occur along clear, fast-running streams that are heavily shaded by closed canopy vegetation. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and rivers.  Threats  Amanipodagrion gilliesi is now critically endangered due to destruction and degradation of its habitat. There has been almost a complete destruction of the low-altitude forest across East Africa, mainly for conversion to agricultural land. The few remaining forests of the East Usambara Mountains where the Amani flatwing is found are under considerable pressure. The main, viable subpopulation of Amani flatwings is relatively safe within the Amani-Sigi Forest Reserve, any other subpopulations within the vicinity are either already extinct or maybe on the verge of extinction as a result of human encroachment, deforestation and water pollution. Also the protected population of Amani flatwings leads a relatively precarious existence, containing fewer than an estimated 250 mature individuals.  Conservation  The stream around which the one remaining viable population lives is protected within the forest reserve in the East Usambara Conservation Area, and is therefore relatively safe from any danger. Any changes to this stream could result in the extinction of Amanipodagrion gilliesi. It has been advocated that an extensive survey of the whole area is urgently needed to locate any further remaining populations. This species is very close to becoming extinct. Dragonflies and damselflies can't survive well in captivity.

A talented mathematician in his youth, he especially contributed to the unsuccessful attempts to codify the English criminal law in the nineteenth century. Early life Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Thomas was the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Starkie, vicar of Blackburn, and his wife, Ann n√©e Yatman. He was educated at Clitheroe Royal Grammar School and St John's College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1803 as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman. In the same year, he became a Fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge. In 1812 he married Lucy, eldest daughter of Rev. Thomas Dunham Whitaker which entailed that he resign his fellowship. The couple went on to parent five children.Lobban (2004) Legal practice Starkie entered Lincoln's Inn as a pupil of Joseph Chitty and was called to the bar in 1810, proceeding to practise as a special pleader as well as on the northern circuit, and becoming a QC. In 1823 he became Downing Professor of law at Cambridge though he had little success in attracting pupils with his poor presentations, a fate shared with his contemporary John Austin. He repeated his failure at the Inner Temple in 1833. However, in 1833, Starkie was appointed to the royal commission on a proposed English Criminal Code and spent the rest of his life on various commissions on reform and codification of the criminal law. He was not always popular with his colleagues, Henry Bellenden Ker calling him \\"childish\\" and \\"desultory and wayward\\". He was also a sometime law reporter and author of the influential texts: A Practical Treatise on the Law of Slander, Libel, and Incidentally of Malicious Prosecutions (1812) and A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence (1824). In 1847, Starkie became a judge in the Clerkenwell small-debts court. He died in his rooms in Downing College, Cambridge. Politics Starkie's instincts were Tory and he opposed the Catholic Relief Act 1829. However, in 1840 he unsuccessfully stood as a Liberal Party candidate in Cambridge.

It was formed on October 11, 1866, and was headquartered in Hannover.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939.

The division was subordinated in peacetime to the X Army Corps (X. Armeekorps).Bredow, p. 555. The division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. Recruitment During the Franco-Prussian War, the division was a mixed unit, with Hannoverian, Oldenburg and Westphalian elements. It was subsequently reorganized so that it was recruited primarily from the former Kingdom of Hannover, which had become the Prussian Province of Hanover after 1866, along with Oldenburg, a grand duchy mostly surrounded by the Prussian province. Among the division's units were several that perpetuated the traditions of the King's German Legion, a British Army unit of the Napoleonic Wars. Combat chronicle During the Franco-Prussian War, the 19th Infantry Division fought in the battles of Mars- la-Tour and Gravelotte, and then in the Siege of Metz. It then fought in the Loire Campaign, including the battles of Beaune-la-Rolande, Beaugency-Cravant, and Le Mans.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935); Wegner, p.556. In World War I, the 19th Infantry Division participated in the 1914 Battle of Li√®ge and the subsequent Allied Great Retreat, including the First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne. It was sent to the Eastern Front in 1915 and again in 1916, seeing action in the Gorlice- Tarn√≥w Offensive and the Russian Brusilov Offensive. It returned to the Western Front and, after a period in the trenches, saw action in the German 1918 Spring Offensive and the subsequent Allied counteroffensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive. The division was rated a first class division and regarded as one of the best German divisions by Allied intelligence.19\\\\.

During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\").

The first specimens were brought to Europe in 1839, and seven species are now recognised, most of which are considered as threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are large and slow-growing, and are threatened by habitat loss, overexploitation by local people and by spread of introduced non-indigenous marbled crayfish (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis). They are only found in a relatively small part of the island, mostly in undisturbed upland areas. They belong to the Gondwana-distributed family Parastacidae, but their nearest relatives live in Australasia, there being no native crayfish in mainland Africa or India. Description Astacoides species are large for freshwater crayfish, reaching a carapace length of up to in the case of A. betsileoensis. Males and females are similar, except for the organs directly involved in reproduction. Thomas Henry Huxley, in his book The Crayfish, noted that Astacoides has fewer pairs of gills than any other crayfish, with only 12 pairs compared to 21 pairs in Astacopsis. Biology Very little field work has been carried out on Malagasy crayfish, leaving their biology poorly known. They are slow-growing animals, among the slowest of any crayfish; A. crosnieri may take 10 years to reach a carapace length of . They appear to breed once a year, with females bearing eggs for around four months, peaking from July to October. The eggs hatch in October or November, and the juveniles are independent by January. The fish Channa maculata is an invasive species in parts of Madagascar, and it is known to feed on young crayfish. Astacoides is also harvested by local people, often before the crayfish are able to reach reproductive age. The greater threat to Astacoides crayfish, however, is from habitat loss. The importance of habitat loss may have been underestimated in the past because most studies have focussed on the Ranomafana National Park, where the forests are largely intact but crayfish are still harvested by local people. Distribution A village in the Malagasy highlands Crayfish are only found in a relatively small area of Madagascar, covering parts of Toamasina, Antananarivo, Fianarantsoa and Toliara provinces; the total area they inhabit is around and ranges from the Isaha valley south to the Hauts Plateaux (near Anjozorobe). In common with other tropical crayfish, Astacoides only lives at higher altitudes, from above sea level to . Biogeography The presence of Astacoides on the island of Madagascar is difficult to explain. The other members of the family Parastacidae are found in South America and Australasia, suggesting a Gondwanan origin for the family. However, there are no native crayfish in either Africa or India, the two landmasses with the most recent connections to Madagascar in the geological past. The genus which shares the greatest similarities with Astacoides is the Tasmanian genus Astacopsis. Given the large distance between Tasmania and Madagascar, it has been suggested that although the freshwater crayfish are a monophyletic group, their common ancestor may have lived in the seas, with separate crayfish lineages colonising the rivers separately. Taxonomic history F√©lix √âdouard Gu√©rin- M√©neville, who was the first to describe a crayfish from Madagascar In 1839, the French explorer-naturalist Justin Goudot returned from an expedition to Madagascar bearing specimens of a crayfish he had collected there. He gave some of the material to the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris and some to F√©lix √âdouard Gu√©rin-M√©neville. Both Gu√©rin-M√©neville and, at the museum, Henri Milne-Edwards and Jean Victoire Audouin wrote papers describing the new species, with the name Astacoides Goudotii Gu√©rin, 1839 published on 29 April, and Astacus madagascarensis Milne-Edwards & Audouin, 1839 published on May 9. Some years later, and apparently unaware of the two French descriptions, Charles Spence Bate published what he thought was the first account of Malagasy crayfish. He had been brought specimens by J. Caldwell, and described them in 1865 under the name Astacus Caldwelli Bate, 1865. By the end of the 19th century, scientists had settled on the name Astacus madagascarensis, treating the others as synonyms, and to preserve nomenclatural stability, the name A. goudotii was suppressed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1958. The next new taxon to be described was the variety betsileoensis described by Georges Petit in 1923. In 1927, he divided the Malagasy crayfish into the \\"macrophthalmes\\", with large eyes, a convex carapace and flattened chelae, and the \\"microphthalmes\\", with small eyes, cylindrical carapace and more robust chelae. In their 1929 monograph, Th√©odore Monod and Petit recognised four \\"varieties\\", betsileoensis and madagascariensis (the \\"macrophthalmes\\") and brevirostris and granulimanus (the \\"microphthalmes\\"). In 1964, Lipke Holthuis realised that due to the suppression of the name goudotii, the epithet caldwelli would have to be used, although Holthuis continued to treat the different taxa as subspecies. In 1974, Horton H. Hobbs, Jr. published a monograph which finally raised the various taxa observed to that point to the rank of species, and introduced two new species. Since then, the only change has been the addition of a new species, described in 2005, and commemorating Hobbs, Astacoides hobbsi.

Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1648-51); detail of the River Ganges Fountain in front of Villa Medici on the Pincio This is a list of the notable fountains in Rome, Italy. Rome has fifty monumental fountains and hundreds of smaller fountains, over 2000 fountains in all, more than any other city in the world. History For more than two thousand years fountains have provided drinking water and decorated the piazzas of Rome. During the Roman Empire, in 98 AD, according to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named curator aquarum or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci√©t√© d'√©dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the aqueducts were wrecked or fell into disrepair, and the fountains stopped working. In the 14th century, Pope Nicholas V (1397‚Äì1455), a scholar who commissioned hundreds of translations of ancient Greek classics into Latin, decided to embellish the city and make it a worthy capital of the Christian world. In 1453 he began to rebuild the Acqua Vergine, the ruined Roman aqueduct which had brought clean drinking water to the city from eight miles (13 km) away. He also decided to revive the Roman custom of marking the arrival point of an aqueduct with a mostra, a grand commemorative fountain. He commissioned the architect Leon Battista Alberti to build a wall fountain where the Trevi Fountain is now located. Alberti restored, modified, and expanded the aqueduct that supplied both the Trevi Fountain as well as the famous baroque fountains in the Piazza del Popolo and Piazza Navona.Pinto, John A. The Trevi Fountain. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1986. One of the first new fountains to be built in Rome during the Renaissance was the Fountain in Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere (1499), which was placed on the site of an earlier Roman fountain. Its design, based on an earlier Roman model, with a circular vasque on a pedestal pouring water into a basin below, became the model for many other fountains in Rome, and eventually for fountains in other cities, from Paris to London.The fountain in Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere originally had two upper basins, but the water pressure in the early Renaissance was so low that the water was unable to reach the upper basin, so the top basin was removed. During the 17th and 18th century the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \\"a visual representation of confidence and power.\\" Italian Gardens, a Cultural History, Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006. The most famous Roman fountains of this period include: *The Fountains of St. Peter's Square, by Carlo Maderno (1614) and Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1677) were made to complement the lavish Baroque facade Maderno designed for St. Peter's Basilica. The Maderno fountain was built on the site of an earlier fountain from 1490, and used the same lower basin. The Bernini fountain was added a half-century later. *The Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini (1642), by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is a masterpiece of Baroque sculpture, representing Triton, half-man and half-fish, blowing his horn to calm the waters, following a text by the Roman poet Ovid in the Metamorphoses. * Piazza Navona is a grand theater of water ‚Äì it has three fountains, built in a line on the site of the Stadium of Domitian. The fountains at either end are by Giacomo della Porta; the Neptune fountain to the north, (1572) shows the God of the Sea spearing an octopus, surrounded by Tritons, sea horses and mermaids. At the southern end is La Fontana del Moro, a figure either of an African (a Moor) or of Neptune wrestling with a dolphin. In the center is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, (The Fountain of the Four Rivers) (1648‚Äì51), a highly theatrical fountain by Bernini, with statues representing rivers from the four continents; the Nile, Danube, Plate River and Ganges. Over the whole structure is a Egyptian obelisque, crowned by a cross with the emblem of the Pamphili family, representing Pope Innocent X, whose family palace was on the piazza. *The Trevi Fountain is the largest and most spectacular of Rome's fountains, designed to glorify the three different Popes who created it. It was built beginning in 1730 at the terminus of the reconstructed Acqua Vergine aqueduct, on the site of Renaissance fountain by Leon Battista Alberti. It was the work of architect Nicola Salvi and the successive project of Pope Clement XII, Pope Benedict XIV and Pope Clement XIII, whose emblems and inscriptions are carried on the attic story, entablature and central niche. The central figure is Oceanus, the personification of all the seas and oceans, in an oyster-shell chariot, surrounded by Tritons and Sea Nymphs. The fountains of Rome all operated purely by gravity- the source of water had to be higher than the fountain itself, and the difference in elevation and distance between the source and the fountain determined how high the fountain could shoot water. The fountain in St. Peter's Square was fed by the Paola aqueduct, restored in 1612, whose source was above sea level, which meant it could shoot water twenty feet up from the fountain. The Triton fountain benefited from its location in a valley, and the fact that it was fed by the Aqua Felice aqueduct, restored in 1587, which arrived in Rome at an elevation of above sea level (fasi), a difference of in elevation between the source and the fountain, which meant that the water from this fountain jetted sixteen feet straight up into the air from the conch shell of the Triton.Katherine Wentworth Rinne, The Fall and Rise of the Waters of Rome, collected in Marilyn Symmes, 'Fountains- Splash and Spectacle ‚Äì Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present,. Thames and Hudson, London, 1998 (pg. 54). The fountains of Piazza Navona, on the other hand, took their water from the Acqua Vergine, which had only a drop from the source to the fountains, which meant the water could only fall or trickle downwards, not jet very high upwards. For the Trevi Fountain, the architect Nicola Salvi compensated for this problem by sinking the fountain down into the ground, and by carefully designing the cascade so that the water churned and tumbled, to add movement and drama.Maria Ann Conneli and Marilyn Symmes, Fountains as propaganda, in Fountains, Splash and Spectacle ‚Äì Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present. Edited by Marilyn Symmes. Thames and Hudson, London, and Katherine Wentworth Rinne, The Fall and Rise of the Waters of Rome, in the same collection. Today all of the fountains have been rebuilt, and the Roman water system uses both gravity and mechanical pumps. Water is recycled and water from different aqueducts is sometimes mixed before it reaches the fountains and performs for the spectators.Katherine Wentworth Rinne, collected in Marilyn Symmes, Fountains- Splash and Spectacle. (pg. 54).

Very little other information is known of this species, all of it coming from a single specimen found living at a freshwater stream near Tinaroo Dam, in north-eastern Queensland. Etymology The species name atratus is a Latin word meaning clothed in black. Tony Watson named this species of dragonfly after its blackish brown abdomen.

It is suggested that the shape of the male tail is generally like that of a bolt used in ship building. Gomphus is also a genus of dragonfly, with some similarities to Austrogomphus, both belonging to the much larger family group, Gomphidae. In 1854 Edmond de S√©lys Longchamps named the sub- genus Austrogomphus probably as a southern or Australian component of the gomphid group.

It is owned by ViacomCBS Networks Americas and was launched on 20 December 1996. Aside from airing Nick and Nick Jr. content, it has produced original programming for the channel and has been sold to local distributors worldwide execpt for Cuba as cable television is banned in that country. Nickelodeon is divided into four regional feeds: three (North, Central and South) in Spanish, and one (Brazil) in Portuguese.  History  The channel was launched on 20 December 1996 in Latin America as a children-oriented channel, being the main competitor of Cartoon Network, which was launched three years before. In 1999, Nickelodeon launched its official website for the region, MundoNick.com. \\"Nick Radio\\" was also available, but eventually it was replaced by the Nick Jr. official site. On 13 February 2006, a programming block named Nick at Nite was launched. It consisted mostly of live-action shows from the 80s and 90s, and aired from 10 pm to 6 am. On 9 June 2008, the channel launched \\"Nickers\\", a live-action show with two hosts introducing shows and music. It followed the same line and was very similar to Disney Channel's Zapping Zone. The block was cancelled in all feeds in December 2008. In 2008, two locally produced series premiered, both being soap operas. The first one, Isa TKM premiered on 29 September 2008 and La maga y el camino dorado premiered on 13 October of that same year. In 2009, a programming block called Nick Hits, which airs classic Nick Toons, replaced Nick at Nite on weekends. On 5 April 2010, Nickelodeon Latin America was rebranded with the new logo already in use in the US and most countries in the world, making it the last Nickelodeon channel worldwide to switch to the new graphics. Due to the rebrand, NickHits was closed down and replaced again by Nick at Nite. In June 2010, Viacom gave the rights for Mexico to release their own Kids Choice Awards. https://web.archive.org/web/20100918051022/http://www.mundonick.com/ It premiered on 4 September 2010. On 20 July 2010, another original series called Sue√±a conmigo premiered on the channel. Through August 2010, Nickelodeon started to rerun the animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender to promote the film The Last Airbender; with this, a new on-air logo was shown when the series was broadcast, an arrow blurring takes on/off in the Nick logo. https://web.archive.org/web/20100918051022/http://www.mundonick.com/ On 2 May 2011, it was premiered the fifth original production Grachi. In late January 2012, MTV Networks Latin America announced another locally produced soap opera, Miss XV, that was premiered on 16 April 2012. Since 2012, the Nick at Nite programming block was no longer airing classic programming from the 80s and 90s and, instead, was a mere relay of Nickelodeon's 2000s and 2010s TV series that were not aired in the main slot anymore. On 1 January 2015 the Nick at Nite programming block went off the air.  Feeds  Nickelodeon Latin America is divided into four different feeds for its broadcast in the Latin American region. * North feed: Aimed at Mexico. Used to broadcast as a pan- regional feed excluding Argentina and Chile. * Central feed: Aimed at Colombia, Central America, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia. This feed used to cover Paraguay and Uruguay until 2012, when they switched to the South feed. * South feed: Aimed at Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay.

It is mostly found in tributaries of the Danube, having originated in the northern part of the Balkan Peninsula. Description A. torrentium grows to a length of around , and has a smooth brown carapace, with an untoothed triangular rostrum; the underside is creamy white. Males have larger claws than females, but females have a noticeably larger abdomen. As in other crayfish, the first two pairs of pleopods are specialised for sperm transfer in males, while the female's pleopods are uniform, and used for brooding eggs. Distribution This forest stream on the slopes of , alt=A steep-sided valley through deciduous woodland. On one side, a footpath has been cut; 5 hikers are using it. The distribution of A. torrentium is centred on the Danube system, extending from the Olt River in Romania upstream to Germany and Switzerland and into parts of the Rhine and Elbe basins. It is widespread in southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia. Contrary to some previous records, A. torrentium does not appear to occur in Luxembourg, Poland or Ukraine. In France, at the western edge of the species' range, two populations remain, one in Alsace and one in Lorraine. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are at the north-eastern periphery of the natural range of A. torrentium, with only four and six known populations, respectively, all those in Slovakia being in the ' hills (Lesser Carpathians). The northernmost point inhabited by A. torrentium is near the city of Dresden in the German federal state of Saxony. Italy is at the south-western margin of the distribution of A. torrentium, with at least two populations in the drainage (a tributary of the Danube) near Tarvisio. To the south-east, the species has entered the Drin River in Albania, and was discovered in 2005 in the European part of Turkey. In Romania, it is present in the Apuseni Mountains and in the Carpathian foothills to the southwest, overlapping slightly with the distribution of the noble crayfish Astacus astacus. The populations in the west of the species' range are genetically depauperate, while populations from the upper Kupa basin are as genetically distinct from the rest of A. torrentium as some species in related genera are from each other, suggesting A. torrentium originated in the Western Balkans. Ecology The red fox, Vulpes vulpes, is an important predator of adult crayfish. The preferred habitat of A. torrentium is cold, fast-flowing streams, although some live in larger rivers and lakes. It digs burrows in the banks and hides under submerged roots or rocks, emerging at night to feed. Adult A. torrentium consume a variety of plant materials, including fallen leaves, while the juveniles chiefly feed on aquatic invertebrates. Natural predators of fully grown A. torrentium include foxes, bears, wolves and badgers, while the young animals are targeted by fish. The species is sensitive to low levels of dissolved oxygen, and to chemical pollution. Beside naturally occurring threats, A. torrentium has also suffered from the introduction of the crayfish plague, Asphanomyces astaci, carried by invasive crayfish species from North America, and from the release of detergents into streams while washing laundry. Life cycle Mating takes place at the end of October. The female then carries the 40‚Äì70 fertilised eggs on her pleopods until the eggs are ready to hatch. Juveniles moult up to 4 or 5 times per year, but as they mature, this slows to once or twice a year, usually in May, June or July. Sexual maturity is reached after 3 to 5 years, by which time the animal has grown to a length of . Adult males can reproduce every year, but females do not reproduce for at least one year after producing eggs. Conservation status A. torrentium is one of the most threatened species in Europe: as well as protection under various national laws, it is designated data deficient on the IUCN Red List, it is listed in Appendix III of the Bern Convention, and it is protected under the EU Habitats Directive.

It is endemic to Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is a member of the narrow-winged damselfly family Coenagrionidae with its closest relatives originating in Africa, for example Azuragrion nigridorsum. Description Azuragrion granti is, typically for narrow-winged dragonflies, a largely blue damselfly with black markings on top of the head, black stripes along the thorax and on the upper part of the abdomen which is paler underneath. It has narrow, transparent wings it holds vertically over their body when it is at rest. Distribution Endemic to the island of Socotra, part of Yemen where it occurs mostly in the eastern granitic, mountainous half of the island over an area of 550 km¬≤ in the Hagheir Mountains. Azuragrion granti apparently does not occur the karstic western half of Socotra as there are few open freshwater bodies to be found there. Habitat The natural habitats of Azuragrion grantii are rivers, intermittent freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, and ponds. It is threatened by habitat loss although said to be locally abundant. This species breeds in mountain running water. Nothing is known about the biology of this species. Conservation status There has been a decline in the quality of the habitat available to Azuragrion granti due to water extraction and pollution, and this has also been observed in the lowlands where the rapidly developing tourism industry concentrates. As a result, Azuragrion granti is therefore listed as near-threatened species. Due to its endemicity and the small range of the species, any future predicted impacts by infrastructure development on Socotra will almost certainly have negative effects.

The station broadcasts an oldies format. History WGHN signed on the air on July 16, 1956. The station was founded by Robert Runyon and Robert Kirby, former employees of WOOD radio and television in Grand Rapids. WGHN went through several ownership changes in the next decade. Over the years, the station also moved several times, from its original studios on Washington Avenue (above Grand Haven Jewelry) to Franklin Avenue to South Seventh Street; WGHN has been housed at its current location on South Harbor Street in Grand Haven since 1985. WGHN-FM 92.1 was added on January 28, 1969. In 1976 the station changed its call letters to WFMG (those calls are now used at 101.3 FM in Richmond, Indiana) and separated programming from its AM sister, airing an easy listening format while the AM station continued with a format of adult contemporary music and talk. After the stations were sold in 1983, the FM's call letters were changed back to WGHN-FM and the two stations resumed simulcasting, which continued until January 4, 2008. 2007-08: Sale and Changes WGHN owners Bill Struyk, President and General Manager, and Ron Mass, Vice President (known on the air as \\"Ron Stevens\\"), announced in April 2007 that they were selling WGHN and WGHN-FM to Lansing-based businessman Will Tieman, owner of Michigan State University's Spartan Sports Network. Struyk told the Grand Haven Tribune that he and Mass were both ready for retirement (1). Despite speculation that Tieman would try to move WGHN out of Grand Haven to become a Muskegon- or Grand Rapids-market station, Tieman told The Muskegon Chronicle that he did not plan to make any major programming changes (see: \\"New owner plans to keep WGHN local,\\" The Muskegon Chronicle, 8 May 2007) 1, nor would he immediately discontinue WGHN's University of Michigan sports broadcasts in favor of Michigan State sports. In early January 2008, Will Tieman discontinued WGHN's simulcast of the FM signal and changed the format to ESPN Radio.

If a company is practising market cannibalization, it is seen to be eating its own market and in so doing, hoping to get a bigger share of it. Concretely, it refers to the principle of a newly introduced product B eating up the market shares of an already established product A, both usually coming from the same company. In this case, both products belong to the same category of products. This occurrence can have either a positive or negative impact on the company's bottom line, can be accidental or deliberate, in which case it is commonly called cannibalisation strategy. An interesting example is one involving a company achieving lower productions costs for a product produced in a socially evolved country than for the same product produced in a socially weak country. In this case lower production costs are easily achieved by virtue of to lower wages and social costs. This type of market and corporate cannibalism is one factor that makes it hard today in Europe for example to find any computer not produced in China. At the same time companies like Foxconn achieved not only low production costs, but also made it possible for innovative products to get on the market.  Market cannibalism process  A company has a product A which is well established within its market. The same company decides to market a product B, which happens to be somewhat similar to product A, therefore both belonging to the same market, attracting similar clients. This leads to both products being forced to share the market, reducing the market share of product A, as part of it is eaten up by product B. Suppose that pet- food manufacturers A, B and C offer one line of tinned cat food each, and that the customers cannot really distinguish between them, thereby giving them 33.33% share of the market, each. Suppose that manufacturer C then launches a new labelling of cat food called D. On the face of it, it cuts the market share of product C from 33.33% to 25%, but in reality the manufacturer of C now has 50% of the market share, as opposed to 25% each for its rival manufacturers. This example shows the complexity of the subject and the relationship of market or corporate cannibalism with market evolution.  Cannibalisation strategy  Companies can seek to cannibalise their own market shares through market cannibalism (or corporate cannibalism in this particular case), for two predominant reasons: gaining an overall greater market share within a same category of products at the expense of losing a single well established product's market share, or simply because they believe the second product will sell better than the first. As well as perhaps selling better than the first product, the second product may also sell to a different type of customer, further emphasising the increase of global market share. A third possible reason for deliberate cannibalisation would be to increase profit margin, due to the cheaper production costs of product B over product A.  Gaining global market share  Market cannibalism can also be used to the company's advantage, if the latter looks to increase its global market share, spread through multiple products. The company that best illustrates this process is Coca-Cola, when it started developing a wider catalogue of drinks such as Coca-Cola Light, Zero, Vanilla, Cherry and many more. As the market share of the original Coca-Cola drink shrank, the marketing of these new drinks increased the company's soda market share. By doing this, the company's intention is to harm their competition even more than they harm themselves in order to gain global market share.  Increasing customer loyalty  This strategy also helps win the loyalty of customers, as they will move from one product marketed by a particular brand to another by the same brand. This is the case for Gillette Sensor razor's customers, two thirds of which are estimated to already being Gillette customers for another model of razors. The example confirms the two-sided impact of market cannibalism on a firm - although old razor models become obsolete and lose market share, customers move on to different models, marketed by the same company, therefore increasing customer loyalty - shoppers are inclined to buy products from a brand they already know.  Increasing profit margin  If product B is more economical to manufacture than product A, by virtue of different materials being used or new technology allowing cheaper production, a company will evidently attempt to cannibalise product A's market share with the marketing of product B. This deliberate cannibalisation has the straightforward objective to increase the second product's market so much that product A's is surpassed by it. This is the case for the computer market over the past decade or so. Every year, computer based companies market machines that are more and more powerful, and cheaper to make thanks to technological advancements. Computer based companies attempt to promote their newer models every year because of this, as it allows them to further increase their profit margin. The price a buyer would have to pay for a personal computer has immensely decreased over the years, as the index dropped over 20% every year, from 1999-2003, and now decreasing by 11% to 12% annually.  Importance of innovation  A hypothesis is that by better controlling innovation as a reason for market and corporate cannibalism, higher wages and better social standards can be achieved for the whole market and corporation than those that can be achieved without innovation control. Research and development plays a crucial role in the increasing of market share, a company's ultimate goal. Being costly in terms of money and time, a company will seek to invest in what they believe will gain them the most market share. This decision can lead to either success - as it was the case for Coca-Cola when introducing a new line of drinks - or failure, as it was the case for Kodak who went from commanding 85% of camera sales in the U.S., according to a 2005 case study for Harvard Business School, to entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy and being delisted from the New York Stock exchange. Their downfall was due to their investments being ill-placed, as they refused to seek innovation, afraid that it would cannibalise their already established products. Had they invested in digital cameras, as technology advancements were thriving, rather than spent all development money into creating the Kodak Funtime, they may have continued to be a leading camera company today. This example shows the importance of companies cannibalising the market share of their own products, in order to keep a globally higher market share and prevent competition from cannibalising them, which ultimately leads to the first becoming obsolete. Although market cannibalism can have a deteriorating effect on a certain product's market share, a popular saying claims that it is \\"better to cannibalise yourself than let someone else do it\\". The P&G; group did better than Kodak in the 1930s, in the sense that it developed brands like Tide and Cheer, both belonging to the laundry detergent market, in order to gain as much market share as possible and prevent competition from entering the market.  Measuring cannibalisation  There is no such thing as a standard measurement of cannibalisation, as the definition of it will differ according to different people. However a common, although not the only, way to measure it is to examine the sales lost by the first product once the second has been marketed. The rate then belongs between 0 and 100 - being closer to the latter translates to a higher cannibalisation rate, therefore a greater loss of sales of product A caused by the launch of product B. > Buday (1989, p. 29) suggests that: \\"Excessive cannibalization is one of the > common arguments against brand- extending.... Common branding implies a > similarity: similarity invites replacement.\\"  Cannibalisation rate  According to UPenn's Marketing Maths Essentials website, the cannibalisation rate corresponds to: \\"The percentage of New Product Unit Volume that are sales that would have gone to the Old Product had the New Product not been introduced\\". Cannibalisation rate = Product A buyers opting for product B / Total product B sales Example: A bakery markets a single plain cookie for $2. However, they decide to introduce a new chocolate chip cookie for $3. The plain cookies made 100 sales a day before the chocolate chip cookie was launched. On the first month of launch, the chocolate chip cookie makes 50 sales a day. However the bakery should not expect to make $350, as what will most likely happen is that a portion of the people who bought the chocolate chip cookie will be plain cookie buyers who will have opted for the second product. Hypothesise that the cannibalisation rate is of 60%. Chocolate chip cookie sales: 50 Cannibalisation rate: 60% Plain cookie sales lost: 30 (= 50 x 60 / 100) New plain cookie sales: 70 (= 100 - 30) The new total cookie sale has therefore increased from 100 initially, to 120 (= 70 + 50). The bakery has replaced 30 plain cookie sales with 30 chocolate chip cookie sales as well as 20 more chocolate chip cookie sales. This shows the positive aspect of market cannibalism on a business - although the first product's sales decreased, the overall contribution has increased due to the launching of a second product.

He was also the founder of the Aberdeen Line shipping company.  Background  His father, Andrew Thomson (sic), served in the Royal Regiment of Artillery before joining the East India Company in 1805. George Thompson, always known as George Thompson Junior to distinguish himself from his grandfather, was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School. He then joined the Aberdeen office of the London Shipping Company. In 1825, aged 21, he set up his own business as a ship and insurance broker, with offices in Aberdeen. In the same year his name first appeared as a subscribing owner of a small Aberdeen ship, and his shipowning interests rapidly developed. He also traded the imports which his vessels brought back to Aberdeen.  Political career  George Thompson served as Provost of Aberdeen from 1847 to 1850. The highlight of his term of office was welcoming Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to Aberdeen on 8 September 1848. They were on their way to Balmoral for the first time. This was the first occasion a monarch had visited Aberdeen since 1650. A crowd of 80,000 people turned out to greet her. In 1852 he was persuaded to stand as a Liberal candidate for Aberdeen and defeated another Liberal, Andrew Leith Hay by 682 votes to 478. He was an advocate of further parliamentary reform, and associated with Richard Cobden and John Bright in the repeal of the Corn Laws. After retiring from Parliament in 1857, he took no further part in politics.  The Aberdeen White Star Line  George Thompson & Co. Ltd house flag In his first 15 years Thompson operated a seasonal liner service to Canada and built up a fleet of a dozen vessels with trades extending to Cuba, South America, the Baltic, the Mediterranean, South Africa and the Far East. 1840 saw the launch of the first ship built at Walter Hood's yard in Aberdeen for Thompson, and this yard built most of his ships up to 1881. They included some of the world's finest clippers. In 1842 one of his ships undertook an emigrant charter to New Zealand, and in the same year his first ship visited Australia. By 1846 his ships had become established in the Australian trade. Initially this was to Sydney, but with the discovery of gold at Ballarat the ships also traded to Melbourne. Thompson first established the Aberdeen Line (or Aberdeen White star Line to distinguish it from John T. Rennie's Aberdeen Line) on the Australian trade in his own right in 1856. From that time, Thompson's ships were distinguished by their green-painted hulls, their white masts and yards and the red and blue house flag with the six-pointed white star which gave rise to the alternative name. Thompson entered the China tea trade in 1848. A regular voyage pattern was soon established: London to Australia with passengers and general cargo; Australia to China, Japan or Russia with coal; and thence via a Chinese port with tea. The famous clipper Thermopylae was designed for this trade. On her maiden voyage in 1869 she broke records for London to Melbourne, Newcastle (NSW) to Shanghai and Foochow to London. Ousted from the tea trade by steamers in 1879, Thermopylae was deployed as a wool clipper on the Australian trade. In both the Chinese tea trade and the Australian wool trade her chief rival was Cutty Sark. Thermopylae was one of only two composite (i.e. iron and hardwood) ships owned by Thompson. Thereafter his ships were mainly constructed of iron. They included Patriarch and Samuel Plimsoll. George Thompson had adopted the famous loadline recommendations long before they became mandatory in 1890. In 1881 Walter Hood's yard was sold, as the age of sail was coming to an end. From then on the Line built up an initial fleet of five steamers: Aberdeen, Australasian, Damascus, Thermopylae (2) and Nineveh. Initially they steamed out to Australia via Cape Town and returned via the Suez Canal, but from 1895 they came back via Cape Town. Thompson died in 1895. His safety track record as a shipowner had been exceptional, seldom losing a ship, and he never insured his ships against loss. Instead he invested the money he had saved in insurance premiums in the purchase of new ships and the maintenance of his existing ships. In this way he developed what has been called 'one of the greatest Lines in British merchant navy history'.  Family  In 1830 Thompson married Christiana Kidd, a daughter of James Kidd, an evangelical preacher. They had four sons and four daughters. One daughter married William Henderson, who would later succeed him as chairman of the Line and then serve as Lord Provost of Aberdeen, being knighted in 1893. In 1908 Thompson's granddaughter, Muriel Thompson, won the first ever Ladies' Race at Brooklands race track. During World War I she was an ambulance driver with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY). For her bravery under fire she received the Ordre de Leopold II, the Croix de Guerre and the Military Medal, and was also mentioned in despatches. His great grandchildren included Lord Devlin, who was the youngest High Court judge to be appointed in the 20th century and subsequently a Law Lord, and Alison Leggatt, a noted character actress.  Other interests  Thompson was a generous supporter of the Free Church of Scotland, and has been described as Aberdeen's most generous benefactor of his age. He supported an extension of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and bestowed money on the University of Aberdeen to provide bursaries in medicine. In later life he lived at Pitmedden House, his estate to the west of Aberdeen. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. He is buried with his wife and some of their children in the family plot in the United Free Church graveyard at Dyce.

It is endemic to caves along the Stanislaus River of California, United States. This, with a body size of only slightly more than 2 mm, minute harvestman lives only in caves. Its body is colored yellowish-orange, with white to yellowish white appendages. It appears in the same caves as Banksula grahami, which is slightly smaller and has no well-developed eyes. In fact, B. melones has the best eyes in the whole genus, except for B. incredula, which is the only species that does not inhabit caves. B. melones has been occasionally found near cave openings. When disturbed, they tend to remain motionless for up to several minutes. They can probably live for several years, which is quite long for a harvestman, with molts occurring only every several months. They have been shown to survive without food for up to 43 days (Rudolph, 1979). They prey on very small arthropods, preferring springtails over booklice. Conservation In the late 1970s, the caves of the region were threatened by the construction of the New Melones Dam. B. melones, B. grahami and about 30 other cave-dwelling species were therefore transplanted from McLean's Cave to an abandoned mine shaft, where the Banksula species reproduced well at first. However, ten years later, no B. grahami was found, while more than 50 individuals of B. melones were counted. Again ten years later, in 1996, only six individuals were left. However, the species was since found in a number of nearby caves. References * (1974).

It was directed by Sid Pink, written by Pink and Ib Melchior, and shot in Denmark with a budget of only US$75,000. Uranus, the seventh planet in the solar system, has not been charted by the United Nations' Space Fleet. Therefore, in 2001, an international crew has been dispatched to Uranus by the United Nations, which has become a world government, on a space exploration mission. The film's ideas of astronauts exploring outer space only to confront their inner mindscapes and memories precede the similar-themed 1972 film Solaris by a full decade (although the novel Solaris was published a year prior to this film). The film is also reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's 1948 short story \\"Mars Is Heaven!\\" that appeared in the 1950 book The Martian Chronicles. Plot In the year 2001, while an international five man team is on their way to Uranus, an alien presence briefly assumes control of the crew's minds. They awaken safely but notice that a long ‚Äì and unexplained ‚Äì period of time has passed. Upon landing, the crew finds a forested land oddly like Earth's, rather than the cold, bleak world they were expecting. This forest is surrounded by a mysterious barrier. One of the crew pushes his arm through the barrier, only to have it frozen. New features and forms begin to appear each time they are imagined by the crew. A familiar-looking village appears, complete with attractive women the various male crew members have known in the past. Soon, they must face a series of strange beasts including a giant bipedal cyclopean rodent and a lobster-like insect. The crew realizes that they have been the victims of mind control by a gigantic one-eyed brain living in a cave. There, they are confronted by the \\"Being\\", whose mysterious brain cuts to the inner thoughts of the explorers and causes their thoughts to appear as seemingly real. The brain-Being plans to possess the astronauts' bodies and have them take it with them back to Earth where it will implement a plan for global domination. The crew gradually come to realize their peril and start to fight back against the presence, even eliciting aid from the sympathetic women. They must then confront the Being in its lair while it assaults each with monsters spawned from their fears.

Stone purchased the 400 acre site of a former camp to establish an Orthodox Jewish summer camp. Programs Programs for campers include study of Jewish history, Torah study and prayer. Other programs include an introduction to farming, glass blowing and blacksmithing. Traditional camp activities like swimming, horseback riding, archery, Color War, drama, rock skipping, 9 Square, sports such as basketball, football, soccer, ultimate frisbee, and other activities are also offered, as well as a ropes course. The camp also features a reproduction of a German cattle car, like those used to transport Jews to Nazi concentration camps, and used for Holocaust education. According to previous camp director Yehuda Rothner, the lesson taught is that \\"senseless hatred leads into the abyss\\".Meyers, Dvora, Camp Lessons: Between color wars and singalongs, some Jewish camps include Holocaust education in Tisha B‚ÄôAv programming.

Vernal pool fairy shrimp are listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List, and has been listed as Federally Threatened species since 1994. Description Vernal pool fairy shrimp are usually translucent, however some have been observed to be white or orange. They feature stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and eleven pairs of legs. The fairy shrimp swim by moving their legs from front to back in a wave-like motion. They eat algae, bacteria, protozoa, rotifers, and detritus, and are eaten by birds and other animals, notably by the tadpoles of spadefoot toads. Vernal pool fairy shrimp have a lifetime of about two months. They usually hatch in early January, and die in early March. The female fairy shrimp lay drought-resistant eggs shortly before they die. The eggs sink to the bottom of the vernal pools, embedding into the soil when they dry. When the vernal pool refills the next winter, the eggs hatch, starting the process over. Habitat Vernal pool fairy shrimp have been found in vernal pools in southern Oregon, and parts of California. They can survive if the pool's temperature is between and . In Oregon, they have been discovered in the Agate Desert, around Agate Lake, and on the Upper and Lower Table Rocks. In California, fairy shrimp have been found in 32 locations in the Central Valley from Shasta County to Tulare County, and in the Coast Range from Solano County to San Benito County.

Finger is on the actual K‚ÄìPg boundary. The Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene (K‚ÄìPg) boundary, formerly known as the Cretaceous‚ÄìTertiary (K-T) boundary, is a geological signature, usually a thin band of rock. The K‚ÄìPg boundary marks the end of the Cretaceous Period, the last period of the Mesozoic Era, and marks the beginning of the Paleogene Period, the first period of the Cenozoic Era. Its age is usually estimated at around 66 Ma (million years ago), with radiometric dating yielding a more precise age of 66.043 ¬± 0.011 Ma. The K‚ÄìPg boundary is associated with the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, a mass extinction which destroyed a majority of the world's Mesozoic species, including all dinosaurs except for birds. Strong evidence exists that the extinction coincided with a large meteorite impact at the Chicxulub crater and the generally accepted scientific theory is that this impact triggered the extinction event. Possible causes=Alvarez impact hypothesis Cliffs at Stevns, Denmark; highest iridium occurrence in Alvarez analysis. The K‚ÄìPg boundary exposure in Trinidad Lake State Park, in the Raton Basin of Colorado, USA, shows an abrupt change from dark- to light-colored rock.White line added to mark the transition. In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the K‚ÄìPg boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30 times the average crustal content in Italy and 160 times at Stevns on the Danish island of Zealand). Iridium is extremely rare in the earth's crust because it is a siderophile element, and therefore most of it sank with iron into the earth's core during planetary differentiation. As iridium remains are abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the earth at the time of the K‚ÄìPg boundary. There were other earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, but no evidence had been uncovered at that time. The evidence for the Alvarez impact theory is supported by chondritic meteorites and asteroids which have an iridium concentration of ~455 parts per billion, much higher than ~0.3 parts per billion typical of the Earth's crust. Chromium isotopic anomalies found in Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary sediments are similar to those of an asteroid or a comet composed of carbonaceous chondrites. Shocked quartz granules and tektite glass spherules, indicative of an impact event, are also common in the K‚ÄìPg boundary, especially in deposits from around the Caribbean. All of these constituents are embedded in a layer of clay, which the Alvarez team interpreted as the debris spread all over the world by the impact. Using estimates of the total amount of iridium in the K‚ÄìPg layer, and assuming that the asteroid contained the normal percentage of iridium found in chondrites, the Alvarez team went on to calculate the size of the asteroid. The answer was about in diameter, about the size of Manhattan. Such a large impact would have had approximately the energy of 100 trillion tons of TNT, or about 2 million times greater than the most powerful thermonuclear bomb ever tested. One of the consequences of such an impact is a dust cloud which would block sunlight and inhibit photosynthesis for a few years. This would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). However, small creatures whose food chains were based on detritus might have still had a reasonable chance of survival. Vast amounts of sulfuric acid aerosols were ejected into the stratosphere as a result of the impact, leading to a 10‚Äì20% reduction in sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. It would have taken at least ten years for those aerosols to dissipate. Global firestorms may have resulted as incendiary fragments from the blast fell back to Earth. Analyses of fluid inclusions in ancient amber suggest that the oxygen content of the atmosphere was very high (30‚Äì35%) during the late Cretaceous. This high level would have supported intense combustion. The level of atmospheric plummeted in the early Paleogene Period. If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary greenhouse effect once the dust cloud settled, and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable survivors of the \\"long winter\\". The impact may also have produced acid rain, depending on what type of rock the asteroid struck. However, recent research suggests this effect was relatively minor. Chemical buffers would have limited the changes, and the survival of animals vulnerable to acid rain effects (such as frogs) indicates that this was not a major contributor to extinction. Impact theories can only explain very rapid extinctions, since the dust clouds and possible sulphuric aerosols would wash out of the atmosphere in a fairly short time‚Äîpossibly under ten years. Chicxulub Crater When it was originally proposed, one issue with the \\"Alvarez hypothesis\\" (as it came to be known) had been that no documented crater matched the event. This was not a lethal blow to the theory; while the crater resulting from the impact would have been larger than in diameter, Earth's geological processes hide or destroy craters over time. The Chicxulub crater (; ) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named.Penfield, Glen. Interview: The Dinosaurs: Death of the Dinosaur. 1992, WHYY. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìPg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth suddenly became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be over in diameter and in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about depth. It makes the feature the second of the largest confirmed impact structures on Earth, and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research. The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucat√°n during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects. The shape and location of the crater indicate further causes of devastation in addition to the dust cloud. The asteroid landed right on the coast and would have caused gigantic tsunamis, for which evidence has been found all around the coast of the Caribbean and eastern United States‚Äîmarine sand in locations which were then inland, and vegetation debris and terrestrial rocks in marine sediments dated to the time of the impact. The asteroid landed in a bed of anhydrite () or gypsum (CaSO4¬∑2(H2O)), which would have ejected large quantities of sulfur trioxide that combined with water to produce a sulfuric acid aerosol. This would have further reduced the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and then over several days, precipitated planet-wide as acid rain, killing vegetation, plankton and organisms which build shells from calcium carbonate (coccolithophorids and molluscs).Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Triggered Lethal Acid Rain, Livescience, March 09, 2014 Deccan Traps Before 2000, arguments that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 Ma and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created within 1 million years about 65.5 Ma, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event. The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere. In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. Multiple impact event Several other craters also appear to have been formed about the time of the K‚ÄìPg boundary. This suggests the possibility of nearly simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 cometary impact with Jupiter. Among these are the Boltysh crater, a diameter impact crater in Ukraine and the Silverpit crater, a diameter impact crater in the North Sea Any other craters that might have formed in the Tethys Ocean would have been obscured by erosion and tectonic events such as the relentless northward drift of Africa and India. A very large structure in the sea floor off the west coast of India was interpreted in 2006 as a crater by three researchers. The potential Shiva crater, in diameter, would substantially exceed Chicxulub in size and has been estimated to be about 66 mya, an age consistent with the K‚ÄìPg boundary. An impact at this site could have been the triggering event for the nearby Deccan Traps. However, this feature has not yet been accepted by the geologic community as an impact crater and may just be a sinkhole depression caused by salt withdrawal. Maastrichtian marine regression Clear evidence exists that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the Mesozoic era. In some Maastrichtian stage rock layers from various parts of the world, the later ones are terrestrial; earlier ones represent shorelines and the earliest represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with mountain building; therefore, the likeliest explanation is a regression, that is, a buildout of sediment, but not necessarily a drop in sea level. No direct evidence exists for the cause of the regression, but the explanation which is currently accepted as the most likely is that the mid- ocean ridges became less active and therefore sank under their own weight as sediment from uplifted orogenic belts filled in structural basins. A severe regression would have greatly reduced the continental shelf area, which is the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction. However, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore increasing global temperatures. Marine regression also resulted in the reduction in area of epeiric seas, such as the Western Interior Seaway of North America. The reduction of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered. Supernova hypothesis Another discredited cause for the K‚ÄìPg extinction event is cosmic radiation from a nearby supernova explosion. An iridium anomaly at the boundary is consistent with this hypothesis. However, analysis of the boundary layer sediments failed to find , a supernova byproduct which is the longest-lived plutonium isotope, with a half-life of 81 million years. Multiple causes It is possible that more than one of these hypotheses may be a partial solution to the mystery, and that more than one of these events may have occurred. Both the Deccan Traps and the Chicxulub impact may have been important contributors. For example, the most recent dating of the Deccan Traps supports the idea that rapid eruption rates in the Deccan Traps may have been triggered by large seismic waves radiated by the impact.

Stoke City, old First Division, 1979: soccerbase.com website. and Gifford took over, having been the appointed senior linesman.‚Ä† Thomas retired in 1984 and, as he left the List, Gifford was one of the new intake. Within two years, he was officiating in Europe, as he took charge of the friendly fixture between Northern Ireland and Denmark at Windsor Park, Belfast, on 23 March 1986, which ended 1-1.Northern Ireland v. Denmark , European international friendly match, 1986: srcf.ucam.org statistical website. Domestically, he was involved in a notable incident in a match at the City Ground on 3 March 1990, when Manchester City goalkeeper Andy Dibble had the ball in his right hand waiting to clear upfield. Nottingham Forest winger Gary Crosby headed it out of his grasp and kicked the ball into the goal.Gary Crosby's \\"header\\" , Man City v. Nottm Forest, 1990: Crosby's profile at the BurtonAlbion.com website. Gifford ruled that this was fair (correctly following guidelines for the Laws of that era), and it proved to be the only goal of the game.‚Ä° A few days later, he took charge of the most senior European tie of his career, as R.F.C. Li√©geois played Werder Bremen in a UEFA Cup quarter-final first leg.Li√©geois v. Werder Bremen, UEFA Cup quarter-final, 1990: EnglishFootballArchive.com website. Later in the year, he was involved in a European match where a streaker ran across the pitch, despite conditions of \\"intense cold\\". This was during the European Cup Winners Cup Second Round first leg tie between Fram Reykjav√≠k of Iceland and FC Barcelona on 23 October 1990, which the Catalan side won 2-1 with ten men, due to the dismissal of Fernando Mu√±oz in the 53rd minute.Fram v. Barcelona, Cup Winners' Cup, 1990-91: Linguasport.com website. He took charge of one of the decisive games of the 1991-92 season when Manchester United visited Anfield on 26 April 1992, needing to win to keep alive their hopes of winning the League title. However, Liverpool beat them 2-0,Liverpool v. Man United, old First Division, 1992: soccerbase.com website. and thereby confirmed Leeds United as the last of the \\"old\\" First Division champions. He was included as one of the referees for the new Premier League which started the following season (1992-93), his first match in the competition being the 2-1 win over Middlesbrough by Southampton at The Dell on 29 August 1992.First ever Premier League match, 1992: soccerbase.com website. He retained his position in the top league for the next three seasons before returning to the Football League. Whilst still officiating in the Premier League on 1 February 1995, he issued the fastest ever red card (at that time)Fastest red card at that time, Blackburn v.

July 26, 2007 The series stars 12 obscure superheroes from Marvel's earliest incarnation as Timely Comics from the 1940s period historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Publication history Writer J. Michael Straczynski said in July 2007 that the story concerns 12 superhumans randomly kidnapped by the Nazis during World War II to study their powers for the Nazis' \\"Master Race\\" efforts. The superhumans were put in cryonic suspended- animation until the present day, when a construction project in Berlin, Germany inadvertently uncovers them. The series explores the culture shock of people from the 1940s being revived in the present day. \\"I wanted to explore their reactions to us, and our reactions to them ... what was good about the World War II period that we lost, and what was not so good about it that we've eliminated in all but them\\". In early 2009, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada said the series was put \\"on hold\\" after issue No. 8 (Nov. 2008) because of Straczynski's increased demand as a screenwriter after the success of Changeling, and artist Weston's having taken on conceptual art and storyboarding on a separate film project.Quesada, Joe. \\"MyCup o' Joe Week 39: What's going on with The Twelve?\\", Marvel.com, January 13, 2009 The series remained on indefinite hiatus throughout 2009. In February 2010, Straczynski said that the series would be resuming later that year. In November of that year, with no further issues having appeared, Straczynski said Weston \\"has now caught up on the artwork\\", without specifying an issue or page-count, and that he intended to continue scripting.Renaud, Jeffrey. \\"JMS Speaks on 'Superman,' 'Wonder Woman', Comic Book Resources, November 12, 2010.

Plot synopsis As related by the Phantom Reporter: During the World War II Battle of Berlin in 1945, a dozen of the many superheroes and masked crimefighters of that era are ambushed by Nazis in the basement of an SS building, where the heroes are gassed and placed into cryogenic suspension for later experimentation, but the building is air bombed soon after and anyone aware of their situation is killed. In the present day, construction workers find this bunker, and the Twelve, as they become known, are revived. Put into the care of the U.S. military, they are housed together in a mansion where they receive counseling and support, are gradually made to understand that decades have passed, and are offered a role as heroes in the 21st century. The Twelve adjust in various ways: The Blue Blade becomes a celebrity; the Phantom Reporter starts a column for the Daily Bugle, Dynamic Man allies himself with the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies and throws himself into heroics; the Black Widow reconnects as the \\"instrument of vengeance\\" of an unknown party and begins going on missions; and Rockman bemoans being cut off from an underground kingdom that may or may not exist. On ballistics evidence, police arrest the Laughing Mask for a 1940s murder. In addition, the daughter of the creator of the robot Electro reclaims possession of the robot. In the framing story (set \\"much later\\"), the Phantom Reporter, gun in hand, stands over the body of the Blue Blade, regretting the man's death and vowing to find the killer. The Phantom Reporter is ultimately able to reveal the killer, in a classic mystery setup that involves rounding up the rest of the cast from their various pursuits and explaining the events step by step. The recent spate of unexplained crimes, including an attack on a gay bar Dynamic Man had visited, was carried out by Electro under the control of Dynamic Man, who is forced to admit he also is an artificial being. Blue Blade, after hooking himself up to Electro's control apparatus, discovered this, and so DM had Electro attack and kill him. Phantom Reporter has the Fiery Mask burn off DM's costume, revealing him to be a \\"man\\" who will never be anatomically correct. It is inferred that his creator's phobias about sexual purity were transferred to DM, thus explaining his discomfort with interracial marriages and the homophobia he has displayed throughout the series. He attacks the mansion, trying to trap and kill the others, but all manage to escape due to a sacrifice by Rockman. After fleeing to his creator's home and laboratory, he is confronted by Phantom Reporter along with Captain Wonder, Mastermind Excello, and Fiery Mask. DM kills Fiery Mask by crushing his larynx, but FM manages to pass his powers along to the Phantom Reporter. DM is destroyed by the Reporter, while Captain Wonder holds him in place, suffering horrible burns. Later, at a funeral for Fiery Mask, the others discuss their future plans. Mister E plans on retiring to spend time with his family, to make up for his previous rejection of his Jewish identity. Rockman is not found, though it's believed he escaped and may have finally found his lost underground world and family. The Witness leaves, to work with SHIELD to find those who deserve justice, with Nick Fury's blessing. He is seen confronting a \\"wanted\\" man in South America, at some later date. Phantom Reporter states he never saw The Witness again. Captain Wonder goes back into action, but with a gold half-mask covering his facial scars. Mastermind Excello has used his wealth to buy a private security company, renamed EXC Enterprises, and sets up Phantom Reporter and the Black Widow as operatives. Laughing Mask is given a deal (which views his cryogenic sleep as time served) for his previous crimes and now controls Electro, going after terrorists in sanctioned military strikes. Despite the history of loss, betrayal and punishment, the series ends on a note of hope for the survivors. In the closing scene, Phantom Reporter, in a new \\"combat suit\\" with a flame emblem, and Black Widow, back in her old \\"spider web\\" costume, are seen heading towards a new mission at an unknown location, having been sent there by Mastermind Excello's \\"EXC Corporation\\". Richard and Claire now seem, according to the phrase repeated over and over by Richard, to now be called \\"Fire\\" and \\"Shadow\\".

Geography The latitude of Fallsington is 40.187N. The longitude is -74.819W. It is in the Eastern Standard time zone. Elevation is . History Fallsington is an example of a crossroads community typical of the 18th century, on the Kings Highway (now U.S. Route 13). The Bucks County Courthouse, established in 1663, is said to have been located in Fallsington until it was moved to Bristol in 1705. The first meetings of the Religious Society of Friends were held in the home of William Biles on Biles Island. Falls Monthly Meeting found a site for the first brick meetinghouse built in Fallsington, about 1690, on 6 acres (0.024 km2) of land that had been donated by Samuel Burgess. Also in 1690, Thomas Janney donated 72 acres (0.29 km2) of land to be used as the Quaker burial grounds for Falls Monthly Meeting. William Penn donated a tract of 120 acres (0.49 km2), for a Falls commons. Fallsington evolved through a succession of periods in American history and architecture. Significant homes in Fallsington range from the late 17th century through the Victorian era of the mid-19th century. Fallsington was a center of commerce. A business directory of the 1860s listed blacksmiths, a butcher, carpenters, a carriage builder, a cooper, farmers, an insurance agent, machinists, physicians, a surveyor, and a wheelwright. The growth of Fallsington continued, with the construction of homes, an inn, public buildings, stores, and small craftsmen's shops. Until the construction of Fairless Hills and Levittown, it was the largest settlement in the Township, and functioned for many years as a commercial center. The Fallsington Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

This crayfish feeds on organic matter washed into the cave from the surface, and on bat guano.Cambarus aculabrum. National Biological Information Infrastructure. It is sometimes eaten by the banded sculpin (Cottus carolinae). Little else is known about its ecology.

It is an underground species known only from waters associated with the Floridan aquifer. Description The Dougherty Plain cave crayfish grows to a length of about with antennae twice this length. It is a colourless species with unpigmented eyes, segmented cephalothorax and abdomen, a pair of slender chelae (claws) with a row or two of tubercles and long slender appendages. The rostrum is long and unadorned with tubercles or spines. Distribution The Dougherty Plain cave crayfish is known from springs, wells and cave systems in the karst limestone region of Dougherty Plain in the Southeastern United States. It has been found in Dougherty County and Decatur County in Georgia and Jackson County and Washington County in Florida. It is likely also to be present in Mitchell County and Baker County, Georgia which lie between the two presently-known ranges. Biology Little is known of the biology of this crayfish. It is probably an opportunistic omnivorous scavenger and may feed on the Georgia blind salamander (Haideotriton wallacei) which shares the same range. It has a low metabolic rate, perhaps associated with the limited availability of food, and consequently it is possible that it may live for twenty years or more. Males with ripe gonads have been found between July and October but females bearing eggs have not been found and nor have juveniles or sub-adults. Status In 1996 this species was listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species but following the discovery that its range is wider than originally thought, it was in 2010 recategorised as being of \\"Least concern\\" on the grounds that it has a broad range and is common within that range. It seems to be able to live in water with low oxygen levels and may be widespread in the aquifer away from locations that open to the surface. Potential threats include removal of water from the aquifer for human use and contamination of the water by pesticides and excess nutrients from agricultural operations.

Jones is best known for designing three Carnegie libraries in Sonoma County, two of which are still remain standing and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Jones also has seven other buildings which he contributed to and nine of which are on the National Register. The overall importance and character of the Petaluma downtown can be partially attributed to Brainerd Jones' contribution. In Santa Rosa, Jones also designed many significant buildings including the Exchange Bank (now destroyed), the Saturday Afternoon Club, the Petaluma Women's Club building, the Lumsden House, and the Oates-Comstock House. The D Street area has a wealth of important old houses, many of which are attributed to Brainerd Jones, including the Byce House, used for the filming of Peggy Sue Got Married; the Reynaud House as well as four other brick homes. Jones is known for his use of native stone in his buildings. Other examples include: the 1917 Petaluma and Santa Rosa Electric Railway Depot (now the West County Museum) in Sebastopol, the 1922 addition to the C.C. Silk Mill in Petaluma, the 1911 remodel of the McNear Building in Petaluma and part of the McClay Building, the 1920 Petaluma Post Office (now a retail store), the Simon Pinschower House in Cloverdale, and the 1922 Petaluma Golf and Country Club Clubhouse.

APR-3E airborne light antisubmarine acoustic homing torpedo is designed to be carried by a various fixed wing and rotary wing platforms including Tu-142, Il-38, Ka-28 and other aircraft. The torpedo requires at least 100 metres depth of water for the initial air-drop and can be deployed in conditions up to sea state 6. Once entering water, the control surfaces of the torpedo enable the torpedo to travel in a spiral path with the help of gravity without starting the engine. During this stage, the acoustic seeker of the torpedo searches for targets. Once the target is identified, the engine starts and solid propellant rocket engine ensures the target has virtually very little or no time to react, thus increasing the kill probability. Newest version of this torpedo is the APR-3M, with modified characteristics. Trials of the APR-3M missile have been completed, the process of its serial production has been organized and its deliveries to the Ministry of Defence of Russia are underway as of May 2019.http://tass.com/defense/1057909 Users: Russia purchased a small number of APR-3 for its navy, while China was reported to be the first export customer when APR-3E was part of the Chinese Be-200 ASW aircraft purchase package.
